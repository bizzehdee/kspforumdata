I\u0027m not exactly sure what you mean with the color of the \u0022intersection points\u0022. The only thing I can think of that appears in interplanetary transfers and comes in those three colors are the conic patch sections of your trajectory. And the only reason they have different colors is so you can tell them apart more easily. Which color the final section has is not dependant on the quality of your transfer, but rather simply the number of SoI changes along the way. If you are used to escaping Kerbin\u0027s SoI first, and are now trying to fly a direct transfer from low Kerbin orbit, there will be one extra SoI transition along the way, and that changes the color of your trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntersecting the target SoI at a weird angle often happens simply due to using ballistic trajectories - a single, direct transfer burn usually performed nowhere near the ascending and descending nodes, because the alignment of planets very rarely ever does you the favor of coinciding with the ascending/descending nodes. This means you automatically come at the SoI from out of plane. But that weird angle also completely irrelevant. Even with a direct ballistic trajectory, you first plan a node that gets an encounter, then you perform the burn, and then you discover in more than 50% of the cases that your burn was not precise enough and your encounter now looks completely different anyway. Additionally, correcting the location and altitude of your periapsis can be done with a 1-2 m/s course correction somewhere along the way - close enough to give you precision, far away enough to still be dirt cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the very first part, that\u0027s also worded really strangely, but I\u0027ll try an educated guess here. Ultimately, the amount of dV you need to expend inside the target SoI is directly dependant on how similar your orbit is to the target. If you are coming in from a very similar orbit - like, if you first took the effort of leaving Kerbin\u0027s SoI, matching planes at AN/DN and positioning your apoapsis/periapsis very near the target orbit, like you would when performing a rendezvous in low Kerbin orbit, then it is indeed possible to slide into the target SoI with just a handful of m/s required to capture. But just because the capture burn costs almost nothing doesn\u0027t mean that the transfer was the most efficient. In fact, the method I\u0027ve just described is among the most inefficient of all interplanetary transfer variants. The majority of your dV expenditure will be performed in deep space, far away from all gravity wells, where all your burns will cost far more fuel (see: Oberth Effect). Additionally, it takes absolutely forever until you arrive at the target. Meanwhile, if you are flying a direct, ballistic Hohmann transfer (like you would from Kerbin to the Mun), both your departure burn and your capture burn are executed deep inside gravity wells, where they are the cheapest. The capture burn is much more expensive, because the transfer orbit is not as similar as the target orbit, but the Oberth Effect helps keep the fuel cost low - and additionally you spend much less in \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E burns, because those other burns don\u0027t even exist in this transfer type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s possible that I\u0027ve completely misunderstood anything you said, and not actually answered any of your questions. But in case I did, let me sum up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The color of your trajectory\u0027s conic patches is completely irrelevant\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Ballistic transfers almost always come in from out of plane; that is how they work. Finetune the location of your periapsis along the way, if you must. You can \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E get a perfect polar orbit, no matter your approach vector, but you may not be able to get a perfect equatorial orbit. If you need one, you\u0027ll have to work for it during your capture with some orbital mechanics tricks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0027t fall into the trap of trying to save a few dozen m/s at the capture burn by expending several hundred m/s more on a slow, inefficient transfer. The direct, ballistic Hohmann transfer orbit is the cheapest possible solution in all practical* cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I did not succeed to answer your questions, maybe try providing an actual example of what you\u0027re trying to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Bi-elliptic transfer orbits are slightly cheaper in some edge cases, but they take hundred times the travel time or more and are harder to plan.

Kerbin.\u00A0 If you try to launch at the next \u0022ideal\u0022 window, it\u0027s likely going to be when you\u0027re not at the AN/DN, so that means you\u0027ll need a pretty big, expensive plane-correction burn en route.\u00A0 On the other hand, if you don\u0027t bother waiting for the window, and you do your launch right when Kerbin is at the AN/DN with Moho, then that will put your Pe right on top of the opposite node.\u00A0 That means you can get a Moho encounter without having to do a plane correction at all, which is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebig\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E

one place where being in equatorial orbit doesn\u0027t matter much.\u00A0 There are no moons to worry about, and the planet rotates so slowly it might as well be sitting still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to bear in\u00A0 mind, if you use this technique:\u00A0 the less dV you can spend on that Ap-lowering burn, the better, since you\u0027re doing that without any benefit of Oberth effect.\u00A0 The ideal case is where you do not much of a burn there, and get your Moho encounter, and then can do your retro-burn at low Moho altitude so as to gain Oberth benefit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T00:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

approved methods of getting to Moho, both of which completely disregard any and all transfer windows calculated by whatever navigational aid you use. \u00A0The 1st method is a bi-elliptic transfer leaving Kerbin when it\u0027s in line with the AN or DN of Moho\u0027s orbit relative to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. \u00A0The 2nd method is to leave Kerbin at an Eve transfer window and do a retrograde flyby of Eve manipulated to drop you into approximately Moho\u0027s orbit. \u00A0Depending on planetary alignments, one might cost less dV than the other, but never will the difference be significant. \u00A0And ONLY by using one of these methods will the dV to reach Moho orbit be\u00A0anything resembling what\u0027s shown on the dV map. \u00A0If you treat Moho as any other planet and do a normal Hohmann or even ballistic trajectory, the dV cost will be WAY WAY more, especially on the capture burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as to the easy way to place the maneuver node at the proper ejection angle, use MechJeb. \u00A0Select your target planet (unless it\u0027s Moho, in which case go via Eve or bi-elliptic)., bring up \u0022Advanced Transfer to Another Planet\u0022 in MJ, tell it

With a target like Eeloo, your transfer window is as fuzzy as a kitten; you can miss your node by a week and still not pay a noticably higher dV cost. Moho, on the other hand, absolutely demands that you nail it \u003Cem\u003Eon time\u003C/em\u003E. Even the slightest deviation ramps up the cost; being off by one hour can be considered as having missed the window. Without mods, this is really hard to pull off, but it can be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you perform your ejection with the required precision, the ballistic Hohmann transfer to Moho works exactly as advertised by transfer planners. You don\u0027t pay anything extra, and you get there orders of magnitude faster than when using a bi-elliptic transfer. You don\u0027t need to wait for a three-planet alignment either, and the window repeats every 30-40 days. (That\u0027s not to say that bi-elliptic or Eve assist trajectories aren\u0027t valid choices as well - just that \u0022Hohmann doesn\u0027t work\u0022 is flat-out wrong.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the whole ejection angle thing: That\u0027s something that I\u0027ve always found incredibly irksome about transfer window calculating tools or websites. \u0022Here\u0027s your angle relative to prograde down to the decimal digit, now all you need to do is burn there!\u0022 That\u0027s about as helpful as saying \u0022Here\u0027s a maximum security safe with one million dollars inside it, now all you need to do is open it!\u0022. This immediately conjures the question: \u0022And how praytell would I possibly do such a thing? I have no tools!\u0022 Basically, most transfer calculators are borderline unusable for a pure stock game. They all want you to have access to a tool that lets you measure angles ingame.

And with \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, you can get by without tools, because this info lets you treat the ejection angle as a variable you don\u0027t need to know to create the maneuver node. All you need to do is set up the node anywhere in your orbit, and first add exactly the amount of normal dV required, then add prograde dV until the total node cost is equal to the total ejection dV. Then, now that the dV is already set, you click and drag the node around until you get an encounter. The position at which the node happens to be when you get this encounter is automatically at the correct ejection angle (because you won\u0027t get an encounter with the pre-set dV anywhere else).

You drag and move the node around until you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E hit the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that\u0027s the theory. \u00A0I used to (try to)\u00A0do things that way. \u00A0In practice, though, the stock interface, which was never designed for going further than Mun to begin with, makes it totally frustrating, very time-consuming, and at the bottom line, still rather inexact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna or Eve are about the limit of the precision of this method, because they\u0027re close enough that you have a fair chance of being able to see both the node and the target at the same time while still having reasonably fine control over the node\u0027s position. \u00A0Also, you\u00A0can tolerate a bit coarser control over the node. \u00A0But\u00A0even with them, often your control of the node\u0027s position when you can also see the effect at the target isn\u0027t fine enough to even hit the target, let alone get the Pe there you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly that\u0027s the case for going anywhere further afield. \u00A0The longer the trip, the more precision is required with the node\u0027s position, which means you have to zoom in very close to Kerbin to be able to move the node just a tiny bit. \u00A0Which means you can\u0027t see the effect at the far end at all. \u00A0So it\u0027s all a bunch of\u00A0\u00A0zooming the view in and out, and moving it from one end to the other, with the node constantly collapsing and sometimes being deleted for no apparent reason,,forcing you to start all over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if you get your trajectory kinda where you want it, quite often you really need to put the node between 2 of the discrete positions it can occupy around the orbit, so you still have to tweak the burn amounts, sometimes significantly, from what you got from the website. \u00A0The fine-r control via the mousewheel that we now have over nodes helped a bit with this, but in general at this point you\u0027ve got the map zoomed in on your target, the node is way back at Kerbin, and is usually at an angle that precludes tweaking the dV handle you want to manipulate anyway. \u00A0Or the node collapses and you can\u0027t reopen it without moving the view all the way back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is it possible? \u00A0Yes, vaguely, for relatively short trips. \u00A0Will you get exactly what the website says? \u00A0No. \u00A0Is it an attractive method\u00A0when compared to\u00A0various mod alternatives? \u00A0No. \u00A0Does doing it this way demonstrate a better understanding of orbital mechanics? \u00A0No, because the interface is so clunky that even if you have a PhD in it, you\u0027ll still get frustrated and have great difficulty getting close to what you want. \u00A0Is it worth doing anyway? \u00A0That\u0027s personal taste, but I worry a bit about those who find this an\u00A0attractive option\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that anybody who doesn\u0027t understand orbital mechanics would benefit from reading one of the various excellent tutorials explaining how to do things this way. \u00A0But I don\u0027t recommend actually using this method, at least for any trip further \u00A0than Duna or Eve, because of the frustrations of the clunky interface. \u00A0Maybe do it once you\u0027ve already become addicted to the game, but doing things this way from the get-go might turn off pre-addicted new players \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0. \u00A0I hope that 1.1 does something about the interface here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T15:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269507\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0022\u003E@Geschosskopf\u003C/a\u003E, the map view is nice but very hard to manipulate.
