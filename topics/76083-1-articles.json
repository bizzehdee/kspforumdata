I am a lot older now and have been so enthralled by my music career it seemed not much else mattered. But now I find myself spending hours browsing sites and forums for interesting information. My knowledge is limited so please don\u0027t be too condescending in regards to my question. So, my question boils down to this. Are there any plans on re-visiting Venus? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it was done a few times a while back with limited technology. Surely though today we could protect against the amount of heat and pressure? Are there any plans in the works that I have missed about a mission to land another rover on the surface. I am captivated by the mystery of this planet (much like a women, \u0022from venus\u0022 statement) Not that the other planets don\u0027t enthuse me, I love the recent information into Europa, as well as the voyage to Pluto. But Venus is closer to home, yet its so undiscovered. It is the only planet we will ever be able to collect data from (in my lifetime at least), that has such a close proximity to a star. And because of its atmosphere that makes it way more interesting than Mercury.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see a rover take decent photos of the landscape, unfortunately the only one we have is of the floor. This brings me to another mini-question, when are they going to fire the people involved in taking photo\u0027s on rover missions hehe. I have browsed over numerous curiosity pictures there are a few good ones but most of them are absolute rubbish. There is no doubt of the resolution capability yet it spends most of its time taking \u0022selfies\u0022. I am not interested in seeing the Rover it is there for Mars not for its own self-absorbed persona. Ok I\u0027m joking a little bit, but it just feels there is so much more it could have done in the 2 earth years it was there.

NASA has many interesting papers on the topic of high-temperature semiconductors. I\u0027ve linked to this search result \u003Ca href=\u0022https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/search/index.cfm?Criteria=high-temperature%20electronics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://solarsystem.nasa.gov/search/index.cfm?Criteria=high-temperature%20electronics\u003C/a\u003E in another thread; well worth looking at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, silicon carbide (and to a lesser extent gallium nitride) transistors are under development for use on Venus and (probably later) high-temperature environments in industry on Earth. These should operate \u003Cem\u003Enominally\u003C/em\u003E at temperatures exceeding Venus ambient and can already run for periods of over a year. The idea isn\u0027t to shrink the technology until we can run a hugely complicated computer on the surface. Instead, a surface probe could be given just enough computing power to be mostly remote-controlled, with the bulk of the computations performed by a satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMetallurgy has also advanced a lot from those days. When you read older books on high-temperature alloys (I have one lying on my desk at work; can\u0027t quote anything in this post) you\u0027ll see that much of the knowledge from the early days of solar system exploration was a mixture of partially-understood experimental data and hypothesis. Today\u0027s alloys are absolutely amazing in comparison. As a cool example, have a look at a jet turbine. Nowadays, the blades are made from special single-crystal nickel steels. (Normal steel is actually a mixture of ferrites/austenites/carbides/martensites and has a microscopic grain. This has no grain at all and is single-allotrope--I think austenite.) Such a steel can be (and routinely is) heated to more than 95% of its melting point* and spun at thousands of RPM, all without appreciable creep. For comparison, normal metals tend to creep an awful lot at around 50% of the melting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobotic surface exploration of Venus is within our grasp. But in my opinion we should hold on just a little longer before we can really do it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I.e. about twice the absolute temperature on Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T18:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how much is left of that Venera probe now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T19:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder how much is left of that Venera probe now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why it should deteriorate.
