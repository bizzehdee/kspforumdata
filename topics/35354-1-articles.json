I\u0027m going to Duna next and have so far gone through 2 completely different concepts. I think I\u0027ll go with the 2nd, which involves my 1st-ever multi-part ship assembled in orbit, because I\u0027m tired of thinking about it now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever having done this before, I have no idea if it will work. I mean, the ship\u0027s all put together ready to go, but will it fall apart when I punch the throttles? Does it really have enough delta-V? I guess Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Phililey will just have to find out the hard way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is to take a MapSat for Ike and a lander. While the MapSat\u0027s doing it\u0027s thing, the lander will go down to Duna, using its parachutes, and return. If fuel permits, I\u0027ll then reload it and send it to Ike. I plan on leaving it in orbit when the expedition leaves, so another expedition can use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s an album showing the original idea I had and then the assembly of the multi-part ship. I\u0027ll be adding to is as the mission progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a//XjW5h\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

What\u0027s a good altitude for GENTLE aerobraking at Duna? This is my 1st time so I\u0027d prefer to take it cautiously. I\u0027d rather take the time to make several orbits aerobraking a little each time (the return window\u0027s a long way off, after all) than try to do it all at once. And I only want to save a reasonable, not a huge, amount of fuel. I THINK the ship\u0027s got enough delta-V not to need aerobraking at all, but I do need to practice it. Anyway, after all this is done, I want to orbit at about 50km, which I hear is the best place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What is the \u0022hard deck, do-not-go-lower-than\u0022 altitude for aerobraking on Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Should I launch the probe to Ike before or after I establish Duna orbit? It\u0027s got about 2500 delta-V and isn\u0027t coming home. I want to put it in about a 185km polar orbit at Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
