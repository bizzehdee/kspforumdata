The thrust an engine develops is the sum of two components: the momentum thrust (mass flow times exhaust velocity) and the pressure thrust (difference between the exhaust pressure and the ambient pressure times the area of the nozzle exit). The first term is constant for a given throttle setting. But the second term varies depending on where you are. At sea level, the pressure term is generally going to be \u003Cem\u003Enegative,\u003C/em\u003E because the exhaust is expanded to a lower pressure than ambient pressure. The result is less thrust at sea level, and a lower specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran the numbers for the LV-N engine, as it\u0027s modeled in the game. It\u0027s got a nozzle exit diameter of 80 centimeters, and given its nature we can safely assume it\u0027s designed to work at altitudes above 30 kilometers. That makes the pressure thrust at sea level just a hair over \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015350 kilonewtons. And remember that \u003Cem\u003Ein a vacuum\u003C/em\u003E the LV-N only develops 60 kilonewtons! That means it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E develop less than 10 kilonewtons at 100% throttle on the launchpad, and have a sea-level specific impulse of only 123 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For the geeks like me: If we assume the LV-N exhaust pressure is 0.0025 atm, indicating an operating altitude of 30 kilometers above Kerbin sea level, we get a pressure thrust in vacuum of 0.0025 atm times the area of the nozzle exit, or 0.126247 kN. So the momentum thrust is 60 kilonewtons minus that number, or 59.8738 kilonewtons. Solving F = dm Isp g\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00E2\u201A\u00AC with that value for F and the vacuum Isp of 800 seconds, we get a mass flow rate through the engine of 7.63178 kilograms per second. At sea level, the total thrust is the momentum thrust plus the difference between ambient pressure and the exhaust pressure times the area of the nozzle exit. The pressure thrust term at sea level, then, is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015350.8053 kilonewtons, making the total thrust at sea level 9.19475 kN. Solving F = dm Isp g\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00E2\u201A\u00AC again with that F and the mass flow rate we calculated before gives us a sea-level Isp of 122.855 seconds.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the thrust, though, you\u0027re absolutely right. The stock NERVA engine has a throat diameter of 20 centimeters (measured off the 3D model), which is \u003Cem\u003Efricking enormous.\u003C/em\u003E In order to have the exhaust flow reach the speed of sound at the nozzle throat, the mass flow rate out the nozzle needs to be a mind-boggling 639.075 kilograms per second (assuming NERVA-like chamber temperature and pressure of 2360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0K and 30 atm). That comes out to a thrust of 5,598.1 kilonewtons \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which is actually not unrealistic for a NERVA-type engine of those dimensions and specifications. It\u0027s just that that kind of thrust is completely bonkers for KSP. So the developers arbitrarily set the thrust very low for, as you said, reasons of gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(On a personal note, Scott, I have absolutely \u003Cem\u003Edevoured\u003C/em\u003E your Reusable Space Program series, and eagerly await future installments.

Hyperoglic fuels mean no ignition source and potentially unlimted engine restarts (with pressurized fuel), room temp storable (no boil off) but these fuels are IRL more expensive to make and handle then LOX, LH2 and RP1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines should have less thrust, lower T/W ratio, I think the best projected was with Project Timberwind and that was a T/W of 30, compared to LOX/LH2 engines doing up to 80 and LOX/RP1 as high as 130! Nerva was a horrible ~4!
