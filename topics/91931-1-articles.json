My standard light lifter for probes and things has four SRBs, and depending on the payload they\u0027re throttled at 100%/50% or 50%/25%. An ideal flight for those things sees me launch with the liquid engine throttled down to zero, going to 100% as the first SRB stage flames out and then easing back. By the time the second SRB stage flames out I\u0027m in to my gravity turn and going full throttle anyway.
