It\u0027s gotten to the point where we rent communications time to each other on communications satellites. This works fine and great so long as we aren\u0027t using omnidirectional antennas as you can imagine. For those that don\u0027t know there\u0027s no way to target or filter what the omnidirectional antennas will and won\u0027t connect to. So I had a creative yet somewhat lore friendly idea in mind: is it possible to create a mod that can set frequencies for antennas such that those antennas only connect to other antennas with matching frequency. A bare bones mod would simply add the functionality to omnidirectional atennas however for a larger mod you could add it to all antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Efriends and I are playing war games on a dark multiplayer server, need a way to limit what remote tech\u00A0omnidirectional antennas and dish antennas (when pointed at a planet) can connect to. Had the idea to implement this in the form of satellites can only communicate to satellites on the same\u00A0frequency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StormxWolf","CreatedById":166488,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-08T20:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is hard to do, could simple filtering be possible?
