Let\u0027s not forget that these lights are intended to convey a message, each set with its own purpose. Red underbelly and top strobes mean \u0022my engines are running; keep clear!\u0022 White strobes mean \u0022I\u0027m moving or about to move. Keep an eye out.\u0022 Red and green strobes on the wings (and tail, if it\u0027s large enough) indicate port (left) and starboard (right) wingtips, respectively.

Also, lights out of sync on a helo can be extremely distracting for the pilot, since all the lights are relatively close to him/her, and ground glare can become an issue if the bird is flashing like the paparazzi on movie release night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, I\u0027m cool with them being synced in the game. It really gives the ships a more majestic and realistic feel, especially for the big ones that are assembled crewless on-orbit. Once the crew shows up and starts prepping for departure, it\u0027s neat to be able to start kicking on the various lights and see it come to life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIPEV104A \u0022Venture\u0022, preparing for standby orientation after receiving the Cardinal Research lab and vehicle bay.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cg2ci4j.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Cg2ci4j.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERear angle as the DV-104 \u0022Sherpa\u0022 dropship arrives to take its place in the vehicle bay\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YS7VFPc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YS7VFPc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill loving the HELL out of these lights, and I\u0027m pretty tickled about the amber light\u0027s inclusion in the new version too! \u0026lt;3\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T08:51:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Deadweasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T10:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigNose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigNose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bizz Keryear\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bizz Keryear\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIts really great.\u003Cp\u003EBut I am sorry to say it but it still has the \u0022pause\u0022 bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the lights are on and the game is paused then the lights \u0022forgets\u0022 it last state and are simply turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s known for quite some time now, but I\u0027m still not sure why this happens.
