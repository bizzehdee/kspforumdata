Hmm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, maybe it\u0027s not a bug, but I think it\u0027s unwanted behavior. The speed at which the surface adjusts into the selected deflection angle (or rather, the selected percentage of the selected deflection angle) is set based on the selected deflection angle. This creates a situation where you can\u0027t adjust the selection angle from a large number to a small number, or especially to zero, without making the control surface essentially stuck. I.e. if you set the deflection to 30 degrees and click \u0022deflect more\u0022 twice, then select 5 degrees, the surface will track towards the five-degree deflection at a glacial pace. Not sure how you would effectively fix that, but it\u0027s a thing I just found poking around the interface, so reporting. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
