However, it is possible for two planet packs to have planets that occupy the same space, in which case those particular packs will not be compatible with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using Kcalbeloh as a \u003Cem\u003Esecondary\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0system, it is quite far away, at a distance of 251 - 292 Tm away from the central star. No other planet pack that I know of occupies that range of distances, so anything should work fine with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using Kcalbeloh with the homeswitch, you can still add other planet packs as long as they don\u0027t also move the homeworld (i.e. GEP or OPM should work, but not Beyond Home). They will orbit Kerbol as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using Kcalbeloh as a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eprimary\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0system, where Kcalbeloh takes the position of Kerbol, planet packs such as OPM that expect the stock system will not work. Other packs may work as long as all the systems they add stay far enough away from Kcalbeloh to avoid overlapping SOIs.
