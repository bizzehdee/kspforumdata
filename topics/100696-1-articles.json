One would be a very lengthy crane from the docking port side, the other, a crane that turns this thing by 90 degree and lifts it off. Be creative, with that docking port on it you basically can rescue it.\n\nOh well, most simple solution, build a mini lander in the vab that fits on that docking port.

I\u0027m just pretty sure that I\u0027m not going to get the docking ports aligned right. How do I build a crane? any mechanics/robotics would be amazing. I was planing to use the rover pictured. Adjust it to fit on the launch pad, then get it up to the moon. Shove some extra RCS under neath so if I come up short I can try a little jump, and maybe some landing struts, in case I need to get higher too... but that seems a lot of effort, It is probably actually easier to redesign the base and fly it up there again..."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T13:07:53Z","Content":"If you\u0027re modding, a great way to go would be the Kerbal Attachment System mod. Get either a small crewed lander or a crewed rover within a few tens of metres from that vessel, get the kerbal to take the winch from his vessel and attach it to the other vessel, and you then have control of both.\n\nEDIT: KAS will also let a kerbal on EVA attach a command seat to the top of that vessel, which they can then use to control it."},{"CreatedByName":"MoridinUK","CreatedById":110633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T13:13:05Z","Content":"I have KAS, I just have no experience as to what it will let me do... so if I attached a fuel line or a winch I can command it?
