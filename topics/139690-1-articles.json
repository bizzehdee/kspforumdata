Nowhere else. I\u0027ll be moving parts around and the game will freeze. I\u0027ve left it on to see if it stops freezing but it doesn\u0027t and eventually it crashes. I don\u0027t think memory is the problem. I have 8 GB of RAM and a hex core processor. I don\u0027t have problems in any other games or earlier before the problem started. Here\u0027s a pastebin with one of my crash reports: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/nLURpTmn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/nLURpTmn\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
