I already previewed this on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread/page8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWIP thread\u003C/a\u003E, so as promised, here is the revised version of this soviet monstrosity of a launcher. Accurate almost to the last detail! And even though it\u0027s significantly above the limit I usually set myself, it\u0027s not really such monster and \u0022only\u0022 has 400 parts on the pad. 400 parts \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E. For reasons. Also consider you drop \u0026gt;150 parts once you drop the first stage, if you have a potato computer.

Then the third stage is powered by four radial engines, which stand up for the NK-21s, and that leaves the Blok G upper stage in an almost-orbital trajectory with it\u0027s single Poodle as a NK-19 equivalent. Time to ditch the fairings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/6ocE2xp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ocE2xp.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ocE2xp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what goes on under that fairing, supported by the Blok G upper stage which looks completely wrong (much too short!), but it gets you into circular orbit and then into TMI, with a healthy margin to leave it on an impact trajectory before jettisoning it (it\u0027s pretty much the only inaccurate part, that and the Soyuz engines). Then with RCS you maneuver the rest of the stack out of the impact trajectory into a suitably close periapsis: the Soyuz-K3, the LK lander, and the Blok D braking stage. I know, this particular version of Soyuz isn\u0027t supposed to have solar panels, but batteries wouldn\u0027t give me that skirt that the real one had. Some work could be done there, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per the original flight plan, the Blok D breaks the whole stack into lunar obit, and then a brave kerbonaut EVAs from the two-man special Soyuz version into the LK lander and detaches to perform the deorbit braking burn with the last of the Blok D\u0027s fuel, to touch down using just a bit of the fuel on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/nJLez7Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nJLez7Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nJLez7Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the \u003Cem\u003Etight\u003C/em\u003E part of the mission. If you mess up the landing and do anything other than a very, very good suicide burn with the lander after you ditch the Blok D to blow up in the surface (ending at a few hundred meters altitude tops when you kill your lateral velocity), and perhaps save a bit of fuel by touching down at 10-20m/s (the legs will hold! just keep yourself pointed upwards with as little lateral velocity as you can), then you won\u0027t have enough fuel to get back to orbit. And even then you might have to finish the orbital burn with RCS, but don\u0027t worry since the mere 15 units of monopropellant you have give you upwards of 100m/s delta-v (make sure you save it for this moment!). Check the action groups to find out how to lift off at the same time you ditch the landing gear, as in the real thing, and returning to Kerbin in the Soyuz is pretty much dirt simple, you have a healthy margin built in and loads of excess monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and that\u0027s pretty much it, all you need to know to put one guy up there on the Mun and show those apollo replicas out there, how [russian accent]\u0022Soviet style being superiorly efficient\u0022[/russian accent].

The more I play, the more try to minimize part count (mostly because playing becomes much more enjoyable). Its a lot of different tricks, really, but if I had to mention a few of the key ones, well, the first thing I have to disclose is that I build with the help of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/editor-extensions/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEditor Extensions\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s awesome, and it unlocks a lot of building aids (commands and such like activating/deactivating surface attachment and up to x50 symmetry), and they mostly mean that my design have no cubic orthogonal struts to create attachment points. That saves some headaches and parts, and still the file is usable by anyone whether they use the mod or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut more importantly, I try to keep my designs simple. Why use a cluster of tanks if I can make do with just one? Ideally, I would only have a tank per stage. I also try not to use structural parts at all, and build my ship body with the fuel tanks, and even then, I try to put a single tank per engine, with perhaps another tank to fix the aesthetics (the first stage ). I also watch out to make the payloads as simple as I can make them: A 150part 25mT Apollo-like lander can look very cool, but it\u0027ll need such a complicated and big shroud, and such a big base, that it\u0027ll have a cascading effect on weight and part count throughout the rocket. Can\u0027t you make another one almost as cool, but with 25 parts and that fits inside a 2m radius?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds way more simple than it sounds, of course, and it\u0027s an open-ended effort: the more you do it, the better you become at it, and the more you think you can improve. You may never get to say \u0022I can\u0027t do better\u0022, but you will get better all the time... and your framerate will be happier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
