The problem is that where the two halves were docked together, even with the Clamp-O-Tron Sr., under too much thrust I was afraid the wobble would break the ship apart. I had to baby it all the way to Jool on less than 50% thrust, and that was with nuclear engines. Without that mod that lets Kerbals EVA and add struts, I don\u0027t know how to make the docking connection more stable. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
