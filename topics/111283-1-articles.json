(fte rlall I not only play KSP but other games as well and since this related to one oof those other games, well This is more along the lines of the game engine and not KSP itself..\n\nNow i play in another game call ed \u0022Entropia Universe\u0027 and i have looked at the game engine it uses and to be honest, I find that the Unity system is a lot better and in fact would be intretnig to see if someoen could design a planetary system that could be used to acutally traveers around the star system map I have..(and yes in ourother game ther are \u0022Warp points or Jump Oints\u0022 that allow you to travel between systems..\n\nBut it got me to wondering .. Could a system like[this star sytem](http://www.entropiadirectory.com/wiki/solar_system/) be created in say Unity.?\n\n(My guess is that it more than likely would be considering that I\u0027ve seen the thign syo can do both n unity and the Space 4 UNity modules\n\nBut any thoughts on this?\n\nSpace\\_Coyote"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:51:36Z","Content":"Of course it can be made, Unity3D is simply a game engine, not specifically for space games.

Kerbal Space Program has a pretty nice system that works well for a single player game, but things get much more complicated the moment you try to make it multiplayer and updated at a rate high enough for say a first person shooter game(currently one of the technical issues I am dealing with in the game Stars End)."},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T00:57:02Z","Content":"I could make it, but it depends.

Other thatn that that\u0027s aobut it (Oh and there would be 3 things around planet 4, which is a large asteroid that oculd be flown into and you could park inside the asteroid, (yes an docking bay so youcould enter or leave..\n\nAs for Asteroids/ Yes there woul dbe a myrraid of Asteroid s that ould exist but they would nto be as big as one that has a small city and a night club on it..\n\nOther than taht, fele free to get back to me wto see what would be needed from my end, I mean Mps, or anyting else..\n\nSo I hop ethat helps\n\nSpace\\_Coyote"}]}
