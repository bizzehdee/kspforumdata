(fte rlall I not only play KSP but other games as well and since this related to one oof those other games, well This is more along the lines of the game engine and not KSP itself..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i play in another game call ed \u0022Entropia Universe\u0027 and i have looked at the game engine it uses and to be honest, I find that the Unity system is a lot better and in fact would be intretnig to see if someoen could design a planetary system that could be used to acutally traveers around the star system map I have..(and yes in ourother game ther are \u0022Warp points or Jump Oints\u0022 that allow you to travel between systems..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it got me to wondering ..

Other thatn that that\u0027s aobut it (Oh and there would be 3 things around planet 4, which is a large asteroid that oculd be flown into and you could park inside the asteroid, (yes an docking bay so youcould enter or leave..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Asteroids/ Yes there woul dbe a myrraid of Asteroid s that ould exist but they would nto be as big as one that has a small city and a night club on it..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than taht, fele free to get back to me wto see what would be needed from my end, I mean Mps, or anyting else..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I hop ethat helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace_Coyote\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
