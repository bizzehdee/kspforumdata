Install Kerbal Alarm Clock if you haven\u0027t already.  \n\nOnce it is installed the process is:  \n\nCreate a KAC alarm for your vessel at the appropriate time/soi change/whatever parameters you require the alarm to trigger using KAC mod screens.  \n\nOnce you have a KAC alarm created bring up the DeepFreeze menu.  \n\nClick \u0022Alarms\u0022  \n\nModify the alarm and select the buttons for what you want to happen when the KAC alarm is triggers. EG: Thaw Jeb, etc.  \n\nSave the alarm settings in DeepFreeze.  \n\nAll this has to be done whilst you have a RemoteTech connection. But you do not need a RemoteTech connection when the Alarm triggers. The DeepFreezer will automatically execute your Thaw/Freeze commands when the KAC alarm is triggered.  \n\nRefer to the KSPedia pages for DeepFreeze in the game  \n\n- the Alarms button can be seen on the \u0022VesselMenu\u0022 page in KSPedia (bottom right corner of the screenshot).  \n\n- the KACMenu page gives an overview of the setting the alarm settings menu.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-28T22:58:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2016 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T23:28:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, JPLRepo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmmm... that is interesting.

I\u0027ll investigate. I\u0027ve never had any issues before and testing has never shown any problems.  \n\nand your final request, action groups for freeze/thaw - that\u0027s not really going to be possible. Simply because the freeze/thaw events are tied to actual kerbals frozen in the part. So you can\u0027t just have a generic freeze or thaw, as it needs to have a kerbal linked to the event. Maybe, just maybe, I could look at something using the existing emergency thaw processing code that I have already written that automatically thaws ALL frozen kerbals on-board. But I can\u0027t promise when I will get to that.

If you manage to break it again PM me the log. As for the TAC LS msgs. That msg used to get issued once when you thawed a kerbal in DF. Which was issued when TAC suddenly discovered them again.

DF seems to only recognize alarms that are \u0022attached\u0022 to the Freezer.\n\nHere we have 3 alarms. (The easiest way to see which alarms DF recognizes is to click the little rocket icon next to alarm list.)\n\n- An automatically created alarm from Kerbal Construction Time for a building completion. DF ignores this.\n- An SOI Change for the ship the Freezer is a part of. DF recognizes this. (This was automatically created by KAC.)\n- A transfer window alarm created by TriggerAU\u0027s Transfer Window Planner mod. DF ignores this.\n- Not pictured: Crew Alarms cause DF\u0027s alarm panel to **immediately** break and throw NRE\u0027s (see below). Deleting the alarm fixes the issue.
