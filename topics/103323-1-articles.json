Proper shell usage makes most things easier and/or faster once you get the hang of it. On second thought, this should have been listed last, as there\u0027s no real reason to get down and dirty with this until you\u0027ve got a decent installation up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A common question seen around the web is someone asking \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhich distro\u003C/strong\u003E they should go with. My advice: Try one, and see if it works for you. There is a myriad to choose from, most of them geared towards different uses. If you\u0027re new to the linux area, I recommend going for one with a fairly large user-base, as it makes it easier to find someone who\u0027s found a sollution for whatever issue you might stumble across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EHarddrives and partitioning\u003C/strong\u003E will most likely be very unfamiliar to you at first glance. But depending on how you are with this topic already, you might be OK. For an install I recommend having a dedicated linux harddrive. Not that it matters in the long run, but it does eliminate the need to resize an existing windows/NTFS partition. Basically, it goes like this: Linux supports many filesystems. Most of them default to ext3, reiserfs, UFS or ext4. NTFS is usually supported, but for reasons beyond the scope of this post, you probably don\u0027t want to install linux on an NTFS partition. What this means is that your linux install can read your windows install, but not the other way around. Don\u0027t let this paragraph scare you, tho. Most installers simplify this A LOT, alloming fairly painless repartitioning depending on your need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EDrivers\u003C/strong\u003E CAN be a pain in the retrograde. But don\u0027t let this be a turnoff before doing some basic research. When I installed a linux distro a few years ago just to check how it worked as a desktop OS, I was suprised to see how far linux in general has come since last time I checked (which was around 2001) this means two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Hardware vendors (or some of them, at least) are now taking linux seriously, and release drivers for the linux platform (NVIDIA does this, for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Common hardware made by hardware vendors who aren\u0027t as nice often have a driver made for them by a third party\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the most common sources of grief here are gfx adapters and wifi cards. Google whatever you have and check its linux compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Live distros can help you gauge how well you like linux before actually going for a full install. On top of this, many install images actually boots a fully functional OS and lets you check it out before running the installer as if it was a regular program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESoftware\u003C/strong\u003E - Most windows software has a linux-native equivalent, unless said software is also released for linux. Some might even resemble the windows original. For those of us who traded MP3s via e-mail before the days of Napster and the like, winamp would\u0027ve been the tool of choice. For linux you have xmms, which looks exactly the same and....

It just works. Also, I believe Mint is geared towards ease of use for desktop users. The only issue I had was that I had to select a different NVIDIA driver than the one Linux Mint chose for me, and that took around 30 seconds. Personally, Arch Linux is my favourite nowadays, but I wouldn\u0027t use it as a desktop OS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T23:58:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T00:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dual boot Ubuntu, it\u0027s easy enough to do, you will have to partition your hard drive, but Linux provides a tool to do just that during install.
