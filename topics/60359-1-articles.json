They also operate at 90% efficiency. The 90% efficiency means that you can effectively multiple the time left for oxygen and water by 10x.\u003Cp\u003EThe math behind that is: I forget what the sequence is called, but you start with: x^0 \u002B x^1 \u002B x^2 \u002B x^3 \u002B x^4 \u002B ... which is equivalent to 1/(1-x). Then substitute the efficiency, 90% or 0.9, for x. So 1/(1-0.9) = 1/0.1 = 10.
