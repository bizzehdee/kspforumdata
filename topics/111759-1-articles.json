I like the idea of putting satellites in geosynchronous orbit for communications, I like the idea of line-of-sight for satellites... it all sounds good, but I can\u0027t convince myself it won\u0027t just evolve into tediousness.\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess my question to anybody is did you like Remotetech? Did you uninstall it for any reason? Do any of you find it essential? I\u0027m just asking because I have a lot of time invested in my career save and restarting is a big undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny opinions would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Current Modlist = \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i2xcXlR.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/i2xcXlR.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried Molniya orbits?
