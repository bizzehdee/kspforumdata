On the other hand if you\u0027re playing Realism Overhaul, you\u0027ll get the Deep Space Network from the beginning, meaning that initial setup is reasonably short, and usually having some probes in low earth orbit is enough. Nevertheless, in Realism Overhaul most probes will use RCS instead of reaction wheels, and the Remote Tech flight computer is using a lot of RCS fuel to keep the probe stable... A workaround is to use MechJeb, but opposed to the Remote Tech flight computer, MechJeb will only work while a radio connection exists...\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:29:42Z","Content":"They don\u0027t even need to be geosynch. ;-) I loved RT, it was fun to experiment with and plan for.

Sattelites can take decades to fall out of sync so it doesn\u0027t require a lot of upkeep once they are in place, but you do have to get their orbital periods correct.

Small changes to the orbit to gain or lose time to the neighboring satellite (unless you are just way off).\n\n2. Don\u0027t use too big of an engine. If you have too much thrust, it makes it hard to fine tune without overshooting. Ant engines with a few batteries and 4-5 Oscar B\u0027s make a good satellite. 48-7S are good too but a little strong.\n\n3. Use thrust limiter to fine tune further. Drop the thrust as low as you can for the final adjustment. hbkmog suggests RCS as a low thrust option too, but of course that would require more parts and fuel unless you built an all-RCS satellite.\n\n4. The higher, the better, to a point. You want to get your network as high as you can with the antennas you want to use. This will leave more of a gap between your line of sight and the planet. [Use this tool to plan](http://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/).\n\n5. Avoid asymmetrical satellites. I say this because at the small size these will be, it really throws mass off. My first sats you see below have only one DTS antenna and that made it really hard to control. Even if you never activate it, go ahead and spend the cash and add a second one to the other side.

I consider it a must have when playing. As for it being tedious, I can see that, but in the past I haven\u0027t had much problems with it. I usually launched 3 comm sats at a time, put the launch craft in an orbit with 4 hour orbital period, and released comm sats each time the launcher came to geosync AP, switched to the released sat, and circularized. Now in 1.0.2 it is a little bit tougher without the communtron 32, but can still be done as long as you have enough of the first dish you get on each sat, on to point at the sat in front, one to point at the sat behind, and at least one other for active vessel. \n\nAs others have said, use the sat contracts to help spam comm sats, or put probe cores, ants/dishes and solar on stages that will be left in kerbin orbit during other missions and it shouldn\u0027t be a problem. \n\nI need to replace my geosync network with 3 new sats, now that I have the 32 ant. Although I could use KAS/KIS to go up and switch antennas i guess, but might just be easier to launch a new network lol.\n\nOh as for deep space, You could do a comm relay. Right now I\u0027ve got one in orbit between the Mun and Minmus, with docking ports on it so as I need I can add more/longer range dishes to it.\n\nAlso, if you use kOS or....\u0022meh\u0022 jeb... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) it makes it easier to get things in position, and helps with the \u0022boring\u0022 repetitive launches. At one time I made a kOS program that launched 3 sats on one launcher, got AP to geosync altitude, then made the orbital period 4 hours, and it would release a sat each time it came around to AP. Of course I had to manually switch to the released sat an circularize, but it still made it much easier.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T19:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T19:24:59Z","Content":"I agree that the techtree is not conducive to realistic satallite networks w/ RT.

I generally have 6 of them radially mounted on a planetary expedition ship that also serves as an interplanetary communications hub (IP-COMM) with a 2nd IP-COMM sat. \n\nGo to, for example, Duna.
