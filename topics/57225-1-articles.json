It also tends to make me realize that most of the internet personalities out there have amazingly annoying little verbal tics that, while no doubt tolerable in an environment where I\u0027m not particularly invested, become absolutely insufferable when set to their perpetual failure to grasp the fundamentals of orbital mechanics and rocket design.
