In the editor, the external lighting of the vessel is increased every time my mod\u0027s\u00A0dialog window is redrawn, e.g. when a button is clicked in it. As a result, after some clicking, the vessel is almost pure white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t do anything at all related to the scene lighting, don\u0027t change the craft or affect any other aspects that I could expect to have this effect.\u00A0My code is long, but effectively, it\u0027s just calls to KSP.UI.Screen methods to create, change and destroy UI elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone seen anything like that? Any ideas what can cause such behavior?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
