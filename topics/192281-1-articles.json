So, I\u2019ve been playing KSP since I was like, idk, in 0.23 I think. I played it for years... then put it down in 1.4.4. When I got back, everything changed. 1.6 was out, KSS was cancelled, etc. I was out of the loop. So I got back into the game... until 1.8 when my computer broke. And now... a lot of stuff happened. Negative got more team members, KSP2 was announced. 1.9 was out. And that\u2019s fine. But... KSP2 worries me. Again, I saw lil KSP grow up, giving parts nicknames, adding asteroids, part variation, DLC, and then KSP2 steals the spotlight. And then Squad is obviously like other games, forget that the first video game I ever played exsisted. It\u2019s... sad. So, sorry, but the hype train left me at the last stop. KSP2 seems amazing! But I just can\u2019t bear it. Y\u2019all are gonna have to be patient with this fellow forum member. Thanks for reading this long drawn out post.

Most fans of the Mario \u0026amp; Luigi franchise also greatly prefer the original 2003 Superstar Saga and 2009 Bowser\u0027s Inside Story over their 2017 and 2019 remakes, to the point AlphaDream went downright bankrupt after releasing the 2019 remake because none of the old-school fans of the 2009 original wanted to play the remake. There are also several fans of Need for Speed that greatly prefer playing the old 1994-2006 installments over the more recent games, to the point the old games still retain an active modding scene to this day... really, I could go on and on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, if anything, I really wouldn\u0027t be surprised if KSP2 actually \u003Cem\u003Eflops\u003C/em\u003E and gets terminated early on due to the majority of the fanbase preferring the original game over the second.
