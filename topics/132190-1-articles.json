One second of burn time could cost you an entire mission. I\u0027m sure everyone who\u0027s played KSP for a reasonable amount of time has had one of these moments. What is your most epic disaster averted moment?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s mine: My fifth career munar landing mission was going fine. My lander, laden with fuel, had a TWR of about 3 on the Mun, had just dropped off the transfer stage. The descent burn, however, began way too low, at around 10km. In a panic, I ditched the drop tanks, and tried to save the craft. The craft, with only the central tank on, didn\u0027t have very much DeltaV remaining. There was only one way to save Jeb from dying (TAC-LS), as he only had enough life support for 3\u00A0days (probably should\u0027ve brought more, but I was totally unprepared for such a disaster). I had left an interplanetary cruiser, the Kraken, in low Munar orbit, sciencing away until the transfer window to Eve. Only a couple hundred meters off the surface, I tried to get the lander into an orbit around the same inclination as the Kraken. Much of the fuel was used up trying to get into orbit. The craft made it into orbit, though with a tiny amount of fuel left and on the opposite side of the Mun as the Kraken. I maneuvered the craft into a higher orbit, but it already had too little fuel (3 units of LF)\u00A0to get a proper intercept.\u00A0The intercept was 2 hours away, so the EVA\u00A0suit could sustain him Jeb\u00A0the intercept. I maneuverd Jeb into a 0.2km intercept. I shot by the Kraken at 50 m/s, but eventually I cancelled the relative velocity and flew Jeb onto the Kraken, with Val, Bill, and Bob onboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T21:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce my munar lander ran out of fuel, and I got Jeb out and just deirbuted from high Kerbin orbit.

After EVA\u0027s were added, I decided to do a crew transfer in orbit. First, I sent up my standard 3 man lander, and then I sent up a one man orbital interceptor, which notably featured RCS thrusters to aid in establishing an orbital rendezvous. It also featured a nose mounted parachute, and a stack decoupler to separate it from everything else so it could land safely, once on a landing trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see where this is going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI very promptly accidentally jettisoned the command pod from the interceptor.

Once I parked about 300m away, I flew the stranded Kerbal to the impromptu rescue ship.\u00A0One of the crucial features of the lander was a ladder running the entire length that was installed so that Kerbals could safely disembark on Kerbin.\u00A0My lander was also mercifully blessed with stable re-entry aerodynamics. It naturally flew backwards in atmosphere. See, while there was no re entry heat to kill the guy riding on the outside of my lander, Kerbals don\u0027t have enough grip to stay in place during usual reentry deceleration, so I had to constantly take control of the joyrider and move him back up the ladder before he fell off the bottom. That the ship also had drogue chutes was a blessing. I burned the engines at full power the entire way down, because I knew that if I opened the chutes at too high a speed, the kerbal would be flung off the ship. Drogue chutes were gentle enough to avoid this, and helped the LV-N engines slow me down enough to safely open the main chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, there was nothing more I could do. I turned SAS off, and took control of the outside Kerbal. It\u0027s the only time I\u0027ve ever landed a ship I wasn\u0027t controlling at the time. The ship landed in the water (which handily destroyed the engines before they could kill anyone), and everyone survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T08:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nOutrunning the explosion!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s3eK-_2qOp0/VPlNjpIvU0I/AAAAAAAABV0/W3EsWG6Uk7o/s800-Ic42/screenshot314.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot314.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was sending some mess of claw-contraptions out to an asteroid and was done with the next-to-last stage, so I pushed spacebar to decouple... but then realized to my horror that I hadn\u0027t set throttle to zero first, and that there was still some fuel left in the disconnected tanks.

Once I had circularized at 110km, I deployed my lander (the \u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E) and its three-Kerbal crew to make a landing. The touchdown was a success, a flag was planted, and the team collected enough science to keep the scientists busy for months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://oi61.tinypic.com/2n8rabp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n8rabp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I looked at the fuel readout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E had less than 20% of its fuel left. Enough to lift off, but nowhere near enough to circularize even if I tapped into the monopropellant supply (most of which I\u0027d still need to return to the \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E). Fortunately, thanks to the magic of quicksaving and quickloading, I was able to determine that if I launched straight up, I\u0027d be able to get the lander to an apoapsis of 40km before burning out, followed by an eight-minute fall back to Eeloo. I then had the (unmanned) \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E lower its orbit to 40km, and waited until a fly-over was four minutes away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I quicksaved.

It burned out at 40km, exactly as planned, and then I switched to \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E and fine-tuned the encounter (by now about three minutes left) to get within 100m. I managed to do it, killed relative velocity, and immediately quicksaved. In hindsight that was a terrible mistake: there was no going back, one way or another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now both ships are tumbling toward Eeloo with less than four minutes to rendezvous, dock, and burn back into orbit. The \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E has no command pod, and therefore no way to store science if two Kerbals decided to make heroic sacrifices while the third escaped. And on top of all that, \u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E has a very limited supply of monopropellant remaining. So using tons of it to close those 100m nice and fast is not an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt actually turned out to be easier than I thought; I pulled it off on my second try.

While I was up in orbit, I decided to go back to the space center for something, then came back. This would be vital later on. So, I started the descent back through. I kept the nose up a fair bit to bleed of speed, but avoided making any drastic maneuvers at all.

Most of my missions in the Kerbin system these days are mining expeditions, and Minmus is a much better target. However, I like the scenery on Mun more, and sometimes I like to go back, for old times sake. So one day, back in .90 I think, I decided to take a trip to the Mun. I don\u0027t really have a dedicated lander for that anymore, so I decided to take my Kethane miner, a ship which is fairly heavy (that ship was probably around 35-40 tonnes), and was equipped with 3 LV-N engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that I hadn\u0027t landed on anything but Minmus in a while that didn\u0027t have an atmosphere, and I kind of forgot just how much stronger gravity is on the Mun. By the time I started burning retrograde, it was too late, though I didn\u0027t realize it at first. I started getting uneasy about the numbers I was seeing 30 seconds into the retrograde burn. By a minute, I was pretty sure everyone on that ship was about to die. I tried burning the RCS thrusters for a few seconds, but that didn\u0027t do much, and there was no way I could vent all the fuel (and lighten the ship) any meaningful amount before impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably 60\u00A0seconds into the burn, I switched from burning retrograde to normal. Missing the landing site wasn\u0027t going to matter if my lander impacted the surface at 100m/s. It was enough, and the lander started to pull up with a pant\u0027s soiling 300m to spare. To give you an idea of how bad it would have been if I hand\u0027t made the switch, it took another \u003Cem\u003E3 kilometers\u003C/em\u003E to kill off all my lateral velocity. Now, that was about a 60 degree burn angle from normal, but still. I figure if I had waited another 3-5 seconds before switching to a normal burn, no one on that flight would have survived (I might have been able to save at least one by going EVA I suppose).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWe need more lift Captain!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is the most recent of my near misses, from this very patch, in my latest Ore Miner. The Ore miner is a very similar design to the old Kethane miners, though a bit heavier. 4 LV-N engines now, but she weighs 60 tonnes on the launch pad, and in theory, 70 tonnes fully loaded with ore (minus ~2-3 tonnes in spent fuel from landing). My point being, even on Minmus, she doesn\u0027t exactly have an excess of thrust when taking off to bring ore up to the orbiting refinery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this leads into the first time I ever used this design on Minmus. I landed on an ore deposit in one of the Methane lakes, because tall top heavy ships on narrow landing gear don\u0027t like slopes. What I did not do was take a good look at the surrounding topography when it came to take off. When it was time to lift off and meet up with the refinery, I failed to take into account the 5km tall mountain that was not that far away, and directly in my flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did spot the problem with plenty of time to avoid it, but the world map projected that I would miss, so I stayed on course. That did not however do anything to prevent white knuckles while I went IVA and watched the radar altimeter quite closely. The lowest reading I saw was around 600m, so I guess I managed to select the perfect launch angle by chance in the end on that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the very ore miner that almost hit a mountain on Minmus. The landing gear was repaired once it was back in orbit (wasn\u0027t going to chance that on the ground):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/2cqb8ea.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222cqb8ea.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T20:31:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222413245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455650346\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002282292\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mitchz95\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Mitchz95 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was bringing home two Kerbals from Minmus but had greatly underestimated the delta-v requirements: I had enough to escape Minmus, but nowhere near enough to get inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and I only had about six days of life support left.
