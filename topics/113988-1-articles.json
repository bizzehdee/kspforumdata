It can cause serious damage to the immune system leading to a vulnerability to all sorts of infections, and can cause a form of anaemia in which all blood-cell types AND platelets are lost, leading to bleeding, infection, and severe exhaustion caused by loss of red blood cells. It can also cause a form of skin disease where the upper layers of skin detach from the lower layers, with the very real risk of severe skin damage, infection and death.\n\nI have, once or twice, been prescribed antibiotics which can cause similar side-effects: but this was to infections that were more dangerous than the antibiotic, and the docs made sure to check repeatedly that they weren\u0027t causing me harm.\n\nI would suggest that if you can possibly find a safer medicine to treat your headaches then do so, and if you can\u0027t, then it\u0027s better to suffer the headache: there\u0027s no sense killing yourself for a bit of comfort!"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T14:47:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In case of a sore throat accompanying the cold, we have some really low-impact, homepathic pills that you can pop hourly, and which work (I suspect) mostly by ensuring a lot of saliva flow or something.

It is a proven scam, a hoax, and suggesting anything else will and should yield the same response every time.
