Case in point: you do a Hohmann transfer to get to Moho, you can expect to spend somewhere in the 7,500 to 10,000 m/s of delta-V range getting there and back again. If you do a bi-elliptic transfer instead, you can pull it off for around 4,000 (i.e. what the delta-V map will tell you). It just takes a lot longer to do, obviously (it takes somewhere around 45-50 days to get to Moho with a Hohmann transfer, about 220 days just to get out to Jool\u0027s orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENao mentions that you can get a gravity slingshot off of Jool, so perhaps going there on your way towards Kerbol/Moho isn\u0027t that bad of a notion...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
