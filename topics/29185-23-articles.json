I have orbital engines (restartable many times), and upper stage and lower stage engines (with a \u0022\u002B\u0022 subvariant of each, which trades better vacuum for worse SL performance) as a way to class every engine, and tech level determines specific Isp and TWR within that class. Then Isp and thrust multipliers for switching to hypergolic or hydrolox (default = kerolox). I rebalanced the density so kerolox gets about the same total impulse per tank volume as stock LFO, and conveniently that means density = (real-life grams/cc) divided by 200. Which stacks up, more or less, with what volume units represent if you measure the cubic volume of a tank. I have the MATHS! to prove it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only bothered to add MMH, though it would be trivial to add Hydrazine, UDMH, and Aerozine.
