With two I can do it: antenna A is active, B is inactive, set A to lower in 60 seconds, and B to raise in 6060 seconds. For 6000 seconds the craft is not connected but it automatically raises with a delay allowing the connection to resume. This saves lots of power on long flights to hibernate the connection.\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that bringing several large antennas is impractical just to schedule the lowering and raising at the same time. You can\u0027t do that for a single since only the currently-available action is schedule able. If action groups could be added to RT2\u0027s repertoire that would workaround the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this idea.
