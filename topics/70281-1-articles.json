It has a black background for other mod parts and I thought \u0022Maybe because it\u0027s transparent\u0022. Then I picked the KSP retro flag which also has a transparent background but on the part it has a white background instead of black? I know that you can\u0027t have it fully transparent for other parts that just have a plane with the flag on it but how would I have it as a white background instead of black while keeping it transparent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(It\u0027s white only for the KSC/Mission flag and is transparent for stock parts)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
