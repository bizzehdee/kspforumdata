Also just animating the tracks will not make it move, for that you\u0027d need a wheel collider setup driven by the idler wheels.\u00A0 KF used a texture animator in conjunction with wheel colliders to give the impression that the track moved , the track mesh itself is static apart from moving with the suspension, it doesn\u0027t actually rotate.\u00A0 Another thing to be aware of is that there is no way to have two tracks driven on the same base, not without a plugin, you can separate the tracks to individual; units and place them on the bogie though and that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the animation issue , it looks to me as though you didn\u0027t centre and zero all your transforms before animating the part, although it very difficult to tell from the image what is actually wrong apart from a misplaced mesh, maybe a little video or gif would help to illustrate your issues more clearly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing, as it goes the tracks are one of the hardest parts to make and get working correctly I have ever made and they are certainly not a project I\u0027d recommend to somebody starting out or with little familiarity with unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it can be done\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003Eweapons testing yesterday, note whats being used to carry them\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C9bKBNK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C9bKBNK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T14:06:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChristopherJon","CreatedById":136135,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T15:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, upon further reading I am going to go with the texture animation.
