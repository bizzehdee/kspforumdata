Expect a lot of changes, since a lot of these contracts were merged into the stock progression system. Also crafting this release as a \u0022modular\u0022 pack, with different types of contracts placed into different config files, so if you don\u0027t want (for example) the repeatable contracts you can delete them easily without trying to parse the configs. It will also allow me to add updates easier in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pending update will have a dramatically scaled-back number of contracts (again, due to many being merged into stock) but will offer a new set of \u0022routine spaceflight\u0022 missions to keep your skills sharp, and give you an excuse to keep using your designs.
