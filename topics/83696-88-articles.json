I am hoping for AoA gauges, dynamic pressure, IAS, flap and spoiler control, mach number gauge, temperature gauge, and would absolutely love if the ascent graph page worked like ASET and had dynamic pressure graphed as well. Makes for a really nice readout and shows max Q nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T19:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHad a thought can you use your MFDs but have them display ASET pages?
