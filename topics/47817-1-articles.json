If your rocket consists of payload/booster, and the booster has no seperation events, it\u0027s an SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs are horribly inefficient - in my experience, you get about a 4% payload fraction on an SSTO booster design, as compared to about 15% for an asparagus booster; 46 tonnes is the practical payload limit for an easy SSTO design. They also take careful flying; you can\u0027t just leave the throttle up all the way the whole way up. Building them is far, far easier to do and you don\u0027t have to worry about staging events - those are about the only advantages to them. An SSTO doesn\u0027t have to be small, either - that 46 tonne payload rocket weighs about 1150 tonnes all told and needs nine Mainsails to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of y\u0027all want, I\u0027ll share my magic formulas for building an SSTO rocket design.
