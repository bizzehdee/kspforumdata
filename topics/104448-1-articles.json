It consists of three craft, each suited to a certain specialized task. \n\nThe Lance-1 is a light cargo SSTO capable of lifting a total of five tons to LKO. It is perfect for any light probel missions and comes with a communications satellite as well as a transfer stage capable of placing the satellite in orbit around any body between Eve and Duna. ![5jc6skq.png](http://i.imgur.com/5jc6skq.png) It handles well during all phases of its flight, though you might want to move some fuel to the front of the craft just to be sure. There are no action groups for this craft, and it really doesn\u0027t need any, seeing as the RAPIERS are set to auto-toggle.

It comes equipped with a full compliment of scientific instruments and can carry four crew. It\u0027s a bit more tricky to fly due to its tendency to pitch up in vacuum, caused by its slightly offset engines. This is easy to control as long as you keep the throttle fairly low. ![jf7BJjo.png](http://i.imgur.com/jf7BJjo.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It handles much the same as the Lance-1, but is slightly less manueverable. This is the only modded craft in the series, and it only uses the oh-so-useful [adjustable landing gears mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660-0-25-Adjustable-Landing-Gear-v1-0-4%28doors-fixed%29-Nov-14)\n\n![PFfwkkc.png](http://i.imgur.com/PFfwkkc.png) Link to craft [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jvwhq970100my72/Lance-3.craft?dl=0)\n\nAll craft operate in a similar way - try to get above 23km and 1600m/s before the RAPIERS toggle, then perform a pitch up manuever and ascend rapidly through the remainig atmosphere. If you do then you should be capable of reaching orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Benji13","CreatedById":162932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T07:32:17Z","Content":"Looks cool.
