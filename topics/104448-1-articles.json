It consists of three craft, each suited to a certain specialized task. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lance-1 is a light cargo SSTO capable of lifting a total of five tons to LKO. It is perfect for any light probel missions and comes with a communications satellite as well as a transfer stage capable of placing the satellite in orbit around any body between Eve and Duna. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5jc6skq.png\u0022 alt=\u00225jc6skq.png\u0022\u003E It handles well during all phases of its flight, though you might want to move some fuel to the front of the craft just to be sure. There are no action groups for this craft, and it really doesn\u0027t need any, seeing as the RAPIERS are set to auto-toggle.

It comes equipped with a full compliment of scientific instruments and can carry four crew. It\u0027s a bit more tricky to fly due to its tendency to pitch up in vacuum, caused by its slightly offset engines. This is easy to control as long as you keep the throttle fairly low. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jf7BJjo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jf7BJjo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xdB9X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
