Then like the clutz I am I hit spacebar instead of z and it activated all the chutes. Of course they didn\u0027t deploy in space, they\u0027re \u0022blue\u0022 now. But if I now reenter onto Kerbal they will get destroyed by the heat. I cannot load, I have that deactivated.\n\nI put a rescue mission into orbit, right next to them (spent my last science on getting working rescue vehicle parts), and even had an engineer (BILLY!) with me. Thought he maybe could repack the chutes or just deactivate them. But nope, can\u0027t do anything with the chutes.\n\nWouldn\u0027t be that big of a problem if I could just transfer the tourists over to the rescue vehicle, but they can\u0027t exit their craft of course.\n\nSo now I am stuck. What to do?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T16:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EngineerBill**"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T15:55:27Z","Content":"First, make sure no spacecraft enters a kerbal.

I will change the savegame... I reckon it\u0027s the \u0022persistentState = ACTIVE\u0022 which I have to change to \u0022persistentState = STOWED\u0022 for all the chutes :-) don\u0027t want to mess with the minimum deploy pressure since I don\u0027t know the craft (it\u0027s my first orbital ferry, don\u0027t know how it behaves on reentry)\n\nedit: I also apparently had to change the \u0022active = False\u0022 to \u0022active = True\u0022 under the \u0022Events {Deploy{\u0022 section\n\nedit2: none of the savegame edits worked ... I tried putting the chutes into their own control group (didn\u0027t save), edited the quicksave and persistent.sfs at the same time, none of those worked... I have given up now on editing the savegame.\n\nWill try the min air pressure... sigh, let\u0027s hope for the best for the poor kerbals\n\nhad it set to 0.4 and it opened right at 5500m\n\nthanks again\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T17:10:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EngineerBill**"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
