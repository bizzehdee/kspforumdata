Then like the clutz I am I hit spacebar instead of z and it activated all the chutes. Of course they didn\u0027t deploy in space, they\u0027re \u0022blue\u0022 now. But if I now reenter onto Kerbal they will get destroyed by the heat. I cannot load, I have that deactivated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a rescue mission into orbit, right next to them (spent my last science on getting working rescue vehicle parts), and even had an engineer (BILLY!) with me. Thought he maybe could repack the chutes or just deactivate them. But nope, can\u0027t do anything with the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t be that big of a problem if I could just transfer the tourists over to the rescue vehicle, but they can\u0027t exit their craft of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I am stuck.
