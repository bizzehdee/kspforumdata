Hated docking. Tried to dock, and failed miserably. Tried again, failed even worse. However, I slowly, painfully learned the secrets that not only make docking possible, but actually fairly easy once you\u0027ve done it a few times. Here I share these secrets with you, the person who wants to learn how to dock without needing PTSD treatment afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will break \u0022docking\u0022 in two parts: rendezvous and the final docking sequence.

I already have a space station in an 80km orbit to dock with. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll need to launch two docking craft. Place the first one you launch into the 80km orbit. When you launch the second one, check to see where the first one is. If the first craft is ahead of the second craft, place the second craft into a 75km orbit. If the first craft is behind the second craft, place the second craft into an 85km orbit. Remember: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThings in lower orbits will catch up to things in higher orbits!\u003C/span\u003E Also, you want the orbits of the two craft to be fairly close to each other. 5-10km is optimal.

When you get close to a targeted vehicle, it will automatically switch to Target mode. If you click on the navball mode box (where your speed is), you will cycle between these three modes. Since you are now in Target mode, you will have two pink markers added to your navball. The pink circle is the Target Prograde Marker, and the pink Y is the Target Retrograde Marker. \u003Cstrong\u003EYour speed in target mode does not indicate if you are moving toward or away from your target.\u003C/strong\u003E The relationship between your Prograde/Retrograde Markers and the Target Prograde/Retrograde Markers show you if you are moving toward or away!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see how this works. We want to move toward our target craft. Find the Target Prograde Marker. Point your craft off to the side of the Target Prograde Marker opposite where your Prograde Marker currently is.

Look at your speed, and the distance to the target craft. You want your speed to be roughly 1/100th the distance to the target. If it\u0027s 5km (5,000m) away, you want your speed to be 50m/s. If it\u0027s 2,000m away, you want to be going 20m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mRFIyTe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mRFIyTe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re heading toward your target at your initial closing speed, flip your craft 180 so you are looking at the Target Retrograde Marker. As you close, your Retrograde Marker will drift off the Target Retrograde Marker. PUSH your Retrograde Marker back onto the Target Retrograde Marker by burning your engine. This will slow you down. You only need to correct course and speed every so often. If I start out at 50m/s closing speed at 5km, I\u0027ll burn at 2.5km, 1.2km, 700m, 300m, and 100m at which point I\u0027m going 1m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yuigHVZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yuigHVZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big issue during this process is overburning.

Docking ports pointing east/west will move as the craft rotates around its orbit. Don\u0027t try to dock with a port that\u0027s facing east or west! Instead, slew your target craft around so your target docking port is pointed south. A docking port facing north/south will not move if it\u0027s fairly near the center of mass.
