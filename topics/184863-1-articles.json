I am an avid admirer of the rovers and it made me quite upset to learn that Opportunity didn\u0027t survive the Martian 2018 sandstorm. So thank you again for honoring their memories and legacy.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor those that don\u0027t know, there are three robotic rover arms in three sizes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Big things from a little package?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I just wanted to thank all you guys for what you did.
