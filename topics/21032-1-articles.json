Long story short, he was chosen to be on a rover mission to drive at least 25 km South of the base. He was successful at getting there. But he wanted to get back really quickly to tell his mates but he was going 30 m/s and.... well there was a hill and the rover was in the air, trying to control the rover whilst screaming he tried to slow down. Unfortunately the rover toppled over at the speed of 20 m/s. The rover was fine but the pod he was in didn\u0027t. Now his crew mates are sad and are staying on the mun waiting for his return, even though he might never come back.... They will never go until he comes, there are now 2 of them and the place of the crash is 16.6 km away from them. The data is in the rover but neither want to go. I guess they might need a mission to get them out of there since they\u0027re so sad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E :(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures that I took:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/2ih5p3a.png\u0022 alt=\u00222ih5p3a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/2l8emfs.png\u0022 alt=\u00222l8emfs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/1199c9z.png\u0022 alt=\u00221199c9z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/29vgbpe.png\u0022 alt=\u002229vgbpe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i45.tinypic.com/2628uu0.png\u0022 alt=\u00222628uu0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[spoiler=2 crewmates upset \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/nx6ft1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nx6ft1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s the rememberance of Ercott Kerman, the first Kerbal to walk, drive and sadly die on the mun in 0.17...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CkGordon","CreatedById":51332,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T17:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that ISA MapSat?
