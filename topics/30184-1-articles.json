I\u0027ve mastered going to the Mun and i currently have good \u0027ol Jebidiah up on the Moon. I\u0027m trying to send a rover with a seat so I can explore the Mun and find a suitable flat area, but I can\u0027t seem to get that damn Stock Rover anywhere...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ditchbuster","CreatedById":68012,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T05:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I did to get that stock one to the mun was to spin it upside down and attach it to a rocket that can get to Mun orbit. Then I jettison it and bring it down just like a lander. Once on the ground I hit full throttle and stage at the same time and the top part goes flying away!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacob01","CreatedById":61842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T06:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using the stock rover, I just attach it to the top of my usual mun rocker (Which is just the Kerbal X with modifications for me). I land it down as I would with any other manned mission, but then I decouple the rover and blast it slightly into the air using the sky crane. Then I land it, and once its landed, I ditch the sky crane by throtoling up slightly and decoupling it, this way the rover doesn\u0027t go off the ground high enough for it to be damaged, but the sky crane continues going up until its fuel runs out, and then crashes back down to the Mun usually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irichey25","CreatedById":66851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T06:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing for me is, there is no Skycrane along with it.
