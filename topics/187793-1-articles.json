PC and Linux and Mac (if Mac is supported) will likely get crossplay relatively soon after launch in the worst case, if that\u0027s not just a feature available at launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossplay between Playstation and Xbox is going to be the hardest sell for the KSP developers, because you have to sell that idea to Sony and Microsoft, two companies that are in fact competing for market share of the console market. Those two corporations think that if a game doesn\u0027t have crossplay, players will be forced to buy a console from them if they want to play with their friends that don\u0027t have the same console they have. However, the far more likely result for KSP 2 at least is that those friends just remain unable to play with each other forever, because KSP 2 is not one of those games that sells consoles. Because both Sony and Microsoft know that KSP is not the kind of game that sells consoles like that, they\u0027re likely not going to be willing to take the extra effort to support KSP 2 in a way that allows crossplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, crossplay between Xbox and PC is another matter entirely, and it\u0027s something that Microsoft is likely extremely interested in, since Microsoft sells both the Windows OS (that most gaming PC\u0027s use) and the Xbox game console. As an example that proves this point, take a look at the newest Halo game. It\u0027s the first NEW Halo game that has released simultaneously on both Xbox and PC on launch day. Having crossplay between Windows PC\u0027s and Xbox consoles in that case means that the games will have a longer lifespan on the Microsoft consoles (and Windows PCs), because it makes the number of players you can choose to play with larger. At the end of the day that means Microsoft makes more money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the oddball one that I can\u0027t predict is crossplay between Playstation and PC. Just like with Playstation and Xbox, Sony and Microsoft are competitors. However, the fact that Linux and Mac PC\u0027s would also be able to crossplay in that case might change the equation slightly (not much, since the vast majority of PC\u0027s in the world run Windows, but it\u0027s not zero so it can\u0027t be totally ignored).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not like Sony will mandate that only Linux and Mac PC\u0027s have the ability to cross-play with Playstation consoles, that would be a rather unreasonable request that would be denied immediately, and both parties (the KSP 2 developers and Sony) know that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: On the other hand, I was not aware of the fact that KSP 2 is coming to PREVIOUS gen consoles. I hope that\u0027s not a mistake that gets retracted like what happened with Cyberpunk 2077, because KSP is going to be an extremely computationally demanding game (for entirely different reasons (physics vs graphics), but the overall load is probably in fact greater than CP2077\u0027s total computational load).\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, I hope that means that the KSP 2 developers are forced to optimize KSP 2 even more, rather than cutting content and/or features to make it \u0022fit\u0022 the PS4 and Xbox One (consoles that are rapidly approaching the 10 year mark of age, and if you know how slow a 10 year old PC is, just imagine a (weaker) 10 year old gaming console).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would surprise me a lot if KSP 2 was coming to the \u0022basic\u0022 PS4 and/or Xbox One, instead I\u0027m pretty convinced that it\u0027s coming to the \u0022PS4 Pro and Xbox One S\u0022 only, as they have better hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-07T19:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2022 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESlight concern about KSP 2 coming to previous-gen consoles\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
