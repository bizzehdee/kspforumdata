It\u0027s target audience is kids, which probably don\u0027t require the same level of subliminal stuff/\u0022fine tuning\u0022 (read: interference from suits) as live action shows for adults do, so the creators get more freedom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Animation is a much more drawn out process, you have the script and some storyboards and that\u0027s it. You have your voice actors record and... it\u0027s done. From then on you\u0027re animating around the audio they produced. There\u0027s no room to make last minute changes or meddle in the middle of production, which is what tends to kill shows. It\u0027s also harder for them to meddle during editing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother reason The Bad Batch probably did well is because it was handicapped by a heavy merch presence. If it was as marketable in that way as The Mandalorian, you\u0027d see a lot more interference from suits in order to put in scenes to help sell merchandise. Mando S3 was basically a giant advert for Grogu plushies. I\u0027d like to believe that if the show\u0027s creators had their way, S2 would have been the end and we wouldn\u0027t see Grogu again until the Mandoverse movie that\u0027s rumored to show how Palpatine returned. Or S3 would have focused on Mando by himself and dug more into what the post-Empire world is like without him being handicapped by the kid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-08T03:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mandalorian lost its way when kathleen kennedy decided to undo the entire point of getting grogu to skywalker.
