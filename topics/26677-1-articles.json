The closest encounter I could muster was something like 800,000 m. I started to burn retrograde upon entering Duna\u0027s influence at my periapsis to establish a capture orbit.

This method is time consuming but it uses less than a quarter of a Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank. If i want to go to the inner planets i plan for my apoapis to be at the light side of the planet, for the outer planets the apoapis is at the dark side of kerbin. If during a planning a burn i get an encounter with Mun or Minmus i wait for one orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once outside the Kerbin system at the ascending or descending nodes i match the plane with the target parent planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. After that i try to get an encounter with the planet with the least amount of burning time at various points at the ship\u0027s orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Once i have an encounter i fiddle with the periapisi/apoapsis (blue circles), inclination (triangle icons) at the maneuvering node in order to get a planet periapsis within a planets atmosphere or a height of roughly 10-20 km if there is no atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I execute the burn at half the time before i encounter the node (i do this for every burn i make), eg for a 10 min burn i start at T -5 mins\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Once the burn is complete with the use of RCS i try to correct my periapsis, the further away you use it the more distance you shave off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Once at a planet\u0027s influence i save (hit F5) and check my periapsis to see if it\u0027s correct, if not i plan another node and correct the periapsis/inclination using RCS or the main engine if the burn is over 100 m/s (depending from your ship\u0027s design). At this step, and when correcting the periapsis at solar orbit, i don\u0027t wait for the ship to reach the node i execute the correction, this is very helpful especially when you enter a planet\u0027s influence and you don\u0027t have enough time inside its influence, create the node at say 5-10 mis away and once you have the altitude/inclination you want burn, you can get a polar orbit with very little fuel consumption at this step. At solar orbits i create a node 1 hour away from my ship so i can have all the time i need to make my corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.

That said, if you do it carefully, you should only have a few hundred m/s of excess velocity upon reaching Duna. It\u0027s hard to say where you\u0027re losing delta-v though, without monitoring your flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When you launch, how much delta-v are you using to get to LKO? If it\u0027s more than 4700 m/s, you need to work on your ascent. A skilled pilot can make it to orbit in a well designed ship for about 4400 m/s, but between 4500 and 4600 m/s is a much more realistic goal for most vessels. (~4600 m/s used)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you\u0027re in your parking orbit (which should be as low as possible), set up a maneuver node to plan your ejection burn to Duna. This will allow you to correct for any inclination differences and fix any timing mistakes in advance. It also gives you a good idea for how far in advance you\u0027ll need to start your burn to get there when you want to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make your burn in map view as much as possible. Sometimes you get to the target for less delta-v than expected, some times it takes a bit more. I usually delete the maneuver node 10-15 seconds before it finishes so that I can see what my orbit is actually doing without the node\u0027s interference. As you get close, throttle back and watch the close approach indicators. Stop burning when the indicator tells you you\u0027re starting to move farther from the target instead of closer (shocking, huh?) (~1100 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Timewarp until you\u0027re out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, then set up a maneuver node to fix your encounter, getting your periapsis as low as possible (preferably under 250km at this point, but anything under 2Mm will do.) (~50 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Timewarp again until you\u0027re ~10 days out from Duna, then finally get your Duna encounter just right (use a maneuver node to plan it if you\u0027re uncertain in which direction to burn based on the map view and try to get your periapsis to ~70km if you\u0027re not aerobraking.) (~10 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Once you enter Duna\u0027s SOI, burn at the retrograde direction\u0027s heading, but with zero pitch, until your periapsis is where you want it. It should already be very close, but it will shift slightly upon changing SOI. (~10 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Timewarp until shortly before periapsis, then burn retrograde to capture. (~300 m/s) (Alternatively, set your periapsis to ~12km and enjoy the show as you coast through the atmosphere.

So it\u0027s actually overkill and I always have fuel left. But I don\u0027t use it for my Duna injection burn. I only use the nuclear engine with it\u0027s 2500 m/s dv between Kerbin orbit and Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought of one thing that might make an effect.
