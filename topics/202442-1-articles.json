I also know about wing incidence. What is the optimal angle for something like an eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E, designed to go fast in Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere.?Any tips help, except egrigious exploits like heatsheild wings or kraken drives My concept is 7 of the largest kerbodyne tanks, with 4 big-s wings for every tank(at 10 degree incidence), each filled with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E, so when the lfox runs out i use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E nukes. 5\u00A0nukes power it on exhaustion of lfox. Payload is 1 ton, and maximum mass of 650 tons. Full reusability. Note, this is in the kerbalism mod, which only allows 1 ignition for mammoths, and ~14 for nukes(also no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E). I will send an engineer for on orbit engine refurbishing, kerbalism gives you a 1/4 chance of you not being able to repair, so max of 4 trips up and down before failure. Then i send it to kerbin either on nukes(on orbit refuel) or carry it as dead weight for grand tour. No need to actually do this multiple times, but no part is destroyed or lost or left on eve surface. Do you think this concept will work?\u00A0tell me all your drag reduction tips so I can make it work. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
