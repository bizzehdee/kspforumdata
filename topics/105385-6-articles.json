Do a test run and check when they occur? Preferably at varying altitudes?\n\nI did test, did you read the rest of the post? (Or maybe doing properly documented and controlled tests too)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah yeah, I know but what I\u0027ve meant is: If we start getting mach effects can we reliably say its passing the transsonic to supersonic barrier?\n\u003E I did some test and it seems that no, with the debug info for heat and aero on watching some tests flight. It was a rather small probe with the stock resource scanning(wanted to test that) the 45 small engine and two SRB on the sides. TWR 2.1 dV of 6000\n\u003E \n\u003E After launching and just letting the rocket do its turn on aero alone, at first the orcket quickly breaks the transonic barrier, giving some mach effects. these pass out and stabilizes at around 1.6~1.8 mach. Some of the test if I was going too shallow and too fast the front of the rocket, eg stock fairing, bit bigger sized due to Scan part, start to gain a LOT of temperature, this temp conducts to other parts, but the result is the fairing blowing up some of the time (without any of the mach or heat effects).\n\u003E \n\u003E Which leads to observation number 1: Watchout fairings will overheat too, the visual indication was on the stage sequence\n\nWell I was quite sleepy, so maybe the writing doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense.\n\nSummarizing: the white a red effects seems to be high pressure and high heating due to excess velocity in a certain pressure altitude. \n\nReaching trans-sonic flight gave me some intense high-pressure effects, but after breaking it, going at around ~1.7 mach at higher altitude, the effects went away. But this was misleading, I was still going supersonic flight, high pressure, with increasing drag and lots of temperature gain at the rocket top, this caused my fairing to explode in a couple of the test, something forcing me to slow down.\n\nSo a rewrite of the observations **:=** Be careful as supersonic effects are still happening even without the visual effects, high drag and overheating.\n\nThis also led me to wonder, as you climb altitude how does the speed of sound varies? I was believing that mach was high in higher atmosphere, but its actually the reverse isn\u0027t it? Sound travels faster in higher density medium. Can some clarify this?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone figured out the new terminal velocities for various altitudes yet? Not sure how you\u0027d go about finding them but I had the old one memorized and the sooner I can get started on the new one, the better.\n\nAs mentioned above, Terminal velocity is not a constant. It depends a lot on aerodynamics and atmosphere pressure, it never was a good indicator to optimal velocities. Now the real issue is sonic speed, when going transsonic and higher a lot more of drag is created, specially in bad aero designs. However, I suspect going lower than trans-sonic isn\u0027t going to get you very far either. There probably is a mach speed sweet spot.\n\nAlso related, in the above test I did, I get a lot efficiency, around 2400~2600dV only, but its was pretty much like an ballistic missile, and had to fight the high heating effetcs.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnswering to my own question above:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This also led me to wonder, as you climb altitude how does the speed of sound varies? I was believing that mach was high in higher atmosphere, but its actually the reverse isn\u0027t it? Sound travels faster in higher density medium. Can some clarify this?\n\nWikipedia is our friend: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Altitude_variation_and_implications_for_atmospheric_acoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Altitude_variation_and_implications_for_atmospheric_acoustics) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Mach_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Mach_number)\n\nBasically Mach speed depends on pressure, density, humidity, temperature and a bunch of other things. As the atmosphere lowers pressure so does density, so its a trade-off, humidity I don\u0027t believe matters on KSP, so the main factor for sound speed is temperature (as it also is for Earth). The temperature drops up to the lower atmosphere, so does mach speed, after that it actually has higher temperature gradient, so does mach speed increase. Considering the complexity of newer aero and thermo dynamics, I think it most surely holds up for KSP, but some testing would actually help."},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:38:20Z","Content":"Thanks for all the answers.
