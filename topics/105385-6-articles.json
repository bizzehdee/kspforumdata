Some of the test if I was going too shallow and too fast the front of the rocket, eg stock fairing, bit bigger sized due to Scan part, start to gain a LOT of temperature, this temp conducts to other parts, but the result is the fairing blowing up some of the time (without any of the mach or heat effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads to observation number 1: Watchout fairings will overheat too, the visual indication was on the stage sequence\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I was quite sleepy, so maybe the writing doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummarizing: the white a red effects seems to be high pressure and high heating due to excess velocity in a certain pressure altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching trans-sonic flight gave me some intense high-pressure effects, but after breaking it, going at around ~1.7 mach at higher altitude, the effects went away. But this was misleading, I was still going supersonic flight, high pressure, with increasing drag and lots of temperature gain at the rocket top, this caused my fairing to explode in a couple of the test, something forcing me to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a rewrite of the observations \u003Cstrong\u003E:=\u003C/strong\u003E Be careful as supersonic effects are still happening even without the visual effects, high drag and overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also led me to wonder, as you climb altitude how does the speed of sound varies?

It depends a lot on aerodynamics and atmosphere pressure, it never was a good indicator to optimal velocities. Now the real issue is sonic speed, when going transsonic and higher a lot more of drag is created, specially in bad aero designs. However, I suspect going lower than trans-sonic isn\u0027t going to get you very far either. There probably is a mach speed sweet spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso related, in the above test I did, I get a lot efficiency, around 2400~2600dV only, but its was pretty much like an ballistic missile, and had to fight the high heating effetcs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswering to my own question above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis also led me to wonder, as you climb altitude how does the speed of sound varies?

As the atmosphere lowers pressure so does density, so its a trade-off, humidity I don\u0027t believe matters on KSP, so the main factor for sound speed is temperature (as it also is for Earth). The temperature drops up to the lower atmosphere, so does mach speed, after that it actually has higher temperature gradient, so does mach speed increase. Considering the complexity of newer aero and thermo dynamics, I think it most surely holds up for KSP, but some testing would actually help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the answers.
