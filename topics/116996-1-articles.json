But really, it should be much easier. They could, for instance, color-code (or otherwise identify\\*) the names in the list that shows up when you click on a hatch. Usually the only time it matters is when you want to do an EVA or transfer a kerbal, so that would be the ideal place for it.\n\n(\\*Color-coding works great except for people who are colorblind.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:48:57Z","Content":"A simple name and a symbol on the face screen wouldn\u0027t be enough?"}]}
