So naturally there\u0027s a need for observation towers. This is a no assembly required, point pointy end at space and go, self-propelled base. Or is it a lander? It could make orbit again after landing at Duna, there\u0027s enough dV...\n\n**Download:** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bg8qc7k7urwx5h3/Base%20of%20Obscurity%20%2B%20Launcher.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bg8qc7k7urwx5h3/Base%20of%20Obscurity%20%2B%20Launcher.craft?dl=0)\n\n![hViUW7O.png](http://i.imgur.com/hViUW7O.png)\n\nLKO with 1,000\u002Bm/s dV remaining from the Crepe Launcher (be careful if manually flying when it\u0027s down to the single booster (see album for picture) - it\u0027s a touch off centre so gentle throttle inputs will keep you on track). Base itself is good for at least 3,500m/s (although its fuel is really meant as ballast, but hey, we all make mistakes and maybe halfway to there you need to got somewhere that\u0027s not there) dV from its Nuke stage, plus the last ditch c. 800m/s stage from the aerospikes.\n\nRated for Duna using just the Crepe Launcher for Launch and transfer, haven\u0027t tried it anywhere else. \n\n**Launch from KSC**\n\nIgnite. Keep an eye on staging, first tank gets dropped pretty quickly. First two stages do not have rockets for separation - you\u0027ll always be vertical when they run out. I tend to do its gravity turns at around 10km. Keep pointy end pointed at stars.\n\n**Landing**\n\nLanding the base: Use the Crepe Launcher if you\u0027ve got any dV left. If not, use the nukes (in combo with the Aerospikes if you want more flames) once established on your entry trajectory feel free to dump the nukes (it\u0027s not your planet, so it doesn\u0027t matter if its unethical...). If your Aerospikes look like they\u0027re going to run out of dV - just transfer some more fuel in from the main base.\n\nHas been tested to withstand slopes of 4.8 degrees.\n\nOnce landed, transfer most of the fuel from those Rockomax tanks back into the main base. When you separate the landing engines (you don\u0027t have to - you might get bored of the base being there...) leave a bit of fuel in those tanks and fire up the engines gently. I\u0027ve had mixed results with the separation - sometimes it goes fine, sometimes it goes banging into the observation tower. Quicksave to be safe!\n\nYou can use the cupola as a viewing deck to the stars, and the lander cans have their windows facing outwards.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nCrew Capacity: 27\n\nScience Lab\n\nAntenna\n\nPower\n\nDocking Ports\n\nObservation Tower\n\n**Base Only (wet)**\n\n177.4t\n\n28m x 14.7m x 18.3m\n\n254 parts\n\n4x jr docking ports\n\n254 parts\n\n**w/ Crepe Launcher (wet)**\n\n1,740.2t\n\n40.2m x 26.7m x 26.7m\n\n416 parts\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
