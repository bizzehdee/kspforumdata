I\u0027ve been playing KSP since .18 but i\u0027m just now joining the Forums Because i realize that there are modding Geniuses here. So some of my KSP experience involves alot of time figuring out how to dock, but now that i\u0027m over that learning curve my possibilities are endless. I have a space station/Telescope Countless missions to the Mun and Minnmus under my belt and my Latest achievement is getting a Com Sat network Around Duna. I try to play realistically so I am so glad they added PermaDeath and crew is labeled \u0022dead\u0022 and not \u0022MIA\u0022 I installed Tac Life and was going to use Deadly reentry but i couldn\u0027t get the heat shield part to render. I Mostly play Sandbox because \u0022My\u0022 idea of career mode was totally different then the \u0022Devs\u0022 idea of career mode and i\u0027m totally disappointed in the direction they went. But other than that Ksp is a great game and since i bought it at .18 i\u0027ve logged 224 hours on Steam. Thanks guys see you out there! (cept not really)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T06:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t give up on it yet: career mode is only on its second iteration, and is going to keep evolving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nMitch","CreatedById":98379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T07:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just think a simple tech tree is inappropriate for a game of this stature. I Mean I don\u0027t like the idea of using a surface sample or a seismic reading to just unlock more rockets. Don\u0027t get me wrong I like the idea that you have to unlock more rockets and stuff, just don\u0027t like using \u0022Science\u0022 to do it. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a sense of \u0022Discovery\u0022 in the game which is really what NASA and JAXA are all about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the party! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
