This includes the position of the orbiting object at a specific point in time. Because orbits in KSP are perfectly stable and repeating, just one specific time stamp is required to compute all possible locations at all possible times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a practical example, pull up \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlexmoon\u0027s transfer planner\u003C/a\u003E. Press \u0022add body\u0022, and then switch the type to \u0022vessel\u0022. The form you now see asks you all the information that is required, including the last field: \u0022time of periapsis passage\u0022. There, you are to enter a specific ingame date (year/day/hour/minute/second) of this vessel hitting its periapsis. It doesn\u0027t matter \u003Cem\u003Ewhich\u003C/em\u003E periapsis passage; any will do. As long as the orbit is known, and one single timestamp is known, you can compute the vessel\u0027s position at any given point in time - both forward and backward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really know how exactly Hyperedit or the ingame cheat menu expects such info to be entered; that\u0027s an exercise left to you. The point is that it is\u00A0indeed possible to\u00A0make a challenge like you envision. All you need to do is figure out what exactly you need to enter into Hyperedit or the ingame cheat menu to place the vessel in the exact place on the exact orbit at the exact time you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sivonen","CreatedById":165197,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T06:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for pointing me at the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIngame cheat menu doesn\u0027t allow to put crafts in collision course iirc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sivonen","CreatedById":165197,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T06:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith these instructions I managed to replicate the trajectory every time:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161887-jebs-problematic-mun-landing-prevent-the-crash-challenge/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
