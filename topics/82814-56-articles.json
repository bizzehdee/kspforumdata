So that means I have to go through each vehicle and redo Every. Single. Strut. (On the plus side, it allows me to take a crack at reducing the M4\u0027s part count.

As it turns out, the batteries weren\u0027t the only KW parts that I had used on them. It turns out that I had used the KW struts on quite a few of my tanks, specifically every tank between the M3 and the M7 and every variant whereof. So that means I have to go through each vehicle and redo Every. Single. Strut. (On the plus side, it allows me to take a crack at reducing the M4\u0027s part count.
