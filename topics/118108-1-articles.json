The original 3 (Jeb, Bob and Bill) are unkillable: they go MIA (Missing in action) if their rocket is destroyed but they will respawn, AFAIK. Although, if you are playing in higher difficulties or using crew other than the original 3, I\u0027m not sure if they will respawn of not; it might depend on some settings. If they don\u0027t respawn, you could probably tweak some things in your persistant.sfs file, though I don\u0027t know what exactly you\u0027ll have to do, so I might not be helpful there.\n\nIf your rocket is not actually destroyed, just ignore my comment and recover your ship as it has been said above ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
