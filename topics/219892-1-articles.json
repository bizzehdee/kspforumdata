I\u0027m not in the path of annularity, but I\u0027m very excited for a nice partial solar eclipse!

I didn\u0027t have much in the way of specialized equipment, so I did the old hole-in-the-paper trick. It was really neat, especially since usually when there\u0027s a historical, once in a lifetime astronomical event, it\u0027s on a school day, absurdly late at night, and it\u0027s cloudy anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t know what to expect, but it\u0027s noticeably dark, not like night-dark but more like dusk-dark.
