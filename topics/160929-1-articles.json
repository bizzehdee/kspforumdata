I decided to look through the files, because why not, and I saw that there are parts that I dont see in the game. For example, there is a heat shield file, but no heat shield in the game. Another part is the airbrake. is there something wrong with my demo, or what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T19:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe demo does not contain the full suite of parts.
