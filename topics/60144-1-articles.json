On Eeloo, cyrovolcanoes (A.K.A snow geysers) would push your ship around or launch Kerbals off the surface (since Eeloo is planned to be the innermost moon of Gas Planet 2, this may be evidence of a subsurface ocean with life). Laythe was supposed to have REAL volcanism with lava, which would generate lava flows that might destroy your ship ( Laythe\u0027s volcanoes would also generate massive amounts of CO\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, which, thanks to the greenhouse effect, would warm Laythe up enough to support liquid water on its surface). Personally, I really want this feature to be implemented, but others may think differently.
