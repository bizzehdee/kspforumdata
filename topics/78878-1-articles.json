HOWEVER, the game is still fun to mess around in. I have a SPACE SANDBOX! So I started building outrageous ships (alt-f12) and exploring the solar system. First one was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike an X-Wing. Letting MechJeb handle the finer points I flew everywhere, checking out all the planets (and crashing into the sun). Now I am to the point of editing the in game parts to make my own creations. Most have just been to change the thrust and create an auto-refueler. But I want to try something a little more extreme. I want to create a warp / FTL drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it would use up a S-Ton of energy to use and the thrust would be off the scale. But if the shear energy of the jump doesn\u0027t rip the ship to shreds, I have two problems with this little project of mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) This would not just be a part or collection of parts. I would have to create some sort of \u0022nav computer\u0022 in which one would have to carefully plot a course taking into account gravity wells, distance and planetary bodies (aka, don\u0027t smack into Mun on your way to Eeloo). No idea where to begin on something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) STOPPING. After engaging the FTL and getting where you want to go, how to STOP? I have been trying to figure out a way to make the craft go to zero-V but can\u0027t figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know this is, technically, cheating. But come on! I could not resist!

Definitely don\u0027t want it to be EASY to plot an FTL jump. If you are going to go several lightyears in the blink of an eye I think the difficulty should be much higher then planning an orbit. And, for instance, if you muck up and jump into a planets atmosphere, well lets just hope you built your ship capable of landing and have enough fuel to do so lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen looking around. Still can\u0027t figure out how to zero-V the craft. Script maybe? Can I put a script within a part? Is that how they do it with MechJeb?

I roughly estimated the thrust it would take my test rocket to the speed of light and set that value in the FTL engine part. I placed an FTL engine pointing forward and one backward (to go and stop).

I\u0027m not a modder-but I reccomend having a look at the Jump drive plugin-it (almost) does pretty much what you asked for.
