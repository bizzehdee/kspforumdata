While we\u0027ve had some rockets fail due to design issues with the rocket itself during the ascent to orbit, none of our craft have failed to achieve their objectives once they have made it into space. This includes multi-part missions to Mun, so we will be using a Mun trip as the example for this tutorial. Our goal will be to place a communications satellite into equatorial orbit around Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDefine your mission requirements\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step is to decide what you want to accomplish in your mission. In this case, we want to go to Mun and deploy a communications satellite. Since we won\u0027t be bringing along any kerbals, life support isn\u0027t an issue. We will need communications equipment, batteries to run them on, and solar panels to charge the batteries. We should also want a means to move the satellite after its been deployed and of course a probe core is required to control it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we know what we\u0027re sending to Mun, let\u0027s figure out what we need to get it there. To do this, we\u0027ll make use of a Delta-V map that will give us the numbers required to get to various places in the Kerbol system.

Click the image above and late in the thread you will find discussion on the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv value for ascent to LKO. We will use the amount given here on the chart so once to LKO it\u0027s 860m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to transfer us to Mun and then once we get there we need 310m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to enter into orbit. We don\u0027t actually need all that \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv because we won\u0027t be placing the ComSat into such a low orbit, but we\u0027re going to use the full value anyways so we have some extra fudge room for unforeseen mission problems. The further you travel, the more extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv you want to try to bring along. For Mun, all our missions require at least \u002B300m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, which is enough for a direct return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in total we need \u003Cem\u003Eat least \u003C/em\u003E4,570m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to get to Mun.

As defined earlier, we need at least 1,170m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to do this. Slapping together some small fuel tanks and strapping on a highly-efficient vacuum engine and we get the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cVOULLI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cVOULLI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtop our transfer stage, the first part that we created for this craft was an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76231-0-23-x-Kerbal-NRAP-adjustable-test-weight-for-rocket-building!-v1-4-11-04-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENRAP test weight\u003C/a\u003E.

Once we subtract the weight of the NRAP from the total weight, we will also have the specific weight of our transfer stage. Make note of both these items again.

As mentioned before, this will take 3.4km/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, but we don\u0027t need all of this for the lift stage, as the transfer stage contains enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to take up some of the work of getting into orbit, and we\u0027ll also be building a booster stage. So, slapping together a decoupler, tank and suitable atmospheric lifter engine we end up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1hGxiq2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221hGxiq2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that we are still using vacuum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv! This is a consideration that is made thanks to our booster stage. As with the transfer stage, this craft was constructed first with an NRAP set to the combined weight of the transfer \u002B payload.

Even if we take into account the atmospheric \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for our lifter stage, we still have 3,450m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv combined, which is enough to satisfy our 3.4km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv requirement to get to 70km orbit.

Think again!! The reason we made sure to break down our \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv amounts in stages is because you will be using different amounts of your total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv at different stages in your mission. It\u0027s totally possible to build a rocket with this much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv that won\u0027t even make it up into orbit because the majority is in your transfer stage, making it too heavy to get up to orbit after your lifter burns out low in the atmosphere. Make sure each stage of your mission has the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv required in addition to being larger than your minimum mission amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EStage your rocket\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo back now to each craft stage you created, and pull everything under the NRAP out into a sub-assembly.

The first thing you need to do - check your weight. If you did everything right, the total weight of the rocket after attaching all the sub-assemblies should match what you added up from each individual stage. We actually made a mistake creating this rocket and ended up with a weight that didn\u0027t match. Turned out we had input 1.203t for the transfer stage NRAP instead of 1.230t! Be careful of small mistakes like this, they can lead to bigger ones the larger the rocket and the more complex the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing you need to do is of course attach some fairings, and then organize your staging menu properly so that the boosters light first followed by the main engine after they separate... you\u0027ll want to adjust the boosters for low TWR on takeoff, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s it! You\u0027re well on your way to Mun and anywhere else in the Kerbol system you wish to go to. The missions will change, the rockets will change, but the overall planning and construction will remain the same. Define your requirements, then build top down to match them. If you need more stages, create them individually as we did for the four included in this tutorial.
