Sorry about that, I made the missions way to complicated and Mission Controller just doesn\u0027t like it, it seems. Also make sure your using the most current version of MC. I separated the docking from all the other Objectives. But keep in mind that when you dock the vessel.. You have to still be in compliance with the previous objectives..
