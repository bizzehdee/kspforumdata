It was fantastic! I can\u0027t say what I love more the book or the movie. And I can\u0027t make that determination the boom isn\u0027t better than the movie and the movie isn\u0027t better than the book. They are both fantastic in their own right. In that case I guess I was able to separate them and appreciate them both for what they are. They are both love stories to science. I think that both the book and the movie hit the threshold of sacrifice of science for narrative. Let\u0027s be honest we can nit pick every scene but the bottom line is that it is a movie and the purpose is to escape reality. I think I can easily say this was the most accurate science fiction movie ever made. Any more accuracy and you start going toward being boring and only appealing to really nerdy people like all of us. The solutions to the problems were science based. There was very little luck involved. There was no \u0022power of love\u0022 moment. It was all lets just work our asses off to get mark watney home. So if you read the book don\u0027t expect the movie to be exactly like the book. There is a lot from the book in the movie. More than I have ever seen in a novel to film adaptation. But book readers you just have to go in and expect a thouroughly entertaining movie and satisfying on nearly every level. If you expect it to be exactly like the book you are going to have a bad time. For me they are both fantastic on their own. I am 1000% ok with that. When it comes to not picking science and engineering. Yea you all have great points but come one this movie was the closest to we are going to get to a really accurate Sci fi movie.
