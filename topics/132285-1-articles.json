Does chess allow it? Then it\u0027s allowed here. Is it not possible in chess? Well, it is now. Call upon your knowledge of games from checkers to Connect Four to even Call of Duty. Counteract them moving a rook to one of your pieces by calling an airstrike on them. Due to the chaotic changing of actions that will occur, the game board will shrink, grow, and change to all sorts of shapes and environments.
