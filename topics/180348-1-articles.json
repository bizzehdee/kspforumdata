I had this problem on one of my career saves too, also on PS4, unfortunately couldn\u0027t never get it working, can you remember your last save? Mine happened when I had a rather large base loaded on the mun (800\u002B parts) which admittedly is pushing it for console. I have heard others say that High part count builds, on planet surfaces,\u00A0with too much flex can lead to corrupt save files\u00A0after too many saves,\u00A0could be the issue I had although I\u00A0cannot confirm that myself. I had to start over I\u0027m afraid. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
