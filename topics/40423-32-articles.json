So if you were to maintain your translational error but decrease CDST, the line would deflect further away from centerline (as your angle from centerline would increase).

You push the keys to fire the translation thrusters, but there\u0027s no apparent movement, possibly not for some time. Why not? Did you forget to turn on RCS? Did you forget to take yourself all the way out of timewarp? Do you have a pair of thrusters firing 45-degrees away from the direction you wish they were instead of one thruster firing exactly the direction you want, such that the efficiency is reduced? Are you pushing the wrong button? Do you just not have working thrusters in that direction? Or is your ship just so heavy it takes a long time to get any indication of response, especially if you\u0027re very far off the axis of the port?
