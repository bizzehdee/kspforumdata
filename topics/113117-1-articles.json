So the issue is enclosing the space stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have to disagree with OP. Struts have a place in the game and much of the wobble problem can be fixed by better design without necessarily resorting to struting the lower stages. And I think if you are creating someting \u0027outside\u0027 the NASA box, struts are a handy thing to have around even in launch stage. The reason why I say this is now with aero getting those wide draggy packages into space requires slowing the launch down (meaning engines like jets that are efficient and lots of them) and this also means securing those outmounts and also stabiling a huge dragy thing on a node that is stock 3.75 or with mod maybe 5 to 8 meters. I\u0027ve launched factorys that are almost 30 meter across so struts are very nice things to have around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut........some parts realistically need zero span welds.

If I turn off the space stage SAS and add a SAS module to the launch stage this causes alot to diminish. Then slow the speeds down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second cause of wobble is winglet tuning. There is only one winglet in the game (unless you\u0027ve added more), but you can bet that NASA does not put winglets that are oversized or undersized on their rockets. Oversized winglets are as much a problem as undersized, but one can mediate this problem by moving the winglets up the launch phase lower the distance between the winglet and CoG and therefore lowering the torque they can produce. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to use the word whine but from what I see alot of the complaints are complaints about not knowing the physics and poor design. I have launched rockets with 10 burn stages that are taller than the VAB itself, yeah used struts, yeah needed outmounts and modified struts, yeah slowed down launch phase, yeah its all to compensate for an unrealistic design with a magnitude more unwelded \u003Cem\u003Esegments\u003C/em\u003E (meaning linewelded not separable) than NASA has in their rockets, should I expect flawless operation? But another point is that the GAME allows users to redesign parts to suit their needs, so don\u0027t whine, modify, and if the modification was really something the game needed then it might get added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really really want to fix the single point snap issue without needing struts, modify your tanks to exactly fit your need. IOW don\u0027t have a 400 and 800 when you need a 1200, instead modify the scale of an 800, making the y = 1.5 times the original. Then add 50% more mass, 50% LF and 50% more Ox. Do this for every stage and reduce, realistically, the segmental flexibility. The real name of the problem is segmental flexibility, unrealistic numbers of segments result in \u0027unrealistic\u0027 levels of wobble. Count your segments from your SAS module in both directions and from your winglets. if you end up with lots of segments on the thinnest stage, . . . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, wobble and flexibility below 20000 meters alt tell me that I have a problem in my design. MechJeb generally takes care of the control issues (keyboard controls are not as good as stick controls). If the issue remains you have to treat is as a design flaw not neccesarily a game problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T19:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.22, it took me a long time to figure out how to use the Mainsail without it tearing the rocket apart.

Huge boosters were attached with just the decoupler and a single strut. Soon I learned to appeciate the change. Struts had become almost unnecessary, and rockets barely wobbled at all. Now we can build quick and dirty rockets to launch large payload easily. For example, this rocket can lift around 100 tonnes to a 600 km orbit using just 6 struts (2 for the boosters and 4 around the undersized parts between the fairing base and the payload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/heavy_lifter.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022heavy_lifter.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you tweak the gimbal range of the Mammoth and the Twin-Boars down to 50%, the rocket follows prograde with stock SAS without any wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I don\u0027t believe that wobble is a problem in the game anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not the strength of the gimbal so much (generally lower in KSP than IRL), it\u0027s that it can instantly jump from one extreme to another that causes problems, IMO.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use Claw\u0027s amazing StockPlus (SQUAD, hire this guy and make StockPlus properly stock) which gives engines gimbal speed.
