How are you guys handling landing or aerobraking accurately on Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Jool, and Laythe. I went to Duna and ended up almost 1/4 of the way around the planet off from my intended landing spot.\n\nI know MJ probably uses the stock drag model, so is there something out there that will help get me closer to my intended landing spots or aero-brake orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:10:45Z","Content":"There\u0027s the [Atmospheric Trajectories](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694) mod.

Stock uses the same amount of drag for every single part regardless of orientation, size or mass and is highly predictable, unlike real life. Remember that FAR tries to provide realism and the more realistic its drag model gets, the less accurate landing predictions are going to be, even with the trajectories mod.\n\nAs an example, refer to the image below. It shows the predicted landing zones for several Mars probes that we\u0027ve sent over the past few decades. You\u0027ll note that it takes the form of an ellipse. The probes were predicted to land anywhere within the designated ellipses. You\u0027ll also note that with time we\u0027ve gotten more accurate with our predictions as we learned more about Mars atmosphere and aerodynamics and as our technology has improved.\n\nCuriosity had the greatest degree of accuracy yet but it was made possible because Curiosity could \u0027fly out the errors\u0027. In other words it actively steered towards its desired landing zone.\n\nYou\u0027re *already* getting far more accuracy in predictions than NASA got ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n[![PPS2OdBl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PPS2OdBl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/PPS2OdB)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T17:44:48Z","Content":"I use the Trajectories mod with FAR and have found that it sometimes undershoots quite a bit. Frankly I haven\u0027t spent enough time investigating why this is, so I can\u0027t offer too many thoughts on whether it\u0027s correctable or not. I have learned to manually correct for it based on the type of craft and the steepness of the re-entry trajectory. The undershoot seems to be worse on shallow re-entry angles and heavy atmospheres like Eve.\n\nNote that Trajectories has settings to let you define what angle of attack you\u0027re going to have at various stages of the re-entry. It\u0027s important to adjust those to get meaningful predictions. Re-entering sideways in FAR yields a very different trajectory than head-first or butt-first.\n\nTrajectories also doesn\u0027t seem to understand aerodynamic lift too well if you\u0027re flying winged vehicles. While it does take entry angle into account, my conclusion is that it still assumes a ballistic flight path (i.e. only thinks about drag effects, not lift). Somebody correct me if I\u0027m wrong here... but anyway... Re-entering a lifting Space Shuttle type vehicle that can actually glide pretty well in the atmosphere can lead to overshooting the Trajectories estimate.\n\nWhat Trajectories does very well in any event, however, is help map out the impact of planet rotation when you are still many hours or days away from re-entry. The Trajectories \u0022X\u0022 is still going to be in the right vicinity and then you can simply correct based on experience to get a pretty good line-up.\n\nNone of this is to rain on the Trajectories mod parade... it is a terrific mod and I\u0027m very glad to have it. What it\u0027s trying to do is just very hard to get right."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T03:37:26Z","Content":"With the latest MechJeb dev build, it\u0027ll actually attempt to steer itself towards the landing point (like Curiosity did I guess), so, the accuracy is a whole lot better."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T09:41:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With the latest MechJeb dev build, it\u0027ll actually attempt to steer itself towards the landing point (like Curiosity did I guess), so, the accuracy is a whole lot better.\n\nI love it when code that I did not change for month gets better by itself ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T10:09:08Z","Content":"Trajectory in FAR is strongly affected by the behaviour of the craft during the descent; even a bare capsule can manouvre by changing the angle at which it meets the wind.
