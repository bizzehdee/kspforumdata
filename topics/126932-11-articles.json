Maybe for tests 2-3 the throat size was too large to properly choke the flow so the exhaust exited at\u00A0higher than ambient pressure, but for test 4 the pressure was high enough to choke the flow and drop the pressure. Seems like there\u0027s a sweet spot somewhere inbetween 7-8 bar for the fuel pressure and 8-9 bar for the oxygen for ideal performance.

Initially the mass flow goes up with pressure, but eventually Venturi overcomes Bernoulli and the mass flow decreases because the density at the throat drops precipitously.

Despite that, for a fraction of a second it was actually working, and there were visible mach diamonds, so I\u0027m\u00A0pretty happy with that part of the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, there are several things that need improvement. First and foremost are\u00A0my safety procedures, currently testing is done behind some glass doors with manual ignition, but this presents a few hazards. One is if the engine explodes shrapnel could fly\u00A0straight through\u00A0the glass and into myself and anyone else who\u0027s watching, no shrapnel was produced in this failure, but it\u0027d be naive to assume that this could never happen, and I\u0027d rather not be a cautionary tale. The second is that the engine fails whilst I\u0027m lighting it, and flies right into my face. To mitigate both of these issues future testing will be done at distance (perhaps ~30m) with remote ignition, and around the test stand thick plywood walls will be placed to catch or slowdown any escaping debris. Better safe than sorry. Cameras are more expendable than humans so they can remain close to the test site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing that needs improvement is evidently the injector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sshhuZX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sshhuZX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old injector was very much inspired by those of similar micro-hybrid engines, but I believe it has several flaws. One is that it intentionally puts a barrier between the burst disc and the ignitor, which directs most of the fire away from the burst disc, and makes the whole thing unnecessarily difficult to light. It also provides no means of support for the ignitor, meaning that it can come loose before ignition, which results in a dud launch, or can come loose after ignition and clog the nozzle, which provides quite the unexpected firework show. Fixing this looks to be fairly simple, just shift down the barrier so it directs the flames\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etowards\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the burst disc and holds the ignitor firmly in place, improving ignition reliability and reducing clogging risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third improvement to be made in the next engine iteration is weight saving, the old engine had a measly propellant mass fraction of 0.07. Now due to the small size and use of a heavy commercial pressure vessel\u00A0a low propellant mass fraction can\u0027t be helped, but based on some rough calculations I reckon I could get the whole thing down to around ~80-90g with a propellant mass fraction of about 0.1. This will be achieved by trimming down some of the unnecessary aluminium on the internal components,\u00A0using smaller bolts for cracking the canister, and switching from a stainless steel tube to an aluminium one. Still a long shot from\u00A0the 0.5 propellant mass fraction of similarly sized solid motors, but better than nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make designing the next\u00A0engine a little easier I also wrote a few\u00A0bits of code to calculate nozzle dimensions, minimum material thicknesses, and maximum apogee in flight for me.
