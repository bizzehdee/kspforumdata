I\u0027ll be landing everywhere but Eve (for now) and then returning to Kerbin. But, this is literally using ALL my funds. The payout will be huge, but there\u0027ll be no quick-loading if I mess up. My biggest worry is the Duna landing. Ike and Gilly will be easy.\n\nAnyone else take an all-or-nothing risk like this before? If it\u0027s a complete failure, I\u0027ll be trying to land and recover old probes and whatnot to cash in on scrap parts so I can maybe ferry some tourist or redo easy contracts to rebuild my bank.\n\nI\u0027m trying really hard to not make a copy of my save folder, just in case lol"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbow-Dashie","CreatedById":76160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:38:02Z","Content":"I once did an all or nothing Manned Mission to Duna... left me with literally 70 dollars after the ship launched...\n\nThen I watched in terror as my entire Space Agency\u0027s budget fell out of the sky in pieces while in orbit...

I had one probe going to land on Eve and do atmo/seismic/pressure/temperature/goo science (which landed fine and got all the science transmitted) and then I had one ship with a probe going to Ike, and a 3rd ship with 2 crewed landers going to Duna and Ike (for a different biome than the probe and a different contract, but also for Eva reports and surface samples). When I launched the 2 ships headed for Duna, that was the last of my funds. I couldn\u0027t really do anything else except wait for the Eve ship to land and collect science which also completed the \u0022Explore Eve\u0022 contract. Shortly after that was the 2 Duna-bound ships. Now all I have to do is get my Ike probe back to Kerbin to collect more Biome science.\n\nMy space program is back on track!"}]}
