Any help please?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T03:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hujinkai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T02:56:25Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nYou need to upgrade your facilities to build bigger spacecraft. Upgrading the VAB will increase the part limit, upgrading the launch pad will increase your mass limit.

Send it out to the runway and launch straight up.\n\nThe only thing I\u0027m not sure about is whether the runway would somehow take damage from that. For the sake of realism and balance I\u0027d like to think it would, but I suspect it\u0027d be perfectly fine with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T12:47:26Z","Content":"Truthfully, VAB increase is more usefull than SPH increase. you can do a lot with planes with the basic building. The only issue with the runway is the basic one is not totally flat.
