So maintenance of something like Hubble by Soyuz crew is theoretically possible. The tricky part is getting the spacecraft to correct orbit. Hubble is inclined 28\u00B0, and Baikonur is 45\u00B0N. So a Soyuz launched from there would have to make a 17\u00B0 inclination change. That\u0027s a whopping 1km/s of delta-V if you do it in orbit. The current variant of Soyuz spacecraft, the Soyuz MS, typically rides to ISS on top of the Soyuz-FG rocket. The later is capable of lifting 7,800 to LEO with Baikonur inclination. Soyuz MS is designed for launch mass of 7,000-7200kg. That\u0027s just too fine of a margin to try and start making inclination changes with.\u00A0However, there\u0027s also Soyuz-2, which is designed to operate at least with Progress ships, and so might be possible to adapt to a Soyuz MS launch. Soyuz-2 can get up to 8,200kg to LEO, and that\u0027s a significant improvement. So what you do is you strap Soyuz MS to a Soyuz-2 rocket. You start a normal launch until second stage. Instead of burning to orbit, second stage inserts you into a rather unpleasant ballistic trajectory that gives you a good, clean opportunity for an inclination change at the apex. Because part of the acceleration is reserved to this stage, the inclination change actually costs a lot less than 1km/s. The downside is that failure to reignite\u00A0second stage here will result in an extremely unpleasant re-entry with higher than normal G forces. But should be survivable and this is the emergency in-flight mission abort option, so that\u0027s fine? Maybe? Anyways, this gets you to Hubble\u0027s orbit, where you can do a spacewalk, using orbital module as an airlock, perform maintenance, and do a fairly routine return from orbit. Caveat on that last bit is that you couldn\u0027t land in Kazakh steppes. The most suitable landing spot for a Soyuz landing from Hubble\u0027s orbit is probably going to be in Australia with backups in Africa and maybe Texas? All of these are already on the list of potential emergency landing sites, but primary landing site would have to give agreement for a non-emergency landing. Australians certainly don\u0027t welcome spacecraft crashing on them without permission. *cough*SkyLab*cough*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, nobody\u0027s going to do this. Not worth the risk and probably not the expense, either.

The focus of warship defense is now focused on interception and evasion (CIWS, CAP, EW, decoys) rather than endurance (heavy armor, torpedo bulkhead, citadel armor). Now I wonder, if the modern-era warship do get hit by modern antiship missile, in terms of endurance compared to WW2-era heavy armor battleships, which one will outlast the other? (assuming both are hit by the same number of missiles and no missile are intercepted)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhoo, do I have a treatise to write now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, there\u0027s a huge difference between what is considered a missile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022harpoon-1024x575.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.15\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://militaryarms.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/harpoon-1024x575.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a Harpoon, an increasing rarity on US ships in favour of a Rolling Airframe Missile launcher.

The equivalent of a mid-sized bomb coupled with burning jet fuel is going to cause quite a bit of damage above-deck, especially on a late-WWII \u0022all-or-nothing\u0022 warship. At best, the WWII ship of a comparable tonnage will benefit from fewer elaborate systems that can catch fire - they had nowhere near the electrical generators and radar arrays, and could just hide the small engine rooms and magazines all the way below the waterline.
