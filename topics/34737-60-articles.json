Everyone was keeping it up to date themselves. then Sirkut received \u003Cstrong\u003Epermission\u003C/strong\u003E to make a part, Which forked to his IR plugin. the docking washers. This was a big help with lining up ships after docked. Well then He went and started making many parts for DR. Listening to request and suggestions of the community. Sirkut with the help of DEVO and ZodiusInfuser. And maybe some others i missed, created a very useful part combination. Which is now none as MSI. I hope this helps and ive given you the correct information. Sirkut can clear any details i missed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T02:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamned Robotics is dead.

Anyone who has made more then one craft with two different group lists will have noticed this, I\u0027m sure. Load one craft and organise the groups how you like, then create a new one and change the groups.
