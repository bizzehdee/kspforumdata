I love designing and building ships and vehicles, and this game provides one of the most fun ways to do it!\u00A0One of the updates I really like is the auto strut feature; it keeps the ships stable while also keeping them clean looking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese days I usually\u00A0play with mods, and I have recently been having a lot of fun with Infernal Robotics (IR). The other day, I was trying to build rovers with IR parts and suspensions (The stock wheel\u00A0suspensions cannot provide the up and down wheel travel that I would prefer). I noticed that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe wheel bases\u00A0being\u00A0locked on auto strut to heaviest part\u003C/strong\u003E seemed to make any IR parts connected to them in some way either unable to move or cause any IR part movement to twist the rover parts violently. This was frustrating and creatively inhibiting for me. I\u00A0found that other people were having issues with this, including the wheels\u0027\u00A0auto struts moving to (or failing to move from) different heaviest parts when docking/undocking craft, especially when using Kerbal Attachment System.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis basically illustrates\u00A0the problem that others and I are having:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/CarelessColorlessBeardeddragon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gfycat.com/CarelessColorlessBeardeddragon\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy primary question for Squad is, \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan auto strut locks on wheels and other parts be removed, letting us choose whether or not to auto strut the wheel bases?\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI like auto struts and don\u0027t think they should be removed. Perhaps the default could be to auto strut the wheels to heaviest part, but if advanced tweakables is selected the user can change it. I get that auto strutting the wheel bases to heaviest part keeps rovers from wiggling and exploding on undock when being carried in cargo bays, but is there a more elegant solution than locking the auto strut on the wheels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy secondary question is whether or not anyone has found a temporary workaround for\u00A0this?\u00A0I dabble in C\u00A0and Visual Studio but I am new at writing mods for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not have Kerbal Joint Reinforcement installed and I am using KSP 1.2.2.\u00A0I am using the latest IR build 2.0.10 from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases\u003C/a\u003E, and I have confirmed that the mod works properly when not using wheels. Here is what I have tried to do to temporarily get around this issue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I edited the \u0027autostrutMode\u0027 values for all the wheels in the craft file, turning it from \u0027ForceHeaviest\u0027 to \u0027Off\u0027. This had no effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I made the cubic octagonal struts weigh dozens of tons and attached them to the wheel bases with the hope they would auto strut to that part and not the rest of the craft. This did not work because of course the wheels could be auto strutting to only one of the several cubic octagonal struts on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I tried to add a new technology to the game and then change the \u0027autoStrutTechRequired\u0027 value in the physics configuration file. I thought that this might work for sandbox mode if a science career was started and then all but that tech was unlocked in the debug menu. I failed at this because I am not good at modding this game and could not even get the new tech added. I also don\u0027t know if auto strut is always on for the wheels even if it hasn\u0027t been unlocked by general construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. I tried the fix proposed by J.Random in this thread:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138647-turning-off-the-new-wheel-autostrutting/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138647-turning-off-the-new-wheel-autostrutting/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Putting his code into a cfg file in the GameData folder did not work for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. I tried a basic patch using code suggested by Shadowmage in this thread:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155572-are-forced-wheel-autostruts-temporary/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155572-are-forced-wheel-autostruts-temporary/\u003C/a\u003E.
