Now as I\u0027m in orbit I don\u0027t see that option, and I\u0027m not sure why, and I\u0027m worried I\u0027ll need to use some more destructive methods to get of the engines after landing. So, when does the option appear/disappear?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:54:30Z","Content":"It is meant for jettisoning the engine-shroud that normally goes with a previous decoupler anyway.

So you could put a heat shield over an engine and do a shielded, parachute/airbrake entry into the atmosphere followed by a powered retrorocket landing without a clunky stage decoupler involved."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T22:52:42Z","Content":"There\u0027s another post with more replies if you need it"}]}
