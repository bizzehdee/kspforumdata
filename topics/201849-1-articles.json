That said, it requires a fair bit of delta-vee to intercept and stop there, and haven\u0027t tried to see what a mission using solely chemical rockets would take, esp. given I overbuild my landers most times.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEve is \u003Cem\u003Ebeautiful\u003C/em\u003E though; with some very breathtaking views and a lovely purple color. However, you need a hell of a big ship to get off - when I finally got back to trying to crack it, I managed it with a 140 tonne lander. Again, I admittedly overbuilt it, and have studied others\u0027 designs and realize if you just want to \u0022get off Eve\u0022 you can go much lighter esp. if you give up on wanting the launch capsule to be able to navigate back to the mothership (i.e. have the mothership come to you instead), and launch from a high spot. But I wanted to make a craft that I could confidently say I could set down at any place, take off, and maneuver back to the return vessel, esp. given how tricky it is to plot an accurate landing when descending through atmosphere due to the aerobraking, and I built it with 8000 meters in the ascent stages and used a monoprop tank to do the rendezvous and docking maneuvers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-24T04:37:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2021 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by shimmy00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-25T03:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTook me a lot longer to answer.\u00A0 Went for Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a rover lover, Duna is one of the best planet/moon to operate on.\u00A0 It\u0027s relatively forgiving, and relatively mild for terrain height changes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClose contender was Mun, Laythe, Pol and Vall.\u00A0 Minmus is cool too, but it\u0027s up to a point where I\u0027m kinda sick of it, you know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you design a good solar boatplane (with sturdy/stable landing wheels for ground landing), Eve is one hell of a place too.\u00A0 Nothing like flying 100-300 meters above the surface at 50-70m/s and being able to land everywhere...
