I would not recommend flying it without mechjeb (which is on the vehicle) or a really gentle hand on a control stick. **NovaPunch** is required for this vehicle, as is the **Space Shuttle addon to C7**. Use the two pairs of low altitude engines for takeoff, and then switch to the high altitude engines. With mechjeb, recommended take off inclination is between 10 and 20 degrees.\n\nAny input would be appreciated.\n\n[http://www./?wkxj9t4ux2k2zd3](http://www./?wkxj9t4ux2k2zd3)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T11:58:11Z","Content":"Those crazy Nazis."},{"CreatedByName":"Jatizso","CreatedById":21720,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T13:18:24Z","Content":"They both still are nice planes, though."},{"CreatedByName":"sanderlebau","CreatedById":5577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T14:35:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Those crazy Nazis.\n\nYou think that\\\u0027s crazy?
