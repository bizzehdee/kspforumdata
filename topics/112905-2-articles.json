I did notice a very slight pause when I crossed over into space, no crash; it may be occurring in other game modes, but I have not been paying too much attention during launches (mind tends to drift from the repetitious nature of launches ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). When I circularized, it did crash my game. Same exact thing as you. I forgot that I am using the development DLL NathanKell provided, so the Mun bug fix didn\u0027t fix this issue. It\u0027s just weird that with my OPM/Trans-Keptunian support config, the crash occurs with the first orbit contract completion rather than the leave atmosphere contract that others are having. Other than that, sandbox and science modes are working just fine. The current Kopernicus version is having some issues handling the contracts/progress nodes with the scaled altitudes and such. If I had more hours in the day, I\u0027d take a stab at helping with the issue with a pull request.\n\nBTW: I\u0027m not using any career based mods such as Contract Configurator, only some mods that add science experiments."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T20:19:48Z","Content":"just a heads up, you included 2 versions of module manager in the download.

[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/KScale2.cfg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/KScale2.cfg)\n\nSince everything is 4 times bigger than in stock orbital velocities are twice as high. Max theoretical stage deltaV vs deltaV requirements is closer to real life. It\u0027s theoretically possible to single stage to orbit, but you wont be carrying any real payload.\n\nYou can use a two stage vehicle to throw payloads to Duna, but it will be very inefficient compared to a 3 stage vehicle.\n\nTo go to mun and back you will need a rocket about this big.\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/KSP%202015-06-26%2006-59-51-66.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/KSP%202015-06-26%2006-59-51-66.png)\n\nI dunno... Feels appropriate =P\n\nIt will be interesting to try career mode at this scale when the freezing bug has been fixed. Doing the minmus flyby on hard mode gives 100 000 funds so early game should still provide enough of return on investment. The cost will sort of spiral away for missions further out into the solar system. Kerbals may have to go on one way missions in order to keep the space program funded XP\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T05:27:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 05:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:49:15Z","Content":"If you wanted that scale, macollo, you could also find it premade in Eudae55\u0027s Kerbol 3.7 pack. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:17:41Z","Content":"Yeah I get crashes in Career anytime I leave the atmosphere.

First time I had no stutter on breaching the atmosphere, and circularized okay. I brought my AP up to Munar orbit, and crashed when I reached it (I may have crossed into the SOI, but I was time-warping and I couldn\u0027t tell if I made it there before it froze).\n\nSecond attempt I crashed on circularization, with the stutter on leaving atmo. \n\nI copied your config, saved it to a new KScale2.cfg, and deleted the old one before I moved it in, just in case. Are you starting a new career for each test, or using an ongoing one? I\u0027m pretty sure the issue has to do with reaching progress nodes."},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T01:47:22Z","Content":"Ahh, I was only testing to 70KM which was always when it crashed.
