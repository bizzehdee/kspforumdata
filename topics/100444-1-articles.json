I find that I overwork things very easily.\n\nMy YouTube name (check out my channel!) is Bagel Rabbit, and I designed my original logo as a rabbit with a bagel for its body, a l\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1 Nyan Cat. Just for the sake of this challenge, I decided to time my building of a Bagel Rabbit. \n\nMy time came out to 19:30 or so (I started the clock a few seconds before I actually started building). The rabbit itself has thirty-eight parts, measures 1.4x1.2x1.6m, and weighs a bit under 0.6 tons (it\u0027s *really* small). It can\u0027t really do anything, but it looks cool, and it took a lot of using the new Editor tools to make it work. I\u0027m especially proud of that accelerometer nose.\n\n![f6z4tqz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f6z4tqz.jpg)\n\nI find that building small stuff is a great way to find creative uses for parts in stock KSP.
