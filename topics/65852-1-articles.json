KSP stock aero has some problems, but the lift equations aren\u0027t based on craft mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift equation for Control Surfaces: sin(AoA)*pressure*speed*lift rating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift equation for Wings: sin(AoA)*(1-|sin(AoA)|)*cos(AoA)*pressure*speed*lift rating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the lift equations for wings and control surfaces is different. If you look at the math, there\u0027s a bug with the control surface equation in that the lift continues to increase all the way to 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock drag equation is a weighted sum of the drag coefficients. I don\u0027t have that equation off hand. However, because it\u0027s based on mass and drag coefficients, you can get away with creating craft that would be extremely draggy in the \u0022real world.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, FAR does some modification to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and fixes the drag model which helps if you want more \u0022realism\u0022. Although nothing stops you from making \u0022realistically\u0022 smooth aircraft in stock. I don\u0027t know how FAR effects the lift equations, but I\u0027m sure it modifies them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse FAR if you\u0027d like, use stock if you\u0027d like.
