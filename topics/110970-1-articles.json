There just happened to be a Mun in the sky when I did my tests of the Third Stage, so there it is.\n\nInitial engine tests went well, the stage produces an acceptable amount of Thrust, Burn Time, and Delta-V. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is also acceptable.\n\nSo I put a nosecone on top and figured I\u0027d see how well it could fly. Once it left the Launchpad, everything seemed to go wrong. What was supposed to be a simple design and testing process turned into a four-hour nightmare of modifications and more testing. I stuck with it, and by the end of the night I had finished my Payload tests and called it a night.\n\nWith the completion of the third stage, design and testing of the second stage now begins.\n\nAlso, a series of space probes will be launched to the Mun in order to practice the techniques used to land and return. The probes will bring back science payloads, ~~and function as navigation beacons on prospective landing sites~~.\n\nI have also scheduled a crewed orbital flight around the Mun using my existing \u0027Project Eve\u0027 rocket. This will bring back more science, and allow the engineers to collect data on the resource requirements for our new capsule design.\n\nI do have two satellite contracts, one for Kerbin, and one for the Mun. The only problem is I haven\u0027t unlocked the Mk1-2 Command Pod. I\u0027ve got some free time today, so I\u0027m going to go collect more science.\n\nI think I\u0027ll hold off on the contracts until I can build a Pegasus analog, thanks for the suggestion Greg.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T14:50:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nRemove Sig, Adjusting Posts for Workability, Fixing Links"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:24:49Z","Content":"**S-1b Flight Test with \u0027Project Explorer\u0027 Probe**\n\nPart of my KSP play yesterday was using the new S-1b Third Stage to launch my existing \u0027Project Explorer\u0027 Extended Range probe for a mission to Minmus.\n\nDespite a rocky ride, everything performed within tolerances, more tweaks will be made to the S-1b design.\n\n\u003Cu\u003EOnce again, if you\u0027re not interested in design and testing, skip the video\u003C/u\u003E.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zwprz9MndI4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T13:31:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nRemove Sig, add Title and Format."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T04:19:43Z","Content":"**S-1b Flight Test with Dummy Payload**\n\nThe S-1b Rocket has passed all of it\u0027s flight tests, and is now Space-Rated.\n\nA single probe to Minmus unlocked two tech nodes needed to build a prototype CSM.

As it sat on the Launchpad, I was lovestruck for a moment. This rocket had a difficult development, was expensive compared to my earlier rockets, and suffered from flight control problems that were never completely solved.\n\nIn other words, *it\u0027s not perfect*.\n\nBut then, you take a moment to look at it:\n\nAnd there\u0027s the thing, because it just sort of *is*.\n\nThe design philosophy of the real Saturn 1b Rocket is mirrored in my own S-1b Rocket:\n\nThe engineering staff at the Kerbal Space Program were faced with a difficult task: How do you lift a heavy payload using only the 1.25 meter parts that are available?\n\nThe answer was simple, and brilliant. They started with a 2.5 meter decoupler, mounted above a short 2.5 meter to 1.25 meter adapter plate. Below the adapter, was installed a core stage of 2 FLT-800\u0027s and one FLT-400. Eight other stages were clustered around this core stage.\n\nSix \u0027Reliant\u0027 and two \u0027Swivel\u0027 engines completed the bottom stage. At the time, the engineers had never tried clustered engines before. The power of the engine cluster came as a shock. In one single engine test, the S-1b proved itself to be the \u003Cu\u003Emost powerful rocket we had ever designed\u003C/u\u003E.\n\nThe design of the whole rocket had been long and torturous, from the powerful bottom stage, the high-performance middle stage, and the CSM payload on top. Even after everything had been finished, pilots reported difficulty making the rocket perform maneuvers at high speeds.\n\nBut on this final day Jebke, Jeb, and Valentina were standing out by the launch pad, looking up at the rocket.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s really very pretty, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 Valentina asked.\n\n\u0022Yeah. I\u0027m not in it, and I\u0027m not flying yet, but I\u0027m still enjoying it,\u0022 Jebke replied.\n\nJebediah, grinning like a lunatic added, \u0022It\u0027s not a bad way to burn 75,000 SpaceBucks!\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, let\u0027s go.

He then \u003Cu\u003Eplotted and flew a rendezvous with \u003Cstrong\u003EPM-2\u003C/strong\u003E, and docked with it\u003C/u\u003E. This is the first time the CSM and MLM have been operated in combination. A crew and Science transfer was done with a short EVA activity.\n\nThen, Rodald Kerman undocked the MLM and gave it a test flight. It performed a retrofire burn until it\u0027s periapsis was lowered to ground level. Then, the upper stage was decoupled, and flown back to the CSM. Jebke performed a \u003Cu\u003Esecond docking maneuver\u003C/u\u003E with the MLM.\n\nRodald transferred to the CSM, and all available fuel, monopropellant, and electric charge was transferred as well.\n\nA short retrofire ensured the MLM would re-enter the atmosphere after it was ditched.\n\nThe KSP Administrator had expressed a desire to test the MLM\u0027s re-entry capability as a \u003Cu\u003Ebackup safety procedure\u003C/u\u003E. The MLM\u0027s re-entry was monitored, and surprisingly, it survived re-entry intact all the way to impact. ~~Future versions of the MLM will be equipped with parachutes as a backup safety measure for crew recovery~~.\n\nOnce the MLM testing was completed, the CSM fired it\u0027s engine to \u003Cu\u003Eraise it\u0027s apoapsis\u003C/u\u003E to Munar orbit. This would be a live test of a CSM Munar Return. During re-entry, the CSM performed an \u003Cu\u003Eaerobraking\u003C/u\u003E maneuver, followed by an RCS retrofire. This allowed the CSM to reduce it\u0027s velocity to \u003Cu\u003Enormal orbital speed\u003C/u\u003E before re-entering a second time.\n\nThis procedure will become standard for all Munar returns.\n\nWhile making their triumphant return, Jebke, Rodald, and Thombart were almost *killed* when their capsule landed in a mountainous area. If the capsule hadn\u0027t made it to a valley, parachute deployment would not have been able to stop them \u003Cu\u003Ecrashing into the ground\u003C/u\u003E.\n\nThe problem of aiming for a specific landing site during a Munar Return remains to be solved...\n\n\u003Cu\u003EThis video shows the complete highlight reel from PM - 2/3 including the near-fatal landing incident\u003C/u\u003E.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/nm6cQsMF5dc?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWith the completion of this mission, the Kerbal Space Program now has all the knowledge, and hardware needed to make an attempt at landing on the Mun.\n\nThe next stage of Project Mun has begun...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nLaunching **PM - 3**, flying the combined **PM - 2/3** Mission, cleaning up the VAB, and preparing for the initial test flights of my S-5 Rocket made for a very busy weekend.

Considered to be a \u0022drooling lunatic\u0022 by Gene Kerman, Jebediah had previously been removed from flight status twice.\n\n- The first time for stealing a rocket, and giving an unauthorized joyride to a bewildered bystander. The fact he successfully recovered the Science data from Surveyor 3 at the same time was glossed over in the official report.\n- The second time was for violating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E airspace at supersonic velocities, and performing an unauthorized low pass over the Mission Control Center. The flying stunts were bad enough, but the fact he nearly killed Thombart Kerman on his first day in the space program was unforgivable.\n\nGene Kerman was heard to remark, \u0022Jeb, you are removed from flight status for the rest of your life.\u0022 So the fact Jebediah is flying today is seen as a mystery. Rumor has it, Mortimer Kerman had something to do with it.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vDlPvgBtxKA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nApparently Jebediah was determined to make what could possibly be his last flight the greatest one he has ever flown. Rodald put the spacecraft on a free-return trajectory, Thombart plotted the Munar Orbit and Landing Site, and Jebediah landed the Munar Landing Module within 500 meters of the targeted site.\n\nJeb and Thombart, posing for a photograph on the Mun.\n\nJeb is seen here standing on the planned landing spot.\n\nMany interesting Science experiments were conducted, and much Science Data would be returned.\n\nHowever, one discovery would continue to fascinate scientists back on Kerbin:\n\nApparently these large objects are to be called \u0022rocks\u0022, and while there don\u0027t seem to be any of them on Kerbin, they are abundant on the Mun. Future missions will attempt to establish the value of these \u0022rocks\u0022 and try to discover where they come from.\n\nTo cap off a successful mission, **PM - 8** splashed down in the ocean East of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is the most accurate Kerbin return from the Mun yet.\n\n**PM - 8** was successful, every objective was completed. **PM - 9** is now scheduled to launch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T14:52:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nReformat, Edit"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T18:08:25Z","Content":"**PM - 9 Munar Landing**\n\nI know it\u0027s been a while since my last update, and I apologize.\n\nYou can blame the BD Armory mod for sucking up all of my KSP play time ![:wink:](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3WvdA7c194?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**PM - 9** nearly had a disaster on landing, but Valentina saved it with some piloting skills.\n\nOther than that, the mission was uneventful, and everyone returned safely.\n\nThe real news is the change in the upcoming **PM - 10** mission:\n\nA fuel-cell powered Munar Rover has been developed, despite the extremely difficult design and testing process, it is hoped this vehicle will allow our Kerbonauts to collect Science from Midlands and Highlands Craters.\n\nThe rover deployment mechanism is very unreliable, but regardless, the **PM - 10** Mission has a launch date.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T14:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nReformat"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T09:45:17Z","Content":"**PM - 10 Landing and Rover Mission**\n\n**PM - 10**, the first of the new series of Mun missions has landed. This mission pushes the lifting and navigational capability of the S-5 Rocket and Munar Lander. The new Munar Rover is radially mounted to the Munar Lander, and to counterbalance the rover, a new Munar Landing Module Science Experiment Package has been designed and fitted.\n\nThis mission therefore had to do double duty as both a Munar Landing, and a flight test.\n\nThankfully, everything worked out well.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cT-f2JEtuEI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAfter the successful landing of **PM - 10** on the Munar Midlands, the primary objective of the mission was undertaken:\n\nDrive the new Munar Rover approximately 30 Kilometers, and collect a full set of Science Experiments from the Midlands Crater.\n\nThe mission had gotten off to a good start, with Jebke having made a pinpoint landing directly on the targeted landing site. The first stage of the mission would test the range of the Munar Rover on one half of it\u0027s ElectricCharge capacity.\n\nAfter driving 12 Km to the boundary of several craters, the EC use was noted for the engineers. Jebediah radioed down from the CSM to pass on orders from Gene at Mission Control: \u003Cu\u003Eforget the range test and go get the Science\u003C/u\u003E. Jebke turned on the integrated Fuel Cell, and put the extra power to use.\n\nThe drive was fairly treacherous, and things were livened up a bit when Jebke rolled the rover. After sliding downhill about 50 meters it landed on the rear of the Science Package. Jebke managed to get the rover pushed back up with the landing leg, and more caution was taken for the rest of the trip.\n\nAfter a careful descent into the crater, Jebke and Thombart gave the Science Package a workout, collecting every type of Science available.\n\nAfter collecting the Science, Thombart left a flag behind to commemorate a mission well done.\n\nNow that the mission is complete all there is to do is return home. Wernher von Kerman\u0027s team of Scientists are eagerly awaiting the Science return from this mission.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8opWaDHEFOw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T14:53:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nReformat"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T14:53:53Z","Content":"**PM - 11 Landing with a Manual Suicide Burn**\n\nAs **PM - 11** orbited the Mun I realized my original planned landing site was in total darkness.
