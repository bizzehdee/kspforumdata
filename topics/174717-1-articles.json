I used the command prompt to start the game, all manual like. Been playing for over an hour now, no problems, so I\u0027m convinced this solved the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust in case anyone shares this problem, the inability to start the game in OpenGL mode, I will add a short description as the right answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo see whether your problem resembles mine, I will leave here the whole odyssey. Starting the game in OpenGL mode was pretty much the first thing I had tried, but not knowing how to build a command into a shortcut, I had done what I had thought a description elsewhere on this message board had described. I may have gotten that wrong, though the command that had been suggested there was not quite correct, it appears, either.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless. If anyone loveed up, it was almost certainly me. Clumsy is a state of mind.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a previous episode:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nProblem: in the last few days, the game has started crashing for no apparent reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOver the past few days, I got system freezing up or BSOD a few times. I thought updating windows and graphics drivers had remedied that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that game just keeps on crashing. Even when it\u0027s just running in the background, after the prolonged startup my large number of mods require. Crash, while I do nothing to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I couldn\u0027t find anything the crashes appeared to have in common.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs it happened without my input, I thought \u0022Maybe it\u0027s the Autosave!\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo test this out, I went into settings.cfg and changed the long and the short intervall, by hanging many, many zeroes at the end of either. I found the game translated the entry in the settings.cfg into 3E\u002B23 after startup.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI got to play around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for about five to ten minutes. Crash.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found in the log file that Janitor\u0027s Closet was throwing many NullReference errors. So I took it out. Game still crashed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve piled the log file, the crash dump, and all the .cfg files and such that lurk in the game directory into a zip file, hence: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-7VGvOb9sC5uLvza72vwtRP2099HV0z9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1-7VGvOb9sC5uLvza72vwtRP2099HV0z9\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve also copied the addon list AVC provides me, it is hence: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HofhzlRRj6SN_R1pHhk_yrH5BlS4EgxN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1HofhzlRRj6SN_R1pHhk_yrH5BlS4EgxN\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: This list is from before I removed Janitor\u0027s Closet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile typing this, I started up the game once more, and it crashed again. This time, at the exact moment that I tried placing the base of a strut. Assemblage of log files zipped up hence: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WlP3SKnRzwoU-0gPYF4MwOT3AbgVtLjh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1WlP3SKnRzwoU-0gPYF4MwOT3AbgVtLjh\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I thought \u0022It\u0027s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I started up the game, told QuickStart to take me to the Space Center. It finished loading and I busied myself with something else, waiting for it to crash or not. No crash message had appeared after what felt like 20 minutes, and I thought \u0022yay!\u0022. Then I tried moving the mouse, and the cursor was stuck. Whole system frozen up. Couldn\u0027t even get to the CTRL\u002BALT\u002BDel screen, that old combo did zilch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo Crash Dump, obviously (I compared the folder names to earlier dumps I had already zipped up).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe output_log, though, is here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zWIf2XmRDjPNecw6oqHN1XqfY6oJ50Al\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1zWIf2XmRDjPNecw6oqHN1XqfY6oJ50Al\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would greatly appreciate any help in figuring this out. I suspect it\u0027s a mod. Actually, I\u0027m fairly sure it\u0027s a mod. But as my wits weren\u0027t great in this to begin with, I\u0027ve gone past their end a while ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m presently mostly stuck at home, being chronically ill.
