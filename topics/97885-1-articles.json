A final decision is expected sometime in summer, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Commercial crew vehicles will aim for the fast rendezvous trajectory from the get-go. Of course, that only leaves a single one-second launch window every couple weeks... hopefully \u003Cem\u003Ecertain providers\u003C/em\u003E will be able to finally get a handle on their constant rolling launch delays by then... *eyes you-know-who*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Administrator Bolden confirmed that they\u0027re going for mixed crews. That is, NASA astronauts will continue to fly on Soyuz even after 2017, while in return, Russian cosmonauts will ride on US crew vehicles. I\u0027ve long suspected this to be the case since it\u0027s the only thing that\u0027s sensible for the crew layover. You can\u0027t just have all members of one side head home for a week or more until the next crew arrives, and leave a whole half of the ISS without a native language maintainer for the duration. They\u0027ll continue to leave a mixed crew up there just like they do now, and as a result, they must be flying mixed crews on all trips with all vehicles. It was not explicitly stated but I assume that the partners will trade seats one-for-one. Bolden said he doesn\u0027t want to \u0022write Russia any more cheques\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They actually dared making a statement about the thing everyone was curious about: per-seat pricing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you, they underlined that the whole concept of \u0022per-seat pricing\u0022 is a bit bogus in the first place, since seats don\u0027t fly into space; in reality, they have per-mission costs (even now with Russia). However, since people so desperately wanted to know, they calculated a derived per-seat cost based on estimates, using the following criteria: 1.) averaged across five years of regular mission service; 2.) averaged across flights using both competitors; 3.) calculated for 4 crewmembers per mission; 4.) while also flying cargo in some of the remaining vehicle space as per the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder these assumptions, NASA expects that in the end they will pay about $58 million per seat on average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot too shabby, considering NASA is buying a brand new vehicle (and booster) for each flight. This leaves both Boeing and SpaceX with a stockpile of once-flown but reusable spacecraft that they retain ownership of and can use for other purposes (and SpaceX will probably be landing all the F9 first stages for reusability by then as well). So not only is NASA lowering the price by a decent amount while at the same time creating double redundancy for ISS crew transport vehicles (no more finger-crossing that Soyuz doesn\u0027t get grounded)... but they\u0027re also giving the whole commercial crew business outside of NASA a kickstart by lowering the price of entry since the spacecraft are already built. I\u0027d say NASA is rightfully pleased, this looks to be on the right track to becoming a very successful program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T21:54:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
