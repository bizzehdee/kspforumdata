The water conditions that can be done on this game are amazing. It would be so awesome if Squad would team up with this company VSTEP to enhance the water in KSP. It would bring this game to new levels of excitement, I know these things are not easy and are a lot of work to make happen but just wanted to throw this out there before the game development ends without this opportunity. It\u0027s a big wish and maybe if enough of us push it could happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T05:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that KSP is mostly a space sim and not a ship sim, I wonder how much it is worth doing it. I mean it might be helpful for those splashdown, but that is about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it should be left for mods, creating oceanic planets and floating structures can already be done with mods. Another step for those who play with those mods would be to have another mod that improve water condition. For those that spend most of their time flying and travelling through space though, I don\u0027t see the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: apparently I thought this was in development and suggestion.

So enhancing the mediums for exploration would be good. The space part is mostly travel. The exploration bit begins when you arrive at a destination. Robot subs, surface rovers, aerial drones, Kerbals wandering around, probe landers, camera surveys... All these things should be potentially available. So, having a space to air interface, an air to ground interface and a ground to water interface all makes sense as content expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
