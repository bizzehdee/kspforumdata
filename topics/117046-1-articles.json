The ablative will bake off two days before PeA.\n\n-No matter how small, do NOT put any solar panels out into the light. PERIOD. Run on an RTG, some scary huge batteries, or fuel cells for the fryby.\n\n-The conformal, passive radiators are not very effective at all. Use the deployable ones if at all practical, or wait until Nertea\u0027s Heat Control Pack is back up to speed.\n\n-Shadow shields are a MUST. If someone ever creates a reflective one that bounces the heat off before it absorbs it, that\u0027d be the ticket.\n\n-Structural stuff is gonna get glowy down below 350000 kilometers. Plan accordingly.\n\n-I strongly advise a MINIMUM maximum temperature rating of 2500 Kelvin for ALL parts.\n\n-Whatever you use as the shadow shield needs a maximum temperature of 3000 Kelvin, and should have a radiator attached directly to it. (BTW, this rules out the stock 2.5 and 3.75 meter heat shields.)"}]}
