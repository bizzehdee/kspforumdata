My goal was to try and get into orbit then open the cargo doors and have the probe released. Once i got into orbit and opened the doors, activated the radial decouplers nothing happened. The probe was just sitting in the doors and it wasn\u0027t even attached to anything. i tried wiggling the ship around but nothing happened still. If Anyone has any idea on how to fix this it would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots~\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prntscr.com/fl68xe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://prntscr.com/fl68xe\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prntscr.com/fl691w\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://prntscr.com/fl691w\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prntscr.com/fl697k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://prntscr.com/fl697k\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prntscr.com/fl69eq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://prntscr.com/fl69eq\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-18T13:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere were the decouplers attached anyway?
