I have followed all advice I\u0027ve found out there. Changed the file structure and added the PART{} wrapping to the config file. I have even downloaded a couple of working mods and compared my own to them. Everything seems to be exactly as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loading log in game tells me it cannot compile the folder because the model does not exist. It is there though, and referenced in the config file just as other mods and stock parts do. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model.mu file is the same it was before 0.20 came along.
