Unfortunately, the VAB and SPH still take long to load, and I presume this is because they don\u0027t use the same terrain as in-flight and the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, I propose that, for 0.22, the VAB and SPH internal scenery exists within the flight scenery just as the space center now does in 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
