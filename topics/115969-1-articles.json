It weighs 200 tons, and uses a fairing shaped like a disc as a heat-sheild, (as well as an actual heat shield for the fairing base.). It explodes almost every time, no matter how I aim my re-entry, so here is my question: Do fairings shield things behind them, or just stuff inside them? \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI feel that the game needs a procedural heat shield, or at least something that can be used instead of many separate shields clipped together.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for all the help in advance,\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:4px;\u0022\u003EMajor999\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:4px;\u0022\u003EPS: How do all of you guys do Eve entries?\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cebi","CreatedById":138242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry to reduce speed before you hit atmosfere by burning your engines.
