This is depressing, this mod adds so much in the terms of having reason and history in my space program. I\u0027ve had this occur in numerous saves now, and its never at the same time. Sometimes its after just a few days sometimes its after a year or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, somewhere, somehow when finishing a mission it does not record, it seems like it records the start but not the end...because I\u0027ve noticed that once it starts to happen every time you recover a Kerbal it awards him the same ribbons each time as he earned from his last mission before it started acting up. The Kerbal is available after the mission however which is confusing but the fact nothing new is recorded and he gets awarded the same ribbons in the summery after every mission makes it seem like the end of a mission is not being recorded properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking into this myself for the time being but I\u0027m no modder lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cfds","CreatedById":82109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T15:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started the game after a few weeks and all teh ribbons of my kerbals have vanished.
