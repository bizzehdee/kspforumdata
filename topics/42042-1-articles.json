By the time I finished playing several hours later I had safely launched and returned an orbital mission (woot!) AND gotten the stock space station into a stable 130k orbit! After many attempts, I finally got the perfect launch and burn and stuck it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E Trying to get a retriever put together to make the runs up to the station now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m onboard. I found the tutorials wonderfully helpful, and the UI intuitive. The flight logs let me know exactly what went wrong, so I was able to learn from each failure. This game has the best of challenge without making me frustrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to seeing this game flourish.

Don\u0027t be afraid to ask if you get stuck and can\u0027t find the answer on your own given the availability of tutorials and post. Most of all, enjoy your new addiction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T21:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow. You are off to a good start. I think I must\u0027ve played 10 or 20 hours before I managed a stable orbit, much less a station up!
