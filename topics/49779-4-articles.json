I think when RT was locking control state (because it thought I was under Kerbin\u0027s new surface, heh), that did something to physics. But I agree about needing stronger joints.\u003Cp\u003EAny idea how? breakingForce doesn\u0027t really do it, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt that. It was likely coincidence. Restarting the game is what did it and it will happen again because it\u0027s intermittent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T15:57:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
