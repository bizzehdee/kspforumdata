I had to send the station up empty to get under the weight limit... but I did fill it with all my tourists. Three descent pods and a normal capacity of five kerbals, 250 monoprop and an X200-32 should be a reasonable early station. After, a contract for putting up a five-man station appeared, but it needed more fuel, and I\u0027d just put one up, so I didn\u0027t take it. Speaking of fuel, I sent up a fueler to top up the station. It\u0027ll be a while before it docks, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fueler just barely squeaks under the 140t limit, and launches a little oddly. First, the seven Swivels at the bottom fire, along with the six 80%-filled Fleas affixed below the drop tanks. Once the Fleas run out, or are about to, the Hammers at the top fire, to pull the rocket to a speed and altitude that it can keep with liquid fuel alone. The Hammers decouple, then the drop tanks run out and drop next. The seven Swivels all run out of fuel at the same time as each other, so the five-Swivel asparagus stage kicks in then, but doesn\u0027t quite get the fueler to orbit. So, it burns from the transport tank a little. Fortunately, with the fuel leftover from the ascent of the station, there should be enough to fill it and deorbit the fueler. The service bay contains RCS tanks and a parachute for the pilot\u0027s descent and the docking procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ZS6aB3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZS6aB3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/gX2YhD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gX2YhD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had a launch site test for the Spark, so I tweaked one of the ones on these two landers to disable its thrust, and fired it with the launch stage.

Since the introduction of career and science modes, I have always felt there was something missing in regards to this. Back in .90, I did my typical thing of starting my sandbox and career games back at the beginning. Being restricted to just two contracts active at a time, I believe I selected one that dealt with testing a decoupler and one testing a parachute at a certain altitude and speed. I chose not to take the achieve orbit contract for some reason... So...to make a long story short, I decided the best way to do the tasks in one mission was to do a simple once-around-Kerbin orbit at 68K. The mission was successful and I did get credit for the decoupler test AND the chute test. When I went back to select the contract calling for a Kerbin orbit, it was gone and with it was the opportunity for more prestige and science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would change would be that such a mission outcome would generate \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E rewards for achieving the milestones required of contracts not selected. Not necessarily the funding aspects since the contract was never activated, but maybe a portion of the science and the prestige. Let\u0027s face it; although Apollo 13 never completed its contractual goals of landing on the Lunar surface, collecting samples, setting up experiments, and testing new equipment, it did generate a lot of benefits for both the crew of the mission and NASA: 1) it created interest in the space program at a time when lunar missions had become boring to the general public, 2) it caused NASA and the Apollo 13 crew to use equipment and materials on board outside of their designed parameters, 3) Allowed NASA to develop protocols to deal with similar mission failures in future Apollo missions, and 4) challenged the manufacturers of space components, vehicles, and related materials to become more focused on quality control (NASA chose to ignore these protocols established by the aerospace industry and it led to the destruction of STS Challenger). All in all, a huge payoff for a mission that did not go as planned. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably the wrong place to post this, but after reading your mission outcome, it just came bubbling out... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
