Or hell, just pick another number and stick with it. Or don\u0027t pick any number - 3.5km/s isn\u0027t \u0027cheating\u0027, it\u0027s what happens when the air acts like air rather than soup. Have X.Xm/s as the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to orbit and concentrate on making sure the engines are balanced against each other than against an arbitrary 4.4km/s. Not only because it\u0027s easier, but it means vaccum operations isn\u0027t as affected. Whatever the final \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to orbit is can and will change and is irrelevant. What matters is that no engine is OP or useless and making sure that they meet that arbitrary 4.4km/s value means you\u0027re going to end up with unrealistically nerfed engines because the scale isn\u0027t right (see first sentence).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFUN\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NFUN\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs the old requirement of 4.5k Dv to orbit was deemed acceptable and balanced, it would make the most sense to keep the challenge of reaching orbit the same.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how getting an extra 1km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV is harder - it\u0027s easily achieved by linking side boosters to the core, for example. Asparagus staging, onion staging, whatever. It\u0027s just a case of adding more fuel and putting an engine powerful enough to lift that extra fuel effectively. It\u0027s not difficult by any means. Granted, it might be for a new person, but you can blame that on the lack of rocket info (dV, TWR etc). Reaching orbit with a more realistic atmosphere will be harder anyway (no more \u002745 at 10k\u0027 or asparagus pancakes, for example) so having new players have to cope with realistic actual gravity turns rather than pitch programs while STILL requiring 4.4km/s.. well, let\u0027s just keep in mind Squad made 50% throttle the default \u0022to help newbies, you know?\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T22:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I the only one who wouldn\u0027t mind an atmospheric across the board buff to everything?
