So how do you slow your decent with a rover? Well you don\u0027t unless you intend on making a massive rover. What you should do, is either place it on a lander(if it\u0027s a Kerbal driven rover) or use a skycrane. Essentially, a skycrane is a vessel that moves objects in low gravity. They\u0027re usually built with a docking port or decoupler on the bottom of the craft to hold the object, and have struts to hold the thrusters just far enough to keep from damaging the object it\u0027s carrying. Feel free to look up skycranes, they\u0027re commonly used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once you have your skycrane and rover on a rocket that can take you to the Mun, you go through your usual deal to reach Munar orbit, then release the rover and skycrane to make an de-orbit burn(Simply burn retrograde until your path leads toward the Mun). if you plan on landing the skycrane, gradually decrease your velocity as you get closer by burning retrograde. I personally strive for a safe landing speed of under 10 m/s but I think you\u0027ll be able to get away with slightly higher speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t plan on landing the skycrane, do the same deal, but HOVER just above your landing point before releasing your rover. This is trickier to do, as being too low could result in you running your exhaust over the Rover and being too high can cause it to break on landing. The plus side is that it\u0027s easier to build a skycrane that doesn\u0027t land with it\u0027s payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t trust the altimeter to be 100% accurate because that measures your distance from sea level or in this case(if I\u0027m correct) the Mun\u0027s lowest point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck on your Mun landing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T17:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf rocket is exploding when you jettison stages because they crash into it - add seperatrons to ensure they fly away and not into your rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf engines are exploding mid-flight when nothing hit them - they\u0027re overheating, throttle down and watch their temperature bars\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf rocket explodes suddenly in flight for no reason - you\u0027re accelerating way too fast, either throttle down or add struts to reinforce the structure as parts start falling off and crashing into other parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf lander keeps crashing into the Mun - kill your vertical velocity, basically burn retrograde until your retrograde marker (the crossed out circle) on the nav ball is pointing up at 90 degrees relative to the ground.

As nice as it might seem to have a rover with everything built into it already, anything that adds extra weight requires you to add about ten times as much weight in fuel. For instance, in the first post you mention \u0022Kethane scans\u0022 for your rover. This is a mistake; what\u0027s the point of a kethane scanner on the ground, where it can only examine one location at a time? Put it on a satellite in a low orbit, instead, and use 100x time acceleration to do a rough scan of the entire surface in a few dozen orbits. (The only time you should put a K-scanner on a ground vehicle is if that vehicle will be mining the Kethane as well.) That saves you a little weight. Or, like I said, add more fuel, which is the answer to a lot of things in KSP. This also assumes you actually have enough engine power on the descent stage to land safely (a local TWR of at least two or three, minimum), but without seeing your design we can\u0027t make suggestions on that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there\u0027s a question of efficiency on your orbit. The Apollo program did its landings in the safe-but-inefficient way: thrust sideways to kill almost all horizontal velocity, and then drop straight down before thrusting vertically to kill your descent speed. This is also the easiest way to do things in KSP, especially if you\u0027re trying for a specific landing site, but it\u0027s not the most efficient; thrusting retrograde as you go down to kill both velocities at once takes less fuel, it\u0027s just a lot harder to land on a specific location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond this, you need to build your designs more sturdily. It\u0027s one thing to say that a couple parts fell off on impact, but \u0022exploding\u0022 means you either hit the ground REALLY hard (i.e., not even close to a safe speed) or your design fell apart from the shock (in which case you need more struts).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there\u0027s a question of efficiency on your orbit.

My general rule of thumb is to circularize at 10KM after transferring from Kerbin orbit, then adjust to a 5KM periapsis over my target landing site, and do the landing burn once I hit said periapsis (which gives me some extra vertical time when landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If what you need is advice on how much fuel you\u0027re going to need, the answer there is \u0022it depends on how much you\u0027re taking with you\u0022.
