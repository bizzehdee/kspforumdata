First time poster so hope I\u0027m posting in the correct forum. Anyhow, I started playing with kethane, but after landing this central tank and 4 little miners I can\u0027t seem to get them working. I can mine kethane, store it, convert it to monopropellant, and transfer to central tank. That cannot, however be done for liquid fuel/oxidizer. What did I do wrong? By playing with pipe connectors I could create liquid fuel and store in the tiny miner fuel tank, but it had to be manually transferred to the central tank, which was a pain...I cannot seem to get image to work but maybe this imgur link works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/BiD3EKu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/BiD3EKu\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderB","CreatedById":17544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T19:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kethane converter works as a reverse engine, so just like regular engines, they need to be on the same stack as the fuel they\u0027re using (making, in this case) in order to acces the tank. in other words, you need to provide a fuel tank (and/or fuel lines to a fuel tank) for the stack that the converter is in. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonopropellant (and xenon gas) isn\u0027t bound by stacks and fuel lines, so it is automatically put in any of the availible tanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T19:23:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlexanderB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T19:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@MinerKerb: That is unfortunatelly how Kethane works at the moment. It will only put fuel / oxidiser in the tank connected \u003Cem\u003Edirectly\u003C/em\u003E to the converter unit. All else has to be arranged like you did, with KAS fuel pipes or alternatives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe you can use the stock fuel lines as well but point them in reverse - arrows on the lines pointing \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E the fuel tank connected to the converter. Since like Alexander pointed out the converter acts as a reverse engine you should end up with fuel being spread out to the tanks that are further out. However I haven\u0027t tried that myself - since Kethane mining takes a bit of time anyway I don\u0027t mind alt-clicking on tanks to distribute the fuel manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinerKerb","CreatedById":107398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T20:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
