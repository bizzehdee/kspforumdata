That\u0027s mammoth, sabertooth tigers, megasloths, giant elks, mastodons and so on. On the surface it seems that at the time of the massive Younger Dryas climate weirdness (\u002B10 to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C in average temperature, ocean level rising by 400 feet / 160 meters) humans went very mobile, migrated all over the place, and shortly thereafter those species went extinct. Naturally one would tie the two together, an explanation that is likely simple, clear and wrong (there\u0027s a lot of details that do not fit, like how the Clovis people in the south-east of north america could have extinguished mammoths on the west coast in a mere 300 years, all without leaving a single killing site, even though they never lived there). Correlation not being causation, maybe instead there was a common cause for both: we know from previous mass extinctions (Cretaceous-Paleocene, Jurassic-Trias) that when something REAL BAD happens, it is mainly the big animals that suffer while the most adaptable species can manage to thrive from the destruction. And I also know from anthropology (another hobby of mine) that primitive hunter-gatherer just do NOT extinguish species through hunting - because it\u0027s way too damn hard work and all of them always underuse natural resources around them, by a far margin. My point is, it is a lot more likely that the same thing that forced humans to migrate and invent new technology and use any edge they could, also did in the big game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and, just like with the K-T event, the YD is too geologically marked with a prominently visible, thin black layer of stuff with unusual isotopical properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point if you are thinking \u0022Impact\u0022 you are correct and should give yourself a cookie \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hypothesis of a massive impact causing the YD extinction was first carefully formulated in 2007.

If the YD bolid was big enough (and it seems it was) it would have vaporized ice, from itself and from the miles of ice sheet it landed on (leaving no proper crater), in the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, maybe even in a suborbital arc. The spray could very well have flash-frozen mammoths standing, from thousands of miles away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow cool is that ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd \u003Ca href=\u0022http://faculty.nps.edu/mjjaye/docs/Esri%20Jaye%20Presentation%2015July2014%20Submerged%20Canyon%20Formation%20A%20Novel%20Explanation.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere is a final nugget to chew on\u003C/a\u003E, although this one is stretching it thin: make the progenitor comet 2500 kms wide, and it would have held enough water to rise the oceans 2 whole miles.
