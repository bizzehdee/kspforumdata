For example, the hitchhiker, when someone goes to make it from MFT-1 to MFT-2, it will just look like two hitchhikers welded together.  \n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Proton main engines, or at least a mount that will put the six engines like the Proton, I.E. protruding past the internal tank.  \n\u003E \n\u003E 4) Modular/Resizable rcs thrusters with the ability to make ports appear on any side of the rcs  \n\u003E \n\u003E 5) Modular Parachutes? Like the ability to make one to five parachutes deploy from one canister, also, to change the shape of the parachute. The stock models are fine, but I would like something like the Ares/Orion parachutes, the red white and blue ones.  \n\u003E \n\u003E 6) Stock engine mounts with modularity.

JoseEduardo suggested that I add a ProbeCore/avionics functionality to a clone of the procedural decoupler... which I consider to be an acceptable compromise.  So, you may see these in a release in the near future.  Note, it will -not- come with any EC storage or reaction wheels; it will simply be a pure avionics part (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E level 2/3/whatever the max is).

What purpose does it fill that the existing engines cannot?  If it is just for \u0027recreation\u0027 purposes... well... see below...\n\n4.)  I already have fuel tanks with integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E; the MUS tanks, which stands for Modular Upper Stage, and are intended for exactly those uses -- as second / third stage tanks with integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and integrated probe cores (#1).  Otherwise, no, I will be not add \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to the main fuel tanks.  What is so special about what you are trying to do that it cannot be done with the existing fuel tanks and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks?  However, please keep in mind that this mod does not exist for \u0027recreation\u0027 purposes; if you want historically accurate recreation rockets, you should probably look elsewhere ([FASA](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22888-105-fasa-544/) is a good place to start, [BDB](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-112-bluedog-design-bureau-massive-stockalike-parts-pack-v0106-mice-may2716/) also does a few in a bit more of a kerbal style). \n\n5.)  What part of stage recovery needs new parachutes?  I must be missing something, or playing wrong... but stock parachutes always worked fine for me.  Additionally, StageRecovery (the mod) -**cannot**- use SSTU parachutes (as it only checks for the stock parachute module and derives drag from drag cubes; my parachutes use neither the stock module nor drag cubes), so even if I did make the parts, they would be useless for StageRecovery purposes.
