I am now doing a lot of attempts, to scout out some decent islands for landing. Then I can perhaps pick one, and learn how to do a precision landing from orbit, by parachute. The lander comes with a little extra liquid fuel, and some backwards facing air intakes on my outermost tanks, so I can use my Rapiers (airbreathing) while descending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier today I managed a landing on a 10 degree slope with only 0.4 m/s sliding, which eventually stopped (without the slope changing, I guess the 0.4 m/s was some kind of residual velocity from the landing). However, the location was horrible for my little planes... so the search continues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-03T13:54:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2016 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Magzimum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T14:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222836425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151366\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478181122\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167187\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Magzimum\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Magzimum said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145504-sharpy/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145504\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145504-sharpy/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Sharpy\u003C/a\u003E, thanks for that analysis.

Wheels are surface-mounted, same as legs. They just default to a different orientation, but you can rotate them any way you like. Learn to love the move and rotate tools, it took me a long time to learn to use them, but now I\u0027m using them all the time. Wheels extend downwards without the slant, and if you angle them too much, the wheel raycast will stop catching the surface and they will start sliding just as any random non-wheel part, but the same angle as legs should be well within safe range. These wings on your lander look like a really good spot too. Note though that wheels, especially the smaller ones, have significantly lower impact stress resistance than legs. They WILL break if the lander is too heavy for them.

It would have to be able to drag itself ashore completely, because I intend to launch one or two planes too - just for fun, btw. It also requires precision landing to land near the shore, which may still be difficult. This solution may be easier with a space plane. Although my lander contains wings and jets (Rapiers), it is more a rocket than a plane.
