The simplicity and the zero part impact on the game is what attracted me to Snacks! in the first place. This and the fact that the best way to transport snacks is with habitation modules, which forces the player to build ships with large habitable volume. This is an UNIQUE feature of this mod.

Considering that a given command pod could support its crew for ~50 days, and a full Hitchiker will last ~200, though, I guess resupply is of a lower priority than with more intensive life support mods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI still don\u0027t see why having to mount a crewless crew tank for resupply is a bad thing even real life resupply vessels are pressurized and carry life support hardware same as any craft humans are expected to step into for any period of time even if just for loading and unloading purposes.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B-STRK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022B-STRK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs it is, however, for resupply plans I\u0027m planning on using a Mk2 crew tank as a heavy Snacks and crew resupply shuttle, particularly for offworld base-orbit from a mining site; it\u0027s the lowest-profile (not sure about weight, though) solution for a Snacks resupply vessel of that size (4 pax = 800 Snacks). (For a lighter option, I have to go to US\u0027 Snack wedges for a 1.25m solution (44 Snacks @ wedge x 4 wedges = 176 Snacks for a Cygnus-type resupply). \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E this is probably why I frown on dedicated snack tanks more than any other reason. Compared to using a crew can they are the always the most mass efficient option which undermines the mod\u0027s ballance. Compared to other life supports mods the resource used is very very light in fact it\u0027s now completely massless. Part of the reason for this is because it was balanced to use extra crew cans (an already rather heavy part) as its storage part. mods that add snack tanks think since they have no crew capacity they can shave some dry mass off but really they are undermining the reason that there is no snack tanks and that is to force you to give your craft living space otherwise you can just cram your kerbal in a tiny mk1 landercan and keep him alive and happy for years with a cabinet packed solid with snacks which is something this mod tries to avoid.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B-STRK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022B-STRK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis isn\u0027t intended to be pressure on tgruetzm to add parts to the mod.
