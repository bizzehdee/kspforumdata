I\u0027d prefer to keep in sync with the main fork rather than becoming divergent. Agreed that people should not expect support from the mod author. I can offer some level of support directly, though my time isn\u0027t infinite either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC) I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s much of an alternative for fixing the issue as the issue is that KSP 1.3.1 is largely not compatible with mods built for newer versions. Most mod authors understandably don\u0027t want to have to build against countless versions of KSP, so I prefer not to ask them to provide builds which I can do myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, where I\u0027ve made changes (so far just kOS) I have had them pulled back up to the main fork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
