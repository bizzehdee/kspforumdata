Upon entering, the plane will appear in the editor in the exact state that it was on the moment it drove through the door; if say that an engine had been blown off, or its fuel tanks are empty, it will appear with these problems in the editor. There will also be no save or load button, only a store ship button; the amount of money available to spend will be displayed in a corner, and there will also be a \u0027Refuel all tanks\u0027 button somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECostings! Any original part you delete will award you 50% of its value (you\u0027ve ripped it off a used aircraft, it\u0027s not exactly 100% new...); any new part you add will cost full price, but if you remove a new part it will give a full refund (as you didn\u0027t really add it..). The refuel button will do just as it says a charge for the amount of fuel (as in \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E fuel; RCS, Xenon Etc)it had to refuel (if a tank was 50% full it\u0027s not going to charge you for a full tank, just half); you can then use tweakables to empty tanks and it will refund you the amount you empty. When finished, you can choose to store the plane in the hangars, or launch it straight away (like a normal launch). If stored in the hangers, you can launch or edit at a later date via clicking on the Runway on the KSC and going to a \u0027Hangar\u0027 page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there will be a speed limit of ~20 m/s on entry to the SPH to stop people saving crashing planes by flying it in the hanger; any faster than the limit and it will treat the hangar entrance as solid (BOOM!); there will also be a small cost for \u0027Maintenance\u0027 on a Plane every time it enters the hangar (it will warn you of this, if can\u0027t afford it, it will auto store the craft); this will be a flat cost for a normal flight, but will then increase every time a vessel has endured Re-Entry (paying for every time a plane lands is a bit harsh, not mention difficult to track; plus, if you landed too hard, something will have broken and you will have to repair it!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor Rockets\u003C/strong\u003E: As they can\u0027t really travel to the SPH, they will be recovered like normal; where the parts of the craft that are on the surface of Kerbin are destroyed and all crew and science are given back at the KSC; also every part recovered will give 80-90% of its value back (they can\u0027t really be re-used, but museums and companies would pay for the used parts for attraction/study), but of course the craft is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen creating Rockets or Planes, you are technically making a design or blueprint, not the actual rocket (hence duplicates); so a design will have a certain cost (parts \u002B fuel) and will only be taken when the flight is put on the pad.
