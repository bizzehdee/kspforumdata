My name is metdawg, I\u0027m relatively new to this game (a friend showed it to me ~2 weeks ago, thank goodness it was after finals for the summer term...) and have developed a slight obsession. I study aerospace engineering IRL, and if I had this game back when I took an intro orbital mechanics course, well, my knowledge of that material would have been much greater. Thanks to the dev team for making this game as awesome as it is, while keeping it open to let the users have fun with plugins and the community. I\u0027ve got some other projects I\u0027m working on right now, but you\u0027ll see my name in the contests in the near future, so watch out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pugspaceprogram","CreatedById":57139,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T19:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
