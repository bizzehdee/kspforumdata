As a result, the player is only given the \u003Cem\u003Eillusion \u003C/em\u003Eof choice -- that is, the player thinks s/he\u0027s choosing the right engine for the job, but the reality is that there wasn\u0027t a choice because any other engine would result in complete failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I disagree with that (I\u0027m not intending to set up a straw man argument here, just stating my current position). I recently changed one of my lifters from a radial design with skippers, to a central mainsail \u002B SRBs instead and both designs were effective. For my last Duna mission, I could have used either a Nerv (LV-N) engine or a Terrier (LV-909) and gotten similar performance and payload characteristics. I ended up going with the Terrier because those liquid fuel tanks are just a pain to deal with for the Nerv engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a couple of different lander designs with the exact same payload that are almost identical in delta-v and TWR, but one uses two Terriers, and the other uses 6 (or maybe it was 8) Twitch engines. I think one carried more fuel than the other but they ended up being about the same mass wet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my experience, there\u0027s still plenty of meaningful player choice. In fact, for one I really like the fact that the Spark (48-7S) is no longer objectively superior to the Terrier (LV-909) in every way as it was pre v1.0. That\u0027s an example of there not really being a choice when there was almost no scenario that I remember encountering where I would pick the Terrier over the Spark.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T03:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill though, about the KR-2L - I do agree that it needed a slight rebalance, but not to the extent where it is literally weaker than engines waaaay smaller than it.
