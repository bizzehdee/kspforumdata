Using the wrong tool itself is now inherently unreasonable, as evidenced by the standard reply given when someone asks why an engine isn\u0027t performing as well as they hoped (\u0022You aren\u0027t supposed to use it in that situation!\u0022)\n\nYou either change the job or you use the tool that the game has specifically designated for that job. The fact that people are actually happy there is now a defined and enforced \u0022right/wrong\u0022 for things like this is surprising. Those two words never used to exist in Kerbal vocabulary before now.\n\nJust to clarify, by the way, my personal gripe is only with the rocket engines. How the airbreathing engines now function adds to gameplay in my opinion, since how I fly actually has an active effect. I\u0027ve genuinely enjoyed that, and the supposed nerfs to SSTOs seem to be an issue with drag more than anything, which is a different subject entirely. The changes to rocket engines, on the other hand, adds nothing to the game besides realism for the sake of realism (thus not comparable to the improved aerodynamics)."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:40:37Z","Content":"Yes, the KR-2L thing has annoyed me ever since.

I\u0027m assuming you want each engine to be useful in multiple roles? What roles did you have in mind and which engines should be useful in which roles?\n\nMy 2 cents: From a gameplay perspective I want players to have choices, and have those choices affect gameplay enough that the choice is meaningful, and have those choices allow a player to tackle a problem in more than one way according to that player\u0027s particular personal play style, skill level, etc.\n\nThe argument I\u0027m seeing from the OP (and correct me if I\u0027ve misread you) is that for a given payload mass and role (lifter, vacuum lander, interplanetary transfer), there is only one engine that fits that role. As a result, the player is only given the *illusion* of choice -- that is, the player thinks s/he\u0027s choosing the right engine for the job, but the reality is that there wasn\u0027t a choice because any other engine would result in complete failure.\n\n---\n\nHowever, I disagree with that (I\u0027m not intending to set up a straw man argument here, just stating my current position). I recently changed one of my lifters from a radial design with skippers, to a central mainsail \u002B SRBs instead and both designs were effective. For my last Duna mission, I could have used either a Nerv (LV-N) engine or a Terrier (LV-909) and gotten similar performance and payload characteristics. I ended up going with the Terrier because those liquid fuel tanks are just a pain to deal with for the Nerv engine. \n\nI also have a couple of different lander designs with the exact same payload that are almost identical in delta-v and TWR, but one uses two Terriers, and the other uses 6 (or maybe it was 8) Twitch engines. I think one carried more fuel than the other but they ended up being about the same mass wet.\n\nSo in my experience, there\u0027s still plenty of meaningful player choice. In fact, for one I really like the fact that the Spark (48-7S) is no longer objectively superior to the Terrier (LV-909) in every way as it was pre v1.0. That\u0027s an example of there not really being a choice when there was almost no scenario that I remember encountering where I would pick the Terrier over the Spark."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T03:36:10Z","Content":"Still though, about the KR-2L - I do agree that it needed a slight rebalance, but not to the extent where it is literally weaker than engines waaaay smaller than it.
