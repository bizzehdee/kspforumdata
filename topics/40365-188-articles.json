They have more than enough resources available but without fail one or two of the four on the craft splutter out and die at a mere 14,000m. Thats with a total of 20 Intakes mind you. 14 supersonic intakes and 6 ram air intakes with precoolers, which strangely only yield a total of 4.00 atmosphere/intake air. It seems like the atmosphere isn\u0027t distributed properly or is simply disappearing. As the craft climbs rather than the intake atmosphere slowly dwindling down, it sharply drops off several times. When on the ground and stationary Intake Air fluctuates wildly on all the intakes. I was easily able to get much, much higher in the atmosphere with the old Atmosphereic Scoop intakes, but with their lack of precooler functionality they weren\u0027t very practical.\u003Cp\u003ESo is my game some how screwed up or is my engineering \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E off the mark?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fiddled about with their setup in the latest update and it might not have worked as well as it first appeared to.

I actually had the problem with the old intakes not working, but managed to resolve it after reading through a few pages here. So it sounds like some of the problem is definitely poor engineering on my part. Although the stock and modded intakes are still bugging out on me. Occasionally when the craft first loads on the runway the intake will appear with only part of its resources available. For instance the supersonic intakes like in my picture will occasionally load with .20/.20 Intake Air and .05/.20 Intake Atm...which is weird because the craft is just sitting there on the runway. Also is it normal to have the engines drag down the resources when they are throttled up? Just starting the TTJ on the pad pulls down the value in Intake Atm even though it hasn\u0027t increased in altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the potentially stupid questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: On a side note the reason I started using the old intakes in the first place is the other ones don\u0027t display that they provide Intake Atm in the VAB, even though once loaded they do provide that resource. I was trying to build a SSTO capable of taking off on Duna so using Intake Atm was needed rather than Intake Air.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-21T04:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2013 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by biglightbt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T03:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would probably be easier for him to just place it in his power management display.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played through the game with the new system far enough to use anything with megajoules, so right now I haven\u0027t tested the power management display out yet so didn\u0027t think of that.

I\u0027ve just managed to unlock the first tier of nuclear reactors and decided to make a science lab and fly it to minmus to get some research going. To my surprise the waste heat started building up rather quickly, due to the change to radiators that I read up about in this thread. I\u0027ve had to revert and launch several revised versions, each time with more radiator capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach one suffered from waste heat buildup causing a drop in the generator\u0027s efficiency, forcing the reactor to run at higher capacity to keep the science lab running and making the problem worse. Eventually, the electric generator\u0027s efficiency drops so low that it can no longer supply the lab with power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConceptually I like the way the radiators work now, building up heat until they reach equilibrium, and encouraging you to supply enough radiators to keep everything cool. However I\u0027m starting to feel that the balance is off, at least when working with Tier 1 equipment. Here\u0027s the final version of my Minmus Science Lab that will stabilize just barely below 100% reactor throttle to keep the lab supplied with 5 MW:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/56il88s6f/Science_Lab.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Science_Lab.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not quite visible from this angle but it took 4 of the medium sized radiators to just barely keep the 1.25m KIWI reactor cooled at ~97-98% throttle while supplying a permanent 5 MW of power for the lab, at an efficiency of just 12.9%. To put things in perspective, that\u0027s 3.2 tons of radiator for the second-smallest size 2.5 ton reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs tier 1 equipment really intended to struggle this badly to power electrical things?

Your reactors seem like a good power source, and the antimatter tank explosion fits well. Whenever its convenient for you works for me if you are willing to make the change. Just put it in the change log and I\u0027ll start implementing it soon after I have the update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"db48x","CreatedById":66108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T18:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are a couple of ways I can fix this: 1) I can change most of the ALL_VESSEL_FLOW resources to STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH - this has the downside that existing ships may need significant redesign because those resources will no longer be easy to transfer or 2) I can remove all the checking code that disables mode when you have no fuel for it, which means these options will fail at low time acceleration but will begin working when you accelerate faster and when the vessel is unfocused. Technically, there is also 3) write a new method that handles resource draws for ALL_VESSEL flows properly but I\u0027d quite like to know why this change was introduced before doing that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to me that you could also change the units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
