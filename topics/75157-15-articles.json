The other option would be to lighten the sky with the stock AFG node, however getting it looking good on the ground means having it look ugly in orbit, so I compromised the glitchness for having darker skies in the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give the layer effect another go though, just in case\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I\u0027ve just found a way to do it, thanks for getting me to do that :L\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T19:11:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pingopete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T19:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed the dark skies at day issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2kktw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
