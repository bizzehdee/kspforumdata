The only way to do this is by using math or the kerbal way which we all know is trial and error. Though as the planets will be far away, hard to get into orbit around, hard to land on and probably even harder to get off from I think that trial and error will not be the best approach to this anymore. I\u0027ve seen alot of math questions scattered around the forums lately and most of them have been without response, probably because they were abit misplaced and most wouldn\u0027t guess they were there. That\u0027s why I created this thread which is a collected thread of all math, calculations and theorems that concern space and KSP. Anyone can share their calculations, anyone can ask, anyone can help, anyone can add to the post to make it bigger. There\u0027s another similiar thread which is sort of a 101 guide to learning the most important math aspects to KSP.

If you\u0027re doing Hohmann transfers between two objects in orbit around Kerbin (say, the Mun, and Minmus,) the body everything is in orbit around is Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me work an example going the opposite direction from the one in the thread: Going from Minmus to the Mun.

Translating that to degrees (multiply by 360), means that you\u0027ll want to leave Minmus when the Mun is about 349\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away from reaching the opposite side in its orbit (or you can alternatively think of it as leaving when the Mun is about 11\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of the opposite side in its orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrecting for orbital inclination on the way is left as an exercise for the pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculation will get you \u003Cem\u003Eclose\u003C/em\u003E when flying interplanetary distances. Navigating /into/ a planetary SOI is going to be tricky, simply because of how small targets they are on that scale. And targets in non-circular mean that your target orbit won\u0027t be moving at the same rate throughout its orbit, which makes the calculation rather more difficult, should that turn out to be the case..\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this was the starting post which made me send him a question and the reply is above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maltesh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maltesh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re going for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHohmann Transfer\u003C/a\u003E, figuring the angle is fairly easy for objects in circular orbits.

Also if it orbits 1.9722 this means that it\u0027s one orbit and almost another full orbit (about 97% of the orbit). Though am I supposed to do the burn when it has completed 97% of its orbit or when it just has started it and is at 3% of its orbit? In other words, do I do the burn when it has orbited 0.9722 or when it has orbited 1-0.9722=0.0278?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you make it into degrees (multiply by 360 which maltesh also taught me) it says that 0.9722 is about 350 degrees and 0.0278 is about 10 degrees.
