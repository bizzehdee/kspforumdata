Have a warning that goes up that drops you out of time warp when any resource gets below an adjustable lower limit with a default of something ~10% remaining. You can then tap into this \u0027reserve\u0027 by hitting an override. I\u0027m guessing that this is a pretty common feature in most/any real space vehicle.
