I got really interested lately and made my move. It was really hard, but in the same time, a lot more simple to do than I thought. My two modules are the Hundur and the Acara. Hundur has the solar panels. I launched Jeb and Bill in the Hundur and docked the Acara. I have Bill stationed in the Acara, and the Acara is designed as an escape ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6v3ASJc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226v3ASJc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T00:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
