The government started to look for other fun stuff to support so they want to cut the Kerbal Space Progam fundings. but there is still one huge thing to do: they still haven\u0027t landed on any of the Jool moons!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Jebediah called a meeting with the other Kerbonauts and engineers. In face of funding cuts, they have to reduce the number of missions. And so they have found only one solution:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To execute one giant mission, the bravest and craziest of all time, in which they will land on all the moons and come back in one!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Many of the less crazy engineers and sane common Kerbals immediately started to proclaim that this is impossible, even with the bravest and most stupid Kerbonauts and engineers. This idea gained a lot of interest and attention in the public and even in the government. Jebediah and the others realized that with this new, huge publicity the Space Program may be saved and they can continue to do what they love the best! They started to think about the details of this enormous mission...\n\u003E \n\n![JNr4SKL.png](http://i.imgur.com/JNr4SKL.png)\n\n[LINK to the old Jool-5 thread.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-THE-ULTIMATE-JOOL-5-CHALLENGE-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-misson) There are hundreds of pages of entries and discussion, so look at it to see what worked and what didn\u0027t!\n\nIMPORTANT INFO\n\nThe Jool 5 Challenge has a new owner!  [@JacobJHC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152333-jacobjhc/) has started the new thread here:  [The Ultimate Jool 5 Challenge Continuation for 1.4/ Making History](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172495-the-ultimate-jool-5-challenge-continuation-for-14-making-history/)\n\nPost your new entries there!  **This thread is now closed to new entries**.\n\nCHALLENGE RULES\n\nGiven the scale of this challenge, everyone who completes the mission successfully gets a spot in the hall of fame.\n\n1. No cheating, including the stock debug menu cheats, HyperEdit, or file editing.  HyperEdit is allowed for testing but get rid of that H when you fly the real mission!  \n\n2. No part-clipping of functional parts (fuel tanks, batteries, crew pods, engines, science parts, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E) into each other. It is okay to clip structural and non-functional parts, wings, and heat shields.  \n\n3. Any number of launches are allowed to assemble the ship in Kerbin orbit. All launches must be flown!  \n\n4. There\u0027s funding for one main ship only so all the crew, lander(s) and other stuff has to go to Jool as one big ship.  The ship can separate once in Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.  \n\n5. Kerbals must be in a pod or cabin (no seats) for the interplanetary journey. Seats are okay for landing and flying within the Jool system.  \n\n6. One refueling mission is allowed in the Jool system if you run out of fuel, unless your ship uses \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. The refueling mission can only transfer resources, not parts, to your Jool 5 craft. This mission must actually be flown!  \n\n7. On all of the landings, the Kerbal must be able to get out and walk (or swim!) around on the surface.  Make sure your ladders work!  \n\n8. Use Normal difficulty or harder, except, any ComNet settings are allowed including turning it off completely.  \n\n9. All the Kerbals have to arrive back to Kerbin surface at the end of the mission, happy and alive. You are allowed to optionally send up a craft to return them from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n10. Mods:  \nSTOCK: only mods which do not add parts and do not change physics are allowed.  This includes any informational, planning, visual, autopilot, or automatic functions.  \nMODDED: Use of most parts mods and certain game mechanics mods are allowed.  You NO LONGER HAVE TO ASK if your favorite part pack is allowed!  Some parts mods are prohibited.  Please see below.  \n\nSpecific Mods:\n\nSpoiler\n\nExamples of popular mods allowed in stock entries:  \n\nMechJeb, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, Precise Node, Transfer Window Planner, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Scatterer, Chatterer, Pilot Assistant, Docking Alignment Indicator, TAC Fuel Balancer, Throttle Controlled Avionics, X Science.\n\nExamples of allowed game mechanics mods that would count as modded:  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, DRE, Remote Tech, ScanSat, Kopernicus, part welding, any life support, any new science experiments, fuel switchers\n\nProhibited Mods (powerful enough to make the challenge trivial, or too confusing to judge): \n\nTweakscale  \n\nKSP Interstellar  \n\nNear Future Propulsion  \n\nOPT Spaceplane  \n\nB9 Aerospace  \n\nKerbal Atomics  \n\nAtomic Age  \n\nExtraplanetary Launch Pads  \n\nOSE Workshop  \n\nImpossible Innovations  \n\nSolaris Hypernautics  \n\nDeep Space Exploration Vessels  \n\nAny Orion nuclear pulsed propulsion  \n\nAny warp drive or propellant-less space engine  \n\nAny physics alteration that makes the challenge easier (reducing gravity, moving the moons, HyperEdit, or debug menu cheats)\n\nENTRY SUBMISSION RULES  \n\n11. Submit your challenge as an imgur album, with good captions and descriptions, as a video or series of videos, or as a thread in Mission Reports.  \n\n12. Pictures or it didn\u0027t happen! Please keep the resources tab open, as well as show the informative windows from Mechjeb or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E if you use them. Take a picture of every important moment, including transfers, dockings, landings, stagings, and refuelings. For Jeb\u0027s Level, also take pictures of the science screen when you recover your craft. Alternatively, video submissions are a great way to show everyone your mission as well. These will help future participants to see exactly how you accomplished each part!\n\nCHALLENGE LEVELS\n\n1ST LEVEL: one Kerbonaut lands on all the moons and come back safely.\n\n*1st level low mass and low cost sub-challenges*: with stock parts and physics, how low can you go and still accomplish the mission?\n\n2ND LEVEL: two or more Kerbonauts land together on all the moons together and come back safely.\n\n3RD LEVEL: There\u0027s not enough time left for training one crew member to be an expert on all of the moons, so five Kerbonauts must go to the mission, with at least one unique Kerbonaut landing on each moon.\n\nJEBEDIAH\u0027S LEVEL: collect as much Science as possible!  Your score is the number of science points from the Jool system only, returned to Kerbin (not transmitted).  Only stock experiments count for this!  To score, take pictures of the science screen(s) when you recover the data.  Otherwise, the rules are the same as 3rd Level.\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E:  Use of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E will get a note \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E on the entry description in the hall of fame.  This includes stock ore harvesting and converting as well as mods such as Kethane and Karbonite.  \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is allowed for any level of completion.\n\nGRAND TOUR:  Not officially part of the challenge, but landing on all planets and moons in the Kerbol system in one mission will earn a GRAND TOUR note and the everlasting praise of all of Kerbal kind.  Rule 4 is waived, but any Kerbals on the mission cannot return to Kerbin in between any landings and you still must follow the other rules.\n\nAdditional optional information to help others see how the mission was accomplished:  \n\n- Which game versions did you use?  \n\n- What mods did you use, if any?  \n\n- How many Kerbals are on the mission?  \n\n- How many launches were needed to start your mission from Kerbin?  \n\n- How much did your mission cost?  \n\n- Did you needed a refueling mission?  \n\n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc?  \n\n- Share the delta-V information too, if you tracked it!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, now this big announcement is in the Kerbal News, all the public is excited about this mission and even the Government is watching! Now it\u0027s up to you, to the engineers and to the bravest and craziest Kerbonauts of all time!\n\nCompletion Badge: Anyone who has finished the challenge can add this badge to their signature.  The Low Mass Feather badge is available for entries in the low mass sub challenge.\n\n![Z5hSyCv.png](http://i.imgur.com/Z5hSyCv.png)

I\u0027d propose the following to encourage people to bring and use an MPL, while keeping in the spirit of the original challenge:\n\n--You can load an experiment into the MPL and get science for transmitting the processed data; in V1.x you can also get science points for the unprocessed observation. To get points for the unprocessed observation you must bring it to Kerbin surface in a pod or MPL. \n\n--Science points may be transmitted ONLY from an MPL, and ONLY for data that was processed in the MPL.\n\n--Include documentation of every experiment loaded to the MPL and every experiment from it. No proof, no points.\n\nDoes it make sense? Is it too complicated?

Edit: MRS is already allowed, first one in the list.\n\nThe K2 pod looks good, the Corvus pod is too lightweight compared to stock for two Kerbals.\n\nTantares has several parts, especially the crew parts, that are much smaller and more lightweight than stock, that\u0027s why it\u0027s not allowed.\n\nI would say procedural parts is overpowered.

I absolutely would use it to stabilize a multicomponent ship enough to survive physics warp and thus a 20-minute burn or so in a reasonable timeframe, or detach now-useless components from a lander to keep the remains of its fuel tank, all cards being on the table. But I\u0027d pay a price in weight and complexity for that benefit.\n\nDang It essentially causes things to fail randomly. Command pods can carry a limited supply of spare parts, but it\u0027s essentially a tax on over-complex designs.\n\nThrottle Controlled Avionics manipulates engine thrust levels individually to maintain stability on asymmetric designs, especially in atmosphere. It\u0027d be useful for the initial launching of things like Ion Rings.\n\nFuel Tanks Plus offers an assortment of stock-balanced fuel tanks approximately 1.5x the length of said stock tanks. It\u0027d essentially be a way to reduce part count and this increase the portion of the mission I can actually fly. For instance, my Laythe lander could lose three parts with no difference in delta-V, thrust, weight, or CoM with this mod.\n\nHeat Management adds a set of purpose-built radiators and heat sinks. It\u0027s essentially a more intentional way of achieving the same result as attaching an LV-N to an orange tank with 8 Big-S Delta Wings radiating from it.\n\nJettison Fuel adds the ore tank\u0027s jettison function to regular fuel tanks. It does nothing but allow dumping fuel into space.\n\nTrajectories is a useful mod I\u0027ve recently located that calculates a landing point on planet surface while factoring in atmospheric drag and planet rotation. It\u0027s only functions would be to prevent splashdown on Laythe and drop my return stage directly on to the KSC.\n\nKerbal Attachment System allows things to winch in other things, drag them around, or lay fuel pipes and such between two pre-built points. My use for it would primarily be to simplify docking or potentially right a fallen lander.\n\nOn Mechjeb...
