I only ask because I\u0027m using the station and bases contracts pack, so every time my KSS changes to a base it then stops issuing contracts for me to service my station, until I go and change it\u0027s type back to a station again. Not a huge problem, but very annoying. Does anyone know of a way to lock it to one vessel type so it wont keep changing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
