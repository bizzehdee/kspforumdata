Obviously, it\u0027s not meant to go at KSC, I was just comparing it side-by-side with the existing buildings to check scale and texel density.\n\nUgly brutalist buildings have very simple shapes and are ideal for a blender novice like myself. I will try and make some vaguely matching and complementary additions and try for a little kerbal town or something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T19:34:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 07:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by comham**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:10:55Z","Content":"We definitely need more general assets available for non-model-making modders.
