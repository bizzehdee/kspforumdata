Do **not** use cop-out worst-case scenarios (e.g., \u0027you could be struck with a nuclear missile\u0027)\n2. Be detailed, keep things as close to realistic (but interesting!) as you can and (preferably) relevant to the given scenario.\n3. Try not to repeat ideas too much. Be thoughtful.\n\nAn example:\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 800, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Person 1:**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]I\u0027m driving to work this morning. What\u0027s the worst that could happen?[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Person 2:**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]As you get into your car, you realise it\u0027s out of fuel. Annoyed at the prospect of being late,\n\nyou rush to your neighbour\u0027s house to ask if you can borrow enough fuel off them to get to\n\na petrol station. They acquiesce, but as you\u0027re siphoning some fuel out of their tank,\n\nthey carelessly light a cigarette. The petrol fumes in the air ignite, and the fire quickly\n\nreaches their car\u0027s fuel tank, whereupon it explodes, shooting jets of flame out of the fuel\n\npipe. You, as well as your neighbour, wake up in hospital recovering from second-degree\n\nburns.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nWhile you are free to pick out any scenario you wish, I would recommend giving fairly ordinary scenarios -- the point of the game is to get from the ordinary to the extraordinary without using excessively unlikely connections.\n\nWell, let\u0027s see how we go. I\u0027ll offer a scenario to start.\n\nI\u0027m carrying my groceries into my house.

So you put them down to free your hands.. But you just remembered that the new cashier put the eggs on the bottom, you hear a huge amount of cracking.. Then when you finally open the door, its stuck, so it bursts open, knocking down your groceries. Your porch is small, so they fall off. You start back, to try and save them as they fall, but pull the other bag down with you. There is a bag of mouse traps that your bought in the other bag, so when you and your groceries are lying on the ground, your day ends with your arms stinging from mouse traps, in your bed with ice pack all over your injured arms..\n\nI\u0027m sitting, typing at my computer, what\u0027s the worst that could happen\n\nedit: ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T16:37:18Z","Content":"Your pet disrupts the cat\u0027s brain waves, which bounce off your hand and back into poor old Mittens.
