I landed a Kerbal there in 0.20, but it was a one-way trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was time to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rocket was built, untested, Science was installed, and it was launched. Bill Kerman became the pilot, as I forgot to un-draft him. Jeb\u0027s in a space station with no return ship (oops), so we won\u0027t be seeing him for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NCrm0zPh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NCrm0zPh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELot\u0027s of Science to bring home. The tech tree is maxed, but Science is fun anyway. Nice stable lander, lots of parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing worth noting: I\u0027ve never lifted anything off Duna. KE says I have the TWR, so onward we go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch window turned out to be perfect (random luck), I didn\u0027t take and screenshots as I hadn\u0027t planned on writing this up, and yet another launch (that works) isn\u0027t that exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Duna SOI I found I was aimed straight into the planet, not for the ~15000m aerobrake the map screen said. I blame Bill, personally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile fixing that it occurred to me that I was going rather fast and my transfer stage, while long on DV, was not long on TWR. Aerobrake time! Plus I like aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere Bill is lining up for aerobraking, we\u0027re going deep:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VPprTrih.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VPprTrih.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAimed for ~9,000m to clear the big stuff, promptly found that Aerobraking alone wasn\u0027t looking good, things were starting to look distinctly Mars Climate Orbiterish and had Bill light the nuke. Bill looked less than pleased with matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lQ7clpuh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lQ7clpuh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd released the six Duna parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oUtfEmyh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oUtfEmyh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat did the trick, and down bill went at a stately 11m/s. The transfer stage was jettisoned as it had done its duty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LSTAnibh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LSTAnibh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing shocks didn\u0027t appreciate the jolt much, but they held. Bill\u0027s untested ship made it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9kPwt7rh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229kPwt7rh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was psyched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more so when he stepped out to look around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vXVe1yfh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vXVe1yfh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocks were collected, Science was done. I had Atmosphere and Science Bay testing at high altitude, low altitude and surface, goo at low and surface, the other sensors at surface, almost all of it brand new data. I elected to bring it home for the Greater Glory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking off and heading for orbit, I almost caused the End of All Things, when it tried to treat Duna like Mun/Minmus/Dres and burnt at a low angle. Here I\u0027ve spent a couple minutes going straight up again to try to get headed in the right direction and am finally able to gravity turn. After this point, it all went well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AIgewX5h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AIgewX5h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came a long, boring, wait at 100000x for Kerbin to line up correctly, as I was down to ~1100DV remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the window arrived, and I got Bill aimed for home. No pics, cause meh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this time Bill EVA\u0027d to repack the Duna chutes, just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon entering Kerbin SOI I again found myself aimed right at the dirt. While that may work in-game, I like to pretend otherwise. Plus Mountains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI aimed Bill for a ~30,000m aerobrake and deployed three of the Duna parachutes manually, for reasons unknown at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobrake begins, fairly violently:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YBrIrOVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YBrIrOVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs aerobraking continued, I was feeling nervous for some reason. Maybe because at 24,000m Bill was still going a bit fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rQKxMHCh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rQKxMHCh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy face and Bill\u0027s face likely looked identical (other than color, anyway). It was enough of a shock that I missed the screenshot until that point, sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire bottom half of the craft fragmented, all the carefully saved science? Gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E why I use spaceplane cockpits and put some parachutes on the cockpit itself. Bill touched down fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully Bill had kept his Duna rocks in his pocket, so we still got some Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6eRn55sh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226eRn55sh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll told I enjoyed it immensely, KSP is an amazing game that way. The moment it starts getting boring \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E happens. Had I been less shocked I\u0027d have hit F3 to see if the parachutes deployed and tore the ship apart. It seems both unlikely, as I\u0027ve deployed very similar chutes a lot of times in similar situations, and like the most likely explanation giving the current aero model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat fun, in any even!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T09:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery pretty lander.
