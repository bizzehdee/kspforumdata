In the interim I\u0027ve created an oxygenator panel that attaches to the outside of the inflatable dome, it has a teroidal connection point where ideally the next module (the power system) will connect with an invisible mesh with a \u0027cable\u0027 that will ideally line up with the teroidal female plug hole and lead to a base unit which ZO2 / EPS panels can be attached to.

Bad moment of capture is my guess, the actual finished product is as smooth as a baby\u0027s arse while still conserving triscount. But it\u0027s enough to get the general jist of the shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe science behind it:\u003C/strong\u003E at extremely low tempretures one can pass highly CO2 contaminated air through a low-insulative quality pipe exposed to the Martian atmosphere, rendering it liquified, the liquid is then blasted against a catalytic plate which breaks the C from the O2 leaving you with high concentration O2. An animation every so often of an air jet coming from the panel would be grand, so I need to remember to try to do that, as the C is expunged and the O2 is reheated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe O2 can then either be mixed with something readily available, say, left over hydrazine from landing engines, then control combusted to create H20 and straight oxygen, two units that are very handy to have available in an isolated place such as the Duna surface. Bodily fluids can also be processed through an oxygenator in a similar fashion, in fact, I should probably add another atmos loop to that part for weewee to not so icky stuff conversion, as everything has different boiling and freezing points, which makes using the temp outside being REALLY****INGCOLD super handy. The only real cost is heating **** up again, but if you use afforementioned hydrazine reaction the combustion does that job for you, recycling the energy that would otherwise be dispersed and wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E Just going to keep on making parts for my hab pack and worry about making them work later. I\u0027m having a bit of trouble projecting the unwrap properly for some of the more complex parts (ie: the hab itself has a rubber inflated landing foot to try and minimize impact and hopefully allow for manned landings of fully integrated habs at later points, it\u0027s weird ass spiral unwrap takes up most of the field for the UV unwrap. So I\u0027m hesitant to add a complex skin to it until I\u0027ve got that sorted, I saw some methods of \u0027unselecting\u0027 parts, but due to it being a torus I can\u0027t unselect parts because pretty much every unwrapped part is in some way visible; the overall skin of it is a simple low res rubber compound so it shouldn\u0027t be too dramatic if I just resize that part much smaller than the others right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do any of you folks use Twitter? If so, add me, @bashpr0mpt, to show my appreciations I\u0027ll throw you some of my fans to bump your follower numbers and make your e-peens larger. Hit me up and @ message me when you\u0027ve added me so I have your usernames and can add you back / give you guys a shout out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about making a communications platform for the top of the hab to house a few antennae and a dish, I\u0027m thinking of making a nicer variant of the remote tech dish, I\u0027ve jury-rigged a few different dishes to use instead of the woeful mapsat dish (although the mapsat dish is nicely animated, I\u0027ll definitely give it that! But having one design of such an awkward height and size is frustrating!) I\u0027m also considering making the landing foot and building foundation as a separate part, and having it separated from the bottom of the hab by very small trussing just as an extra bit of fluff and detail. Although from a scientific POV you wouldn\u0027t want martial air getting under your hab and would want it pressed firmly against the soil to avoid windchill dropping the skin temp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn RTG, that should be what I make next. I\u0027d love to add a functional air lock to the hab, a crew tunnel to connect habs (if we had docking systems that worked I\u0027d totally try and get it set up so you can connect them on the planet (using that nifty forklift from kerbal.net or by EVA like ORDA\u0027s refueling hose), but I\u0027m going to need some serious assistance working out node connection location coordinates. ATM I\u0027ve just copypasta\u0027d **** for illustrative purposes simply because I\u0027m more interested in getting the part to appear in the game first and foremost. Uh, yeah, RTG\u0027s, they\u0027re handy. Radioisotopic thermal generators are pretty much free electricity! If I could get it working with the electricity plugin (if only Zoxygene and the Electricity plugin guys got together and made their systems talk to each other, man that would be epic!) it\u0027d naturally attach someplace close to the Oxygenator panel, or perhaps even mount on it.

Is there an impact on performance in game? Because I\u0027ve noticed the game is woeful at memory management and **** grinds to a halt with even mildly complex models, so I want to minimise that where I can. Also; is there a reason blender can never import .dae\u0027s of other peoples stuff? It just loads a ****ing cube whenever I try and import or load things. :/ Should I be getting some other program to open .DAE\u0027s? I noticed Unity will open them, but when something like zoom is as counter intuitive as alt right click and drag I\u0027m still kind of scared off by Unity (you also can\u0027t zoom in enough that the object is more than a few millimeters in size without it colliding with and being cut in half by the POV. :/) but would like to see how some other people make their models.
