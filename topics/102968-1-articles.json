If you are making a skycrane you can use the radial plug from KAS with a winch, release the cable from the winch, then when you are less than 20m from the surface change the plug mode. Your rover will drop from the crane (But still be attached by the cable) then when you touch down (Or right before) unplug the cable and watch your skycrane fly away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T17:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell here is a lander, notice how the decent stage has two parts, outer tanks connected to ascent stage engines and tanks, inner tank and engine connect to lander pods. With the KAS pipes when I decouple the the ascent stage, the descent stage stays intact despite 5 decoupling points and thus 5 parts.

Upon decoupling, you want both tanks to stay connected to each other via the struts. The only way I see something like that working is if the two tanks are separate before launch, but then dock together using docking ports after launching your craft. Upon the two decouplers ejecting the separate tanks, the docked tanks should stay together. Otherwise, you\u0027re ejecting two tanks that will be treated as separate \u0022crafts\u0022 (debris objects) and cannot be strutted together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T21:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports that are put into such shape that they dock themselves right after launch are your friends man.

The reason this would work: you lose control over the the staged part (descent stage in this case) upon decoupling. By setting the radial decoupler\u0027s position until AFTER you decouple from the descent stage, they then disappear from the staging tree! Quick and easy way to do it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
