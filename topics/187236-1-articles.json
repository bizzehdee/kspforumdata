At some SSTV decoders, we can see 4 kerbals, 4 planets, a red planet, the pyramid signal, a ComNet signal and a-KSP-like logo. As we analyse, there\u0027s a ridges at the bottom of the decoded signal.

If you pay some attention you will see \u0022Bop\u0022. So that means the 4 kerbals on the image would be the Dunatian civilization and they were planning to go to Bop, and the 4 planets and including Duna as the red planet would be simply, Moho, Eve, Kerbin and the fourth one would be Jool. The KSP-like logo would be all the track of the spaceships of the Dunatian civilization. So it means that the Dunatians was escaping of a threat and they go to Bop to be refuged. Today, we still don\u0027t know about this mystery after Nova deleted his forum post about the SSTV signal.
