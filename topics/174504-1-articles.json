It shows the correct closest approach, but as soon as I place a maneuver node anywhere it moves the closest approach marker directly on top of the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, here I\u0027m trying to get to Moho:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Nv9Q1Vg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Nv9Q1Vg.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see the closest approach seems correct, 80,310.6km from Moho right near where my orbit and Moho\u0027s orbit intersect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I place a maneuver node at a random place:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002271y0YB8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/71y0YB8.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you see it moves the closest approach marker onto the maneuver node, now showing 17\u002B million km. If I move the maneuver node, the closest approach marker happily moves along with the node, making it seem like the closest approach is always going to be exactly at the node position. It does not matter what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E values I give the node, it always shows the closest approach as being at the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried reinstalling my mods, uninstalling maneuver node mods, restarting KSP... same behaviour. Using the latest KSP 1.4.3.2152 Windows x64.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve run into frustrating issues like this with the closest approach marker a number of times now. Anybody have a fix or workaround?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noobton","CreatedById":114094,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T20:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to technical support - modded installs as I can see that you have at least working in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-02T02:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have \u0022Always show closest appraoch for target\u0022 activated in your graphic settings? This option is pretty useful while planning with a single maneuver node but unfortunately it is also the reason for the markers to appear direct on the spot of a new maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidFoo","CreatedById":188573,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-02T15:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right, I had that option activated. When I turn that option off, I don\u0027t see a closest approach at all, because there wasn\u0027t any encounter with Moho. This clarifies it a bit for me. When the option is turned on, it shows the closest approach but not when using maneuver nodes, unless you actually \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E an encouter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think before I was always encountering the Mun / Minmus / Duna which usually do have an encouter after the Kerbin escape burn, and then it was a matter of tweaking the encounter, but the maneuver nodes would work then of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow when trying to encounter Moho I was close but no actual encounter -\u0026gt; therefore no closest approach when using nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now I fixed my encounter by turning the option back on, and experimentally burning in different directions to decrease the closest approach until an encounter is reached, after which the maneuver nodes work again so I can tweak the encounter periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the tip!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
