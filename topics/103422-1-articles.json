I know it\u0027s possible to get a custom user title, and I know about going from curious george to bottle roketeer but where does it go from there. I noticed my title is rocketry enthusiast, but I did not change it since I assumed in some way it would show the dedication of the user to the forums, however I\u0027d much appreciate knowing the exact workings behind it."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T23:58:03Z","Content":"Your user title is based on post count (standard reminder: [post spamming is against the rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-July-24-2014)).
