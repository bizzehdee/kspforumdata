MK2 \u0026 3 end caps/cover plates, the standard rocket parts have flat adapters that can be used to cover the exposed structure on their ends but there doesn\u0027t seem to be a similar part for the space plane parts. \n\nThis isn\u0027t as much a concern if you\u0027re only using them to build aircraft but the parts in your mod make these form factors viable for for other uses such as space stations which can end up with exposed ends which can be visually jarring, I would also suggest having a thicker one with with an airlock of some sort.\n\n2. MK3 science lab, I know this was discussed a while back but I had an idea that might make it viable without being overpowered. As I understand it the Mk3 form factor has enough space to allow for two decks. If this is the case would it be possible to have a short, two decked hull piece set up with the lab on the bottom and a small service section/cargo bay above for the instruments or probes?\n\n3. Long term habitation modules, I know you\u0027ve said you don\u0027t like doing IVAs but I think that these would be vital for anyone using your parts for space stations or deep space ships, these might not be viable for the Mk2 form factor but the Mk3 should have enough space for some kind of cabin module.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T22:14:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Star-Eagle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T20:36:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I had a productive morning today, and made some things that really should have been stock:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/6VOwbpN.png](http://i.imgur.com/6VOwbpN.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E I seem to remember someone requesting a CLS passable drone core, hence the center hatch.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/dpLRUGi.png](http://i.imgur.com/dpLRUGi.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Rounding out the Big-S line of wing parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/WYBiJWv.png](http://i.imgur.com/WYBiJWv.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E And something that has been requested several times, finally got around to it, sorry for the wait.\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts have been uploaded to the github repo.\n\u003E \n\u003E @CptRichardson: If we\u0027re talking stabilizers/fins that can be folded up rather than the empennage itself they\u0027re mounded on, that makes things much, much simpler.\n\nNice job on the wings"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T01:18:51Z","Content":"@Star-Eagle;First off, welcome aboard!\n\n1.

With the endcaps could I suggest having a thicker version with an airlock for the mk2 size, this I think would be especially useful for mk2 rovers or surface bases.\n\n I *would* suggest the same for the mk3 but I think that would look a bit silly scale wise, perhaps instead a *very* short mk3-2.5 or 3.75m adapter plates to mount docking rings onto, this is something I could see being very useful for space stations made with mk3 parts.\n\nWith regard to the long term habitation modules, the ideas you and CptRichardson mention are pretty much what I had in mind,a two deck part with a bunk room/dormitory on the lower deck and some kind of common room/lounge on the upper deck. Maybe something with a few comfy chairs around low tables, a small kitchen and dining area in one corner and maybe a small library/study area in another corner with desk and book case?\n\nPerhaps these ideas could be used in the mk2 parts if they were split-up? i.e separate bunk-room and lounge parts.\n\nI\u0027ve also had a few more ideas that might be worth considering;\n\n1. mk2 \u0026 mk3 stairs, something like you would see on small private jets or maybe just some kind of hatch opening we could mount the existing ladders to so they would be usable with the hatch open but shielded from the air stream with the hatch closed.\n\n2.mk2 \u0026 mk3 six way hub, I think this was suggested before I can\u0027t remember if you said it was do-able in the mk2 form factor or not. \n\n3. mk2 \u0026 mk3 vertical t hub, basically a hub with two attachment points on the horizontal and one at 90 degrees in the vertical. These I think would be very useful when combined with the other hubs for large stations or multi hulled \u0022mother-ships\u0022.\n\nEdit:\n\n4. A telescopic extending docking port, similar to the existing in-line ports but with a much longer reach to enable a greater distance to be maintained between a large ship/space plane and a space station. \n\nAs always feel free to accept or reject these ideas as you see fit, it is your mod after all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T20:47:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Star-Eagle**\n  \nAnother idea"},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T21:09:22Z","Content":"I do like the stair idea (good for places like Eve where OMG-gravity exists, or for in general cleaning up the profiles of our craft), the hubs (as I proposed, and also good for making stations out of Mk2/3 parts), and the extended port, which would be a good thing for the Mk3 profile.

The first option though, to have something similar to the picture, is what I meant by having the ladder as part of the model itself but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s doable as well. Either way, the first option (having the door and attaching a ladder to it) will not work if the doors use ModuleAnimateGeneric.\n\nEDIT: Re-reading your post (god, I\u0027m stupid today), I get the feeling you would want to attach the ladder the part that is hidden by the doors rather than the doors themselves. In which case, the doors/part would have to have ModuleCargoBay in order to actually shield the ladder from the airstream (in stock, at least. With FAR, no problems at all). Either way, if that\u0027s what you want, I\u0027d guess it\u0027d be doable (basically a sideways service bay with a thick core that has a hatch built in, attach the ladder below the hatch, close doors and everything is hidden).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T21:51:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T21:55:58Z","Content":"@CptRichardson; Something like that would work, but keep in mind any mk2 part would be single level only\n\n@Star-Eagle; I envisioned the endcaps being sort of like the Rockomax Brand Adapter 02 - a flat structural/cosmetic endpiece with an attach node, wit hmk2 getting an airlock version.\n\nThe stairs seem possible at first glance, but I can see a few issues with them, in terms of their height coupled with rigid placement requirements and the limited landing gear selection, in terms of their functionality - kerbals would either end up climbing them like ladders or spamming the climb ledge button, and the hatch locations on mk2 crewed parts in some case would preclude stair placement; the hatch option would really only work with mk1 or mk3 parts due to how KSP handles airlock colliders.\n\nThe existing hubs are already on the \u0027rework\u0027 list, so adding a few more of them wouldn\u0027t be all that much more time consuming.\n\nThe mk3 docking port options will likely have some reach to them."},{"CreatedByName":"Star-Eagle","CreatedById":151995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T22:03:12Z","Content":"Yes that is exactly what I had in mind thought it seems we both misspoke, with the second option what I was thinking would not have the ladder mounted to the movable part. \n\nIf you were to think of a cargo bay rotated so that the doors opened sideways you would have a better idea of what I\u0027m trying to describe.
