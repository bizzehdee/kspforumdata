It has 24 PD-10 hitchhiker storage containers, 12 PD-12 cupola modules and 4 MK 2 lander cans for a total absolute maximum kerbal capacity of 116 kerbals, but it would be a bit of a tight fit. The exterior hatches of all the modules lead to an enclosed area with doors at the \u0022top\u0022. The cupolas, aside from having a very nice view, also give the craft enough reaction wheels to turn without RCS even though it weighs 230~ tons. The internal tanks (equivalent to 3 Large orange tanks) can hold about 2,500~ delta V of fuel, so it could theoretically get to Laythe on its own but if you want to have fuel to use once there you might want to dock an external Fuel tank to The single large docking port on the front. You should note that the engines cannot take directly from tanks docked to docking ports so you will have to transfer fuel to the built in tanks manually. Now, lest you get bored with all this techno babble and wander off, here are some pictures of the interior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stroyan.net/KSP/screenshot66.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot66.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stroyan.net/KSP/screenshot68.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot68.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be warned that the part count does not quite fit in the 300 restriction. At launch the part count is about 1,150. The good news is that a lot of this is launch vehicle and the final part count is only about 400. This craft is also completely unarmored. In some places there is only a one inch piece of metal between the habitation areas and the exterior. It is also not made to have weapons but it does have docking ports that they could cling to if you want. Ok, more pictures. These are the doors that allow entry and exit from the craft.

These are for refueling shuttle craft (more on those in another post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get this goliath to orbit you will have to be careful. First select one of the control modules that is facing up so as to get an accurate navball reading. It is best to start your gravity turn at about 12,000 meters. At this point you only want to tilt 10 degrees to the east. Then when you reach 25,000 meters turn another 10 so you are facing 20 degrees east. When you reach about 35,000~ turn eastward so you are pointing 40-45 degrees east. then at about 50,000 point towards your orbital prograde until your apoapsis reaches the desired height. Then just glide up to your apoapsis and round out the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs requested here is the proof of destination:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stroyan.net/KSP/screenshot16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot16.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis launch vehicle makes heavy use of asparagus staging. As soon as you see a pair of fuel bars empty and a pair of engines shut off stage to drop them. Another tip; when you drop the first set of tanks you may notice that they are slightly uneven and one will run out a fraction of a second before the other. To get around this make sure you stage just before the first one runs out. It is vital that you get this timing right. If you stage too early then the tanks will still have enough fuel in them that when you release them they will go up and potentially damage the rest of the rocket. If you stage too late the problem will carry over to the next set of tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stroyan.net/KSP/screenshot19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you have dropped all but five of the tanks and engines the remaining engines are all able to take fuel from all the tanks. The equipment to drop them is still there but they have been hooked up so that even the empty ones can take fuel from the full ones. The engines will still drain one pair of tanks before the other so if you want to drop them you can wait for that pair to empty and then decouple but I would recommend keeping them around for the extra thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to orbit I find it easier to just right click the decoupler to decouple it instead of using the staging. Take note that the starliner\u0027s fuel tanks are totally dry. Their fuel was pumped into the launch vehicle to decrease weight. If you want you can transfer some of the remaining fuel in the launch vehicle to the starliner. It will still need a large tanker to completely fill it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://stroyan.net/KSP/screenshot28.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to Laythe I used external fuel tanks.

Ixian corporate is known for developing and applying some of the best manager training programs and business intelligence systems known. Consumers love Gravioli Surprise, a popular line of tasty instant meals known to positively hold down hunger for a long time, an Ixian Micro-Aquaculture (IMA) product. Aerospace and heavy industry acquisitions last decade resulted in the establishment of the Ixian Commercial Fleet (ICF) seven years prior to the recent conflict in space. The ICF sells mission space, cargo transport, tourism, and exploration services via space train convoys known as Tradestars. The Delos series of mobile outpost, Ionia type ion drive shuttle pod, and Fire Fly utility droid are all models used by many other industires - often delivered to distant parts of the system by Tradestar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIxian efforts in space have been non-military in the past and they have relied on contract security firms to guard their Tradestar convoys. Just prior to the public knowledge of hostilities between Sprit Wolf and Handland the Tylo incident occurred. A major Tradestar on route to Tylo and guarded by Handland was lost to piracy. An insurance investigation verified piracy and cleared both Ixian and Handland cases with no charges but the party behind the apparent hijacking was not brought to light. Though details of the lost convoy are not generally known it was system wide news when the ICF recalled all of their vessels and exercised safety suspension clauses in almost every contract. They also exercised termination clauses across a wide range of projects and contracts involving Handland and strangely went unchallenged by Handland in doing so. Those events have largely been overshadowed by news of battle and related current events. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday a massive media campaign revealed the upcoming re-launch of the Tradestar fleet with impressive new Athena class hardware. Ixian technology is known to be very advanced and modular, given the nature of their space train convoys. From unknown sources they seem to have developed a number of advanced military grade vessels that parallel the hit kerbalvision space-crime-and-espionage drama Kerbalstar Nebula. Even their familiar products such as the Delos outposts have been upgraded with security in mind. In hindsight experts now speculate that the elaborate kerbalvision production was a smoke-screen for their R\u0026amp;D efforts in addition to being a valuable entertainment franchise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips of the Athena Class Tradestar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order of typical convoy configuration (bow to stern):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 x Adamant Mk. 1 Medium Escort\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 x Athena Mk. 1 Colonial Cruiser\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 x Delos Mk. 4 Mobile Outpost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- N x Hermes Mk. 2 Fuel Pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 4 x Ionia Mk. 2 Long Range Shuttle Pods \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 x Fire Fly Mk. 3 Utility Droid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllegiance: Any corporation that has absolutely no allegiance with Handland. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Counts (Final Stage with Armaments):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdamant Escort- 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAthena Cruiser - 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelos Outpost - 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHermes Fuel Pod - 40\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIonia Shuttle Pod - 30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire Fly Droid - 34\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft files: Coming Soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Videos: Coming Soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfographics: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DTOoTpW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DTOoTpW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESignage for Athena recruitment \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FKFHH0U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FKFHH0U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAd campaign signage for general recruitment (note the Fire Fly Droid)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(From the \u0022Hurry Up!

They would be an alternate attachment for the Delos Mobile Outpost in place of the 6 tactical space mines shown above.
