That way Mun gravity, when it starts to affect the trajectory, will pull you towards the right direction. If you enter Mun influence from the Kerbin side, you are bound to \u0027slingshot\u0027 even further away (you \u0027fall\u0027 towards Mun, adding velocity and the trajectory becomes hyperbolic without further braking). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo \u0027fall\u0027 towards Mun so it is also a \u0027fall\u0027 towards Kerbin and/or against your trajectory at that point. You will fling around the moon on a trajectory that heads back towards Kerbin. A \u0027free return\u0027 to Kerbin influence. It will not be a free return to Kerbin atmosphere, but it should be close enough to be fixable without too much deacceleration. You can minimize this by trying to get Mun encounter that flings you \u0027backwards\u0027, towards the direction where the Mun came, so when you look at your relative speed to Kerbin, it is low (you want it to be sub-100m/s at 11000km if you want direct re-entry - remember that Mun is doing 542m/s so if you fling past it 700m/s relative to Mun, you would be then doing still 200m/s to the direction Mun is travelling, in relation to Kerbin...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure you actually miss the Mun - it is also easy to get a trajectory that will result in a fresh new crater (assuming no course corrections).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senji","CreatedById":10124,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T11:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, how do I do a free return from Mun-surface then?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarnis","CreatedById":884,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T11:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Senji\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Senji\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, how do I do a free return from Mun-surface then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\\\u0027t \u0027free\u0027, you do have to make burns, but to use least fuel, lift off and turn against the orbit of the moon. That minimizes the speed around Kerbin and once you are outside Mun influence, the orbit should have periapsis close to Kerbin. Either brake then or wait until you are at apoapsis (going by Kerbin once) and burn at apoapsis for minimum fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4 IN 1","CreatedById":1540,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T12:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo my Ap have to be around 11000Km and I have to get there just in time the mun reach that point ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarnis","CreatedById":884,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-07T13:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my Ap have to be around 11000Km and I have to get there just in time the mun reach that point ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. Actually tad more than that is usually better, it allows more time to enter Mun sphere of influence. I usually aim to 11600-11800. It puts the elliptic transfer slightly beyond Mun orbit but that\\\u0027s perfectly fine (and actually the preferable angle for the capture)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to time it is simple; While on low Kerbin orbit, look at the map from above. When the Mun is approximately at \u0027two o-clock\u0027 and your capsule is at \u0027six o-clock\u0027 in relation to Kerbin, start your burn. Your orbit periapsis will head towards \u0027tweleve o-clock\u0027 (opposite of your position around Kerbin). Stop burn when periapsis is at around 11600km and wait/time warp. Once your craft gets to 11000km\u002B, Mun will be there.
