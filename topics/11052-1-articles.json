It flies like a dream but has a funny 20degree AoA at altitude wich is no real problem. I had the pleasure of having to rely on the position of Minnus and the Sun when flying near the pole to keep my orientation; otherwise i would have gone lost and never made it back. The entire flight lasted 1hr and 48 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some things i noted could be fixed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We clearly need more and brighter, more distinct stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The runway needs to be way longer and wider. It also desperately need night landing lights!! I just don\\\u0027t risk landing on the runway as landing on the ground is just as well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- WE NEED MORE INSTRUMENTS! Please!!
