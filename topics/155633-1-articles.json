Also the drag at that speed MAY cause it to rip apart depending how aerodynamic it is and how structurally sound it is. That in a combination with the odd physics at low FPS is what causes this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slats224","CreatedById":174295,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T10:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help, i will wind down all my settings and give that a shot, howevere i have another issue of after kerbal has a fit sometimes my ships save file gets put in like a limbo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere the file will load and the ship will be in the construction bay, but the load file screen will not disapear and the engineer will tell me for all intensive purposes there is no craft in the bay. This also prevents me launching or altering the ship. i sent this problem off to the guys at kerbal support with my save file but they havent had the chance to get back to me yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T11:48:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe really need more info than this, please see here and upload the craft file, game logs from the event and your dxdiag somewhere for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
