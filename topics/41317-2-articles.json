Otherwise they could be too powerful, and if/since this is the case the swarm strategy is limited by the command vessel where if its taken down, the drones become inert. The other way could be small, simple one kerbal fighters, but then a plethora of problems accompanies that. First most is gathering all the kerbals (unlimited \u0022recruitment\u0022 aside) the next is building simple ships, the simpler the ship the more that can be used, but since they\u0027re manned, and you \u0022have\u0022 a limit on kerbals, you want to make them reusable, which means more parts, and less ships. Then you have to arm these ships, and if they\u0027re to be rearmed (something most people would want, as oneshot fighters aren\u0027t efficient in the long run) that means the armament has be simple, yet be able to be reloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: If \u0022droids\u0022 are used then the risk of the command center being targeted means you still have to worry about maintaining and protecting valuable ships, and if manned vessels are used you want to make sure that the vessels aren\u0027t just flying coffins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I think a \u0022swarm\u0022 smaller manned fighter ships with a central command hub/refueling station/carrier is more cost effective than larger ships with more firepower, since the less overall losses are incurred when one small fighter is destroyed vs a larger vessel.
