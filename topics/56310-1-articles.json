RCS is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/span\u003E essential, but it makes things a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Elot\u003C/span\u003E easier. You\u0027ll need two command pods in your craft and one of them will need to be launched empty. Shoot for 5500 m/s of delta-V. Launch when Jeb is 450,000-500,000 m downrange of KSC as normal and try to put your altitude at the same level as Jeb\u0027s craft. Next, target Jeb\u0027s craft. Assuming an eastward launch, you may need to either burn northward at the descending node or southward at the ascending node - go at whichever node is coming up next and burn slow until the value becomes zero. Once that\u0027s zero, your orbital planes are aligned. Next, set up a maneuver node at the next upcoming apsis. You should have the intercept chevrons, note the distance of closest approach. Pull prograde a little bit on the node and see what the distance is - if the distance decreased, continue pulling prograde until it starts going back up again. If the distance increased instead, start pulling retrograde instead. When pulling retrograde, make sure your periapsis stays above 70,000 (otherwise you\u0027ll drag atmo). Go ahead and burn according to resultant node. If you don\u0027t have an approach within 2 kilometers as a result, set up another maneuver node at the opposite apsis and do the same thing again. If necessary, you may want to wait a few orbits for the distance to close a bit before doing any further maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually though, you\u0027ll get within 2 kilometers. You can begin following the close approach pattern for docking at that point - zero out your relative velocity to the target craft, aim at it, then burn to close. At 1 kilometer, zero out, aim at the target, then burn towards it. Do it again at 500 meters, 200 meters, 100 meters, 50 meters, 20 meters and ten meters. Once you\u0027re zeroed out at ten meters, it\u0027s time for Jeb to go EVA - jetpack him over to the empty pod and have him climb in. Then you just have to burn the rescue craft retrograde until your periapsis is 30,000 or lower and pop the chutes when ready. Definitely incorporate two or three radial chutes in the design (if you\u0027ve got Survivability on Tier 2) to be on the safe side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"agentKmurph","CreatedById":80512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T04:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe\u0027ll survive forever.
