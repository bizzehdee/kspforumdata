I don\u0027t understand why you would remove parts for testing, as you simply don\u0027t need to use any parts you don\u0027t want to use. I do not use a separate install just for testing parts (as opposed to in game software like auto pilots), however I DO use a separate saved game just for testing mod parts. Each saved game has its own persistent file so if something gets messed up it should not affect your other saved games. But some here do use a vanilla (stock) install as well as another version for use with mods. I defer to their experience with the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"webwolf","CreatedById":82381,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T08:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebackup your \\GameData\\Squad folder,then delete those parts you don\u0027t need in test,if something goes wrong,just restore your backup,I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuantumX","CreatedById":78767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T10:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK thanks i managed to find a solution having to installs and renaming them...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T11:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is to simply copy/past the KSP folder from the steam folder to the dev folder, then I delete all the parts I don\u0027t need (to improve the loading time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way I can play ksp with steam, and develop with the other version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T18:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDispatcher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your processor and harddrive it can sometimes take several minutes to load KSP with only the stock parts. If you\u0027re a player who uses a lot of add-ons this can get much worse. I\u0027ve had loading times as high as twenty minutes. KSP also loads slower if it\u0027s not the focused window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy having a separate instance of KSP you can have a different set of stuff for it to load, and you can also have different settings to make it run faster in general or test edge cases without messing with your play instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen cut down to the bare minimum parts required to test your parts/plugins, and stripped of it\u0027s IVAs, KSP can be loaded in under a minute. This is important because you may have to restart KSP many times an hour to test what you\u0027re making, and if it takes 5-20 minutes each time, that\u0027s going to slow you down, and kill your enthusiasm. Once you have it proven in your test environment you move over to your play environment (making appropriate backups), and when you find a bug you change your dev environment to suit it.
