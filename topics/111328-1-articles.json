I read some stuff about transfer windows and I think I get it, but I don\u0027t get the stuff about phase angles and stuff. I think you have to burn prograde at a certain part of your orbit, which gets you on an escape trajectory that takes you to Duna. Is this what you do? How do I know which part of the orbit to make the burn? Should I just play around with maneuver nodes?
