The main thing that makes it difficult is time warp. You can add things like construction time, research time, long term experiments and the like but if players can just time warp through it you\u0027re really not actually creating a challenge, you\u0027re making them press the period button. You can discourage this kind of thing by adding a cost to time--salaries and\u00A0reputation that whittles away over time etc--but then you end up penalizing players for time warping when they really need to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Roverdude had the right idea when he started working on the telemetry system. If players are going to be asked to do more legwork (setting up arrays in that\u00A0instance) then the benefits should be purely bonus rewards, not penalties. I think a similar idea could help create a clever incentive process for players to consider time more carefully. The simple version is that World Firsts could become a bonus reward system with global deadlines--that is,\u00A0hard dates set from the outset of your career rather than by the date a\u00A0contract was accepted.\u00A0Milestones would stay the way they are, passive rewards for progress that neither have advances nor deadlines;\u00A0Explore Contracts would be the central tree through which players explore deeper into the Kerbol system;\u00A0and World Firsts would be rewards for \u003Cem\u003Egetting places fast\u003C/em\u003E. The best way to do this and make it obvious to players might be to fold them into the Explore contracts themselves as bonus deadlines.\u00A0When you viewed the Explore contract\u00A0you would see:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrestige: Trivial\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpires: 5d, 3h, 22m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadline: 100d\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObjective: Achieve orbit around Minmus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERewards:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvance : 40,000f\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompletion: 110,000f, 12s, 10r\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailure: -45,000\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWorld First!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadline:\u00A050d\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReward: 25,000f, 15s, 15r\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not just that you got there, its that you were the \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E to get there.

Its not about forcing a particular kind of role playing, its just about rewarding players for cleverly managing time. This is still tricky though. You would have to carefully calibrate them based on transfer windows and flight durations, and for \u0022Return from\u0022 contracts return windows and return durations. These could be set for ideal windows on Normal difficulty, but could also be set tighter for harder difficulty levels\u00A0giving a real challenge beyond grinding harder for building upgrades.

Say you want to go to\u00A0Minmus. Once the \u0022Flyby Minmus\u0022 Explore contract pops up you can accept that contract and receive an advance for going there. If you\u0027re ambitious you can plow right ahead to orbit or land with the same mission, and you\u0027ll still receive the reward for those tasks because they now count as Milestones and pay out automatically (ie, what used to be World Firsts are all now Milestones).

Even the dates I listed above start when you go interplanetary, which could easily put you at least halfway through the tech tree. In the early game as you\u0027re tackling the Mun and Minmus and maybe an asteroid or two the timings are a lot more flexible. You can easily go Orbital the first day, and a round trip to the Mun takes less than 3. Minmus is a 20 day round trip, but asteroids could take over 250 days. The question is if we\u0027re talking about something like\u00A0time-based R\u002BD\u00A0how could that be calibrated to put pressure on that first Duna window on day 236? How are we challenging players to build up enough tech or just cowboy it? Lets say for the sake of argument you\u0027d want half of the tier 6 nodes and if you\u0027re lucky a couple of tier 7s like Nuclear Propulsion and Electronics before that point. To keep things simple lets also say you can research any number of nodes at one\u00A0time (though maybe this could be a product of building upgrades).\u00A0You could almost make it so each tier takes 7\u00A0more days than the one before it, so tier 1 takes 7\u00A0days, tier 2 takes 14\u00A0days, tier 3 21\u00A0days etc. Based on my own career so far that would have me in orbit by day 42, sending mun\u00A0probes and doing other contracts until day 84, and sending crewed missions to the Mun, Minmus, and setting up my station and satellite networks until day 185 or so.

If you can set your own deadlines then those deadlines don\u0027t actually matter very much, you can just time-warp through all your research and then accept the contract without having to think about anything. You\u0027ve added more clicking and maybe a bit of role playing but you haven\u0027t actually added \u003Cem\u003Egameplay\u003C/em\u003E. Gameplay requires strategy and trade-offs, having to consider whether to time warp through a research node or whether you would gain more by running a riskier mission without those parts. If you never have to think about it because its \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E better to time-warp then you\u0027ve done a lot of work and added very little to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could of course set the Explore contract deadlines by a global clock rather than by the date those contracts were accepted, but that seems a little harsh, and leads to a situation in which missing a deadline to go to Duna means there will never be a reason to go to Duna.

They happen evenly over time regardless of what the player is doing.\u00A0This means players are penalized for time-warping in general rather than based the time-scale of the task at hand. Time based budgets place strong economic biases toward short-term vs long-term missions, and requiring a certain number of missions per year also encourages players to bang\u00A0out a few easy missions just to make the quota. The advantage to bonus deadlines is they can be precisely calibrated to specific tasks. Both the deadline is shorter and the bonus is smaller for a Mun Mission than for a Jool mission, which matters a lot. Its what allows you to scale rewards based both on the duration and the difficulty of the mission.
