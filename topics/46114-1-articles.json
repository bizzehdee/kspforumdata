Unfortunately, the atmosphere in KSP (or at least the drag) isn\u0027t that good yet. Chutes, rather than slowing your plane down, will stop your plane almost dead in its tracks. As far as stock goes, there\u0027s not much of a way to do it. I suppose, if you\u0027re feeling particularly Jeb-ish, you could try Xetalim\u0027s SRB suggestion...

For instance, if you put 1 large airbrake on each wing\u0027s top, the nose will tend to point upwards. My science on airbrakes is not perfect at all, but you can try placing evenly, behind the CoM.
