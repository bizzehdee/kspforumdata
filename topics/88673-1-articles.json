How hard can novel writing be, anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, you might remember my thread of Camp NaNoWriMo, so you would already know what this is, but in case you don\u0027t know: National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo for short) is a writers challenge. It challenges you to write 50,000 words of fiction in the month of November (about the length of \u003Cem\u003EThe Great Gatsby\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003EThe Catcher in the Rye\u003C/em\u003E). This breaks down to about 1,667 words a day. It\u0027s harder than it looks, but at the same time, not as hard as it might look at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, but I could never do that,\u0022 you might say. \u0022Novels are hard. They\u0027re for writers, and I\u0027m not one.\u0022 Well, guess what. The whole point is to get people who wouldn\u0027t normally write to put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard. Note that they said 50,000 words, not 50,000 \u003Cem\u003Ebrilliant\u003C/em\u003E words. It\u0027s a first draft. You can edit it after November.
