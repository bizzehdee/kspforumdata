Aerodynamics are actually important. The side of your rocket must be as smooth as possible.\n\nThe problem is that you have a small part (the stack separator) that is in the airflow, and a small heat sensitive component next to it. \n\nThough, admittedly, I\u0027ve also had some components mysteriously overheat while going quite \u0027slow\u0027. The thing is, it\u0027s always stuff sticking out into the airflow, or around a gap in an otherwise smooth surface."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:51:48Z","Content":"Glad you fixed it, change it to \u0022Answered\u0022 maybe?"},{"CreatedByName":"Poofer","CreatedById":110117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:59:00Z","Content":"Heat also transfers via conduction, meaning the heat from your rockets/parts that heat due to smashing into the air also go to the rest of the ship.\n\nthings you can do to prevent send heat where you want it.\n\n- don\u0027t attach service bays near science jrs. they act as insulators and won\u0027t let the science jr send heat away\n\n- attach solar panels on the science jr. they act as great radiators\n\n- attach service bay at the bottom of the ship, this will insulate the rocket heat from the rest of the ship."}]}
