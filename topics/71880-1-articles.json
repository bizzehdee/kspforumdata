However, due to the low value placed they often place on their short lives and their very focused one track minded intelligence, the actual average life span for Kerbins is only 87 Kerbin years. This is not to say that Kerbins don\u0027t value their lives but rather they value knowledge and principles more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E About their intelligence... Kerbins are a wildly intelligent race (mean IQ of 160 threshold for what they consider mental ******ation is 130 and below), however, their intelligence is framed by their short lives. They experience a very rapid mental development but have only a short time to gain wisdom from life experiences. This has lead to a peculiar technological progression as the Kerbins often solve problems the hard way centuries before they discover an elemental solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For example the Kerbin\u0027s use Maglev rail technology for ground transportation as they have not yet discovered the wheel. They use rocket powered lifting platforms to fly but have yet to understand the concept of lift, and believed that ascending above roughly 50,000m would result in a collision with the \u0022Cosmic Wallpaper\u0022 a term that is used to describe the Sun, Stars and M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. As such the Kerbins occupy a strange distinction in simultaneously being a very technologically advanced yet technologically backward species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Another large consequence of the Kerbins\u0027 extreme intelligence has been difficulty with communication; each child Kerbin often fully invents their own language in infancy as well as learning each of their parent\u0027s personal languages, their family language, and one of their country\u0027s primary regional languages. This occurs early in the first 12 or so Kerbin years of life after which language learning becomes much more difficult similar to the way it is in humans. Kerbins are still able to learn languages quite well as an adult but the sheer number of languages found on Kerbin and the often huge variation between them causes great difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The highly segregated nature of Kerbin language led to a great many wars of the history of Kerbinkind. Leading up to the events described here, the Kerbins had found themselves locked in a 130 Kerbin Year (38 Human Year) Kerbinwide War.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The invention of radio communications 42 years into the world had greatly increased the quality of Kerbin communication and started reducing the significant language barrier. By year 122 of the war, as a result of this increased communication and ongoing military conquests, the Kerbins slowly formed into three large superpowers along with a small number of smaller semi-independent countries each of whom had some sort of alliance with one of the superpowers. At this point public interest in the war was beginning to drop and many younger Kerbins hadn\u0027t been alive when the war started and had no appreciation for why they should be fighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this time around year 129 of the war that a Kerbin by the name of Lippershey Kerman of the Halo (pronounced aah-loe) superpower invented the telescope. (Yes though they had advanced missile technology, computers, and radio communications they missed something as simple as this for that long.) Lippershey, weeks afterwards was using his telescope to demonstrate to a group of Generals how his invention could be of use to spy on enemy movements both in daytime and nighttime settings. When the time came for the night demonstration everything was going well but when one of the Generals was looking through the telescope he was bumped into by one of his aids causing him to point the scope skyward. The General let out a \u0022Waaaaooooowww\u0022 as he looked at the far greater number of stars than he was used to seeing and swung the telescope through the sky to rest on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. He excitedly had everyone come look and many exclaims of \u0022Waaaaooooowww\u0022 where heard. One General, General Jool Kerman decided to point at a particularly bright star in the sky and was absolutely floored to find it was actually quite green and looked and had swirling shapes over its surface as well as being a discernible round shape and not a single point of light. The meeting was quickly adjourned as the generals rushed to tell the President of their findings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President of Halo, Duna Kerman, upon hearing of the telescope and the things that were seen in the sky quickly had several top scientists put on the project of discovering more and appointed Lippershey Kerman to develop a more powerful version of his telescope. After several months and with the help of a more powerful telescope the scientists came to the conclusion that Kerbin was not the center of the universe and that it in fact was circling the Sun along with other \u0022planets\u0022 including the one they named Jool after General Jool, and Duna named after President Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs word of these new discoveries leaked to the general public and the other superpowers, demand for telescopes shot through the roof overnight. From small civilian use up to building sized scientific telescopes, every single Kerbin individual, business, and government organization had to have a telescope. The only industry that could produce parts to the tolerance necessary for large telescopes was the defense industry. Telescopes where in such high demand that profit margins on telescopes where 10 times the profit margins on weapons systems. As such, most defense industry companies ceased weapons production altogether to focus on telescope production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, with political and societal interests focused solely on the heavens and weapons no longer readily available, the Kerbinwide War ended with a whimper as soldiers everywhere either ran out of weapons or where too busy looking through their telescopes to fight in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever before had one single discovery so excited every Kerbin in such a universal way. Every Kerbin alive could agree that it seemed their manifest destiny to move out and conquer this new universe they now saw before them. In wake of this public sentiment the remaining nations joined themselves together under a new government the Postwar Unified Nation of Kerbania (P.U.N.K) with the charter that a full 15% of all tax revenue would be devoted solely to space exploitation. The agency within PUNK devoted to this task was the Kerbanian Space Exploitation Agency (KSEA).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbinLightning","CreatedById":110694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T04:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe Players:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSEA\u003C/strong\u003E - Government space exploration agency with unprecedented level of funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 1 Contractors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Incorporated (Ticker: KMPI) \u003C/strong\u003E- Kerlington started off as a humble paper products company in the Halo Nation prior to the KerbalWide War.
