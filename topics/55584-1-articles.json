Then me too; but I don\u0027t blame KSP here, as it happens only with the latest beta-driver (which I have installed, as it\u0027s noticably faster on my laptop). Had no problems before the driver upgrade. Well, it\u0027s a beta-driver anyway. And fix is easy: after playing, don\u0027t suspend, but shutdown instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI regularly got a bluescreen from this driver some months ago. As it turned out, it was caused by Adobe Flash Player. Every time I had multiple tabs including flash plugins (which I regularly had in the background while gaming), chances were that the video driver would crash at some point. This not only happened with KSP but with multiple games, and actually in pure Desktop mode as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t get rid of flash, try uninstalling and reinstalling Adobe Flash Player. Since I\u0027m using Windows 8, there is no custom Adobe Flash installation anymore, since Internet Explorer includes them since a few months. And so far no more crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liamthom","CreatedById":73459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kzauner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kzauner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean when resuming after a suspend?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by Suspend?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand myself i think i have found a fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
