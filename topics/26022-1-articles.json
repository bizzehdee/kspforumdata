This will put you in an orbit that takes less time to complete, thus you can catch up; Vice versa if it\u0027s behind you. Once you\u0027re close (within ~30 k) kill all relative velocity (click on the navball until it says TGT and burn retrograde). Then aim at the purple/pink circle (as this is will point you towards the target vessel) and get up to 50 m/s relative velocity towards it. If you\u0027re somewhat far away, you may need to do some quick course corrections along the way. I do some complex tangent-to-target burns to save fuel, but you can just kill all relative velocity and start again if it\u0027s your first time rendezvousing. Good luck, and I hope this helps you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can just eyeball the orbits when you\u0027re starting to rendezvous, matching orbits to begin with is useless if the target vessel isn\u0027t right in front of you.

Rotate view until you are looking at the orbits from the same plane, and you will be able to see if you are passing north (above) or south (below) the target at closest approach. If you are passing south, point the nose of your ship due north and fire the engine. This should cause the line of your path to rise and meet that of the target. Once the intercept markers appear, you can further fine-tune your intercept. Try to get it within 2kms, and then you can close the final distance with short burns and RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tricio","CreatedById":60516,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T17:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow , Outstanding Comments from all of You , Thank You very much , Very interesting , Wish me luck ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I will post back If I have managed my 1st DOCK \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
