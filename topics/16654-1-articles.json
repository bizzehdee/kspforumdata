I attempted one by using the Mun to reach Kerbol orbit, and it worked. I have no clue how to see how efficient the maneuver was compared to a Hoffman out of the system, so could someone please do the math for me?

In the best case scenario for a Mun slingshot, the break even point is around 1200m/s of needed velocity when exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI. This is about 300m/s delta-v. I used 100km as parking orbit around Kerbin, and 3km periapsis for the Mun slingshot. Past expending 300 delta-v, it would be more efficient to do the escape trajectory directly from Kerbin orbit. This is also assuming you transfer to the mun such that your periapsis is on the back retrograde sector of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-12T03:49:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2012 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Kosmo-not\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silicon014","CreatedById":39039,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T14:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell then my hopes are dashed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.
