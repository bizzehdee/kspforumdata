I have a suggestion to modders or Squad itself to improve the contracts for carrier mode. (i suggested nothing what is in the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 list.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You know the missions like: \u0022set a probe on this orbit\u0022, or \u0022test boosters on xxx height and xxx speed\u0022, or \u0022build a station (base) - with no further purpose\u0022, or \u0022take a crew report below (above) xxx height at xxx region\u0022, or \u0022discover celestial body\u0022 - quite fast becomes boring and even annoying, because you don\u0027t feel like the Kerbalkind is alive and they want to conquer the space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E (as it was said), you don\u0027t feel like there is something you have to explore. You can explore Dres and then test boosters on flight over Kerbin, or you can not explore Dres and just test boosters and launch probes on the determined orbits around Kerbin - it doesn\u0027t realy matter in such reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I suggest to make some kind of long-ranged scenarios (missions) when your decesions will make some changes in the nearest future. For example: you take a contract to build a station on the orbit around Eve, after succes and approximately a year (or a half) later you have to deliver two scientists to the station, some kind of science equipment, life support and put three probes (with special equipment) on geostationary orbit around Eve to help scientist. About 1-2 years after that you have to take those kerbals back or deliver new portion of supplies and instruments, also you have to deliver their successful experiments to Kerbin safe and sound and so on...(but make this kinda sequnce of grouped missions just in 3-4 stages = 3-4 united missions, i think more will be exhausting and become boring \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also i think it will be cooler to add some moments of AI control, when you can feel like the R\u0026amp;D has its own aims and you (as an administrator of Space Agency and some kind of God) just help them to do their job. As for example let\u0027s get back to our scientists on Eve orbit. So you can\u0027t control them, you can observe the station, but you can\u0027t do IVA. You see some kind of job is doing there: kerbals are doing EVA and put some experiments outside the station or repairing the shell of the ship or something like that. Another example: when you delivered the astronauts to the red planet you can see they\u0027re moving on the map or you see the icon of the base on the map and then *bam* and icon of the astronaut EVA appeared, * bam* another one - and actually they are doing some stuff, not just standing. Maybe they\u0027re exploring the planet, maybe they\u0027re testing something, maybe they\u0027re building another living module or maybe they just came out for a walk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I think that AI control will be good only in carrer mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also i think there is a little problem with Solar system in carrer mode. You know the presence of atmosphere, it\u0027s height, you know the value of g etc. of the celestial body but you have never explored it, you know everything about it but you have never seen it before - how is it possible? Please make exactly the exploration (not sexploration) of this Solar System not \u0022checking the given information about it\u0022. Because how can we explore the Kerbin (at the beginning of the carrer) and get science for it if we already know everything about Eeloo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In conclusion i want to say that at this stage the game is quite cool, but: the carrier, science and sandbox modes are not so different, the only major differences is in carrer mode you need science and money, in science mode you need only science and money is free and in the sandbox mode everything is free - not a big deal. Kerbals are like the dolls and the Solar System is like a big sandbox - the problem is that dolls want nothing, they have no goals, no desires, they are not even alive, but you can control them making the illusion of life in it; In the sandbox you can do what you want to do with your dolls, but the sandbox is already explored and hides no secrets - that is not interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
