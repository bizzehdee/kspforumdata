I couldn\u0027t build (much less fly) a rocket to save my life, but I\u0027m learning fast. I\u0027m also trying to figure out how to design a working manned rover, but it\u0027s slow going.

It could be driven, but would tip over on anything tighter than a wide turn.) A manned M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landing is pretty much out of the question, unless I could somehow fly a spaceplane there and land it. My best friend is impressed to no end that I play this.

(Build them and see what works or crashes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rockets, just start out simple with a capsule, parachute, and an RT-10 SRB. Do one flight straight up and see how high it will go. Observe how overpowered it is and its tendency to overheat. Note what happens to the RT-10 when it lands on the ground. Fly it again but use the d key to turn it a little to the East so you land in the ocean. Note what happens to it there. Put a decoupler between it and the capsule and stage at burnout.
