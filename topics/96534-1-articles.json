That\u0027s about all I can remember about the context\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, here are those two novel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the first one was about the two main characters who had to do an math exercise for school. The exercise was something like: \u0022in the municipal forest, there is x oak per acre, y [another type of wood, can\u0027t think of another one right now] per hectare. the forest is z hectare. How much oak and [other type of wood] is there in the forest.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey found that exercise very difficult because of the conversion between acre and hectares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if all the farm animals helped them, the solution wasn\u0027t found. So, they decided to do something simpler(I\u0027m being sarcastic here): simply go in their municipal forest and count the trees(simple, isn\u0027t it?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey did that, backed with other animals(if I recall correctly) and found the \u0022solution\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, all the farm animal went to school to see the result of the problem, because they was proud. BUT, as you can guess, they didn\u0027t found the correct solution. The animals weren\u0027t happy, and a chicken said that, because the exercise weren\u0027t corresponding to something real, it wasn\u0027t valable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn inspector was passing nearby to... inspect and said that the girls(and the animals) was right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s the second novel(I dont remember a lot of details)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)the two girls imagine, before going to sleep, how cool it would be to be a horse(I think it was after a argument with their parents, but I\u0027m not sure). The next day, after they slept they discover they became horses during the night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the novel, the parents have less and less money(they have to buy the food for their children) so they start selling the farm animals. At the end, I remember that the two girls forgot how to talk because they didn\u0027t talked enough. Also, their parents sale them(I think they was separated but I\u0027m not sure at all about that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:I just remembered that, after being sold, they woke up in their bed without being horses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you went trough this text, I want to thank you.
