On the other hand, the Shuttle costed about $450 million per launch (or over $1 Billion per launch, depending on your source), and had a average launch rate (excluding the launch pauses due to the Shuttle disasters) of 3-4 per year.

The actual cost to add a mission should be more modest (though I\u0027m not sure exactly what it is). The real limiting factor is the cost of payloads. Spirit and opportunity cost somewhere around 250 million for the launches (based on other recent Delta II launches), out of a budget of 820 million for the first 90 days. The nice thing about the shuttle was that the payload was mostly already sitting there.
