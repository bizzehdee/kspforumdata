Falcon Heavy doesn\u0027t have to be in competition with SLS; it can be used to supplement the larger launcher for smaller components that can be attached over many launches (Manning of a mothership to Mars, for example.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe difference between SLS and Falcon Heavy is that the Falcon infrastructure and boosters are shared with Falcon 9.

Congress didn\u0027t care how much Apollo cost, they just cared that they landed on the moon before the Soviets. If a future president wants to land people from their country on Mars before another country, congress would fund it no matter how expensive it is. The SLS will definitely have fewer launches per year than the Shuttle, because less of it is reusable. But, the Shuttle\u0027s $1 billion pricetag may have partially because it was not expendable; the reusable-ness was more of an advantage in launches per year than cost. Mainly due to recovery costs from the boosters and refurbishing everything. The SLS\u0027 first flight should be a manned lunar landing, since we should at least get something out of it besides a circumlunar flyby and a asteroid rendezvous before it gets cancelled. Orion imo should have a Soyuz-like orbital module on top in the form of a BA-330.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
