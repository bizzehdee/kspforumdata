I\u0027ve tried this on a clean install where only those two mods are present. I don\u0027t know what information will be most useful, but here\u0027s what happens:\u003Cp\u003E-TweakScalable parts (like Squad stuff) can be scaled as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Procedural tanks can be scaled in diameter in length, but the shape can\u0027t be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When the procedural tanks are scaled, the attach nodes scale in size but do not move with the new, larger size of the tank (they remain in space where they would have been for the initial 1.25m size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-However, when you then attach the procedural tank to a command pod, for instance, using one of the nodes that are now visually inside the part, the pod is pushed to the top surface of the tank anyway as if the node were actually on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a lot of other mods installed, and after trying random attempted fixes like deleting all but one KSPAPIExtensions.dll, I managed to make it so that no parts showed up in the VAP/SPH part lists at all, but I don\u0027t know how to replicate that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving the KSPAPIExtensions.dll from the ProceduralParts/Plugins directory (thinking that might be the conflict) makes procedural parts all appear identical in the VAB (as opposed to the decoupler appearing flatter, the RCS tank being more squat and having a different texture, etc.) and breaks their scaling completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to a log file (from the attempt where I did NOT delete Proc Parts\u0027 .dll), let me know if something else would be more helpful: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/KSP.log\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/KSP.log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a short test, it seems to me that removing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProcedural Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s copy of KSPAPIExtensions.dll fixes the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EI strongly disagree with their placement of the dll, as it\u0027s a dll that is used by other projects and should therefore reside in a common directory, and I\u0027ve thus \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676?p=1169652#post1169652\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Einformed\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E the mod creator.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT]A short talk with swamp_ig later, I\u0027ve found his reasons to be sound.
