The plane wobbles when input is zeroed, but not when input is first provided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words (contrary to Marvin\u0027s opinion) this is nothing like how normal planes behave and is a result of the specific behaviour of KSP aerodynamics. The soupy atmosphere combined with the effectiveness of control surfaces at deflection means planes can turn way, way harder than they would normally be able to. In real life this would result in massive sideslip, spins, tearing off of wings, and so on, but not in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for whatever reason the effectiveness of control surfaces only seems to come into play when they are actually being engaged with input. When you zero the input and the control surfaces return to a \u0022neutral\u0022 position, all of their control effectiveness appears to be lost. In other words, they\u0027ll let you turn hard when you provide input, but they won\u0027t then hold your course equally as hard when you stop providing input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried adding symmetrical and balanced control surfaces to the craft with deflection and unbinding them from all inputs. For example, two small horizontal control surfaces at the rear, both on the centreline, with one pitched up a few notches and the other equally pitched down a few notches, then similarly near the front to balance out the lift and drag, and all locked to not respond to any input. But this didn\u0027t seem to make a difference. In other words, the super powerful force of control surfaces seems to come quite specifically when input is provided, but not otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to note is that (according to the VAB CoL indicator) vertical stabilizers will start to provide lift when the aircraft is rolled. For example, roll left in the VAB without vertical stabilizers and the CoL stays pointed along the normal out through the top of the craft. But add vertical stabilizers and do the same thing, and the vertical stabilizers will now produce an upwards force when the craft is rolled left, meaning your CoL now points not normal from the top, but angled slightly towards the right of normal (closer to vertical). I don\u0027t know if this is how they actually behave in game, but if so that would obviously contribute to instability during turns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T17:33:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T17:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happens in real life too.

Because the stock model doesn\u0027t account for drag by shape, the solution was to have the control surfaces add a force opposite their movement.

If you want to remove the wobble, you would need to perform your maneuvers more slowly than what the video shows. You may say that that is as slow as you can do it, but you COULD turn on fine control. If that doesn\u0027t work either, then using SAS and fine control should work much better.
