The ant requires me to be in a sub-orbital trajectory of between 70,000 and 83,000 and the NERV Atomic engine requires me to be in an escape trajectory. I\u0027ve met the requirements for both contracts and got green ticks in the contract window, yet when I activate the engines, the missions don\u0027t complete. Every other contract similar to this previously have gone without a hitch, but these two just won\u0027t complete and I don\u0027t want to lose the money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what could be wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T11:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell It could be that you\u0027ve activated the engines before in the flight. Also a condition is that, you only see it when you hit the \u0027\u002B\u0027 button on the contract, is that you have to \u0027activate the engine trough staging or by right clicking on the engine -\u0026gt; \u0027run test\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to activate them through the staging process once the other parameters are met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that they don\u0027t need to actually work.
