Not the type of particle that delivers it. Granted, at moderate energies, a proton will deliver higher CoM energy in collision with an electron simply due to its mass. So that could be a factor. The other thing is that there might be more charged particles than energetic photons coming in from the Sun. But otherwise, the two types of radiation are the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at some info on Wikipedia, it looks like most dangerous radiation is going to come from Solar Particle Events, which results in up to 10MeV proton bursts. That\u0027s heavy ionizing radiation, but the protons themselves are going to be strictly classical due to their mass, traveling at roughly 1% c. If you try to deflect these with a mag field, cyclotron radius formula applies. p = Bqr. At 1 kGauss, that\u0027s over 30cm turning radius.

I also can\u0027t picture it anything other than a 2U mission. That could be a budget\u002B option. But for base, I\u0027d go with a jar fixed within the body of a 1U, with about half of the volume taken by a 10x10x5 pill box jar, and the other half with electronics and attitude control hardware. Sensors can go into corners around the jar as well. Solar panels can then probably go on the sides. Back wall would be open, allowing sun light. Two cameras can be installed on the board, one pointing forward, the other back through the jar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want to generate up to about 1m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of artificial gravity in the jar, we can just spin the whole sat at roughly 30RPM. Spinning much faster than that would make it difficult to track rotation with horizon sensors. And I doubt we can completely avoid axis tumbling or some excess torques. Hopefully, however, the whole thing can be corrected with magnetotorquer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does that sound for basic mission? Because this we can probably put together on minimum budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know bugger all about biology, however. I know people have made some completely enclosed mini-biospheres with some algae and plancton. But I\u0027ve got no clue what one would need to set this up.
