However, I am currently stumped on a contract I can\u0027t get in position for.\u00A0 I am trying to measure temperatures while in space flight above the Mun, but I cannot seem to get into position.\u00A0 I plan a maneuver that appears to line up with the zones needing measured, but when I come around my orbit where I thought I would be above the correct positions I am always off, and not by small amount, but several degrees off.\u00A0 Any pointers on this matter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorforce7","CreatedById":94677,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-02T09:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA picture with your craft in map view please that includes your current orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut my bet is that you require temperature readings near the polar region and your orbit is not inclined enough so you\u0027ll never pass over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moon has no tilt so the day/night border on the poles is the exact geographical north. If your orbit line is tilted away atleast slightly from this point your will miss some of the surface area.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEither that or you go below instead of above.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had that a few times as I mixed certain temperature reading missions and tried to go below a certain area while I had to aproach from above.

So you have to realize which direction the Mun is spinning, and about how fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, if you are in a high orbit, the Mun will rotate a long way while you orbit slowly around. So it\u0027s best to stay down low -- just a bit above (or below) where you are supposed to take the reading. Then you eyeball how much the Mun rotates while you orbit once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to make sure I\u0027m lined up for a couple orbits ahead of the target, myself. The waypoint zones usually seem to be fairly small. On rare occasions I\u0027m just on one side of the zone on one pass, then just on the other side during the next pass, even when I\u0027m orbiting low - but that\u0027s rare, as I said. But doing it that way gives you a couple shots at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-02T10:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just put the craft in polar orbit. It will eventually reach the zone. The slower celestial body rotates, the better, you could have more than one chance per Sol.
