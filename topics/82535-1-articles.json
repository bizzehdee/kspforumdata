But yes, you will need decouplers or docking ports if you want to remove something from the cargo bay. The best way to put something in there (if you want to use the nodes) is to take either the front or the back of the plane off and pick a view where you can see the node without it intersecting any part of the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T21:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a stackable part (like the octagonal strut) to reach the exact center.
