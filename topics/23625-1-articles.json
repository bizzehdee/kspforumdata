The only realistic way was to develop it on Kerbin, which has a larger gravity well. If it works there, it will work on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy initial design just about worked, but my ascent profile was awful. I switched off the jets at a mere 600 m/s and clawed my way to orbit on a pair of aerospikes, arriving there with almost no fuel left, with most attempts not even doing that and falling back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a few tips here, and my final design is something I\u0027m actually rather proud of. It takes off vertically, gets to around 1,200 m/s before firing up the rockets, and arrives in orbit with plenty of fuel to rendezvous and dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring development of this though, I learned a lot abut how to get an SST vehicle into orbit, and slowly figured out the variables I had to balance to get the thing to behave through hypersonic flight into the high atmosphere, and then transition to the orbital insertion rocket burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played around with one or two vertical take off SSTO designs, managing one that was able to get out beyond Dres\u0027 orbit without refuelling, all in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it occurred to me that I\u0027d probably climbed most of the learning curve I needed to climb to build an actual spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m pleased to report that, after returning to the SPH, I have now built, from scratch (not modifying a stock design), an SSTO, piloted spaceplane that can ascend to orbit, dock, reenter and land. My first practical design is nicely balanced and behaves beautifully in hypersonic flight, unlike my first attempts where touching the controls between 18,000 and 35,000m would typically be followed almost immediately by an abort to surface, if the vehicle actually stayed together!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo-longer am I terrified of the dark arts practiced in the SPH; things seem to have \u0022clicked\u0022, and I have a feeling that my standard way to get kerbals into space will now involve taking off from a runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt feels like a whole new area of the game has opened up!

If I explain my ascent profile, the ram intakes may become clear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off from runway with just the ram intakes open (scoops closed due to drag), climb at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and terminal velocity (ish) to around 14,000.

Open air scoops, start to climb at 50-100 m/s rate of climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 25,000 metres and something like 1,200 m/s, the air starts to give up (people better at this than me can get this higher). Throttle back to about 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s usually about now that I kick in the aerospike. The plane is still climbing, but under reduced power and the acceleration has slowed. The aerospike, together with the jets at lower power, keeps the acceleration and ascent going. Keep reducing power to prevent flameout\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere around 30,000 metres, it starts to get tricky. There is almost no air left. The jets are sipping fuel, as is the aerospike. Using them much more risks a flameout. At this point the plane is traveling at about 1,500 m/s. if we wait any longer then we will catch up to the apoapsis and start to descend. This is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKill the jets, close all air intakes. Full throttle immediately. The aerospike roars to life. Check map view. The apoapsis should be in front of you and running away. If it looks like you\u0027re going to catch it up, increase your angle of attack. BE CAREFUL. If your plane isn\u0027t well balanced, changing the angle of attack here could cause it to spin out of control. My earlier attempts were prone to this and needed RCS assistance at this stage. Now I\u0027m building them somewhat better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch the navball change from \u0022Surface\u0022 to \u0022Orbit\u0022. With the plane still below 40,000 metres, the apoapsis will shoot away and a periapsis will appear. Let the apoapsis climb to around 100,000 metres and cut the power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric friction will now start to bring the apoapsis back down, but we have built up enough speed and have enough vertical momentum to carry us clear of the atmosphere before it drops below 70k. Glide to orbit, circularise, feel smug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why you need the air intakes. The jets formidable ISP and power means they can push the plane through the atmosphere and attain speeds that would require very heavy rockets to match. If you have to switch to rockets at altitudes where the air is still producing a lot of drag, you will burn all your fuel trying to keep the apoapsis in front of you, and the fall back to Kerbin. It\u0027s all about going as high as possible and as fast as possible on jets alone, so that the fuel-thirsty rocket has to do as little work as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haemogoblin","CreatedById":57864,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T12:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks Comrade \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not braved spaceplanes yet but I\u0027ve a feeling that info you just gave will be invaluable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what does a good spaceplane assent profile look like?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got halfway through the OP when I realized I was reading it in poem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI posted a pic of the prototype.
