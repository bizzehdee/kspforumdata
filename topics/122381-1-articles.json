Create a simple plane. Fly the plane and crash it as close as possible to the vessel on the pad. Assuming the plane is destroyed the focus will switch to the vessel on the launch pad but the IVA from the plane will be superimposed on the Mk1-2 pod and the pilot of the plane will show up as a blank portrait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022why\u0022 it happens, that would be a question for the devs rather than any normal forum member but, given it appears to still be present, they probably don\u0027t explicitly know \u0022why\u0022 or they would most likely have fixed it by now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the MIA thing only seems to happen when the vessels have the same kind of crew carrying part and it is the first crew part on each vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T00:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait a sec the KIA screens are still in game?!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T01:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SemiaCloud\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SemiaCloud\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWait a sec the KIA screens are still in game?!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn spirit, but not function, yes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you recover that pod, do all the Kerbals survive?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forum wants to correct \u0022Kerbals\u0022 to \u0022Kernels\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
