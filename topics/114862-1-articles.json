I\u0027ve noticed that when it does go supersonic it does go off like a rocket (well, Ramjet) - but what\u0027s the best way to get upto speed? Is my SSTO too heavy perhaps? Is it worth trying to boost it to supersonic speeds right off the deck with some SRBs? Should I be trying to go as fast as possible at low altitude, or get up into thinner air above 10,000m before trying to accelerate above 300\u002B?\n\nAny pointers would be gratefully received!\n\nWemb\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T15:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:01:14Z","Content":"Not enough power.

As Sharpy said ... with too little, you\u0027re not going to go hypersonic. However, the other direction is even more disastrous- as too much engine can easily lead to detonations below 10km if you don\u0027t hold back on the throttle. That said, you still want enough to climb at 45 degrees and hit peak speed before 25km or so - which can be close to 1500 m/s with enough turbos."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:21:39Z","Content":"They are talking about the rapier, the whiplash is the turbojet engine.

Best to just try it out once you understand and can fly the generic flight profile.\n\nIn aerobic flight, the most demanding point on engine power is the sound barrier. If you can pass that, you can get to the edge of aerodynamic performance. If you are on the edge of power requirements, a shallow dive can give you the additional energy needed to advance to Mach 2. RAPIERs have some of their best power to pressure at 10 km so plan your dive to be at 400 m/s at that height. Whiplash engines don\u0027t have an obvious height to dive through, but it can be difficult to maintain a climb past angels 12 if you need that dive for power.\n\nAnerobic mode design is simply a matter of having 1600 m/s or more dV and unity or better TWR."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T22:56:53Z","Content":"I have not noticed whiplashes having a significant acceleration hump, unlike the rapiers, which is why I am confused. This has gone to orbit and returned, I am sorting out payload now (it turns out I probably no longer need so much room). It weighs around 80t wet and achieves 1250m/s at around 11-12k on just the whiplashes. It doesn\u0027t even need the nuke (in fact is a lot better balanced) without, it was just there for a mission idea I had which probably won\u0027t work out. This was based on my payload fraction challenge entry, just .....expanded. The frontmost fuel tank needs to be disabled during ascent to balance the nuke. Once in space transfer all fuel to the large tank in front of the cargo bay.\n\n![4oCYenl.png](http://i.imgur.com/4oCYenl.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T23:06:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T15:24:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have not noticed whiplashes having a significant acceleration hump, unlike the rapiers, which is why I am confused...\n\nIt\u0027s the change in versions - Scott Manley, whose design I ripped off, has just posted a video describing exactly what I\u0027m seeing in the new version - his design can\u0027t be flown as agressively in the latest version as before - I\u0027ll drop a fuel take and dump some oxidiser which was a problem with my design - this looks to be the solution that SMs doing to.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/SdmNv2ZyMmU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThanks for all the advice guys - I\u0027ll mark this as answered as soon as I read how to mark this as answered.\n\nCheers, Wemb"}]}
