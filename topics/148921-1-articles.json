As far as I can see the idea is to eliminate the costly insertion burn to enter orbit. The principle from the\u00A0few rather dumbed down articles I\u0027ve found it seems to be to almost match orbit with the target but going slightly slower and upon catching up with the spacecraft\u00A0the target body gravitationally captures it. Which sounds pretty simply but then how the hell do you do the first bit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get out to Mars orbit would require a transfer orbit would put apoapsis\u00A0somewhere out in Mars\u0027 orbital path and Periapsis\u00A0somewhere along Earth\u0027s. To \u0022match orbit\u0022 with Mars you\u0027d have to lift periapsis to up near Mars\u0027 orbital path which would presumably take a crap ton of fuel. Less than a capture burn? I don\u0027t get it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas trying to find some diagrams to explain the ideas but the only time this has been done is Earth -\u0026gt; Moon so those are the only ones I can find. As far as I can see its a lot of clever mucking about with\u00A0lagrange points to get into the correct orbit which obviously isn\u0027t applicable to Mars with its tiny moons and much high DeltaV required.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone explain? Articles explaining this kind of thing are always one of two extremes,\u00A0\u0022Too dumbed down to be useful\u0022 and \u0022University level mathematics required for understanding\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T13:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you maybe provide links to your articles?

I don\u0027t know how this would work with Mars, it has no moons with any kind of decent mass so I suppose you\u0027d need some kind of planetary conjunction. . . . which\u00A0strikes me as pretty specific circumstances\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T15:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image result for ballistic capture\u0022 src=\u0022http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll181/Keith_Gelling/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-18%20at%202.59.29%20pm_zpsuweymopa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRef: Belbruno \u0026amp; Topputo,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8856\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8856\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as far as I can see, the manoeuvre exploits the dynamics of the Mars-Earth-Sun system. It\u0027s a weak stability boundary (WSB) transfer (which are a horrible set of things to have to try and come to terms with fully, having spent much of the past half-day trawling papers on them) which involves a set of stable points around Lagrange points as far as I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the transfer is performed in such a way such that the burn to insert into the desired orbit (point x\u003Csub\u003Ec\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0in the diagram above) will have lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements (in some cases) that the burn that you would have to perform to shed excess hyperbolic velocity if you were doing a Hohmann transfer. These transfers have the advantage that they are not too sensitive to the relative position of the two planets - so you can transfer to Mars outside\u00A0the ideal window for Hohmann transfers - and that in certain cases they can save \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re trying to rationalise these orbits in terms of what you know from KSP, then don\u0027t. These transfers cannot be done in a 2-body regime because these orbits exploit features that don\u0027t exist in those regimes, so you\u0027ll just give yourself a headache for nothing \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-29T15:15:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2016 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T18:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing L1 to enter orbit around a planet ?
