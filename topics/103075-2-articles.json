Taking another step, it begs to be part of an Engineer\u0027s UI panel, allowing access to all craft tweak options without needing to hunt-and-click on a craft in flight.

First, the modder code might simply be a hack around the main code, that would not be needed if the devs made the feature themselves. Second, unlike other devs in another companies, AFAIK SQUAD does not force you to waive your IP when modding KSP automatically, so technically the modders code is not open for their use automatically ( leading to negotiations about it\u0027s usage that can be simply avoided if you just redo from scratch ). Third, the devs might believe that adapting the current mod code to the main code will be a bigger workload then doing it from scratch.

The cost of hiring more crews increases for each additional crew member in your active roster, that is, hiring your 30th Kerbal is much more expensive than hiring your 5th one. This cost increases based on your current active crew count. That means, for instance, that going through 100 Kerbals would be far less expensive than having a roster with a hundred active ones.\n\nHaven\u0027t seen anyone talk about this yet.

That kills the incentive to run multiple simultaneous missions (something I tend to do a lot of).
