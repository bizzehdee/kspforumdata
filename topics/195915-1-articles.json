If yes, make a copy of your entire KSP folder because a reinstall might erase settings, then reinstall KSP to get the file (use Steam \u0022beta\u0022 function to get versions earlier than 1.10). After installation copy just the 1 missing file to the copied folder, and play from that new folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T02:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201293-deadjohn/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201293\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201293-deadjohn/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DeadJohn\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that porves to be very helpful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T03:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your on Steam, you can just right click the entry in your library, select Properties, and verify your files.\u00A0\u00A0 That should replace the missing exe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T15:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI re-installed ksp at this point, so all that\u2019s left is to re-download mods.
