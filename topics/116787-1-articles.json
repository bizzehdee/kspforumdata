your TWR increases as your rocket climbs out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere due to the lost fuel from burning it, so you\u0027ll have to learn how to decrease your throttle, which helps conserve fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E learning to pilot your rockets efficiently is a very vital key skill in this game that you\u0027re going to have to learn. you can\u0027t just burn with the Z key all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother skill to use is gravity turning, I\u0027ll touch more on this later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce in orbit, you can dock with a re-usable nuclear tug and burn chemical engines to escape kerbin\u0027s SOI (~1500 dV) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce you\u0027re orbiting the sun, TWR becomes almost meaningless so shut down your chemical engines and use the nuclear tug to setup your interplanetary rendezvous with your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce you\u0027ve arrived at your target, switch back to chemical engines and set a stable orbit, undock from the nuclear tug and plan your landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you\u0027re doing a return trip, you can use the same nuclear tug that you left in orbit, refuel if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etips on nuclear tugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N nukes are LF engines that don\u0027t need oxidizer, and only work best in a vacuum and have a high ISP making them ideal for longer burning times. however, they\u0027re pretty heavy engines so it\u0027s usually not a good idea to permanently keep them on your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe best use for these engines is in situations where TWR doesn\u0027t matter, such as interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 FT-800 tank (with oxidizer removed) will give you about 5 and a half minutes of burn time, you only need 1 LV-N per 100t of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso for example, if you\u0027re hauling 220t of stuff to the Jool system, you only need 2 LV-N engines and a single Rockomax-32 tank without oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etips on gravity turning: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can\u0027t just burn straight up and expect to reach orbit. what goes up, eventually comes down. you\u0027ll have to use a gravity turn to initiate an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity turning varies as each vessel is built differently, but a general guideline is to use surface mode on the navball and a radial lock during pre-launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif your vessel has any boosters that it would shed, you might want to fight the radial tracking to lead the rocket away from the Launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen the vessel reaches 22kM, switch to orbit mode on the navball and use prograde tracking. your vessel *should* gravity turn by itself all the way into sub-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen you\u0027re at your AP, circulate, but it shouldn\u0027t be much of a burn since gravity turning did most of the work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etips on docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour orbital AP should be about the same height as your docking target. it doesn\u0027t have to be exact, but the closer, the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen you circulate your orbit, make sure your PE is higher than 70kM but below the target\u0027s altitude. this will give you an egg-shaped orbit that isn\u0027t shaped like your docking target\u0027s orbit; this is the secret to an orbital rendezvous, one vessel will have a shorter orbit than the other, eventually they will pass each other. all you need to do is make sure you\u0027re close to the target then match your orbital speed. so what you need to do next is to time warp until the two vessels meet, switch the navball to target mode and burn chemical engines in the Retrograde direction until your navball reads between 1 or 2 m/s; this is your speed relative to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eset target lock and give a short burn towards your target, you shouldn\u0027t need to go faster than 20m/s because eventually you will have to slow down again, so time warp until you\u0027re really close. while you\u0027re in target lock, your prograde indicator should be aligned with your target (and your navball pointer) if not, you can use RCS to make the necessary course adjustments until it is aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, on a separate note, when setting your inclination to your target, know that your \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EA\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Escending \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EN\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Eode requires \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EA\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Enti-\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EN\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Eormal burns.
