Make it usable not just something that isnt used\n\n5. Just post your Idea below if you want add some diagrams for displaying points or uses of the fuel tank\n\nthe poll is simply used to inform me of what type of fuel tank to create\n\nThis mod will be covered by a CC-BY-NC 4.0 licence\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T12:43:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lowaltitude**\n  \noutlining the basic idea for the mod"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T11:24:53Z","Content":"Probe sized and/or radially attached would be sweet ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T11:26:34Z","Content":"I need some large radial sized tanks\n\nI really need a good set of universal cryostat tanks for KSPI, which can be attached and detached magneticly.\n\n![Nautilus-X_Extended_duration_explorer.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Nautilus-X_Extended_duration_explorer.png)\n\nThe idea is to \u0022release\u0022 the tanks as soon as they are empty.
