It needs to be small, much smaller than the other scanners, because it is meant to be used on rovers and planes and such.

The model is somewhat similar too, but that\u0027s not intentional. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radar dish is similar to some missile detection systems and naval firing control systems, although much smaller, so it seems at least somewhat plausible as a close range anomaly detector. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few problems with my current design though. The complex animations (there are four of them) require a separate plugin to work correctly, and don\u0027t work well with damny\u0027s plugin. The scanner function works, but it ignores the animations or whether or not the dish is deployed or not. My thinking is to make the orange light and text flash while no anomalies are nearby, then switch to the green light when an anomaly is detected. I don\u0027t know how to do this, or if it\u0027s easily possible. It will require input from damny\u0027s plugin; obviously there is some event triggered when an anomaly comes into range, I just don\u0027t think I can integrate my plugin with that though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the .gif above I\u0027m just manually triggering all of the animations. One for the dish and light deployment, one for the dish spinning, one for the orange light, and one for the green light. Obviously that\u0027s not a good solution. I can integrate the deploy animation easily enough with the regular SCANsat module, but if I want anything else to happen I need my own plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if there is already some plan or part in the works for this model I can retract my submission and adapt it for use in my own part set, so that\u0027s no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sethnizzle","CreatedById":22985,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T20:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, I totally agree with you that the BTDT model needed to be different.
