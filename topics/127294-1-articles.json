The drills, converter /\u00A0ore storage\u00A0/\u00A0fuel storage units and delivery modules are each on separate landers, and they\u0027re interconnected utilizing KAS parts (winches and connector ports). Now, this was from 1.0.2, before waste heat from the drills and converters became a real concern - which is why you don\u0027t see any radiators on those landers at all. No reason why they couldn\u0027t be added for a 1.0.5 rig. Anyway, the point of the converter here was specifically so that the\u00A0delivery lander (shown front right) could top off its tanks after reconnecting to the rest of the rig. There was sufficient storage aboard the converter unit that the lander could top off both its fuel and its ore supply instantly, requiring a delay for fueling the storage unit every other trip. The delivery module would take off\u00A0and rendezvous with the orbiting station, which itself had another converter unit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vSUl8ya.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vSUl8ya.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my Munar station.

The ore processed at the station would be specifically used to refuel all the craft there - including the delivery unit itself. By having a converter at both ends, it was possible to build a lander with a very limited amount of delta-V while it was fully loaded with substantial amounts of ore.

thing that allowed you to reset Goo and Materials experiments for use in multiple biomes.\u00A0 Nowadays, however, any beginning scientist can do that himself without a lab.\u00A0 In return, labs can now manufacture science over time but the amount they produce is tiny and the time required is huge, so it\u0027s just not worth the trouble (especially if you use life support).\u00A0 So since 1.0, I only bother with them at all when station and base contracts specify them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny sort of refueling operation within Kerbin\u0027s SOI is\u00A0worthless from an economics POV and considerably more trouble than it\u0027s worth to use just as something interesting to do.\u00A0 The only purpose served by doing it is to learn how the system works, so you can then use it at other planets where it actually makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of mining, from you original post, you had insufficient cooling to keep your stuff from exploding.\u00A0 When doing cooling, pick radiators based on the \u0022cooling required\u0022 of the hot part and the \u0022core heat xfer\u0022 ratiing of the radiators.\u00A0 The big ISRU needs 200kW, the small ISRU 100kW.\u00A0 Each big drill needs 100kW, each small drill needs 50kW.\u00A0\u00A0The standard arrangement is 1 ISRU and 2 drills all the same size, which means a big set totals 400kW and a small set 200kW.\u00A0 The fixed radiators do 200kW (large), 150kW (edge), and 50kW (small), while the retractable radiators do 1000kW (large), 250kW (medium), and 50kW (small).\u00A0 Retractable radiators generally run close to 100% efficiency because they turn edge-on to the sun, whereas with fixed radiators you\u0027ll need like 50% extra capacity to be safe, so I only recommend using retractables, for any application.\u00A0 This means that to keep a big mining set cool, you\u0027ll need 1 large or 2 medium or 8 small retractables.\u00A0 For a small set, you can use 1 medium or 4 small retractables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause all mined fuel is free, fuel efficiency in the process is not a major concern.\u00A0 Provided you can get the quantity you need to orbit in 1 trip (so you don\u0027t have to waste time making several trips), you\u0027re all good no matter how much you consume making the trip :).\u00A0 Thus, there\u0027s not a whole lot of reason to have separate ground-based mining/refining bases with fuel tankers flying the stuff to orbit.\u00A0 Just having the whole thing fly is by far the simplest solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason to go simple\u00A0isn\u0027t so much the mass of moving ore as opposed to fuel, or even\u00A0having to lift the ISRU and drills, it\u0027s because having it all in 1 vehicle totally eliminates the problem of docking on the ground, which is a bigger hassle than the pseudo-precision landing required before you can dock on the ground.\u00A0 After all, your ground mining base can be a\u00A0rover\u00A0 Provided the tanker lands in the general vicinity, the base rover can just drive a fairly short distance\u00A0over to it and drill and refine there instead of the tanker having to land right at the base.\u00A0 Such a base rover just needs an ISRU, 1 or 2 drills, power and cooling for the machinery,\u00A0some means of connecting to the tanker, and\u00A0only 1 of the smallest ore tanks, nothing else (if it has power to run its machinery, it has enough power to move).\u00A0 All the tanks for finished product are on the tanker lander.\u00A0 So you connect\u00A0rover to lander, start the drills, and ore goes into the small tank.\u00A0\u00A0 You then start the ISRU and product goes into the tanker.\u00A0 Continue until the tanker is full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real trick in this is connecting the rover to the lander.\u00A0 There are 3 methods.\u00A0 Docking\u00A0with ports is the worst and only really works reliably on the flats of Minmus.\u00A0 It utterly sucks everywhere else.\u00A0 Next there\u0027s the asteroid-grabbing \u0022Klaw\u0022.\u00A0 I still don\u0027t\u00A0trust this due to kraken-invoking issues although Squad says they\u0027ve solved lots of them in 1.05, plus it looks ugly.\u00A0 However, it does allow totally crewless operation.\u00A0 The final method is via the mods KIS/KAS.\u00A0 I find this the most reliable method for making the connection, although there are some annoying bugs you\u0027ll run into periodically (always pack extra pipe ends and tools as some will disappear) and it requires an engineer on EVA to make the connections.\u00A0 But OTOH, the whole mining/refining process works faster with an engineer aboard so you\u0027ll probalby have one available anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T22:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
