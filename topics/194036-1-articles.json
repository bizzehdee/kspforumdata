What operating system are you using (Windows, Mac, Linux?) Are the software drivers for your joystick installed and up to date? Did your joystick come with any control software to configure it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first thought is that it sounds like your joystick hasn\u0027t been calibrated. This is usually an option in the control panel settings in Windows and I think available in other operating systems which will tell the computer where the \u0022center\u0022 is on your joystick and sets up the movement boundaries. Just do a Google search for \u0022calibrating joystick\u0022 for your operating system and follow the relevant instructions. It\u0027s important to start the calibration with all of the axes in the center of their travel and then follow the steps that the calibration program tells you to do. Keep in mind that this is a configuration that is run by your operating system, or the programming that comes with your joystick, KSP doesn\u0027t do this itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might find it helpful to try installing a mod called \u0022Advanced Fly-by-wire\u0022 which changes the way KSP reads joysticks and it has its own calibration system added to it. There are different versions for Window, OSX, and Linux. If you need help installing mods, just ask, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/175359-19x-afbw-revived-joystick-controller-mod/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis is the forum thread for Advanced Fly-by-wire\u003C/a\u003E which might get you started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t used that particular joystick, so I can\u0027t say exactly if it works with the game or not, but I hope you find this information somewhat helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. After a quick search it seems that others have had similar problems, and it might be possible to install a program which intercepts the joystick inputs and passes them on to KSP to use. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/7wsqry/issue_with_joystick/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is the link to the reddit thread\u003C/a\u003E where I found some information on the topic.
