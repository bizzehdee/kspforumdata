I was trying to reach orbit in my KASA profile on career mode, and I was having some trouble.. I get above 70km Ap no problem, then I start burning near my Ap. It uses nearly all my fuel, and the Pe is not high enough so I just end up re-entering! I am still pretty new to the game, and I would like some help on how to fix this!

Turn earlier. Turn can start at 70m/s~100m/s, way below 10km altitude. Ideally prograde should be already pretty flat around 30km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Calculate your delta V - either by hand or by mod.
