If you do the following instead (without caring for the tutorial text):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- raise apoapsis to intercept target, at a cost of 280.5 m/s (25s burn duration);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- plane alignment then costs much less, only 260.5 m/s (22s);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- another burn to match the R/V position (or even some correction burns), that took me 91.4 m/s;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- zero relative speed at closest approach, for 145.7 m/s (11s);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eresulting in 786 m/s of DV still available (quite close to the amount saved by making the plane alignment maneuver at a higher altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t say from what you wrote why those maneuvers cost you so much more. You may not be keeping the maneuver node centered on the navball at all times (get help from the autopilot) or you may be burning not at the node, but too early or too late. For greater efficiency, each burn has to be done starting at \u0022Burn_duration\u0022/2 seconds before the node.
