This ship, as with all of my ships, are made entirely from stock vanilla KSP parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard Nebula Class Starship (NCS) is a long-range, interplanetary ship designed to carry crew and equipment to within range of distant celestial bodies and then proceed to serve as an orbital base/station while shuttle ships perform surface missions. The ship sports four LV-N Atomic, and four LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engines for general maneuvering as well as 2 large Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engines for large changes in delta V. Twin Toroidal Aerospike Rockets are also placed opposite the main engine blocks to provide retrograde burns without requiring the ship to turn around. In addition to the command bridge, the NCS features crew quarters to support up to 11 Kerbals at one time (not including space on docked shuttle ships), allowing for diverse crews on long range missions. Two docking bridges in the center of the ship are available to accommodate and carry up to two space planes as well as an additional two docks in the stern of the ship which are available for either lunar landers or remote-control refuel tankers (not pictured) with which to provide additional range to space plane missions. Finally, at the port just behind the command bridge, each NCS carries a payload of four long-range probes for advance scouting and information gathering on destination planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo TSC SP11-A Explorers docked with The Odysseus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://static.bf2s.com/files/user/14407/NCS4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NCS4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn SP11 docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://static.bf2s.com/files/user/14407/NCS3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NCS3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA launched probe maneuvering with its ion engine.
