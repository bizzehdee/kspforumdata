Doing so would mean the rocket would be cheaper to develop, and has been proven to work (though never on the scale of Liberty), such as with the use of the Centaur (originally developed for Atlas) on Titan IIIE, Castor 2 (originally developed for the Scout rocket) as the booster for Delta 0100, 1000, and 2000, the use of the Altair stage (originally developed for the Scout rocket) for the 2nd stage for the Delta C, and more recently, Minotaur (a rocket made largely of spare Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBM stages). \n\nHell, it works in KSP:sticktongue: (ok, that\u0027s a bad argument, admittedly, but still.)\n\nIs it just me, or am I missing something?"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:03:35Z","Content":"A manned 2015 flight?

I think it\u0027s design is sound (only one Shuttle SRB failure ever), though they probably would have undergone significant modifications to the Ariane core upper stage- it was too heavy by itself to run on a 5-seg, so they had to stetch it, for example. \n\nThough it was probably better for the rocket to never actually get built- the HLV market is getting quite crowded today!\n\nI think LEGO rocketry is a pretty good idea too when trying to reduce DEV costs.\n\nEither way, now that ATK merged wih Orbital, next time CCDev comes along, they probably will stap on boosters to the Antares, and make a spacecraft for CCDev.

Everything thinks that since you *can* shut down liquids, you ***have*** to shut down solids. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to shut them down - you just have to be producing zero (or very small positive) net thrust. The technology for doing so (venting the case) is old and well proven. (It was first deployed in the 1950\u0027s.)\n\nNow that brings up the obvious question, \u0022why didn\u0027t they try this with the Shuttle?\u0022. The answer to that is, \u0022the ET was a huge problem\u0022. See, during first stage flight the SRB\u0027s were essentially dragging the ET behind them. When thrust was terminated, the changing loads would tear the ET apart tossing the Orbiter in the airstream where it would be torn apart by aerodynamic forces. (This is essentially what happened to *Challenger*.) For the same reason, they couldn\u0027t simply blow the attachments and let the SRB\u0027s go on their own merry way. The answer to this was a solid fueled escape rocket to power the Shuttle clear - but the escape rocket required was too big and too heavy, even if it was subsequently used (after ET jettison) as a \u0022third stage\u0022. (First stage being SRB\u002BSSME, second stage being SSME\u0027s only.)\n\nA capsule doesn\u0027t suffer these problems. It\u0027s lighter, and rather than being \u0022beside\u0022 the booster it\u0027s on top of the booster and leaving it behind as the booster slows down and the escape rocket accelerates the capsule which further reduces the size of the escape rocket required."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T06:49:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While it is made by Boeing it doesn\u0027t change the fact it\u0027s basically a LEO-Orion, although a bit smaller.\n\nThe only thing CST-100 has in common with Orion is the shape. They are completely different vehicles, with different systems, different mission profiles, designed and built by different companies.\n\nAn Airbus A350 is also the same shape as a Boeing 707 even though they have nothing in common. All that means is that the shape is optimal for those engineering requirements.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T07:06:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"}]}
