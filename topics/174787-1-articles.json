However in certain instances while playing the controller remaps itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstance 1: When choosing the Launchpad with an existing craft, none of the inputs work, my trigger is remapped to timewarp\u002B\u00A0 a workaround is that I\u00A0have to recover/relaunch the craft to get them to work properly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstance 2: After loading a craft onto the launchpad, and using time warp on ground, the controls once again remap themselves and i cant control the craft until i recover/relaunch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstance 3: Ingame, sometimes when i go to map my joystick, it will register keyboard inputs instead of the proper joystick until i reset the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in windows, the joystick is always operating fine, i test all buttons in a text field and none of them cause me to type keystrokes. I check my Logitech game profiler, that has not changed, just the ingame input.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a fix instead of the workarounds i have mentioned?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
