I\u0027ve decided to change the probe like you suggested and will be changing the location in the tech tree for the probe (if I remember correct, the 2.5m part is already under General Construction). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SorensonPA\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SorensonPA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmm. Is science supposed to be locked into the part once it gets hoovered up from experiments? Like others I snagged this since I figured it\u0027d make doing science sweeps much easier - but after doing so, I found out I couldn\u0027t retrieve it from the part via right-click, and my research vehicle is a separate one from my return vehicle.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: OK, after whipping up a ModuleManager config to insert the collection script into cockpits, it seems you can nab those on EVA even if not from the science parts themselves. Maybe a better way to go about this would be to just insert the manual collection script into cockpits and then only have new parts for automatic collection, which some folks might not even want?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take a look again, but science shouldn\u0027t be locked in the container once collected. The only problem with putting them in crew capsules is that they already implement the IScienceDataContainer interface and by putting my ScienceContainer (which also implements IScienceDataCntainer) in them, you\u0027re being redundant. I\u0027m going to look into making a separate module that can be used for crew capsules that wont be redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You mean form EVA! That was an oversight on my part.
