How exactly are you missing Duna? If you\u0027re flying by it without getting an encounter, you can make a mid-course correction to bring yourself into Duna\u0027s SOI. Past that (and the correct timing of your launch windows) orbiting a planet is exactly like orbiting the Mun. You are using maneuver nodes, yes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T19:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re getting that close already, wait until you get halfway there, place a maneuver node, and move the little markers around until you get an intercept.
