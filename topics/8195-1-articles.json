He never really talks about minecraft anymore since he left the team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really look forward to seeing what this game becomes as well. I have a lot of hope for it. I\\\u0027d really like to see it cling very closely to sandbox gameplay, though. It\\\u0027d be nice to see it get something like empire building mechanics and simulate a developing space economy, rather than a linear progression of missions or goals. AI space programs doing the same thing would be neat too. O_o\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
