And one of those is, to me, the unique way in which it annoys me... Let me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other games I\u0027m either having fun, or I\u0027m not.\u00A0It\u0027s instantaneous, I\u0027m playing and I think \u0022Bah!\u00A0Time to stop playing this sh... erm, game.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut KSP is different. Often times I\u0027m playing until I realize\u00A0I\u0027m tired and liquided off\u00A0(or rather, \u003Cu\u003EI\u0027ve been\u003C/u\u003E tired and liquided off for the past two hours!), at which point I say to my self \u0022why the heck are you still playing?! Go do something else!\u0022... and then I set to complete one more contract, send that one probe, land something or check that one rover I left on a cliff... and the cycle resets itself... until an hour later when it comes back to me \u0022wait, wasn\u0027t I fed up?\u0022 and I finally close the game for the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s like the games hooks you in to the point where you lose the ability to gauge your own enjoyment of the thing. It\u0027s the weirdest thing because you\u0027d think that in order to hook you in, the game would make you happier, not angrier. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this happen to you as well?

I also launched my Minmus Mining vessel (in my modded system, in addition to the 3x enlargements of bodies and orbits, I switched the orbital parameters of Minmus and Mun) - its an all in 1 designs with no need for a kerbal and life support: 1 launch, no surface base... much less tedious than the modular Mun base and dropship that I was planning... but in this save, it takes ~1650 m/s to get an intercept, and several hundred more to capture and land.
