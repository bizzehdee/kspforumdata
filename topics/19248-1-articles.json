Because right now rentry feels..... well not right.Don\u0027t get me wrong i don\u0027t want ot bash the game ect and i know this is still erly in the development but i\u0027m just curious.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-13T23:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2012 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Dermeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martonaut","CreatedById":26366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T23:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits on the wiki , they will some day add reentry stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T23:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, you can skip off of the atmosphere Rather easily, actually.
