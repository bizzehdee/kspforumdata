I have played the game through steam on other, less powerful computers/laptops and performance there was very noticeably better. When running on default settings and 4-part ships I am already subjected to the orange timer. On lower settings, this starts occurring at roughly 10-part ships. The performance hit is slightly lower when looking at the sky, so I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s partially related to the rendering of the surface and/or space station. Sadly, the performance hit has made the game not very fun to play at all. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomputer setup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhenom II X6 1090T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadeon HD 6900 series\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8gb RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewindows 7 64bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evideo drivers are currently the latest beta drivers for AMD.
