If you don\u0027t want to use mods to help with this, you can only ever provide very little thrust (like, one or two Poodles\u0027 worth) and hence have to deal with very long burn times. Rotating the thing into the right direction for a burn also requires a lot of patience.\n\nIt will have no gravity. Any base you want to build needs to be anchored using one or more claws.\n\nThe only science you can do is collecting soil samples.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T21:23:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:13:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Dragging it into a stable orbit is entirely possible though a bit tedious: the claw can transmit only so much force before it starts to bend and flutter.

Rotating the thing into the right direction for a burn also requires a lot of patience.\n\nOne way to mitigate the bending-claw problem: Make it so that the thrusting craft has no torque authority at all, and is thrusting straight at the asteroid\u0027s CoM. That is, make sure that the thruster has a locked gimbal on its engine, and has disabled all reaction wheels (including the command module, if it has \u0027em). This means its thrust axis stays lined up straight through the asteroid\u0027s CoM and flutter is minimized. Of course, it also means that the craft is useless for steering the asteroid (i.e. rotating it to the desired orientation), but you can make up for that by attaching *other* craft that have plenty of reaction wheels but no active engines. They do the torque, the thruster does the thrust.\n\nThat said: I personally find the claw to be so horrendously buggy and game-destroying that I\u0027ve completely sworn off it forever, or at least until Squad has the bandwidth to fix it. But the above technique worked well for me until I got so frustrated with game-destroying bugs that I swore off the claw."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:30:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One way to mitigate the bending-claw problem: Make it so that the thrusting craft has no torque authority at all, and is thrusting straight at the asteroid\u0027s CoM.

Deactivate thrusters, enable reaction wheels, correct, then reverse that and accelerate again.\n\nHow viable would be using multiple tugs? By adjusting thrust limiters you should be able get a setup that has a summary CoT through CoM of the asteroid. (actually, on a single craft with widely placed engines you can achieve that too... but it will put a torque on the Klaw.\n\nOne more option: use the klaw for stabilization only, placing it on a flexible joint (a beam attached to a stack of Spider engines?) and use several girders as the actual \u0022pushers\u0022/\u0022landing legs\u0022. So when you thrust, the klaw only prevents slippage while the girders carry the forces.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I was actually wondering this morning if redirecting Gilly would even be possible.

It uses single-body with gravity-less orbiters. E.g. your actions don\u0027t influence the planets, just the same as asteroids don\u0027t have gravity at all.\n\nBy the way, people have been placing asteroids in LKO, making them the refuelling stations.

Having the ISRU on a separate craft proved a bad idea - that craft and the pusher weren\u0027t perfectly aligned, so they constantly wiggled and bounced. And the RCS/torque drones were notoriously kraken-prone due to side-mounted Klaws on SAS modules - they would often explode during physics loading, and constantly jittered. In the end, I decided to not bother because of several problems:\n\n1. The asteroid rotation doesn\u0027t stop, even when in timewarp. \\*Especially\\* when in time warp. Made it very hard to stay a fixed direction. On top of that, the RCS/torque drones didn\u0027t seem to apply torque perfectly and would cause constant over-rotation.\n\n2. Circularizing the orbit on Kerbin\u0027s equator would have taken 2/3 of the mass of the astertoid (~1500 tons) and hours of thrusting, which would have made the whole thing not really worth it for fuel.\n\n3. The ISRU unit has a bug where it would keep draining the ore from the asteroid even though the containers should have been full, probably because of using one full Ore unit to top off fractional amounts of monoprop/fuel usage.\n\n4. MY contract was for ejecting the asteroid from the solar system, so staying at Kerbin was only for a short while anyways.\n\n5. The ISRU and pusher modules didn\u0027t have RCS thrusters on them (my mistake). The two nuclear outriggers did, so I used them to try and center each on the asteroid CoM.\n\nRight now I edited the save to restore the lost mass, and debating trying to eject it from LKO to solar system escape - needs something like 7km/s dV, which is close to 7 real-time hours of burn - more when burning at 50% to account for off-axis burning. I may just edit the save again, since I feel like I earned the contract completion.\n\n![KgD7cEr.png](http://i.imgur.com/KgD7cEr.png)\n\nDon\u0027t ever do this:\n\n![hN0EE0Q.png](http://i.imgur.com/hN0EE0Q.png)\n\nSomething about having the Klaws mounted on the side of the SAS modules caused the whole craft to wobble and shake, and sometimes explode.\n\nI did not try a pull configuration, that might work better, but I doubt it. How does the floppy asteroid dampen oscillations? I would think that would make problems worse. Also, this: \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy)\n\nIf I was to try again, here\u0027s what I would do:\n\n1. Try a class D instead - E is just too big.\n\n2. Use one vessel, ISRU \u002B pusher combined.\n\n3. Only use 1 nuke.\n\n4. Try using Vernors on the RCS/torque drones - they provide more thrust and only need LFO.\n\n5. Turn on drill to fill tanks, then shut off drill. Turn on ISRU to fill tanks, then shut off ISRU. Don\u0027t leave either on while thrusting for long time periods, or while defocused.\n\n6. Instead of trying to put the drones in specific spots, make sure the Vernors point specific directions.\n\n7. Make sure all vessels have full RCS controls (vernors or whatever).\n\nBest of luck to anyone else.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nJust had another thought. One thing that might work is to have your thrusters in a radial-4 configuration. And using KER, you can modify the thrust on each engine to get the thrust torque as close to zero as possible. The flexible Klaw might still prove to be a problem though.\n\nDammit, now I want to try again.
