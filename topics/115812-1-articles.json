Having the ISRU on a separate craft proved a bad idea - that craft and the pusher weren\u0027t perfectly aligned, so they constantly wiggled and bounced. And the RCS/torque drones were notoriously kraken-prone due to side-mounted Klaws on SAS modules - they would often explode during physics loading, and constantly jittered. In the end, I decided to not bother because of several problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The asteroid rotation doesn\u0027t stop, even when in timewarp. *Especially* when in time warp.

Every ton of ore you extract will make the asteroid weigh one ton less. Your TWR will go up as you go, the thing will become easier to handle, but it will remain an E class for the purposes of completing your contract. If you\u0027re confident that you have enough fuel, you may just mine and discard the ore in order to shed mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T22:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPulling works much better with a free pivot. Changing directions is completely different and presents similar problems as pushing when the asteroid starts spinning, but if done slowly it can be easily done. If my memory serves me, I also disabled engine gimbal since they were at the front and directions were inversed. Not sure if this is still an issue for the latest versions of KSP... But reactions wheels and thrusters work great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did mine it dry, accidentally - the slag weighed over 200 tons, and I didn\u0027t have enough dV with the asteroid as-is to get it out of Kerbol orbit. So I added back the missing mass, and reduced its slag mass as well. Once I mine it fully, then I\u0027ll try launching it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
