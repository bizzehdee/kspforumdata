It requires an orbit at least as large as Jool\u0027s, and an inclination of 66 degrees or so. (I assume the reference plane is the ecliptic, more or less?) I\u0027m concerned that I won\u0027t be able to build a ship with enough delta-V to match this orbit. I\u0027ve done many match-orbit contracts around Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus, usually with no problem, but this is my first solar contract. A couple questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027ve Is there a way to \u0022target\u0022 the destination orbit? I know it\u0027s marked graphically on the stellar map, but it\u0027d be nice to be able to click on the target orbit, \u0022target\u0022 it, and see relative inclination, intersection points, and other data in KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Assuming I can\u0027t \u0022target\u0022 the destination orbit, how do I figure out where to do an inclination burn? Normally, in a Kerbin SOI contract, I just eyeball where the target AN/DN intersect my own orbit. But in a solar orbit, it\u0027s awful hard to line up the target orbit\u0027s ascending/descending nodes with my own relatively tiny orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Playing around with maneuver nodes, I see inclination burns in the range of 7000 m/s delta-V -- and that\u0027s before spending fuel to match periapsis and apoapsis. I guess that eventually might be feasible (right now I don\u0027t have nuclear engines or the heaviest liquid engines), but I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027ve bit off more than I can chew?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T01:01:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Spock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my perfectly humble opinion, matching orbits around the sun contracts are too much of a PITA to bother with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are polar surveys of Jool.
