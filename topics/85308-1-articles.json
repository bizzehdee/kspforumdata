The upgrades we did to the issue tracker last week are definitely showing their worth now though, as there have been several cases of issues that were technically low-priority and would have been dismissed earlier as unimportant, that rose to the top of the list after receiving several votes. Sometimes a very mild, small detail can have a major subjective impact on the way the game plays, and issue voting lets us finally measure this perceived importance for all issues. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Besides that, most of the work this week and the last was basically bugfixing and adding polish to the things we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve implemented. The Strategy system and the Admin Facility were met with very positive responses overall, but I must say I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very happy to see how the new spaceplane parts are turning out. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I must warn however, that several SP\u002B parts do replace old parts, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very likely that some spaceplane designs can become weird or misaligned.

For most cases, simply detaching and reattaching the misplaced parts will do. We decided it was for the best to simply bite the bullet on this one, because there is no point in having old parts linger around, wasting our already cramped memory space, just for the sake of delaying this inevitable change. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;If you want to start preparing your saves for the release, I recommend recovering all ongoing spaceplane missions.

I know it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bit of a hassle to have to do this, but trust me when I say it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be well worth it!\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA): \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Last week I took a 5 day vacation in Quer\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9taro to celebrate Mexican Independence Day (September 16th - \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFiestas Patrias\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2). It was a really nice time of relaxation and fun with the family. I needed that a lot. When I came back to the office on Wednesday, I set everything for the Server Migration (second attempt) scheduled for Thursday night. Unfortunately, the migration failed and we had to suspend it and I set the sites back online. This week, I cleaned our databases and made some reports. Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m testing the last tweaks to the KSP Store website.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart): \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Last week and also this one, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been deep in QA and experimentals.Luckily not too many bugs have surfaced on my part and the ones that have were not that serious - the NavBall appearing in weird places and things like that. What has been keeping me busier than I expected is getting the arrow indicator for the maneuver vector on the IVA NavBall. Since all of the vectors share the same relative position to the center of the sphere and all is managed through rotations, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a whole different thing than for the staging NavBall.
