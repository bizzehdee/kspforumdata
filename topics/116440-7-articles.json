I have fixed all of mine and now everything is back to normal. I was able to find everything. I did almost miss a couple in the Misc folder. the SwitchPanelsShort at the bottom has a couple colors off to the far right and you have to scroll to find them. Also the parachute is in the Misc folder as well. In the SmallLabelPlate.\n\nThanks again guys for your help on this!"},{"CreatedByName":"Nittany Tiger","CreatedById":123570,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T12:37:49Z","Content":"No problem.  I need to go ahead and fix the other colors on my save.  I think both of our methods plus Find and Replace will fix it, and in fact either us or the mod dev can just run that on their install files and call it a 1.2 patch."},{"CreatedByName":"Nittany Tiger","CreatedById":123570,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T14:05:39Z","Content":"Alright, [@artemisrain](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/141419-artemisrain/)\u0027s syntax correction works and now I have all of my text correct.  My supposed regex for Find and Replace was bad, though.  The correct search regex is \\[#\u003C=(([0-9]:\u0022[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\u0022;\u0022[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\u0022;\u0022[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\u0022)|([0-9]:[0-9a-fA-F]{6};[0-9a-fA-F]{6};[0-9a-fA-F]{6}))=\u003E\\] and the replace regex is \u003C#\u003C=\\1=\u003E\u003E.  So in my instructions to use Find and Replace, after doing the find and replace for single-color codes, repeat those instructions using the new search regex and the new replace regex for the multicolored ones.  That should be all you need to do to make this mod work properly for 1.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Shingen","CreatedById":157174,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T20:17:21Z","Content":"Hi there.\n\nWould you be so kind as to show me where I can get the .zip file for this mod ?\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"artemisrain","CreatedById":141419,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-08T16:15:28Z","Content":"Here is my version with the fixed color syntax.
