You must know me lurking around in the Tantares thread. One day I tried Beale\u0027s tutorial, and made it.\n\nFinally, I started building this myself after the stock Mk1-2 seems bad-looking when used in SDHI.\n\nHere\u0027s the current progress:\n\n![progress1_zpsuckgtla7.png](http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg559/bien_vincent/progress1_zpsuckgtla7.png)\n\nHeight: 2.3m\n\nTop diameter: 1.25m\n\nBottom diameter: 2.5\n\nTotal polys: 36 (32 polys at the side)\n\nAnd I now have made it to UV Mapping, but I need someone to texture it Mk1-2 style. (please PM)\n\n![Mk1-2AdvA_auv_zpsecc9jout.png](http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg559/bien_vincent/Mk1-2AdvA_auv_zpsecc9jout.png)\n\nAnd on the KSP Group at Facebook, Kyle Harrold (CardBoardBoxProcessor!) found me!\n\n![hefoundme_zps4rh8ojn7.jpg](http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg559/bien_vincent/hefoundme_zps4rh8ojn7.jpg)\n\nHonestly, this started as the revival of the old KWRocketry Ceres command pod, and I gave up because of that msh. and mdl. files that doesn\u0027t open in any of my programs. Also, at the WIP stage of this mod, I *did not certainly*plan to smoothen Bobcat\u0027s Orion and Mk1-2ify it.\n\nCheers, flamerboy67664/SpaceEagle"},{"CreatedByName":"ahappydude","CreatedById":458,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T01:06:46Z","Content":"Im better at making models and ideas then actually texxtuering them, so dont feel bad =) Its always nice to see new modders here, welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T22:21:54Z","Content":"It needs a little more detail in order to look good, maybe windows or a hatch.
