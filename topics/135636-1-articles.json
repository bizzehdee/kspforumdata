I used to just delete the folders for the parts I didn\u0027t want, but now that memory isn\u0027t as much of a concern and finding out which folder is which part is time consuming I\u0027m hoping someone can look into this idea (or point me in the direction of an existing mod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething straightforward... like just hovering the mouse over which part you don\u0027t want in the list and pressing a hotkey, which would send it into a \u0022Hidden\u0022 category to the left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a part is hidden it wouldn\u0027t appear in any other category or in search but you could still find the parts in the hidden category. To remove the part from hidden you would just hover over it and press the hotkey again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T02:56:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 02:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by The-Bean\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The-Bean","CreatedById":17935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T02:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMonthly bump (don\u0027t worry, only one \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nyaandere","CreatedById":162887,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T01:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love a mod like this as well.
