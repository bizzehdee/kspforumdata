By \u0022radial decoupler problem\u0022, I mean the way that since 0.24.2, radial tanks have tipped inwards at their top ends and collided with the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is to use 1 pair of Sepratrons facing horizontally outboard at the very top end of the radial stack. That\u0027s it, only 2 Sepratrons per radial stack, no matter how wide or tall the radial stack is. These Sepratrons keep the top end of the stack from tipping inboard. This works for all radial decouplers, and also for various amounts of strutting the radial stacks to the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many possible variations to the above general solution that you might find applicable to your particular rocket. For example, you might find that these Sepratrons work too well and cause the opposite problem of the bottom end of the radial stack rotating into the central stack. This is general only a problem if the radial decouplers are mounted high up on the central stack. If the radial decouplers are mounted near the bottom of the central stack, then the bottoms of the radial tanks will usually swing inboard safely below the nozzle of the central rocket. They might hit each other but won\u0027t affect the central rocket. But if this bothers you, you can adjust the arrangement of the 2 Sepratrons on the top of the radial stack. Options include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESlide the Sepratrons down the a bit from the top end of the radial stack\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduce the burn time of the Septratrons by tweaking their fuel down (this is usually a better idea than reducing their thrust)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESlide the Sepratrons towards the outboard edge of the radial stack so less of their thrust is directed straight out from the central stack (you generally want to do this anyway to keep the Sepratron flames from hitting the central stack)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I build radial stacks as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I always use the TT-70 radial decoupler. The height of this decoupler provides useful standoff distance between the radial and central stacks, to allow some pivoting of the radial stacks without hitting the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I mount the TT-70s as low as possible on the central stack, then build the radial stacks up, down, or both directions from there. Usually I build the radial stacks upwards only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Each radial stack gets 2 and only 2 struts to the central stack, 1 at the top end and 1 at the bottom end. I only strut radial stacks to each other if they extend far below the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Each radial stack gets 2 and only 2 Sepratrons mounted horizontally at its very top end. These are usually 1 or 2 angle snaps outboard from the centerline of the radial stacks, to protect the central stack from their flames. Because of this, I have never yet had to tweak the Sepratrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works so well for me that it\u0027s become my automatic standard practice and I have long since ceased to worry about the decoupler bug because this work-around is so simple. Most of the time the radial stacks come off totally clean without even hitting each other below the central stack but if they do collide, I don\u0027t care because by that point they\u0027re just debris and they don\u0027t hurt the central stack.

Plus there are 12 boosters, each of which has 2 Sepratrons at the top, so the central stack is getting hit with 24 jets of flame. This are also 12 tail fins between the boosters and the main engine also flairs out at the bottom, so the SRBs have to be shoved away without hitting any of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the boosters are attached on TT-70s mounted very low on the central stack, plus 1 strut at the top and 1 at the bottom, with the lower 1/4 or so of the SRBs sticking down below the central engine. The Sepratrons absolutely prevent the tops of the boosters from swinging in and hitting the central stack. They swing the tops away so fast that all 24 can\u0027t burn up the central stack (also, they\u0027re angled outboard a lot instead of straight into it). The boosters come together can collide under the main engine, but that just adds some entertaining but harmless explosions to the launch.
