I really wanted to build my next space station by getting all the parts up with a very large space-plane. This should lift what I need in larger sections if I did my math right, my problem is I cannot even get it off of the ground. I have build large planes before that can hold a 20k altitude all day long that weigh more than this but for some reason this one empty or loaded does back flips, veers wildly out of control, or wont catch lift until the end of the run way. I have tried shifting weight front to back and vise versa and where it is right now is as far as I get with it. I am looking for any suggestions, heck call me a fool for all I care I am just stuck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s15.photobucket.com/user/fcdrifter13/media/screenshot0_zpsf06981b3.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a372/fcdrifter13/screenshot0_zpsf06981b3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zpsf06981b3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is B9 Aerospace, with a mechjeb 2 pod on top for load info. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the craft file \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8wwcr6l83gc3eft/SSTO%20heaviest%20Lifter.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8wwcr6l83gc3eft/SSTO%20heaviest%20Lifter.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T09:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pic is worth more than a thousand words: look at that thrust vector, and the position relative to the the center of mass.

Could the problem be to little lift? and when I do manage to get the nose up it is just catching the air and flipping it backwards? When I get off from work I will try again moving it around and I will try to double the amount of lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I use regular rover wheels as bigger landing gear or will they cause too much drag. Right now I am just trying to get her up with 2 orange tanks plus a little extra I think that is about the most weight that I would carry. I have a different design in the making for trying to lift 300tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deskjetser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deskjetser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso just remember to strut your stuff! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat has two meanings! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fcdrifter13","CreatedById":79366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T01:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I finally got her into stable flight.
