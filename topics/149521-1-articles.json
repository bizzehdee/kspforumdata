Thats because if you keep pressing alt/shift \u002B Q\u002BE you have to tap 72 times before any part comes back around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a hexagon ring station for example like I build is 72 / 12 = 6\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo when you Alt/shift \u002B Q,E,A,S,W,D (depending on how you want to rotate it) 12 times and you copy paste that as a Subassembly you\u0027ll have it right. It doesnt even matter if the docking ports are centered on the module (although you\u0027ll need symmetry enabled) because they\u0027re all copies of themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAs for the docking ports on the side of your tank\u003C/u\u003E (the one that doesn\u0027t fit) a similar aproach can be used.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut you don\u0027t want to use 12increment rotation in that case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut your angle snap to the hexagon marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut your docking port on your fuel tank and try to drag the docking port all around the tank. Because the haxagon angle snap is chosen any part (docking port in this case) displaces itself in increments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat shows us that there are 24 snapping points on the circumference of a fuel tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou want it to be a hexagon?
