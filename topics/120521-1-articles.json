The frustration of repeated accidents still haunts me whenever I contemplate a new mun rover design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that experience I learned that in my non-RCS-stabilised rover, speeds in excess of 10m/s are safe-ish, in excess of 15m/s are risky, in excess of 20m/s are pushing your luck and in excess of 30m/s are downright reckless. That didn\u0027t stop me from occasionally hitting 35m/s or even 40m/s on the flat straight-aways when I knew I had a quicksave in my pocket, but it did make me take the slopes with great care and pick my route with a view to minimising my exposure to rugged terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a circumnavigation of Kerbin underway, and again quicksaves are my saving grace.

Even on Kerbin I\u0027m taking my life in my hands exceeding 30m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Mun you can do a few things like use RCS thrusters that point to the ground to keep you firmly stuck to the surface at speed, but if you hit a bump it\u0027s actually lifting and braking thrust that you\u0027re going to want, to slow you before you crash down again.

If you want more ground clearance, you gotta spread the wheelbase. You have a good idea with the I beams, try longer ones and see how it works. Or just stick the wheels out the side. But really you could bring your \u0022belly\u0022 down to where your suspension currently is, if you clothesline that undercarriage you\u0027re toast anyway so no reason to feel like you need to protect the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t forget to tweak your wheels! Steering with wheels that have enabled motors is method #1 to flip any rover. If you\u0027re using Claw\u0027s brake bugfix (you probably should, it really is a bugfix and really does help), you may need to tweak brakes to have enough to stop you but not so much to flip you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Downthrusters. RCS thrusters are a popular choice, but I\u0027ve found the most efficient method for me personally is to use either Twitch or Puff engines. This is because you can limit their thrust and throttle them for on-the-fly, as-strong-as-you-need-it downforce. Other engines work, including Dawn, Ant, etc, I just find those two to be the preferred type for me. See comments on driving below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ballast. Does that sound crazy? Actual mass = \u0022free downforce.\u0022 Assuming of course that mass is keeping your CoM low. Fortunately, KSP gives us an ideal ballast in the form of LFO, which is dense, transferable, and fuels the downthrusters. If you\u0027re concerned about putting more mass up, you can send it up with empty tanks, then dock and fill it on the Mun. For a circumnavigation attempt, you are almost surely going to want to carry lots of fuel for downthrusters anyway, and maybe want/need to refill them too. The only downside to more mass is that impacts will be more damaging to wheels, huge n\u0027 heavy rovers will break stock wheels with regularity just bumping into terrain edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Moar wheels. This also sounds crazy, who drives cars with six or eight wheels? Folks who need lots of traction, that\u0027s who - dualies. We don\u0027t have dualie wheels, or a great selection of wheels of differing profile, so we make do with more wheels. The trick here is simple - more area contacting the ground = more traction. Hence why tanks use treads (among other reasons). Worth mentioning that the motors in the wheels, true to life, seem to have really amazing torque, they will do their top speed of 25m/s even with pretty heavy loads!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minor factoid I remembered: 1 RTG = 1 fully powered wheel. Unpowered wheels don\u0027t use juice even if they have steering enabled and powered wheels only consume EC when actually running the motor. Not that you have to use RTGs but this is a nice thing to know. However you don\u0027t have to have full power at all times, especially on Mun where you can coast nearly 90% of the time without hardly losing speed, so in practice you may need less power than you think. Not that I mind your overengineering, I admire it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What it really comes down to at all times is traction. Downforce is about traction. Flipping is about losing traction, or getting uneven traction. Think of traction like a resource; any action you take uses part of your traction budget. Accelerating, braking, turning, all use traction, just like in real life. Unlike driving on a well maintained highway under Earth gravity, your total traction budget may subject to change without notice, which is what trips folks up (besides the fact that driving on Mun gravity reduces it significantly already). The problem is you can\u0027t see this resource, you have to guess at it. However, without seeing it you can still know that when you turn, you should neither accelerate nor brake, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An extension of traction is slope. Going uphill gives you better traction, gravity is pulling you down the slope, and you are driving into it, so your wheels get good contact with the ground. So long as the slope isn\u0027t flipping you backwards, going uphill will be to your advantage in low gravity. Going downhill is of course the opposite; you are driving \u0022off\u0022 the slope so your wheels have poor ground contact and hence poor traction. As a result you can go faster uphill but must take it easy going downhill; I advise coasting, tapping the brakes or reverse as needed to control speed, and engaging downthrusters if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Avoid driving parallel to slopes, this is yet another wonderful way to roll your rover. Whenever possible you probably want to go into slopes straight on; when tackling more severe slopes where doing that is itself hazardous, you can snake up or down the slope, but you must be very careful, and practically stop when you make the S turns. Such maneuvers should be have a very wide \u0022wavelength\u0022, just swerving back and forth in a generally forward direction is usually worse than just driving straight forward, but going in very broad waves can let you ascend or descend unreasonably steep slopes if the rover has a low enough CoM to not roll over while doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Downthrusters are not something you have to run all the time. You don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s a waste of fuel. You\u0027ll need them when you make turns, when going downhill sometimes, and when you want to brake faster. Plan your turns; on the Mun, you should drop speed below 15m/s or so, then engage downthrusters, then begin a turn to a planned heading. Once you\u0027re stable on the new heading, turn off downthrusters. If you used engines with a throttle, like the Twitch, you can selectively use minor downforce for simple corrections, or heavy downforce for emergency evasive driving or if you panic. After a little driving, you should get a pretty good feel for how your rover behaves in the environment you\u0027ve put it in, and how much downforce you want at which speed to make desired turns. Keep in mind the simple rule that the more downforce you use, the more traction budget you have, the more aggressively you can spend said traction (such as with a much tighter turn radius).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SAS stability totally works in a rover. Keep it on, and when it tries doing a little correction steering, don\u0027t immediately override it. Even driving a straight line is much easier with SAS on. You probably do this already, but if not, I\u0027m not kidding, it\u0027s great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Driving fast mostly means driving a straight line either gently uphill or on extremely level ground, and having enough downforce to deal with whatever terrain variances you encounter. On Minmus\u0027s flats, this a cakewalk, no downthrusters needed just don\u0027t make sudden high speed turns. On most of the Mun, this means jockeying the downthrusters diligently without being wasteful of them, and also picking out reasonably straightline paths between craters and holding to those vectors as well as terrain allows. Rough terrain is rough terrain, though - if you want to drive up and down mountains, you go slow up and slower down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally truly speedy rovers that go even 50m/s\u002B consistently are gonna use all landing gear or mod wheels in all likelihood and IMO are a whole different category of build. They\u0027re much harder to make, harder to drive, and typically less versatile (rover wheels have potentially unlimited \u0022dV\u0022 while rocket sleds do not, to say nothing of the difference in how speed is being acquired). They sure are fun though! But I\u0027ll let you in on a secret: physics warp can totally work with a rover. At x2, you should have mostly normal physics still, and in fact I almost always drive on x2 even when making cautious maneuvers. x4 might require you to bugtest the rover to make sure it doesn\u0027t do wacky crap when the physics inconsistencies from that warp level creep in, but you can absolutely speed across gentle terrain at x4 in many places. One great thing about this is that you get the \u0022let\u0027s go faster\u0022 feeling but so far as the game is concerned, you\u0027re still driving whatever your actual speed is, so you won\u0027t actually be any more prone to going off the rails than normal, provided you can keep it in hand (and it doesn\u0027t spontaneously explode, many part combinations seem to do this so really do bugtest this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry it\u0027s long and I ramble. I bet you can tell I love rovers.

Whenever you tweak a wheel, the brakes will go to a fraction of their effectiveness, and will never go back to full, ever. The bugfix gives you the normal braking torque range, so you can tweak them anywhere from dangerously stiff to nice and gentle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of stock rover wheels, the tiny wheels can take 20m/s, the balloon and ruggedized wheels can take 60m/s, and the huge XL3 wheels can take a paltry 30m/s, not that they can go that fast.

They can be repaired infinitely in the field even in stock so feel free to use them as bumpers, I certainly have and they work great for that. I find it\u0027s a lot more common for impacts to transfer force through the wheel, jamming it into the chassis and blowing that up, or for minor irregularities in the terrain to poke up and rack your undercarriage or chassis and blow it up that way (they can be REALLY hard to see unless you\u0027re driving with your camera down under the vehicle!), hence the conflicting interests of ground clearance and low CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to seeing your Elcano!
