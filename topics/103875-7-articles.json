I know I didn\u0027t buy this game because I wanted an aerodynamics simulator.\n\nKSP is about a lot more than just orbital mechanics, it\u0027s about design...for launch; orbital maneuvers; planet encounters; space construction; planet construction; etc... Assuming you are talking about a kid who is interested in learning about designing ships for orbital maneuvers, I would caution any kid who feels he is learning to design ships for orbital maneuvers without designing said ships for launch is fooling him/her self. It would be like designing planes to fly but not takeoff or land. Any kid ONLY interested in learning orbital mechanics can do so by running the in game tutorials. Those have ships already in space they can fly around all they want.\n\nLuckily, there is a pretty easy solution to gain the limited knowledge outlined. Installing the HyperEdit mod allows you to move a ship directly to orbit and skip the launch. Launch is pretty rote without proper aerodynamics and almost any crazy thing will go up so having a launch stage without aerodynamics is pointless from a \u0022learning\u0022 perspective (ignoring the absurdity of learning from a game). IMO, installing mods is much easier than designing things that work so hopefully this suggestion (if spread wide and far) would remove said stumbling block and would be considered a positive response to the proposed problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T07:46:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not entirely sure which crowd squad is trying to please with the new aerodynamics.

When it decouples, a torque is generated around the booster\u0027s CoM in the correct direction (the magnitude is wrong, of course, but it\u0027s masked by the position somewhat).\n\nIn situation B, the torque should be reversed, but in stock, it is not for whatever broken reason. This is incorrect and bad physics.\n\nIt\u0027s present in all unpatched versions of KSP, but some types of rocket designs won\u0027t cause it (they decouple really early or really late), and a lot of users are --I\u0027mma be a bit blunt here--observationally challenged."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T18:30:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s present in all unpatched versions of KSP, but some types of rocket designs won\u0027t cause it (they decouple really early or really late), and a lot of users are --I\u0027mma be a bit blunt here--observationally challenged.\n\nNot entirely correct - it was introduced in 0.24.1 as a result of trying to fix decoupling on the x64 version (inline decouplers also suffer from this incorrect application of force, but the effect is obviously inline and not as noticeable) and is somehow related to the krakensbane as the problem disappears after exactly 750m/s.
