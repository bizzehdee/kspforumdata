Listen if you need to be a lawyer to read the EULA then it isn\u0027t a good Eula. It\u0027s like this analogy. A company sells you a car and put a 75% down payment. Then the next month they come to your door and say: Sign this contract, you might need to consult a lawyer. They hand you a 20 page contract in \u0022legalese\u0022 you say let me consult a lawyer, they say ok but we won\u0027t leave your door until you sign it or we want your car back. You consult a lawyer and it reveals they can take all of your info you placed into your car which has a built in laptop that you already used. So now what you,\u00A0you ask to get your money back right. Oh well in your orginal contract they won\u0027t issue a refund unless required by law. Also you technically used said car for a month. So now what what would you do...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-14T01:50:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2018 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cheif Operations Director\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
