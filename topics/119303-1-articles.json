I know the basic of cfg creation, but, from 1.0 onward, I do not really get how to manage the \u0022thermal caracteristics\u0022 added in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at the fuelcell as \u0022generator\u0022, I modified it to work as an ORE-using reactor, BUT I do not know if, with proper thermal caracteristic, or added line in the generator module, can transform a part as a \u0022heat production part\u0022, capable to overheat (and explode) if not properly cooled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I really never get how the new thermal caracteristics work PRACTICALLY, differently as many of older part modules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs side development, I thought also to use a sort of \u0022Engine Module\u0022 that DOES NOT produce an actual thrust (mostly coping then the nuclear engine module, giving to the part MORE electricity production, and using the LV-N as HEAT-PRODUCER part, in comparison), but I do not like this more strange idea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas/hints to help me from any proper modder out there???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it actually possible on a STOCK KSP, without using a plugin, to create a HEAT PRODUCING PART on activation???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T08:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it actually possible on a STOCK KSP, without using a plugin, to create a HEAT PRODUCING PART on activation???\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it IS possible! You turn the heat production to a higher level.
