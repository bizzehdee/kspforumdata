One that isn\u0027t whimsical and unpredictable, but one that follows patterns and rules and can be tracked and predicted, just like IRL weather can. It\u0027s quite the challenge indeed, but it\u0027s going to happen one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox8124","CreatedById":125032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T23:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in the next update, there will be a weather API for any of you who may want to grab weather data for whatever mods you make!
