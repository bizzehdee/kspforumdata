SR checks if it\u0027s installed, and if it is then it looks at the speed the vessel was going when deleted by KSP and assigns a percent chance of burning up based on that speed. It\u0027s the DR Velocity (something along those lines) in the settings. By default it\u0027s 2000 m/s (remember that KSP doesn\u0027t apply physics to unloaded craft, meaning air resistance won\u0027t be applied at any time and it isn\u0027t destroyed until about 22 km, so it\u0027ll be going way faster than it should). If the vessel is going slower than 2000 m/s then it\u0027s perfectly fine, if it\u0027s going 2100 m/s then there is a 10% chance of burning up, at 3000 m/s there is a 100% of burning up. If you have a heat shield it will reduce the chance by whatever amount of shielding is left, meaning you can be completely safe up to 3000 m/s, but above that you start getting a chance again up to 4000 m/s at which point no heat shields will protect you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rather arbitrary system but it prevents you from dropping things into the atmosphere at high speeds and taking advantage of the physics not being applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make things burn up more often, just lower that speed in the settings. The chance of burning up should be 100 x 2 x [(srf_speed / DR_Velocity) - 1], which in other words is 2% per 1% that the surface speed is faster than the DR Velocity setting. As an example, if you set it to 1500, then 2000 m/s will have a 67% chance of burning up, rather than 0%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that it\u0027s totally independent of the actual DR settings since the system is really arbitrary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gribbleshnibit8","CreatedById":113278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T06:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few days ago StageRecovery just stopped working (no messages, no returns).
