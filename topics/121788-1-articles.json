Within a minute the shoreline was on fire and every Kraken that came onto land was killed. I learnt later that week the 104th attack wing flying a dozen KA-8s have saved the island.\u0027 -Bobby Kermarski, civilian present during the Second battle of Altay islands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/e64fr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The two seat machine carries jamming pods and a complete communication array. The only weapons present on this are a pair of dual .50 calibre turrets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YZ9yV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Growler Aerospace\u0026amp;Defense strongly recommends flying a full throttle at all times. We are however glad to annonce that a upgrade program for the KA-8B is ready and the craft file will be ready within a week or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/Growler117/KA-8E-BACC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/Growler117/KA-8E-BACC\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/Growler117/KA-8B-Orca\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/Growler117/KA-8B-Orca\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T05:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Growler117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
