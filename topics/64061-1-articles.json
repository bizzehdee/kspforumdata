I have an interesting problem. I need a step by step guide for how to reach a target orbit. The catch is, nothing can be changed except the direction of thrusting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the information for ownships mass, thrust, position, altitude, speed, and anything else needed. The body is earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have all the orbital elements for the target orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eapogee perigee period inclination descending node and eccentricity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need to know is, how can I calculate which direction to thrust in to reach the target orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm planning to write the calculations in C# and run it several times a second updating ownships properties each cycle And use this to produce a second by second thrusting direction command to feed to the gimbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JtPB","CreatedById":103925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T17:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe intensity of the thrust can be changed?
