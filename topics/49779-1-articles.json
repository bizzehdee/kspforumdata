What needs to be done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, masses. If we accept 64% scaling, which seems reasonable so as to not overload PhysX, and which most modders who add real-life parts ascribe to, then we also need to scale masses of payload if we\u0027re using KIDS, as otherwise our rockets will be utterly ungainly and way-worse-performing than real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s tackle masses first. There are three things to consider. First, fuel tank dry mass; second, engine TWR (i.e. mass for given thrust) and third, payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo resume the discussion from StretchyTanks thread, here\u0027s what I have so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was responding to Starwaster, who found that for the actual tank (not the whole stage structure, the tank) for RP-1 on the S-IC, dry mass was approx 11 tons and there was approx 622 tons of RP-1 in it. That yields a ratio of 0.017 or so. (Note that in stock KSP, tank mass ratio is 0.1111)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then did some basic guesstimates when considering that KSP tanks are not actually tanks, they\u0027re stages with tanks inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s talk about the Titan I (the kerolox version) and its first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure as one of the first missiles, and not a tank-is-skin job like the Atlas (that to this day has one of the best dry:wet ratios ever), it\u0027s a good minimum baseline. In addition, it\u0027s nice because it has not much in the way of thrust plates or heavy interstages or guidance, and it\u0027s easy to see on a cutaway that the fuel tanks take up most of the internal volume of the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI come up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tDiam\tHeight\tMass\tFmass\tEhgt\tEmass\tEnum\tVol\tDry Mass Mass/KSPVol\tMratio (dry:dry\u002Bfuel)\u003Cbr\u003ETitan I-1\t3.05\t16\t4\t72.2\t3.13\t0.84\t2\t86.7\t2.32\t0.000133757\t0.030446194\u003Cbr\u003EFake TI-1\t1.95\t10.24\t1.13\t22.16\t2.00\t0.28\t2\t21.7\t0.57\t0.000132367\t0.024607888\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fake Titan I uses the 64% rescales (real:KSP), and a rescale of 1/3 on engine mass (close to .64^3). Its dry mass is slightly lower to account for a 0.4t decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the volume ratio is about 1/4.7 stock (stock is 0.000625, or 1/1600), and the mass ratio is about 1/4.5 stock (stock is 0.11111, or 1/9).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the tanks were just tanks, as Starwaster calculates, rather than 2 tanks \u002B outer skin \u002B misc structural mass, then it does seem reasonable the ratios would be off by a factor of 10, not ~5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that should cover tanks. Thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines in KSP have TWRs in the range of 5 (the LV-1) to 10 (LV-909, Poodle) to 14-17 (LV-Ts, Skipper) to 20 (48-7S) to 25 (Mainsail).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it just so happens that a flat multiplier of 6x works pretty well here, yielding TWRs of 30 (about right for a tiny vacuum engine) to 60 (upper stage) to 102 (lower stage) to 150 (Merlin 1D, best TWR ever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, that means dividing engine mass by 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, payload. Now it transpires that pods, at least, in KSP, are quite close to the mass they \u0022should be\u0022, as are the probes we build (they\u0027re maybe heavier, actually). So we can just do .64^3 (it\u0027s the cube rule: mass is cube of volume), which is darn close to 1/3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also need (which I am working on) non-probe-core satellites that can transmit science but not be controlled, and which would be very light indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s start with payloads massing 1/3 of what they presently do, which means you should be able to launch an Apollo stack on a 64% size Saturn V, with FAR and KIDS set at .33, .33.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T10:12:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 10:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdate link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T00:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about changing the fuel mixture, if the assumption is that the Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer is use are RP-1 and LOX respectively then the mix ratio should be 1:2.58 a not 0.9:1.1.
