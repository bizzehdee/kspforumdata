The propulsion branch (top line on the tech tree) will get you nukes. If this is your first play through and you\u0027re asking questions about what size parts you need to go interplanetary, I think you\u0027ll be well served by getting nukes, as you\u0027ll get a LOT more delta V out of your designs, making your life way easier. For the record though, you don\u0027t need nukes to go interplanetary (my first Duna mission only used conventional engines), but it \u003Cem\u003Ewill \u003C/em\u003Emake your trips easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T21:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.25 m is fine for all planets - the best engine for interplanetary transfers is nuclear engine which comes in 1.25 m and the 0.6 m parts are mostly not good for anything except smallest probes.
