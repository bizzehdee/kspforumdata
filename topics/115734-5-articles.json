Ours is inserted into the game separately as a unique part and doesn\u0027t use any modules (radiator or otherwise) that other mods might target.\n\nIt works in two ways: it applies variable cooling depending on current heat leakage rates and a flat rate that kicks in if the tank is overheated.\n\nLike real world ZBO applications, it works best if it is combined with a tank with lots of insulation.\n\nNow, while I don\u0027t think radiator interference is likely, other mods might add their own boiloff to a tank and the ones that I know of apply arbitrary boiloff rates that are not based on temperature or heat leakage so Heat Pump would be useless for those, so try to ensure that you don\u0027t have other mods applying their own boiloff\n\n**Edit:**\n\nKSPI does do boiloff and it is at least partially temperature based though their implementation looks a bit wonky. Not really sure to what extent this mod could mitigate their boiloff but my suggestion stands that you should disable any boiloff except Real Fuels.

However, if there is any period of time in which it was not able to provide full cooling (insufficient electricity, turned off/retracted or analytic mode) then it will have to go into overdrive trying to cool the tank down, which takes time.\n\nNo, it is not at all strange that it (as you say) is shown to be incompatible. More precisely it says it is not supported, which happens if the part is not tagged with RSSROConfig\n\n([https://github.com/KSP-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RealismOverhaul/blob/bf4413550e1a873f094d862d72feb2150c64c3e1/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealismOverhaul_Global_Config.cfg#L256-L262](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/blob/bf4413550e1a873f094d862d72feb2150c64c3e1/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealismOverhaul_Global_Config.cfg#L256-L262))\n\nThat\u0027s all that means. Realistically, about the only reason I can think of for not slapping that label on is that the electrical cost is 1000x cheaper than it should be. According to literature (numerous sources) from NASA on the subject, the electrical cost is approximately 114 watts electricity per watt of heat removed. Right now it\u0027s costing you 114 watts per kilowatt removed.\n\n**Having said that...** even with that cost and even with the lack of a label tagging it as compatible/supported.... my HP parts are STILL more realistic than any current configured radiator in Realism Overhaul that is currently tagged with RSSROConfig = true. The reason I say that is that they use the stock radiator code and a flat resource cost instead of a variable cost based on the amount of cooling being provided. (the stock code simply doesn\u0027t allow for a variable rate, only a flat rate)\n\nSo don\u0027t worry that it says it\u0027s not supported. Instead worry about the day that it says that it IS supported. That will be the day that I increase the electrical cost to what it should be. However, that will also be the day that Real Fuels allows you to customize the amount of insulation your tanks have. On that day you\u0027ll be sending a ship off to Mars with tanks that have tens of watts of heat leakage instead of tens of kilowatts so you\u0027ll be able to afford the electrical cost. (so... I guess don\u0027t worry about it anyway)"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-21T12:29:26Z","Content":"I couldn\u0027t have asked for a better response - very much appreciated [@Starwaster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71262-starwaster/)!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-13T18:00:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m calling for help from anyone knowledgeable about cryocoolers and refrigeration in general, preferably if you\u0027ve actually worked in the field and have good working knowledge on the subject (as opposed to a layperson such as myself who studies as much as he can on the subject but really doesn\u0027t know much more than what he\u0027s read)\n\nCurrently the mod charges a flat rate for resources per watt of heat removed based on the DRA proposals for Mars missions. That comes out to just over 100 watts of electricity per watt of heat removed. (so passive insulation is a must which is why that\u0027s been a part of this mod and is VERY soon going to be replaced by configurable passive (MLI) in Real Fuels)\n\nIf your tank is already overheated those electrical costs get VERY expensive and that strikes me as unrealistic given that the original citation was for cryogenic temperatures, specifically for liquid hydrogen at around 20K.\n\nSo I need help in determining how that cost would be affected by higher temperatures. Specifically I need a range of electrical costs from 4K - 300K. \n\nThe new heat pump RESOURCE node format is going to change in the next update to this:\n\n(the first number of each key is the temperature of the tank that heat is being removed from and the second number is the cost per watt removed - the last two numbers aren\u0027t important to this discussion)\n\n(actually the cost is KWe per KWt removed since that\u0027s scale used by RF but that\u0027s just a scaling issue; the math is the same)\n\n    \t\tRESOURCE\t{\t\tname = ElectricCharge\t\trate\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 4 2000 -367.5568 -272.2836\t\t\tkey = 20.15 114 -13.8706 -13.8706\t\t\tkey = 40.3 28.5 -1.12649 -1.12649\t\t\tkey = 80 7.113802 -0.312432 -0.312432\t\t\tkey = 92 3.988803 -0.1483255 -0.146298\t\t\tkey = 120 2 -0.01839706 -0.01839706\t\t\tkey = 240 1 0 0\t\t}\t}"},{"CreatedByName":"Jim123","CreatedById":157641,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-12T17:41:34Z","Content":"this mod worked for me on my 1.2.2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E ro install but crashes my 1.3.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E ro install should i send a crash report thingy also this is what it says when it carshes mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)  \n\n  in module mono.dll at 0033:b1780e18."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T12:49:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Jim123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E this mod worked for me on my 1.2.2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E ro install but crashes my 1.3.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E ro install should i send a crash report thingy also this is what it says when it carshes mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)  \n\u003E \n\u003E   in module mono.dll at 0033:b1780e18.\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t know, SHOULD you send a crash report thingy? \n\nI don\u0027t have a lot of information to go by otherwise ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T15:16:26Z","Content":"So, in other news there will likely be one more update of Heat Pumps for both KSP 1.3.1 and KSP 1.4.\\*\n\nAfter that there will be a new mod replacing it which extends the stock radiators and that fixes a few of the problems with them and has special handling for cryogenic temperatures, specifically a variable cooling rate based on Carnot efficiency multiplied by a cryocooler efficiency (which would be configurable and thus could be the subject of upgrade nodes)\n\nThe same system will be incorporated into the Heat Pumps update mentioned on line 1 (so instead of the variable electrical cost I mentioned a few posts back it would be a constant electrical input with the actual cooling rate determined by part temperature and radiator skin temperature)\n\nThe new mod is actually ready to go but it doesn\u0027t make sense to release it until Real Fuels is updated with the new insulation code.

Delete all of them except for 3.0.4. That is the latest one for KSP 1.3.1; everything after is for 1.4.\\*\n- Fusebox is also using a version that is for 1.4.1. This is of particular interest because it incorporates a replacement for the Part class and there are several method calls going through that replacement from PartLoader during part compilation which is when your game crashed.\n\nI can\u0027t go through your entire log comparing version numbers; that\u0027s your responsibility. Please go through your KSP mod installations AND VERIFY EVERYTHING. *Make sure you have mod versions that are confirmed by their authors and maintainers to be compatible with KSP 1.3.1*\n\n***\u003Cu\u003EOR YOU WILL SERIOUSLY SCREW THINGS UP AND MAKE ME ANGRY ENOUGH TO USE COMIC SANS IN UNDERLINED BOLD PRINT ITALICS!!!!\u003C/u\u003E***\n\nAnd trust me, nobody wants THAT! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jim123","CreatedById":157641,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-14T13:19:55Z","Content":"okay thank you"}]}
