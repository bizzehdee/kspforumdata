Kin Stanley Robinson\u0027s trilogy was obviously highly researched, has informed me greatly on the business of colonising another terrestrial planet, and had some quite weird spiritual elements. Iain M. Banks is a master at setting the stage, then taking you for a thrilling ride to the stunning finale, while occasionally letting rip with attacks on the barmier elements of the human condition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T02:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVoyage - Stephen Baxter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m currently reading this one, a very detailed description of how the US could have gone to Mars by the 80s instead of building the Space Shuttle.

The world of the discworld is one similar to ours, but with a few key differences - that the world is a disc, sitting on the back of four elephants which ride atop a turtle (with a tiny sunlet orbiting the whole works) is established scientific fact.
