Second, I would like to be able to set the Autopilot to a sort of \u0022Standby\u0022 mode where, instead of immediately taking off, it would stay put on the ground until an enemy fighter comes nearby, whereupon it would take off and intercept.

They\u0027ve been cutting through six layers of structural panels instantly. Even ships designed to handle lasers don\u0027t last much more than three seconds, and I only get that long because I found that docking hubs have odd heating effects when hit with the laser.\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that this is due to stock heating unbalancing weapon damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been meaning to rebalance the laser damage. I\u0027ll actually write it down this time so I remember.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022datubaman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022datubaman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, a few features that need to be added to BDA.\u003Cp\u003E1. A Jettison Command- I would like to be able to jettison bombs and missiles through either action groups or through the Weapons Manager. This is already somewhat possible by setting an action group that fires everything at once, but this is extremely dangerous for obvious reasons. I want to, essentially, be able to drop certain, or all my weapons without actually firing them or arming them. I would also like to see two different kinds of jettison commands, \u0022Jettison All Air-to-Ground\u0022 and \u0022Jettison All\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Guard Mode Opens/Closes Bay Doors- I would like to see this as a feature of guard mode that, when there are missiles or other weapons held inside of a cargo bay that guard mode would automatically open and close those bomb bay doors when those weapons are selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.ECM Pods- Another kind of countermeasures. Jams the radars of incoming missiles. Can be used infinitely but uses a literal metric crap ton of electrical power, so it can\u0027t be used fequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Improved functionality. for the autopilot- I have to say, I am very impressed by the AI. Bravo, good sir! However, there are a few things I would like to add to it. First off is to the ability to tell the Autopilot, \u0022Hey, you see that place over there? Go fly there.\u0022 This is something that would make staging massive air battles so much easier. Second, I would like to be able to set the Autopilot to a sort of \u0022Standby\u0022 mode where, instead of immediately taking off, it would stay put on the ground until an enemy fighter comes nearby, whereupon it would take off and intercept. Also, better ground collision prevention would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I can think of at the moment. I\u0027ll come back later with more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood ideas. Jettison can be an action tied to each missile/bomb individually so I don\u0027t have to give a specific action for dropping each type of missile to the weapon manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about cargo bay control and ecm for now, but the \u0027AI\u0027 is written so that it would be easy to tell it to fly to any arbitrary point, so \u0022go there\u0022 commands should be pretty simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T13:04:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BahamutoD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@datubaman:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with all of your suggestions, esp. 3 and 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also something like \u0022see that friend/foe? go at him\u0022, this would even allow Air-To-Ground attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am not sure if 2 is a good idea, sometimes you are flying too fast and opening the cargo bay could kill you, making it dangerous to switch between guns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe MK20 cluster bomb tends to to stray of quite a bit from it\u0027s predicted course at low altitude, maybe because of bodylift (saw some when activating aerrows), too?
