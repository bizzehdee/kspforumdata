Assume your orbit has you\u00A0pass within about 1000km of Minmus. You are then close enough for Minmus\u0027 gravity to dominate your path. KSP tells your ship to feel gravity from Minmus as opposed to Kerbin (you only get gravity from one source at a time). Your velocity and position causes a new orbit (usually a flyby, or an open orbit) which is labelled in orange, as you are not on that orbit yet, but will be soon. When the orange orbit leaves Minmus gravity field, you go back to a Kerbin orbit labelled in purple, as it is two orbits away. Notice that it is different from your blue orbit, as Minmus\u0027 gravity changed your velocity. The closer you get to Minmus, the greater the change would be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The orange path will only appear if you are going to have an encounter on your current orbit. Watch out if your orbit passes close to the orbits of the Mun or Minmus, as you may eventually encounter them on future orbits. If you don\u0027t want this to happen, you need to make sure your orbit passes nowhere near their paths. You might lose your ship - it is quite possible to encounter the Mun in such a way as to hit it. Minmus is less likely, but also possible. An encounter with either of them could also throw your craft hard enough to escape Kerbin entirely, and end up orbiting the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T21:27:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MaxL_1023\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T16:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few links:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rather informative older thread that talks about why Squad uses patched conics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124639-what-are-patched-conics/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this old chestnut showing the different ways of drawing patched conics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/11297-different-conic-drawing-modes/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
