The heavier materials released by the nova have gathered in the L4 and L5 lagrange points... which happen to be in the combined stellar goldilox zone. At least one of these two worlds become habitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two stars (call them Lucifer and Hephaestus) are 60 degrees apart in the sky- without an axal tilt, \u0022Daytime\u0022 would last 16 hours instead of 12 (4 hours of Lucifer, 8 hours of both, and 4 of just Hephaestus) and twilight and night combined would be only 8. But while both suns up would be warmer tha average, one sun setting would drop the temperature significantly, and both would drop it furthur. With an axal tilt, \u0022Summer\u0022 would be from half a month before Lucifer\u0027s solstice, the longest day would be halfway between the two solstices, a month later, and Hephaestus\u0027s solstice would be a month after that. The same rotation applies to the other 4 seasons, as the axal tilt tracks across the 60 degree separation between the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing formed mostly out of nova remanant material, the planet is rich in heavier elements, (alternatively, it is itself the remanant of a neptune-sized superearth that lost most of it\u0027s venus-like atmosphere in the nova) and in either case,has a strong magnetic field. The auoras would be rather spectacular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything else that would be significant (or impossible) about this world? What would be a good stellar distance to put the lagrange at? (which would be the same distance the two stellar components would be apart.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T01:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk you want dead star, initial weight perhaps a bit larger than sun, then an red dwarf in orbit. then you want two planets in the L4 and L5 points of the red dwarf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit of the red dwarf will be constrained by the goldilock zone but that is no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be forces preventing planet formation in the Trojans, or why has not the junk in Jupiter\u0027s Trojans gathered to an small moon, other option is to end up where after creation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
