Our cosmonaut was the first non-US and non-Russian person in space (Mr. Remek, now a communist politician), and we had five our probes delivered to space (Magion 1 to 5), all via Soviet (later Russian) launchers, of course, as part of the Interkosmos programme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy progress in KSP did go a little further - over my several past saves, I managed to assemble a decent MIR (using FUSTEK expansion parts), put a mk. 3 SSTO into orbit, land probes on Eve and Duna and land the first modules for a Munbase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith .22 out, however, I started anew - the science mechanism is too good to pass on, so here I am with a clean stock slate again, though I will certainly add more mods once they are .22 compatible (looking at you, Kethane!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
