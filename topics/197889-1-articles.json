The fuel tank you get from the start are called seperate structures. Once you get some new tech you should be able to right click this tank in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and switch material to aluminium, which is lighter than the default material. Once you advance further in tech you\u0027ll be able to unlock integral tanks, these should appear as\u00A0seperate parts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and they are way lighter than seperate structure tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, the earliest uppgrades you should be able to apply are available in the part menu of your seperate structure tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
