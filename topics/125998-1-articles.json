Once you get the hang of making maneuver nodes, it\u0026#39;s much easier than a Mun mission. Case in point: Landed on the Mun 6 times, got back twice.

You have to launch on the Minmus orbital plane. KSC goes through this plane 2 times per day. You can use map view. First set Kerbin in focus. Adjust camera so that it is on Mun\u0026#39;s orbital plane. The orbit seems then as a line. Go further from Kerbin so that you see orbit of the Minmus. Rotate view so that Minmus orbit seems a line too. Then you watch from nodal line, because the orbit of Mun is equatorial. Wait until Kerbin rotates so that you see the craft symbol at the intersection point of orbit lines. Check also do you have to go to north or south. Headings are 84 degrees and 96 degrees, respecticely. Try to keep heading at that value during ascent. It is relatively easy to get \u002B-2 degree accuracy without Mechjeb and \u002B-1 degree with Mechjeb.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T01:13:30Z","Content":"\nCongrats!
