There is no combustion process happening and the gas is actually carrying away the heat from the reactor into space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo in fact the engine should cool down while it is working and heat up while it is not, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe there are control rods build into this reactor to give it some more control, other than just fuel-valves releasing the gas into the reactor chamber.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecondly:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you think about the fuels that we are using (Liquid Fuel / Oxidizer) you will see that those are actually only placeholders for the vast variety of fuels that are used in the real world.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBUT, the ISP\u0027s and Thrust that we are getting out of those fuels in our regular rocket engines\u00A0do actually tell you that the Liquid-Fuel is something between Hydrazine and Kerosene. \u003Cu\u003E[citiation needed (I read that somewhere on here)]\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLets, go with Kerosene for this, because we also burn Liquid Fuel in our Jet Engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerosene is by far anything but cryogenic and the actualy Nerva-Engine used Liquid Hydrogene because a cryogenic fuel expands tremendously when you run it over a incredibly hot surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my though was... wouldnt it be more efficient to run the LV-N with the Oxidizer we use in the game? Because that has to be liquified Oxygen at -200\u00B0C while Kerosene would freeze at around -50\u00B0C\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot sure if the Oxygen wouldnt eat away everything it touches at those temperatures.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould be great if to get some brainstorming on this from you guys \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T07:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thermal issue is bogus and needs to be fixed pronto. \u00A0The ISP was a design decision (I think) and should be reversed to provide a mode realistic value.

An\u00A0NTR would have control rods that damp the chain reaction, when you want to burn you withdraw them and let the chain reaction get going, once it\u0027s at operating temperature you start pushing fuel through it, you keep it at optimal temperature by tweaking with the control rods and fuel flow rate, when you are near done with the burn you have to tail off by using the rods to damp the chain reaction and pushing enough fuel to bring the temperature down. I believe they didn\u0027t ever \u0027just shut the engine off\u0027 but always \u0027spooled it down\u0027 to cool it safely and as a side effect generating sub maximum thrust that you would have to account for as part of the burn. The engine should never over heat, I think the overheating is there for \u0027game play balance\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly - I believe with the NTR the lighter the molecule you are heating the higher the ISP you will get out of it, so you\u0027d expect O2 to get higher ISP than Kero. On the other had Kero may dissociate in the engine to C \u0026amp; H which would be lighter and therefore better than\u00A0than O2 or O. Also using hot oxidizer might oxidize the engine - I cannot recall if they had plans for coatings etc that would allow using oxidizing fuels. A NERVA running on CH4 has an ISP of 644, kero would be less that that. Again I think they picked the number for \u0027game play balance\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T07:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA common mistake made by people in this community is to try and equate KSP\u0027s fuels with anything that exists in real life. We can safely claim that the properties of LiquidFuel are similar to those of Hydrazine and Kerosene, and even that they were probably used as a basis, but we shouldn\u0027t presume that LiquidFuel needs to be treated the same in any other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy hypothesis regarding the current state of the LV-N is that SQUAD evaluated the possibilities and decided that this was a case in which realism had to take a back seat to balance. If a NERVA goes into production in real life, it will in all probability completely outmode all other vacuum engines (save for ion engines on probes) due to its awesome Isp. So anyone running a real space program would, for the purposes of their spacecraft, quit investing in chemical rockets altogether, and they would be reduced to fond memories. SQUAD doesn\u0027t want this happening in the game. Some of us would probably like a KSP where we can slap an LV-N on a mothership and instantly get 25km/s of delta-V, but then again we\u0027d probably also like an Unobtanium Hyperengine that gives 10,000 thrust and infinite efficiency. But we must concede that while fun for a few minutes, it would ruin the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf immersion-breaking is the problem, I personally think of it this way: the engine contains small nuclear fuel rods that do not generate significant heat individually (they may also be in insulated, thermally-controlled containers). When activated, it moves them all close together and runs propellant over them. Not only do they start to generate heat faster, but because the propellant is thermally conductive and has significant mass, as it rubs around the inside of the engine it heats up the whole thing. It takes some of the heat with it, of course, so we can surmise that a closed-circuit reactor made from an LV-N would simply overheat much faster.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr perhaps it\u0027s actually a fusion engine. It only says it\u0027s an \u0022atomic rocket motor\u0022 in the KSP lore. As discussed earlier, its resemblance, even if intentional, to the real NERVA is no basis for extrapolation. Fusion is \u0022atomic\u0022 just as much as fission is. So perhaps the LV-N really contains a fusion reactor that produces huge amounts of heat while running and none while off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T08:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLV-Ns use LH2 for best results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad decided against adding another fuel type and the resulting changes that would be needed (extra tank parts, or something in the VAB to tweak tank contents) which would complicate things (and in their opinion) without really improving gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany people have complained about the overheating issue...

Typically it operates for a few minutes at a time, then sits idle for the rest of the entire mission. Before each use, one has to warm up the reactor, and after use the reactor has to be cooled down. \u003Cstrong\u003EEach\u003C/strong\u003E of these thermal cycles puts stress on the engine. And the cooling process consists of wasting propellant, flushing it through the reactor just to cool it off instead of producing thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, during the rest of the mission, your spacecraft needs electricity to run life support, radio, radar, computers, and other incidental things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo make that reactor do double duty \u003Cem\u003E(that\u0027s where the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Bimodal\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E comes in)\u003C/em\u003E and kill two birds with one stone. Refer to above diagram. Basically you take a NERVA and attach a power generation unit to the side. The NERVA section is the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022cryogenic H2 propellant tank\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, the turbopump, and the thermal propulsion unit. The power generation section is the generator, the radiator, the heat exchanger, and the compressor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarm up your reactor \u003Cstrong\u003Eonce\u003C/strong\u003E, do a thrust burn, stop the propellant flow and use the heat exchanger and radiator to partially cool the reactor to power generation levels, and keep the reactor warm for \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe rest of the mission\u003C/strong\u003E while generating electricity for the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows you to get away with only \u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C/strong\u003E full warm/cool thermal cycle in the entire mission instead of one per burn. No propellant is wasted as coolant since the radiator cools down the reactor. The reactor supplies needed electricity. And as an added bonus, the reactor is in a constant pre-heated state. This means that in case of emergency one can power up and do a burn in a fraction of the time required by a cold reactor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor balance I would propose the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the ISRU and drills, the LV-N has an optimal core temperature (3,000 K), but starts cold. (core temperature being different from internal and skin temperature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you run the engine, the internal temperature goes down, and the thrust\u0026amp;Isp is a factor of the core temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have no radiators, and don\u0027t use the engine until the core temperature reaches 3000k, the core to internal heat flow is high enough that the nerva will explode (or possibly the part it is attached to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore to use it without radiators, you must start your burn before the core has warmed up all the way (lets say around the time it only produces 400 Isp?) and you must start spooling down the reactor to a lower temperature before you finish your burn... so that at the start and end of your burn you obtain lower thrust and Isps... and its harder to get precise burns (maybe you supplement with chemical engines to finish off the burn precisely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you need a lot of radiators to keep the engine from exploding as you heat the core to 3000K before a burn, and as you cool down the core after a burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus the engine\u0027s drawbacks would be that you don\u0027t get thrust on demand like a chemical rocket, but you need to warm and cool the core after each burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need lots of radiators for short burns... but for a long continuous burn, you may find it more efficient to ditch the radiator mass, and just start the burn before the core reaches its maximum/optimal temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T08:14:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T10:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222321880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127821\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450075935\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271626\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, MalfunctionM1Ke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly:\u003Cbr\u003E\n(...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo in fact the engine should cool down while it is working and heat up while it is not, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecondly:\u003Cbr\u003E\n(...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot sure if the Oxygen wouldnt eat away everything it touches at those temperatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngines have a module which produces an amount of heat that scales with the thrust output.

Unfortunately, you cannot run them on oxidizer only even in Interstellar, but you can use a wide variety of different fuels.

engines are gonna just be rarely if ever used.\u00A0 Right now (although i know its not realistic), the nuke is fairly well balanced, lowish TWR, very heavy at 3t, and has a heat problem (even if that

lowish ISP or thrust when spooling up, and then increase its ISP to the maximum when at operating temperature.\u00A0 This would make it more realistic in that the nuke is good for its usual useage of long burns, but suffers in both thrust and ISP when cooled down making it bad for short range bursts, unless you preheat it or something (but ofc then we\u0027d need the ability to engage some form of heater perhaps for balance uses electricity or some of it).\u00A0 This way itd be interesting, either pick a cold start, or use electricity (or something else) to heat it up before the

determining how long the spooldown would ofccur, then id accept it, but we need to have it done in such a way that new players would be able to understand it reliably, and that it doesnt become a utter pain to use that engine in the first place.\u00A0 Im all for some more advanced mechanics with the nuke, but please make sure that the changes add to the game, make it more fun (and in my opinion realism for the sake of realism is not always fun) and arent just extra tedious or excessively complicated.\u00A0 As i always say, realism for the sake of realism is not fun, realism when it adds to the game, opens up new options, and adds a challenge that isnt purely tedious or annoying is good, all else better stick to mods and not be forced upon those that do not find 100% realism

You wouldn\u0027t have the control rods fully retracted so that the reactor is producing maximum power at all times, even if you could cycle enough coolant through it (and then through radiators) to keep it from melting down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0As in the bimodal example, you would use it to generate electricity, so the core would be \u0022warm\u0022 but not \u0022hot\u0022, but also not \u0022cold\u0022. Spool up/down time would be reduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic idea is that when you crank up your reactor output, and heat the core to ~3000K, you are generating a lot of heat, and the surrounding structure cannot take it. You need something to take that heat away and cool the surrounding material (in this case, the fissile core can withstand those temperatures... 3000k being about as hot as we can make a core without it melting...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso in addition to warming up the core, there is also the matter of the reaction rate not changing instantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your core is at 3000K, but the fission power production is very low... when you start passing cryogenic fluid through it, the temperature will drop until the power output equals the heat flow into the fluid passing through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... when your NTR is producing maximum thrust at maximum Isp, its got a hot core and a high rate of fission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you suddenly stopped flowing cryogenic H2 through it... it wouldnt just sit there at 3000K, as it still has a very high power output. It would rapidly heat up when the cryogenic fluid stops flowing. So when you stop passing \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 through it, you need to pass something else through it to keep it from overheating while you wait for the fission rate to decreases/the power output todrop/the core to cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis something else would simply be \u0022coolant\u0022. You would route the coolant through the reactor, then to radiators where it will cool off, and then back into the reactor again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could then abruptly shut off the fuel flow through the engine at will, as long as you start running coolant through the engine and radiators as soon as you shut off the fuel flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I can figure, the spool up is less of a problem. You start the fission reaction, as fission power increases, the core heats up, when the core is hot, send fuel through it. I\u0027m not sure what the heat flow situation is like... maybe the stuff surroundng the core will melt if the core sits at 3000K? maybe it won\u0027t, but the core will exceed 3000K if you don\u0027t start running fuel past it. If the former, then you\u0027ve got to start using fuel before the core is hot enough/ at its maximum power output\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t send fuel through it, it will overheat... you can\u0027t keep it at a hot temperature and high fission rate for very long before you need to pass something through it to keep it from melting. Radiators would allow you to cycle fluid through it while it sits there hot with a high power output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, you can use liquid fuel to keep the core from overheating until the liquid fuel is gone, or you can \u0022cycle\u0022 coolant through the core and then radiators to keep it cool indefinitely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality, a compact reactor of highly enriched fissile material at a very high fission rate would consume enough fissile material and make enough byproducts, that you couldn\u0027t just leave it \u0022on\u0022 for days on end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does not model consumption of any fissile material, there\u0027s no need for reprocessing of the contents of a LV-N... so in KSP\u002B this proposal there\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t leave the LV-N on indefinitely with radiators (unless you wanted to go even more in depth, and make LV-Ns consume liquid fuel and \u0022blutonium\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is that those radiators would then be always in use dumping reactor heat, and wouldn\u0027t be available for cooling other things.

In real life the NERVA was considered as an upper stage engine for a Saturn V style rocket, I\u0027ve virtually never seen them used on KSP launchers because you don\u0027t need that much delta-V at the low TWR the LV-N does well. Last I checked you could go as far as Duna and the chemical and nuclear options would be similar in overall mass, and that was before the LV-N gained weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this talk about spooling and excessive thermal management seems a bit complicated, I reckon it could get annoying. What I think would be better to make the LV-N stop being so dominant would be the same thing that limits it in real life - it uses liquid hydrogen and that boils off. Fuel boiloff could be implemented quite easily in KSP already I think, just make the fuel tank slowly consume its own fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo that end KSP would of course need to adopt multiple fuels. I don\u0027t though want a zillion fuels and tiny differences in mixture like you get in Realism Overhaul.

Runs most of the chemical engines along with Liquid Fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMonopropellant\u003C/strong\u003E: Is now abandoned in the interests of simplicity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this vision we\u0027ve only one more fuel than before, and yet I feel there\u0027s considerable new richness added to the game. Engines great for the ejection burn are no longer also suitable for orbital insertion at your destination. Not needing separate monoprop tanks will I think be a welcome simplification of craft designs, and make RCS more practical, at present it seems under-used. ISRU becomes more relevant than ever - the only way you\u0027re flying back from Jool on an LV-N is if you mine some hydrogen when you\u0027re there. There\u0027s the natural option for engines using Liquid Fuel and CryoOxidizer too, which would fit between CFCO and LFO engines in efficiency, and might logically be some of the most powerful in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the downside, we\u0027d probably need a fuel tank switcher in stock to keep the parts list manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T13:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want NERVAs to be realistic then you should take their main disadvantage too, such as killing anyone that isn\u0027t in the right end of an operating nerva several kilometers away.
