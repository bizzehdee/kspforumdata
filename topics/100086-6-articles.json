I installed Kerbal Engineer (since there was an update that supposedly works with 1.0), and the Jeb9000 and Bill9000 and Protractor parts (so that the ships with those parts on them could load, even though they don\u0027t have any MechJeb or Protractor dll to link to). The game loaded up OK, and showed all my old ships in the Tracking Station. \n\nBut when I went to Laythe and started looking over the ships, the game hung (spinning beach ball of death...\u0022Application Not Responding\u0022...memory usage was over 3GB by the application according to the Activity Monitor). \n\nSo I Force Quit and restarted KSP. This time I checked out one of the Laythe BirdDogs, which looked really strange because of the reworked parts. The Ram-Air Intakes are now big clunky things, and the forward-swept canards are no longer forward-swept canards, and the tail fin is different. But, if you look closely at the BirdDog\u0027s rear fuel tank, you\u0027ll see that the bug that causes certain parts to show up shrunken has apparently NOT been fixed (but hopefully the old fix that I\u0027ve been using with the Module Manager will work again to fix this):\n\n![x1ZsizR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x1ZsizR.jpg)\n\nStrangely, the jet engine was deactivated, but I reactivated it and tried an take-off run. The BirdDog was very slow in taking off, but it did get into the air...and then the game froze up again.\n\nRestart...try again...and again the game froze up after takeoff.\n\nSo I restarted the game and decided to check out Duna instead. I went to the Duna Lander 1 (currently unmanned). Its rocket engines were still activated, and so I decided to try flying it into orbit. Lift-off OK (with the cool new dust effects...but I couldn\u0027t tell if they were red Duna dust because I\u0027m colorblind). Started to tip the lander downrange...and, again, the program froze up. Memory usage over 3 GB. Application not responding.\n\nAlas. So now I\u0027ll try a new save to see if the few parts I have installed are what\u0027s causing the problem.

But the new Nuclear Engine still uses plain ol\u0027 high density liquid fuel (whatever that is). So designing a new Tug would probably best be done with aircraft Liquid Fuel tankage. Even though they have a higher dry weight than LF/O tanks...I expect they will still be better than using a LF/O tank that is only partially filled with liquid fuel.\n\nThe question I\u0027m interested in (for the sake of the old Tugs) is what kind of delta-V they can get now with the updated nuclear engines and tanks (partially)-filled with only liquid fuel.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, did some tests.

But now the side boosters push the rocket ridiculously high before they burnout (over 30 km) and the apoapsis is up at 185 km -- that\u0027s just goofy. So I had to drop the side boosters before they even burned out (at 20-something kilometers) so that the sustainer could turn and head into orbit (with the help of the friendly nukes of the Tug above 40 km).\n\nI couldn\u0027t just run the nukes the whole time, because they would overheat to the point of explosion. Who would design a nuclear engine that couldn\u0027t be run at its full rated throttle? That\u0027s just stupid. I guess they want to make our loooong nuke burns even loooooonnnnggeerrrr. \n\nAnyway, it got into a 100 km orbit with the Tug finishing the burn and dragging the sustainer along. By the way, this was with the Tug tanks full of unnecessary oxidizer (since I wanted a comparison with the old situation where the Tug had oxidizer as well). \n\nThe Tug transferred enough fuel and oxidizer to the sustainer so that the sustainer could attempt a return to Kerbin (reusability, you know). I separated the Tug and eye-balled the retro burn for the return to KSC (since, of course, no MechJeb to help target it). The sustainer was stable butt-first during reentry. The heat caused the four fins (AV-R\\* Winglets) to explode. I guess those aren\u0027t designed for reentry. The rest of the sustainer survived (I did the cheaty \u0022pop ou the chutes during the reentry flames\u0022 method) and landed a few kilometers off shore from KSC using parachutes and engine braking. Then it fell over in the water and exploded its forward tank.\n\n![t3v4YwU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t3v4YwU.jpg)\n\nIn version 1.0, the delta-V capacity of the Standard Nuclear Tug *with all of the oxidizer removed* is about 4.1 km/sec. That compares to a delta-V or about 9.5 km/sec that the Tug had in version 0.90. AND the inability to run the nukes at full throttle would require much longer burns. It\u0027s a sad day in TugLand, boys and girls.\n\nA new Tug design is going to need to use the aircraft Liquid-Fuel-only tanks to be efficient.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh! The sepatrons on the side boosters were, of course, positioned to safely push the side boosters away from the sustainer back in the day when the bug was causing the boosters to try to nose inward after separation. So for this flight in 1.0, the sepatrons caused the side boosters to pivot rather violently nose-outward, and swing around to smash into each other below the sustainer.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nUh oh! After messing around with the reusable booster for several launches and trips back and forth from the VAB...KSP has crashed again, taking up over 3GB again. And this is in a NEW save game.
