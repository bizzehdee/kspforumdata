Specifically the ground transmission and sattelite recieving and re-transmission, also what governs what the dishes are made of and shaped like. My (limited) understanding is that the ground station sends a signal (some band of radiation?) to a sattelite in some sort of orbit (LEO,MEO,GEO,SSO,Molynia etc..). This sattelite then sends the signal back to a different ground station.

One of the simplest is a geostationary repeater, which simply receives, filters, and retransmits any waveform it \u0022hears\u0022 on a particular band. Users can then \u0022bounce\u0022 a signal \u0022off\u0022 of the repeater to transmit to other users outside their line-of-sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore complex SATCOM implementations can feature cross-band transmission, support for multiple services, cross-links to other satellite in the same constellation, and even (if you don\u0027t mind shelling out major cash) complete point-to-point coverage from a large network of low-earth satellites (a la Iridium).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESATCOM networks can be robust and flexible. Networks exist for the transmission of phone conversations, radio channels, television networks, and many more. Most leverage a range of microwave bands (Ku and Ka are two of the most common). Putting such communications in space has a number of advantages, including coverage and cost (believe it or not, a handful of communications satellites are frequently both much easier and much cheaper than, for example, laying down a new trans-oceanic fiber network).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T23:09:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TythosEternal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos, is course!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T23:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding satellite dishes forms and materials, the key is mostly to have the dish\u0027s inside layer made of reflective material - then the shape is put into play, to concentrate those reflected waves on a single point, while allowing a bit of freedom regarding at which angle the waves hits the dish. (So you don\u0027t need absolute precision - just being pointed in the direction of the emitter is enough. The receiver is placed at the collection point.

An antenna with a low gain, for example the ones in your phone, will receive and emit roughly the same in every direction. An antenna with high gain will send all the energy in a small cone, and amplify signals coming from there too. That\u0027s why antennas are usually very high gain, both on Earth (the satellite is a small target, power is expensive), and on the satellite (Earth is also a small target from GEO) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDish antennas used to be very popular because they are quite easy to build. They work on the same principle as a telescope, using a parabolic reflector to concentrate the signal. There are a few variants, like the Cassegrain that get better gain (more powerful) in the same size. To reflect radiowaves, you need anything conductive, for satellites its often silver plated aluminium or titanium, because they are very light, and silver is the best metallic conductor there is. Earth based dishes are usually made of steel because it is cheaper, but high end stuff can be made of copper, possibly silver or gold plated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn common alternative on modern satellites is antenna arrays: a bunch of small antennas all connected to each other. They have performances comparable to dishes of the same area, but are flatter and sturdier. It is also easier to tweak them to beams of arbitrary shapes, but it\u0027s more difficult to get good performances over a wide bandwidth. There are many ways to build this type of antenna, but the easier one is to use a printed circuit board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA common reason to use a beam with a weird shape is to send signal in one place and not another. For example, for a TV satellite, you don\u0027t want to waste your power sending a signal in the middle of the ocean, or to a country where you don\u0027t plan to sell your services. To do that, you need to use each antenna with a specific phase, that you find using magic (math irl but beyond the scope of this post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have modulation/demodulation, encryption and all sorts of other details. The big question is how to encode information on a radiowave, and there are lots of ways to do it, with different advantages and issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
