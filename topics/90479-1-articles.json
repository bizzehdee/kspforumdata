The unique \u0022K\u0022 wing design, scaled up from one of Dorfmann Kerman\u0027s model rocket plane designs, helps to provide additonal wing lift and roll stability to help make the extremely difficult and dangero.... uh, \u0022simple\u0022 landing back on the runway even easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x5v28mm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x5v28mm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s follow a typical passenger flight.... well, typical successful passenger flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou and 11 other perfecly sane, not crazy at all, passengers will get onboard of our SPACE SHUTTLE!.

I tackled this from building a capable space plane first, then built the kind of carrier plane needed to lift it that high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was VERY tempted to just build a crazy-overpowere carrier \u0022plane\u0022, that would use at least some rocket power, that would be pointing sharply upwards at a high speed when releasing the space plane. So, the space plane could be a lot smaller. Those were two loopholes in the rules, not requiring the carrier plane to be purely jet powered, no rockets, and taking off horizontally. And not requiring either a horizontal \u0022drop\u0022, or only a shallow climb when the carrier plane drops the space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could have used a smaller SRB for the space plane. But once I saw how well the big SRB flew.... I had to use it. Even though that meant the carrier plane would have to be pretty big. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I ended up needing to change the big SRB to one with a lot less power, more on that later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe carrier plane a PITA. A number of control issues. And structural issues too, before it was finally stiff enough to be able to fly without \u0022dancing\u0022. The original plane\u0027s fuselage was based on girder trusses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4i1A90e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224i1A90e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoy was that a mistake. I changed to 1.25 meter 800 liter tanks (empty) for most of the fuselage, which were a lot better but still needed to add some struts to brace the tailboom from swaying side to side (part of the take-off problems). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The wing design evolved. Originally it had less span. Then it grew, and grew. And went from 4 jets to 6. It was a bear to get to successfully take off, and handled slightly better than a garbage scow. However, it flies better now, and is not hard to land. I also learned to use \u0022tweakable\u0022 options on the control surfaces to disable unwanted functions such as yaw response on the wings when I only wanted roll (aileron) response. The plane started handling a lot better after that. Of course if the wings had been straight (flat), there would not have been any yaw interaction. But I liked the look of it, with the dihedral. Although I am not so sure that KSP aerodynamics recognizes the dihedral for roll stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Plane handling and glide are very nice. It can get at least as slow as 23 m/s before stalling, so that helps to stretch out the glide path if the pull-up was not really close to the Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after I finally got the carrier plane worked out, and could fly to above 25 km to do a horizontal drop, the velocity at that height was 500-600 m/s. When the ship was dropped, it did not want to pitch up much. I tried tricks like a pair of separatrons in the nose and tail thrusting in opposite directions to force a pitch-up, which helped but not enough. It took so long to pitch up, that by the time it could finally get vertical, it had tremendous horizontal velocity and was almost impossible to try to get thrust the other way to fall back in range of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I gave up on horizontal drops. The carrier plane went thru more changes, reduced the span back ot an earlier version, added more jet engines, so that after a horizontal takeoff it could climb vertically and release the space plan vertically. Though there were also more tweaks needed to be able to fly vertically under thrust, originally the thrust wanted to pitch it nose-down when it was pointed vertically and got to thinner air Finally got that worked out. And after working out some more bugs..... finally got a great launch. Well, being separated vertically, coasting up already, the SRB power took it crazy high. Over 2000 kilometers! The space plane\u0027s projected landing spot was about 1/3 around the planet, taking about 90 minutes of duration to fall back. So, the SRB Space Plane was overkill. But I liked the design a lot. So I replaced the big long SRB (KD25K) with the original RT-10 solid fuel booster in KSP, and added two long 800 liter rocket fuel tanks to it to match the length of the big SRB (the tanks were tweaked to be empty, no fuel, no oxidizer, the Space Plane using only solids for thrust). That version therefore only flew for 94.5 km, plenty high above the atmosphere but not as high as I was hoping for. Below is a pic showing both, the final version on the left, and the original with the big KD25K SRB on the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/68kLqsv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002268kLqsv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the carrier plane is now perfected, I could make up a totally different space plane that could fly higher. But from the start I wanted to do a space plane that was \u0022outside of the box\u0022, with the passengers riding on the outside. Still, it could be made smaller and carry 12\u002B1 on the outside anyway. Also from the start I figured out the usefulness of having pairs of separatrons to nudge the ballistic path (in map view) to bring it closer to where the runway should be due to rotation of the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the \u0022K\u0022 wing flies nicely. I wanted to give the plane more wing area without giving it more span, and something unique looking. In my main hobby of Model Rocketry, I came up with a rocket boosted glider with a \u0022K\u0022 type wing (and tail) in 1975. It was even a kit briefly by an old obscure model rocket company. It\u0027s not aerodynamically efficient in the real world, no biplane is, and the \u0022K\u0022 wing is even worse for a biplane, but in KSP it seems OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://plans.rocketshoppe.com/pubs/ASC/1976/ASC_1976_catalog.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://plans.rocketshoppe.com/pubs/ASC/1976/ASC_1976_catalog.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeorgeG\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vQ9U6rU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vQ9U6rU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T09:54:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 09:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoioh","CreatedById":118116,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T14:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice story George, but could you put it in spoiler tags please? you\u0027re making the page hard to load and excessively long at the same time. just type \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and the same, with a / before the word spoiler and without the title, in front and behind every image in your post. it will make it a lot more readable like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2935674/Kerbal/screenshot198.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot198.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr go to imgur.com and use the [imgur] tags with the number of your album.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeorgeG","CreatedById":59741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T07:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade another Space Plane, and modified the carrier plane a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one, not as totally outside of the box as the \u0022K\u0022 wing with everyone riding the outside.
