I believe some of your concerns are being addressed in an upcoming version of Unity but I don\u0027t expect Squad to want to migrate to that or implement the new GUI features in a hurry. Otherwise, the current GUI implementation of \u0027looping rendering\u0027 is actually still very common in a lot of game engines.
