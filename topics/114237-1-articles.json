That velocity loss likely has less of an effect on energy efficiency than cosine losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency of atmospheric launch of a nuanced thing. You need to balance drag, thrust, and mass against each other. Low (or single) stage launchers complicate this by reducing the flexibility in thrust and mass profiles. At what point does engine mass outweigh TRW gains? Faster acceleration gets you out of the air faster reducing dV losses, but needs more fuel per dV. Taking to the extreme, very rapid exit from the soup could require suboptimal burns to orbital velocity. Is the reduced time in the soup worth it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanism of your gravity turn is gravity applying acceleration towards the surface. This alters the velocity direction via vector addition. The turn rate has an inversely proportional relationship with engine acceleration and a porpotionate relationship with the sine of the angle from vertical of your heading. High TWR designs need an aggressive turn to account for a shorter burn and the reduced work of gravity. OTOH, a shallower accent increases drag losses. Especially since you are flying with greater speed. The important thing is to grain horizontal momentum. That controls your angle from horizon at a given time from Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry fidiling with your initial pitch mauver while trying for that 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 10 km. This part of the flight is where you need acceleration the most. If you exceed 110% atmospheric efficiency getting to a 10 km angle of 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or more, reduce your engine array for mass savings. Don\u0027t use throttling if you have too much power down low. Reduced engine weight reduces other requirements. Be warned, due to the sinusoidal nature of the gravity turn, the greater your pitch-over, the more accurate it needs to be. It could be worthwhile to note both the initial pitch-over and the desired angle a minute later so you can correct before you deviate from flight plan too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: I tend to be bad with high TWR gravity turns in atmo.
