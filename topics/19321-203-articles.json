I have to say that I understand your viewpoint and that it does have merits. However, let me just say one more thing on the topic: At least the way Ferram has done the changes is very user-friendly. Not too hard to edit a ModuleManager file \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wedgenet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wedgenet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the explanation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem.
