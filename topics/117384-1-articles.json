Hyperedit MIGHT be able to do it.. its a very useful mod for alot of things.. trains seem to float down from 50 metres without damage.. ive teleported entire trains before harmlessly.. make a copy of your save though if you can at all. back it up somewhere else so if your efforts fail using one attempt youve always got the original there to try again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eloading the game again MIGHT fix it as sometimes ive had a diesel or some tankers buried in a hill but within 2 seconds its reset once the game fully loaded and settled down.. nothing exploded.. another idea (using the backup save) would be to possibly use something else to drive nearby into physics range to see if the reset of physics brings her out of the dirt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elastly (an edit to the post I just remembered) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve not had a train do this for over a year despite being in some terrible situations and terrain styles..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe difference is ive not used that ring shaped tiny fuel tank as a buffer between couplings (docking ports)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eive got hundreds of kilometres logged on some trains. save, resave.. quicksave etc.. but none has ended up like they used too.. similar to your above situation..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(also..

I had the worst rescue mission on the Mun where the marooned kerbal\u0027s pod (Hitchhiker) just up and exploded as I got close with Jeb, requiring a very, very, very long hike back to the landing site with Jeb as the marooned kerbal was able to EVA back. After all that, there was not enough fuel in the lander to make orbit which would make a follow-up pickup mission much easier. After a few attempts I just decided to debug infinite fuel and bring them home. Pro-tip: Infinite fuel requires fuel to be present for it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
