So far I have only been to Duna, and getting there, I parked my ship in LKO, put a probe on the launch pad and used time warp. However, now that my ship is in Duna parking orbit, it limits how fast I can time warp due to being below 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a protractor mod to tell me when the angle is correct, but a protractor based at Kerbin doesn\u0027t give me the angle I need to return from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T17:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse kerbal alarm clock.

I actually had 6 flights in progress at once (2 to Moho, 2 to Jool, 1 to Dres and 1 to Eeloo), and in combination with Alarm Clock (which also now saves manoeuvre nodes calculated by MJ), was able to switch between flights pretty easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I did find that MJ wasn\u0027t quite as efficient as Protractor, but, pretty damn close. When I plotted my two flights to Jool, the first was done by MJ, and the 2nd was a manual burn using Protractor, about 1 1/2 days after the MJ burn. The later flight (done through Protractor) actually ended up arriving some 5 days before the MJ flight; both flights were in the order of 270 days or so to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not really added anything to answer the OP\u0027s question, except that he might want to consider controlling many different flights at the same time. This allows you to have things to do when warping time and your different flights waiting for their transfer windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T13:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the suggestions guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
