I think I have all of the required other mods to keep those running, but they just aren\u0027t showing up in-game. Any reasons/fixes for this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo add on, I think the near future stuff is on the latest version (not 1.11.2), but is there any way to find older versions on the Near Future mods that are compatible w/ 1.11.2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother edit, I found a mod on Curseforge in version 1.11.2 called \u0022KNES-1\u0022 and downloaded that.
