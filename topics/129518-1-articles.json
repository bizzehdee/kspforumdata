KSP has conditioned me into avoiding the clickthrough and delayed-click issues, I almost never have trouble with either of those while building. I tend to hover my cursor a lot, deciding on clicks only after I see the highlight I expect, rotate or zoom out camera to ensure menus are not over parts, etc etc, all without much conscious thought anymore.

I remember symmetry in particular being an unintended and silent victim that would only become apparent much later in a build. Also when doing a lot of gizmo work on a build, Ctrl-Z likes (liked?) to screw things up. So I learned to avoid it completely, and saved often and reloaded my last save instead. Perhaps no longer entirely warranted, but I don\u0027t remember release notes specifically mentioning this being resolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t want this lock switch to be based on hierarchy, no.

Big subassemblies at times, with lots of parts and lots of gizmo work. Many of my subassemblies hardly ever need editing anymore once saved, and all I need to be able to do at that point is place the entire assembly where I want and act pretty much as a single piece. Yet what happens often enough is that subassemblies once placed on a new craft, will get disassembled again in unintended misclicks. Being able to set all parts of those subassemblies as \u0027unclickable\u0027 would in one fell swoop solve .. around 50-75% of the misclicks is probably not far from the truth. For the odd times I need to edit the actual subassembly, I\u0027ll gladly reach for the rightclick menu for the specific part that I premeditatedly wish to pick up right then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedman","CreatedById":156040,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T22:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere should be a text list box to select parts with, having to manage the camera so I can select parts I\u0027ve clipped in is tedious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T02:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I kind of agree this would be neat but if the click through issues are fix it may not be necessary.\u00A0 I would almost suggest reversing the click and shift\u002Bclick functionality though.\u00A0 I.e. hold Shift to remove a part or don\u0027t hold shift to move the ship around.\u00A0 I say \u0027almost\u0027 because I\u0027m so accustomed to the way it is now I may or may not like that lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T17:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could\u0027ve sworn Squad said this was going to be a feature awhile back.

If it doesn\u0027t work properly or optimally then it needs work, but that doesn\u0027t mean the concept isn\u0027t the actual answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ultimately thing this sort of feature needs to be quick and easy, efficient and logical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently Ctrl\u002BZ is mainly \u003Cstrong\u003Enot efficient(for those large crafts). Logically it makes the most sense, and is SUPER quick(in terms of how quick the player can use it). \u003C/strong\u003EAny realistic change to this needs to overcome at least the efficiency part. Locked part sub-assemblies come to mind, but that is bulky and not that easy to use. In-edit mode lock parts seems easy but building a logical tree structure to lock down parts how you want it is a pretty significant problem. (what is mainly proposed here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow lets say we have a bunch of geniuses and they find a realistic solution to this problem of how to build a logical tree structure to lock down the parts we want quickly and easily. How would we implement this so it stays \u003Cstrong\u003Eeasy to use and still logical\u003C/strong\u003E as \u003Cstrong\u003E@alshain \u003C/strong\u003E said we need to still pay attention to what players actually do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also \u003Cstrong\u003Edo not want bugs that lock parts that we can\u0027t unlock\u003C/strong\u003E that would be basically game breaking. So implementation needs to be almost fool proof, as permanently locked parts would ruin anyones craft entirely. Which is far worse than a session crash from Ctrl\u002BZ. So in this case it would be FAR WORSE having an almost perfect but craft ruining bug in this part locking, than having an inefficient ctrl\u002BZ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut lets say we get a perfect running system and theres no bugs. Now we would have to \u003Cstrong\u003Eoptimally \u003C/strong\u003Eallow \u003Cstrong\u003Eattachments onto locked parts\u003C/strong\u003E. As there is no way to get around players wanting to put on the small stuff last. Thats not that hard, but for the proposition of adding \u003Cstrong\u003E4 different ways to lock parts \u003C/strong\u003Emeans 4 more buttons to add onto a menu somewhere. \u003Cstrong\u003ESince its based off clicks you need to add it to the r-click menu for\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eevery part in the game\u003C/strong\u003E there would have to be a base tweak-able class. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis isn\u0027t hard to implement, but it means instant window clutter, or another window ontop of the current tweakables\u003C/strong\u003E. We can add it to some key shortcut combo but we can\u0027t get around either multiple different hidden key combos(emacs anyone?) or a popup window which adds to clutter. This can be acceptable, but defiantly not something forced upon the masses who generally have no problem hitting Ctrl\u002BZ for their non 500 part machines to fix their part grab through a window(the father bug).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we can have a \u003Cstrong\u003Eperfect setup to lock parts\u003C/strong\u003E that will intrinsically be more efficient than Ctrl\u002BZ, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut\u003C/strong\u003E be far more complicated, and automatically forced upon everyone, just for a select few people where Ctrl\u002BZ is to inefficient. We could hide it by default, but this sort of code isn\u0027t simple. Ctrl\u002BZ undos something, by redoing what was done. Simple easy, and straight foward to code. Locking down parts selectively is complicated, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhich is why this post is LONG as hell.\u003C/strong\u003E So putting something is complicated, mandatorially perfect and only ends up an option that few will need? That sounds like something left to mods, not stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m just not sold that locking pieces into place is something to add that is inherently better than Ctrl\u002BZ for the masses.\u003C/strong\u003E If its a mod I see its usages for huge craft builders, but not for the masses who can Ctrl\u002BZ their way out of problems, rather than working through menus to prevent them. Too many people can deal with their craft issues, rather than the few who need this feature. As such, it would be a useful Mod, but not a good implementation to stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T23:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
