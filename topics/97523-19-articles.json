This is because the core is attached not to the cargo bay but to the SAS modules. I had to re-do the attachment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain concerns: rear hidden canards tend to pop out on pull up, so I lowered them so they don\u0027t stick out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe STS 107 Space Hab module, and any module that attaches to the rear of the bay actually breaks fuel flow because when you created your stack, you reattached the fuel line to the cargo bay, and not the monoprop tank. This unfortunately breaks fuel flow at anytime the rear cargo attachment point is used for cargo. I ran into this in STS-2. STS-3 fixed it. I fixed it for this prototype, but its not centered like STS-4 is, so I will probably work on that in my next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the above issues fixed, I present to you the STS-5 Space Shuttle Prototype Inayla: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/d7rh3x55oh5gyni/STS-5_Prototype_Inayla.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMediaFire Download\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Inayla prototype name is a combination of Inigma, Araym, and Darth Lazarus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am wary about part counts too, so I might try to remove a few internal wing parts if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gliding control with the SpaceHab module in the bay (defaulted in the download with appropriate fuel amounts), is about 8% more sluggish than the STS-4, and comes down heavier as a result requiring a massive flare for safe landing.

Instead, use \u0022Landing Guidance\u0022 and select the KSC pad. Cancel it once the crosses meet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Come in hot and high. Nothing is as useless as the altitude you don\u0027t have. \u003Cem\u003E::Edit:: She\u0027s aerodynamic. So if you let the crosses meet, she will overshoot. That\u0027s what gives you the wiggle-room when you reach KSC.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Use S-turns to get yourself down where you need to be (in other words, do it like NASA did. It\u0027s a credit to \u003Cstrong\u003Einigma\u003C/strong\u003E that this thing behaves so well, though I can\u0027t speak to its accuracy having never flown a real Shuttle...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) She will want to dive and has an alarming descent rate, so use SAS/thrusters to hold the nose up to bleed off the speed and keep her actually flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Land her like an airliner, with procedural turns. It\u0027s actually easiest to fly past KSC a couple KM to the left of it, then do a base and \u0022upwind\u0022 turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If you get it wrong, the OMS engines have just enough grunt (and fuel) to extend your glide. Use them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Don\u0027t hold the nose too high on landing. If you\u0027re carrying too much speed, go off the end of the runway. Descent rate is (in this simulation) more important. Those are tiny wheels and won\u0027t take anything above 10m/s when they hit the deck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E::Edit:: Many thanks for the rep, my friend!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T17:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frannington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
