It was an easy enough ruse. She didn\u0027t look like herself anymore, and she certainly didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like herself. She was still unconvinced that she wasn\u0027t strapped down in a padded room somewhere drooling on herself, and all this was just an elaborate dissociative fugue. So for lack of anything else to do, might as well go along with it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice if her damaged brain could hallucinate sleep soon, though. She still hadn\u0027t slept, but spent the entire night in a broom closet learning how to land on the M\u00FCn. Just giving the silly idea thought was clearly madness. Yet here she was, inching up the expansive flank of an Urugan-class booster. Sleep deprivation was medically proven to cause madness. The fact that none of the technicians busying themselves around her paid her the slightest mind, as if she were invisible, also played to that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was all very... convenient.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, these technicians were probably under rather explicit orders \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to see her, and Ussaris could be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0good at not seeing things when told to do so. That didn\u0027t make it any less unnerving, they way they twittered on with each other as if she weren\u0027t even there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe elevator jerked to a stop. With a sigh, and not the slightest hint of challenge from those around, she stepped up to the waiting hatch. It was another \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0capsule, an old Blok F static test unit that had been refurbished and stripped down, leaving it little more than a flying fuel tank. Valentina caught a glimpse of herself in the reflective glass of the hatch window. Huge, dark bags under her eyes, her short hair hidden away beneath a white technician\u0027s scrub hat, and a couple of new cuts already fading into scars. No, she certainly didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like herself, either. It was an easy ruse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith practiced grace, she swung through the hatch and settled into the pilot\u0027s couch, next to a huge drum of water ballast in the other one. At least her back had stopped hurting. Surprising, but she would take any break she could, at this point. Come to think of it, \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of her wounds seemed to be healing very quickly. They were just superficial, anyway. It certainly wasn\u0027t due to radiation exposure from that nuclear explosion. At least she hadn\u0027t started glowing in the dark yet. Much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThunk!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina jumped as the hatch slammed shut. It brought an odd sense of finality. And, really, it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0final. Sitting atop thousands of liters of flammables, it was a virtual pyre. And soon, she would be dead. As far as anyone else knew. Dibella... Valentina tried not to think that direction. Suddenly, she felt very, very alone. The thought had occurred to her, frequently, that this whole thing was just a cover to \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0get rid of her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed. Nothing to do now, but wait. Not even a checklist to go through. She wasn\u0027t actually here, after all. On the panel in front of her, MechIVAN, Revision 8425, was running through prelaunch routines below its big, green... light. Gone was the flickering CRT display with its ring of push buttons, this new update had a very convenient touch screen. According to what she\u0027d read, it was capable of operating entire missions autonomously and adapting to unexpected conditions through a neural-network \u0027learning\u0027 CPU. She still couldn\u0027t shake the feeling it was... looking at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo hours to launch. This would be maddening. Not even a launch suit to fiddle with; the M\u00FCnar EVA suit was stowed down in the lander. Supposedly. After all, this pod was empty. If the cabin ruptured during launch, there were only two ballast barrels aboard. She wasn\u0027t even sure if the abort motors were real or not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis waiting was always the worst, and nothing at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to distract her, this time. Valentina checked her straps one more time, and laid her head back. Maybe she could at least get a couple hours of rest. She closed her weary eyes, and waited for sleep to come.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite her exhaustion, Valentina\u0027s overloaded mind simply refused to shut down. Competing questions and thoughts ran roughshod through it, like armies unsure if they were charging or routing. Maybe \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was finally madness, or maybe the whole point of madness was \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0never actually knew if you were mad or not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kommissar... if he had not been a distillation of her own madness \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0then now...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Kermanni. Probably the last one in the world. It was so beyond unthinkable that just \u003Cem\u003Ethinking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0about thinking about it should be unthinkable. In the glorious Ussari Union, there were many things we did not speak of. And then there were those things we really, \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0did not speak of. Which, of course, were spoken of all the time, with hushed voices in darkened corners, perhaps after analyzing a bit too much rocket fuel. Everyone knew \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0happened - declared enemies of the State during the Troubles, the Kermanni were systematically rounded up and made to disappear - but no one, not even the high-ranking circles Dibella moved in, knew \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella... best not let her mind wander that direction at all. Tercella was gone, and poor Vasily...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina slammed a fist against the armrest. At least it was sturdy. She needed something, \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, to distract her. She reached around and began rooting through the storage bins behind her couch. Most of them simply had small lead blocks labeled \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBALLAST\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0bolted inside. Panic was just starting to creep into her mind when she mercifully found something \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0lead in a drawer. Someone had simply scribbled \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eballast\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0on an old book of some sort. Looking closer it read:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EIMPERIOUS MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND YURTS\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nCOMPLIANCE REGULATIONS, PERMITS, AND BUILDING CODES\u003Cbr\u003E\nREVISION 3.14159\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sent up a silent orison of thanks to whatever glassy-eyed, mind-numbed engineer had stuffed it in there, likely desperate to be rid of it himself. And also hoped it didn\u0027t throw the trajectory calculations off too much. Opening it to a random page, she began to read feverishly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time later, the engines ignited into a maelstrom of flames and drew Valentina back from her fixated stupor. There was no countdown for her, no oddly calming drone of voices marking off procedures, all at once the world--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E--the world became sound--\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--and she felt the enormous construct of fuel and metal lurch sideways, as was the custom of the unusual asymmetric launch vehicle, before it slowly lumbered skyward. She gave the book one last glance and tossed it aside lest it get any heavier. Within those pages was \u003Cem\u003Esurely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0an expanse of madness - really, why make such a kerfuffle over retroactively permitting a freestanding noncomplying secondary dwelling when the preexisting fiduciary already had a circumstantial exception? It\u0027s not like the extemporaneous equity was a factor in a financial disclosure. \u0027Kerfuffle\u0027 was certainly an odd word to appear in such an official publication, too. But it had drawn her away from those dark places that could trap a mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket thundered onward. No checklists, no communication, no \u003Cem\u003Etraining\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0- this time, Valentina well and truly \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0cargo. She watched the numbers scrolling on the displays with a strange sort of detached horror. All she could do now, was watch. She watched, as the indicators marked the boosters falling away. She watched, as the stack slowly leaned over in its gravity turn and the ground became visible in the hatch window. She watched, as the gauge numbers rose higher and higher, the gentle push of the main engines urging the beast on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, she watched other numbers taper away, the rumble of thrust ending as abruptly as it began. There was a distant \u003Cem\u003Ethunk\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as core stage separated, its Separatrons casting a silent glow in the front window. MechIVAN wasted no time in plotting the transfer burn, the craft was drifting in a slightly suborbital path that would eventually dip into the atmosphere on the other side of the globe if the engines failed to light.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome hidden part of Valentina almost hoped they would. The other Kerbonauts often bantered about going to the M\u00FCn, wished the Union had an official program to match if not exceed the KSA\u0027s achievements. Valentina never wanted any part of it. The M\u00FCn was quite possibly the \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0place she ever wanted to go. She wondered if it would be the last place she ever went.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, the engines fired right on time, once more pushing her gently into her couch. In the hatch window, she could see the ship was approaching the customary overflight of the Kerbal Space Center, an ironic twist of orbital mechanics. Not long after, she would become the most isolated person alive.

Nineteen hours. Nineteen hours until she reached the M\u00FCn, without even pre-launch anxiety to season the boredom. Valentina pushed away from the window and settled as best she could against her couch. She wondered when they would make the announcement about her tragic, heroic death. The Ministry of Truth knew its trade well, they wouldn\u0027t disclose it right away. They would let the rumors spread underground, like fungal fibers, gorging on nosy foreign media. Finally, when the caps broke the surface and began to spread their spores, the Ministry would have a ripe harvest.

She would be a lost soul, unable to move on or return to life, left to wander in limbo. People went away all the time in the Union.

Or until true death took them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pushed the dark thoughts away. That was an ordeal for another time. Already, it would seem, her mind was beginning to crawl up the walls. With a sigh, and lack of anything else to do, she pulled on the chains around her neck. Two twinkling objects floated out from the neck of her scrub shirt. She was still amazed they\u0027d let her keep them. The NKOTB had taken everything else from her, but strangely, they had avoided these. Almost as if they couldn\u0027t see them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe piece of Anastasia\u0027s m\u00FCnrock. Valentina hoped she was still all right, then pushed the thought away. Nothing to be done for that, now. What she had left was a small oval of rock, not more more than a sliver. She found it incredible that the rock had split as it did, not at the natural weak point where the hole for the chain went through. She ran a thumb over the tiny, rough crystals on one side, marveling at how they sparkled in the pallid cabin lights. They seemed to throw little, dim points of light themselves all around the cabin, but that was probably just a trick of the illumination. And this edge...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rim of the ovoid sliver was wafer-thin and looked incredibly fragile, yet wasn\u0027t even chipped.

The sensation was... well, it was quite indescribable. The sliver should cut like a serrated knife, but it only... tickled? No, that wasn\u0027t quite right. More like... an in \u003Cem\u003Einversion\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of pain. And her thumb...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should have been torn open, but there were only two distinct lines along it.

She didn\u0027t have much luck with it. The bizarre sensation left her squirming and twitching and giggling like a little girl, which was \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0undignified. She couldn\u0027t hold still enough, and just wound up with an odd-looking scribble on her face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina settled back to her couch, floating just above it.

That, itself, was odd. It was usually as hot and dry as a desert in a Zarya capsule. She couldn\u0027t remember specifics from what she\u0027d read, but surely they\u0027d upgraded the cooling systems for such a long voyage in direct sunlight. This nip seemed a bit overkill, though. Or perhaps, it was her destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe drove the thought away, and clung to the pendant instead.
