It was an easy enough ruse. She didn\u0027t look like herself anymore, and she certainly didn\u0027t *feel* like herself. She was still unconvinced that she wasn\u0027t strapped down in a padded room somewhere drooling on herself, and all this was just an elaborate dissociative fugue. So for lack of anything else to do, might as well go along with it. \n\nIt would be nice if her damaged brain could hallucinate sleep soon, though. She still hadn\u0027t slept, but spent the entire night in a broom closet learning how to land on the M\u00FCn. Just giving the silly idea thought was clearly madness. Yet here she was, inching up the expansive flank of an Urugan-class booster. Sleep deprivation was medically proven to cause madness. The fact that none of the technicians busying themselves around her paid her the slightest mind, as if she were invisible, also played to that. \n\nIt was all very... convenient. \n\nOf course, these technicians were probably under rather explicit orders *not* to see her, and Ussaris could be *very* good at not seeing things when told to do so. That didn\u0027t make it any less unnerving, they way they twittered on with each other as if she weren\u0027t even there. \n\nThe elevator jerked to a stop. With a sigh, and not the slightest hint of challenge from those around, she stepped up to the waiting hatch. It was another *Zarya* capsule, an old Blok F static test unit that had been refurbished and stripped down, leaving it little more than a flying fuel tank. Valentina caught a glimpse of herself in the reflective glass of the hatch window. Huge, dark bags under her eyes, her short hair hidden away beneath a white technician\u0027s scrub hat, and a couple of new cuts already fading into scars. No, she certainly didn\u0027t *look* like herself, either. It was an easy ruse. \n\nWith practiced grace, she swung through the hatch and settled into the pilot\u0027s couch, next to a huge drum of water ballast in the other one. At least her back had stopped hurting. Surprising, but she would take any break she could, at this point. Come to think of it, *all* of her wounds seemed to be healing very quickly. They were just superficial, anyway. It certainly wasn\u0027t due to radiation exposure from that nuclear explosion. At least she hadn\u0027t started glowing in the dark yet. Much. \n\n*Thunk!*\n\nValentina jumped as the hatch slammed shut. It brought an odd sense of finality. And, really, it *was* final. Sitting atop thousands of liters of flammables, it was a virtual pyre. And soon, she would be dead. As far as anyone else knew. Dibella... Valentina tried not to think that direction. Suddenly, she felt very, very alone. The thought had occurred to her, frequently, that this whole thing was just a cover to *actually* get rid of her. \n\nShe sighed. Nothing to do now, but wait. Not even a checklist to go through. She wasn\u0027t actually here, after all. On the panel in front of her, MechIVAN, Revision 8425, was running through prelaunch routines below its big, green... light. Gone was the flickering CRT display with its ring of push buttons, this new update had a very convenient touch screen. According to what she\u0027d read, it was capable of operating entire missions autonomously and adapting to unexpected conditions through a neural-network \u0027learning\u0027 CPU. She still couldn\u0027t shake the feeling it was... looking at her. \n\nTwo hours to launch. This would be maddening. Not even a launch suit to fiddle with; the M\u00FCnar EVA suit was stowed down in the lander. Supposedly. After all, this pod was empty. If the cabin ruptured during launch, there were only two ballast barrels aboard. She wasn\u0027t even sure if the abort motors were real or not. \n\nThis waiting was always the worst, and nothing at *all* to distract her, this time. Valentina checked her straps one more time, and laid her head back. Maybe she could at least get a couple hours of rest. She closed her weary eyes, and waited for sleep to come. \n\nIt didn\u0027t. \n\nDespite her exhaustion, Valentina\u0027s overloaded mind simply refused to shut down. Competing questions and thoughts ran roughshod through it, like armies unsure if they were charging or routing. Maybe *this* was finally madness, or maybe the whole point of madness was *you* never actually knew if you were mad or not. \n\nThe Kommissar... if he had not been a distillation of her own madness *before*, then now... \n\nA Kermanni. Probably the last one in the world. It was so beyond unthinkable that just *thinking* about thinking about it should be unthinkable. In the glorious Ussari Union, there were many things we did not speak of. And then there were those things we really, *really* did not speak of. Which, of course, were spoken of all the time, with hushed voices in darkened corners, perhaps after analyzing a bit too much rocket fuel. Everyone knew *what* happened - declared enemies of the State during the Troubles, the Kermanni were systematically rounded up and made to disappear - but no one, not even the high-ranking circles Dibella moved in, knew *why*.\n\nDibella... best not let her mind wander that direction at all. Tercella was gone, and poor Vasily...\n\nValentina slammed a fist against the armrest. At least it was sturdy. She needed something, *anything*, to distract her. She reached around and began rooting through the storage bins behind her couch. Most of them simply had small lead blocks labeled **BALLAST** bolted inside. Panic was just starting to creep into her mind when she mercifully found something *not* lead in a drawer. Someone had simply scribbled *ballast* on an old book of some sort. Looking closer it read:\n\nIMPERIOUS MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND YURTS   \n\nCOMPLIANCE REGULATIONS, PERMITS, AND BUILDING CODES  \n\nREVISION 3.14159\n\nShe sent up a silent orison of thanks to whatever glassy-eyed, mind-numbed engineer had stuffed it in there, likely desperate to be rid of it himself. And also hoped it didn\u0027t throw the trajectory calculations off too much. Opening it to a random page, she began to read feverishly. \n\n---------------\n\nSome time later, the engines ignited into a maelstrom of flames and drew Valentina back from her fixated stupor. There was no countdown for her, no oddly calming drone of voices marking off procedures, all at once the world--\n\n*--the world became sound--*\n\n--and she felt the enormous construct of fuel and metal lurch sideways, as was the custom of the unusual asymmetric launch vehicle, before it slowly lumbered skyward. She gave the book one last glance and tossed it aside lest it get any heavier. Within those pages was *surely* an expanse of madness - really, why make such a kerfuffle over retroactively permitting a freestanding noncomplying secondary dwelling when the preexisting fiduciary already had a circumstantial exception? It\u0027s not like the extemporaneous equity was a factor in a financial disclosure. \u0027Kerfuffle\u0027 was certainly an odd word to appear in such an official publication, too. But it had drawn her away from those dark places that could trap a mind. \n\nThe rocket thundered onward. No checklists, no communication, no *training* - this time, Valentina well and truly *was* cargo. She watched the numbers scrolling on the displays with a strange sort of detached horror. All she could do now, was watch. She watched, as the indicators marked the boosters falling away. She watched, as the stack slowly leaned over in its gravity turn and the ground became visible in the hatch window. She watched, as the gauge numbers rose higher and higher, the gentle push of the main engines urging the beast on. \n\nFinally, she watched other numbers taper away, the rumble of thrust ending as abruptly as it began. There was a distant *thunk* as core stage separated, its Separatrons casting a silent glow in the front window. MechIVAN wasted no time in plotting the transfer burn, the craft was drifting in a slightly suborbital path that would eventually dip into the atmosphere on the other side of the globe if the engines failed to light. \n\nSome hidden part of Valentina almost hoped they would. The other Kerbonauts often bantered about going to the M\u00FCn, wished the Union had an official program to match if not exceed the KSA\u0027s achievements. Valentina never wanted any part of it. The M\u00FCn was quite possibly the *last* place she ever wanted to go. She wondered if it would be the last place she ever went. \n\nNevertheless, the engines fired right on time, once more pushing her gently into her couch. In the hatch window, she could see the ship was approaching the customary overflight of the Kerbal Space Center, an ironic twist of orbital mechanics. Not long after, she would become the most isolated person alive. She wondered if anyone else had ever felt so--\n\n*Alone*.\n\nA gasp escaped her lips. It was just a flash, like a shooting star across the sky, but it was *there*. Though distant and weak, that troubling sensation like she was feeling someone *else\u0027s* emotion.\n\nJust nerves, plenty of nerves today. Perhaps a bit of indigestion...\n\n*How long are you going to deny it?* a voice whispered in the void. \n\nCan\u0027t be real. It\u0027s not logical. Sounds like some fairy--\n\n*You believe in monsters. If you believe in monsters, you must also believe in **Heroes**... or else you truly have gone mad.*\n\nValentina... didn\u0027t really have a response to that. \n\nFurther consideration was quickly cut off, however, as the engines did the same. She watched the instruments, watched the numbers count down. She felt a thump as the transfer stage decoupled.\n\nMechIVAN\u0027s screen flickered for a moment, then a new display appeared:\n\nEXECUTING ORDER 66.\n\n192 SECONDS...\n\n*Now*, she had tasks to do. She reached around the cabin, pulling circuit breakers for various systems the disturbing little green-eyed box couldn\u0027t control. Radios, recorders, telemetry transponders. All in a carefully derived sequence, timed as the numbers counted down. As the digits ran out and she pulled the last knob, Valentina wondered what an explosion in space would be like. \n\nRather anticlimactic, really. There might have been a flash, or there might not. Then the disquieting sounds of debris clinking off the hull. Sparkles and glints as bits of it tumbled past the windows. A scan of the panels confirmed nothing important seemed to be leaking. Then her eyes fell on the altimeter. \n\nFive hundred and seventy-nine kilometers, and rising incredibly fast. Above the orbit of TINKAN 13. Now, Valentina truly was the most isolated person alive. In the hatch port, its fat crescent grinning like a skull, the stark face of the M\u00FCn beckoned.   \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-09T07:34:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2016 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T08:34:21Z","Content":"So we\u0027ve been out of the frying pan (but onto the pyre) and now explosions in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are.

Nineteen hours. Nineteen hours until she reached the M\u00FCn, without even pre-launch anxiety to season the boredom. Valentina pushed away from the window and settled as best she could against her couch. She wondered when they would make the announcement about her tragic, heroic death. The Ministry of Truth knew its trade well, they wouldn\u0027t disclose it right away. They would let the rumors spread underground, like fungal fibers, gorging on nosy foreign media. Finally, when the caps broke the surface and began to spread their spores, the Ministry would have a ripe harvest. She wondered if someone was already planning her funeral, locked safely away in some dim room in the Fortress.\n\nFuneral. With that, came the dawning realization that even if she came back, she could never *go* back. She would be a lost soul, unable to move on or return to life, left to wander in limbo. People went away all the time in the Union. How many such specters had she passed in her days, unaware, cursed as they were to wander the land for all eternity. Or until true death took them.\n\nShe pushed the dark thoughts away. That was an ordeal for another time. Already, it would seem, her mind was beginning to crawl up the walls. With a sigh, and lack of anything else to do, she pulled on the chains around her neck. Two twinkling objects floated out from the neck of her scrub shirt. She was still amazed they\u0027d let her keep them. The NKOTB had taken everything else from her, but strangely, they had avoided these. Almost as if they couldn\u0027t see them.\n\nThe piece of Anastasia\u0027s m\u00FCnrock. Valentina hoped she was still all right, then pushed the thought away. Nothing to be done for that, now. What she had left was a small oval of rock, not more more than a sliver. She found it incredible that the rock had split as it did, not at the natural weak point where the hole for the chain went through. She ran a thumb over the tiny, rough crystals on one side, marveling at how they sparkled in the pallid cabin lights. They seemed to throw little, dim points of light themselves all around the cabin, but that was probably just a trick of the illumination. And this edge...\n\nThe rim of the ovoid sliver was wafer-thin and looked incredibly fragile, yet wasn\u0027t even chipped. Even pressing her thumb against it didn\u0027t crack it. Best be careful about that, though, probably sharp as a\u2014\n\nValentina paused. Very gingerly, she ran the pad of her thumb along that razor-thin edge studded with jagged crystals. Then she pressed down *hard*, and drew it\u2014\n\nThe most peculiar, undignified sound escaped her lips.\n\nShe peered at the rock, looked back at her finger, then did it again.\n\nThe same noise filled the tiny cabin. The sensation was... well, it was quite indescribable. The sliver should cut like a serrated knife, but it only... tickled? No, that wasn\u0027t quite right. More like... an in *inversion* of pain. And her thumb...\n\nIt should have been torn open, but there were only two distinct lines along it. Staring at them, the skin there looked... *younger*. Across the leathery callus two shallow canyons of soft, pale, new skin had been wrought. Where old scars crossed them, the former simply disappeared. Valentina stared in amazement. \n\n*What on Kerbin...?*\n\nStraining around to see her own dim reflection in the hatch window, she tried dragging the flake of rock over a healing cut there. She didn\u0027t have much luck with it. The bizarre sensation left her squirming and twitching and giggling like a little girl, which was *completely* undignified. She couldn\u0027t hold still enough, and just wound up with an odd-looking scribble on her face. \n\nValentina settled back to her couch, floating just above it. She stared at the incredible, beautiful piece of rock.\n\n*If you believe in monsters, you must also believe in Heroes...*\n\nWith that thought, she took Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone from where it was floating on its chain.\n\n\u0022Heroes, yes,\u0022 she said softly as she regarded it, \u0022the world could use a few more heroes.\u0022 The polished metal felt warm to the touch in the chilly cabin. That, itself, was odd. It was usually as hot and dry as a desert in a Zarya capsule. She couldn\u0027t remember specifics from what she\u0027d read, but surely they\u0027d upgraded the cooling systems for such a long voyage in direct sunlight. This nip seemed a bit overkill, though. Or perhaps, it was her destination.\n\nShe drove the thought away, and clung to the pendant instead. Warm as if heated from within, and the stone...\n\nShe rubbed a thumb over it, paused, then rubbed her thumb and finger together. Then she did it again. The stone always felt slick, almost wet, but now... it really *did* feel wet, yet Valentina\u0027s fingers remained dry.\n\n\u0022What..?\u0022 she peered down into the crimson stone, watching the light refract and dance inside. The stone seemed to go on forever, filled with fragile shafts of light... She felt it again, that sense of falling into it... rising... surrounded by shafts of light, ominous shadows... drifting away... drifting back...\n\nWith a gasp, she jerked upright. Or would have, save for the lack of gravity. Instead, she just banged her knees on the instrument panel. She could feel... or...\n\n*The world could use a few more heroes...*\n\n*I am no hero. But... I am **here**...*\n\nValentina pursed her lips for a moment, then looked back into the stone. With effort, she pushed away everything else... and let herself feel like falling... rising... drifting away...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe knew this place. It was beyond imagination, her mind struggled to comprehend it at all, yet... she knew it. As well as her own hand. From somewhere, she looked up. Ethereal, luminous Beings floated about, slender and delicate. Beyond, grand crystal spires towered up into a black sky, and dominating that sky...\n\nA planet. A planet of incredible size. Distinct yet chaotic bands of pale tans, dark browns, and brilliant whites stippled its flanks, their fringes churning in eternal maelstroms. Beyond the edge where the distant sun reached, lightning arced and webbed amongst the clouds, and between the myriad of glowing points hung there. \n\nTo either side of her, the brilliant spires curved away, wrapping the entire planet in a gossamer ring of shimmering light. This place *was* light. This place was peace. This place was home. \n\nThis place was... doomed. \n\nAs the thought passed her mind, the ground shook and the spires trembled. The Beings, once so graceful, now darted about in unfamiliar panic. \n\nIT COMES.\n\nIT COMES. \n\nIT COMES!\n\nShadowy lines crept between the bands of the looming planet above. Pulling, ripping, tearing; drawing matter inward. Chasms of darkness split the face open along the lines. It collapsed in on its self, black like rot, then ripped itself in *half*. Dark tendrils reached out for the crystal spires...\n\nFLEE! \n\nWE MUST FLEE!\n\nTAKE THEM TO SAFETY, PREPARE THE GATEWAY. THIS PLACE IS LOST. \n\nShe felt herself drifting away again, darkness and light swallowing her. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFalling, rising... the passage of time seemed to settle into her bones. A day? An eon? She couldn\u0027t tell. Once more she felt herself rising, becoming...\n\nThe world coalesced again. Valentina was standing on real ground, amidst bizarre blue trees that mingled with the towering spires. They seemed less brilliant, now. Worn. Strange flying creatures sailed across the the yellow-tinged sky, and *this* sky...\n\nThree suns hung above: one bright, and one dimmer, and one so small it was a barely discernible red point some distance from the others. The Beings were here, too; they seemed worn like the spires but no less luminous. A group of them argued, Valentina could... not hear, exactly, yet voices came to her. Ideas... concepts...\n\nTHE DARKNESS SPREADS. WE ARE ALL BUT POWERLESS TO STOP IT. \n\nLET US GO, THEN, THERE ARE OTHER WORLDS THAN THESE. \n\nIT WILL FOLLOW. IF THIS UNIVERSE FALLS, ALL OTHERS WILL. THERE IS NO SANCTUARY. \n\nTHE SERVANTS GATHER TO STRIKE BACK. WE MUST GIVE THEM TIME. \n\nA whispy, delicate finger pointed toward Valentina. \n\nTHEN LET US USE THEM. \n\nTHEY ARE NOT READY, YET! THEY WILL BE DESTROYED. \n\nTHEY ARE WEAPONS. \n\nTHEY ARE LIVING BEINGS!\n\nAs before the ground shuddered, and billions of voices suddenly cried out. Light dimmed, as one of the stars overhead was consumed by shadow. \n\nWE ARE TOO LATE, IT IS HERE!\n\nIT IS HERE!\n\nWE MUST FLEE!\n\nA third time, darkness rose, and swallowed her up. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe was... somewhere. There were no more spires here, no more sense of multitude. Only a vague feeling of... containment. Above... below? an incredible sight filled her vision. An entire galaxy was spread out before her, its twisted spiral arms appearing to sparkle with billions of points of light. The Beings here seemed to wait in hushed anticipation. \n\nBEHOLD... THEY CHARGE.\n\nBefore Valentina\u0027s... eyes? A great flash spread across a twinkling arm like lightning in a cloud. Then another. And another elsewhere. Flashes of *darkness* answered, pushed back against them. \n\nThe light and the darkness clashed back and forth in a visual spectacle that shouldn\u0027t have been visible at all, hanging here light years away. Occasionally titanic bursts of power would scatter whole star clusters and send them careening across the fold. The tide ebbed and flowed, first one side gaining, and then the other, jumping across the galaxy and slowly spiraling in toward the center. Finally, with a whimper rather than a bang, the last blasts ceased. What had been an object of incredible celestial beauty, speckled with blazing points of light, was now left little more than a glowing whitish smudge across the firmament. \n\nIT IS FINISHED. THE PRICE... WAS STEEP.\n\nAgain darkness rose, and covered her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLight... light drew her forth. That same feeling of containment, as Valentina witnessed another unimaginable sight. Radiating the heat of a young star, a glowing protoplanetary disk bathed her in warm light. A dozen ruddy lumps swirled among the crimson clouds of gas and dust. Now, only a few Beings remained. \n\nWE ARE ENDED. OUR TIME GROWS SHORT. LIKE ALL THINGS, WE SHALL DIMINISH AND FADE. \n\nTHE INFERNAL CROWN HAS BEEN SET. NOW LET US CHARGE A DRAGON TO GUARD IT. \n\nNO, DO NOT DEFILE THAT NAME! IT WILL BE \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E ABOMINATION FROM THE DARKEST ABYSS. \n\nNOT A DRAGON. A KRAKEN.\n\nTHE KRAKEN, THEN.\n\nTHE KRAKEN. \n\n**THE KRAKEN.** \n\nMAY THE LIGHT SEND, IT NEVER SEES BEYOND ITS CAGE.\n\n*What?*\n\nSomething... Valentina wanted to say something, *do* something, but once more was drawn inexorably away. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDrifting.... floating....\n\nGrass. Soft green grass beneath her feet, tickling between her toes. Warm sun on her face. Birds chirping in the sky and flitting between mundane trees. \n\nThere is only one Being left. Somehow, Valentina knows this.  As it kneels down before her, for the first time she sees its face. The proportions are strange. It is bizarre, alien... yet in some way, like all else she has seen, familiar. And beautiful. It reaches out, and brushes her cheek with a mother\u0027s touch. It smiles, and for the first time, speaks:\n\n\u0022Our world is ended. Now yours begins. Use it well.\u0022\n\nShe wants to respond, wants to ask why, wants to ask how, but is only pulled away again. Again she floats, submerged in red light... now green... \n\n...rising amid shafts of light and terrible shadows... \n\n...rising, her lungs bursting for air...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nValentina gasped as her head broke the surface. She looked around, bewildered, afraid. She was... she was...\n\nShe was back in the capsule. With a hand, she wiped the water from her face... only her face was dry. So was her hand. Dry, the kind of uncomfortable dry skin that comes after several days in\u2014\n\nHer eyes flicked to the mission clock in panic. Three days. She scanned over the instruments, trying to force the fog from her mind. \n\n*The braking burn... days too late...*\n\nShe looked up to the window, expecting to see nothing but the endless void of space. Instead, the stark, grey surface of the M\u00FCn leered back at her. A few dozen meters away, the spent M\u00FCnar Orbit Insertion stage tumbled slowly. \n\nShe gave the MechIVAN box a considering gaze, \u0022not bad,\u0022 then let out a long breath. \n\n*Three days... did I really... sleep? for three days?*\n\nAnother realization hit, *did... did I just see...*\n\nAgain she caught her reflection in the window, cast over the stars beyond. No, not stars... only for a moment, the tiny, iridescent flecks in her eyes she saw and dismissed every day... she could swear they were *glowing*.\n\nValentina rubbed at her face with a dry palm, feeling a headache blooming behind her eyes, glowing flecks or not. Feeling that... and more.  \n\nThe M\u00FCn. She did *not* look back to the window. She could *feel* it. Down there, there was *something*.\n\nSomething *wrong*.\n\nSomething *monstrous*.\n\n*...if you believe in monsters, you must also believe in Heroes...* \n\n*...the world could use a few more heroes...*\n\n\u0022I am no hero. But... I am *here*.\u0022\n\nValentina set her jaw, and opened the hatch to the lander. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-14T05:43:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2016 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T12:52:56Z","Content":"dun dun Dunnn!  \n\nOK, that was a cool chapter.\n\nAnd on a COMPLETELY unrelated note....  \n\nI wonder what the next .... of the kraken will be?
