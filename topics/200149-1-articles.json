But the Minimum frame-times were exceptionally poor, and rarely could the console hit a stable 60 FPS even at 1080p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s one of the major reasons they decided to chase resolution instead, when you have such a unbalanced system like that where the CPU just isn\u0027t capable of feeding the GPU rapidly but the GPU has plenty of horsepower on tap. Then cranking the resolution makes sense, shifting the bottleneck more to the GPU than CPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut i do recall Jaguar having poor Cashe performance, and AMD\u0027s architecture overall at that time suffering from poor cashe hit to miss ratios and absolutely disgraceful branch prediction performance (This might be one of the areas that was a Regression from the old Thubans, but I\u0027m not 100% on that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they go for 1080P or 1440P, then i think the PS5 and Xbox Series X will be able to hold decent frame rates and high graphics settings. 4K with checkerboard rendering might even be an option on lesser titles, but if they try to do 120FPS with high resolution....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell they will hit hard limits at that point, and this is all assuming purely rasterized scenes. It\u0027s pretty clear ATM that they don\u0027t have the horsepower for Ray-Tracing on anywhere near the scale marketing has sold people on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a shame really, because the PS5 and Xbox Series X are a legitimate leap over the previous consoles. But i think a large portion of people are going to be very disappointed with them regardless when they realize they aren\u0027t magic boxes that can do 4K Raytracing at Ultra settings with the framerate locked at 60FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-09T16:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the conversation shifted to specs, ok!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do want to just chime in and say that a lot of people play console because they do not understand PC\u0027s (somewhat me).

Intercept is basically using DX11 features, so no worries about Ray Tracing sapping away performance or the like. The CPU in the Series X is plenty strong, so it should handle the Physics Calculations much better than the previous generation consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, unless they absolutely botch the port. It will run fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you\u0027re giving up mod support, and after 2 years the technology in even a mid-range PC will begin to approach the stuff inside the Series X and PS5. And unlike that PC, you won\u0027t be able to upgrade your console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s your choice, and the PS5 and Xbox Series X are fine machines in the end. I\u0027d personally take a less performant PC than either of those consoles currently, because it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll find them at or even near MSRP right now. Mods for KSP are huge, and KSP2 looks to be making every move towards allowing modders to go even crazier with their endeavors than KSP ever did.

So if you don\u0027t want to hassle, and had a back catalog of Xbox One games you wanted to play then it\u0027s not a bad deal at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think both of you are pretty right!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know they said they are developing console versions, but they will come \u0022later\u0022.
