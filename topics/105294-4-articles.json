Is this a heating bug? Sounds it\u0027s not a COG bug only, but a flip \u002B heating bug? As pod on it\u0027s own does not explode? So why would it explode with the heatshield, if not? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heatshield (at least the 1.25m one attached to a Mk1 command pod) causes some weird kinda drag where your capsule turns partially into the airflow accumulating heat real real fast.

Because I think the case \u0022add 1 heat shield and nothing else to a mk1 capsule and it cannot safely re-enter\u0022 is pretty clearly wrong, and defeats the point of the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI checked, and unlike DRE, the mk1 has no ablation value without a shield.

As Harv said the drag is modelled the same as the mass (and as posters above mention, this is added to the base part and seems working), the drag should be added to the base part (which is directionless if talking about a single part AFAIK). Unless parts now have a direction of drag/resistance and a direction for low drag. In which case, is the heat shield accidentally \u0022flipping\u0022 the games understanding of the direction of drag?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a little sequence to show my pod wont tumble, nor is going to burn up on re-entry.
