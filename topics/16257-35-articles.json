What he\u0027s working on is shaping up to be a whole new level of awesome for RemoteTech and my current plan is in fact for future versions to use his source. We see pretty well eye to eye when it comes to the core gameplay mechanics of relay network implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s pretty safe to say that something awesomely huge will be coming in the future of relay network plugins. This won\u0027t be an incremental step from RT 0.5.0.1 to 0.5.0.2, but more like the leap from The_Duck\u0027s relay network plugin to the first version of RemoteTech (minus rookie mistakes and bugs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely it wont be compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Cilph said, he\u0027s rewriting the entire plugin from the ground up and RT data will be handled differently and a lot more orderly. The way dish/SPU data is stored within KSP remains pretty much the same as the current plugin, but fields and classes will probably be named differently to comply with a more standardized naming convention. The old names where added over many months by someone without any formal training in programming (your\u0027s truly), and thus don\u0027t follow any convention beside what suited me at the time of writing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I will of course have backward compatibility in mind, and I will see what I can do. But it\u0027s not a priority. I will of course let you all know about any compatibility issues before any new version of RemoteTech is released. If it turns out you\u0027ll have to sacrifice your old worlds, I\u0027d advise you do so. It will be worth it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-JDP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t care less about naming conventions. Your code was just genuinely hard to read. As for backwards compatibility, most can be converted with a python script. I\u0027ll see if I can supply that. Worst case you have to just reload each sat in cheatmode to turn it back on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duckydoger","CreatedById":70146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T23:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan any one help me.
