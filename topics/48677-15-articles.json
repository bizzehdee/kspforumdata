It\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do once I\u0027ve unlocked everything once. Restart career mode but making every mission as cost-effective as possible. Granted it\u0027s only going to be numbers on a piece of paper, but it serves the purpose of making the missions that much more challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: What are you guys doing to rake in the points so quickly? There\u0027s going to be a lot of revisiting various places as more equipment is unlocked for me, I think. It\u0027s getting to the point where grinding will be inevitable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
