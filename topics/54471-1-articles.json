You can use maximum time warp at this height and it\u0027s not that hard to reach from surface (or rather that much harder than LKO). Also it gives you plenty of space for synchronizing before rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen adding parts, do not send the new part blindly on the same orbit. Put it on lower orbit first and then match orbits during rendezvous, i.e. match orbits and position at the same time. When on the same orbit, your ships keep their distance because their orbital period is the same. Only when on different orbits, one runs faster than another and can catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T09:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember, the higher your orbit, the less fuel your ship needs when leaving the station. Personally, I like 1/2 to 3/4 of way between Mun and Kerbin for mine. This is far enough out that any orbit escape or capture is pretty low fuel consuming but you don\u0027t end up in slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have made low orbit ones just for fun. Either way, the best concept for capturing the station is I like to get to about half the altitude of the station abouts. When at lower altitude, you will travel faster. Just find what position in your burn will capture. If you are 1/2 or less your station\u0027s orbit, you should have an intercept somewhere on your current orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are on the orbit and find yourself behind/ahead, the easy way to cut inside is find out how much burn towards orbit body you need to meet up with your station. When you do this, you will make your orbit more eliptical. If you make it so you start going inside the orbit of your station, you will catch up on first part, then meet up where you cross orbital paths again. Burn away, and it will catch up to you. Once you meet up, just do opposite of previous to circularize your orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis latter tactic is also a good way to planet rendevous if you are one of those peeps like me who don\u0027t like messing around with optimal launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-27T09:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2013 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Markus Reese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T09:41:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrUberGr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrUberGr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so I\u0027ve started constructing my first orbital station, and I need some help to fit the first part there, as well as some general questions. \u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, on what altitude should I position my space station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually put my stations at geosynch orbit, 500, 200, or 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T11:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyway to change the Skipper with a Poodle, through editing files etc?
