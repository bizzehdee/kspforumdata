Mass on the pad was about 2200t and 950 parts. I was getting 1 to 2 FPS on launch; MJ was needed to fly it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I was testing the thrust plate design because of the limits of the strength of radial attachments. I\u0027ve launched up to about 150t with pure asparagus designs but as I got bigger it became increasingly difficult to make a stable launcher. The thrust plate design does seem to be a stronger method of launching heavy payloads, although it still needs a lot of strutting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The staging was onion, mainly to save on build time. If I had made the booster pure 2x2 asparagus it would probably be a little more efficient, but I didn\u0027t want to spend the time setting up the staging. 8 orange tanks and their engines drop off with each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The 12 LV-Ns are less than 10% of the payload mass. They\u0027re there to achieve reasonable interplanetary burn times with very large payloads docked to the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The game doesn\u0027t currently model aerodynamics very well, or allow for orbital construction (other than docking). When those are implemented, I\u0027m sure everyone\u0027s designs will change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
