I have managed to isolate the problem to TR, but that\u0027s where it ends for me, I have no idea how ro remedy it so am looking for help from you folks. Also, I use KSP in -force-opengl -popupwindow, whereas before switching to fullscreen windowed using alt\u002Benter would fix the problem of no AA when running in opengl, this no longer happens, and i have horrible jagged edges everywhere.

However after ONLY installing the newest texture replacer (not using anything from ksprc tr), it works, i still have the horrible jaggies though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter using the Nvidia control panel to force on the AA, i have solved that problem. Also i manually dropped the individual files from proots texture replacer, choosing which ones i wanted and didn\u0027t, and the issue has gone.
