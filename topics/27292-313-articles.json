The game had different plans though... When I quickloaded to try the original plan, I had no chutes and I was darn lucky I was pretty close to the ground already. I blew the decoupler and landed right on top of the asteroid and bounced.

He was standing on a ladder that\u0027s connected to the trailer to attach KAS pipes, and the winches plug mode got flipped from docked (clipping into the trailer) to undocked, which pretty much made everything go boom. The trailer bucked, the asteroid and Lembin both got tossed into the air; he obviously went farther and made a disturbing little poof sound when he hit the ground. Apparently that\u0027s something you don\u0027t do. That particular design wanted to bind with the truck, and it was narrow enough that it would start to roll if you turn too hard. Research was continued and after a couple more mishaps but no more loss of life, I was able to make one that worked surprisingly well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-05-2904-43-59-18.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-05-2904-43-59-18.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-30T02:16:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2014 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dire_Squid","CreatedById":111106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T02:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got no pics, but, besides making a new Kethane/SCANsat satellite for Kerbin (a complete map), I jokingly made an asparagus-style rocket, to see how far it could fly out... and... after tweaking its orbit here and there, I had THREE almost close orbits with Eve!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten into the planet\u0027s orbit, but never close enough to use the SCANsat or Kethane gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T04:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed on \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(and returned from)\u003C/span\u003E the \u003Cem\u003EMOON\u003C/em\u003E!
