I can actually parse the source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty simple stuff actually, most of the complicated code deals with the buoyancy asymmetry for pitch control. The actual \u0022make slow to save\u0022 code is 90% in the gui area, determining if the vessel meets the speed, buoyancy requirements, and landed/splashed requirements. That could easily be copy/pasted into a new module for the station keeping logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel slowing is done in persistentParts(), but that\u0027s just a simple vector damping. It would kinda work for station keeping, but attaching another would most likely add enough speed to cause it to exit out of the persistentParts code and leave it unlanded.

Technically in the mean time I could try to build a base just floating less then KAS cable length above the ground, sort of defeats the idea on Eve of staying at room temp altitude (22500-23500 m) and is grossly unrealistic on Jool where room temp altitude is 44-45 km and \u0022surface\u0022 temps are beyond anything realistically survivable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
