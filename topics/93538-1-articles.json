However, I would greatly appreciate it if we had cargo \u0022holds,\u0022 or doorless cargo bays that we can surface attach stuff to around their entire circumference. This would require tail/nose loading doors, but I also think those would be incredibly useful, especially for rover deployment and retrieval.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T15:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a tail loading ramp would be awesome.
