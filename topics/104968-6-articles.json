What sort of concentrations result in overheating?\n\nAs I understand it, some parts naturally generate a lot of heat. From what I have seen, Nukes and drills overheat quite quickly. Now the heat radiates through the craft and dissapates into the environment. Having lots of parts on/close proximity to the drill will let the heat propagate faster. Also, Roverude mentioned that solar panels act like passive heat radiators(logical enough, given the large surface area).

That rather depends on how you define cheating.\n\nFrom what we know, the resource mining fits the style of the game: pretty realistic, slightly ahead of our own technology, with some simplification to make the game more enjoyable (ie a game). Assuming the system is balanced, then I see no reason for this to be considered an exploit any more than any other feature.\n\nIs using a stock feature available for use by any player cheating? Of course not.\n\nIs exploiting glitches in the game cheating? I would say generally not, although sometimes it could be.\n\nIs using the debug menu cheats (essentially the same as cheat codes) cheating? I would say yes, although arguably it might not be. It all depends of the exact circumstances and what you\u0027re trying to do.\n\nBut of course you can make your own rules, for example not using resource mining, or the nuclear or ion engines if you consider them exploitative.
