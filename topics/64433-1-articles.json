I want to have the gimbal on engines above the initial center of mass disabled, then enabled as staging and fuel consumption moves the CoM upward above each set of engines. So I end up using a bunch of action groups to enable the gimbal on engines, action groups that get used exactly once. The number of action groups a craft can have is finite, so every one I use for the lifter is one that can\u0027t be used for the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to have items that would normally be in an action group put into the staging list so I don\u0027t need to use up my action groups? Alternately, is it possible to change action groups in flight so I can make new groups for the payload as I enable gimbals?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I could enable the gimbals manually (i.e. by clicking them individually) but this is difficult since I\u0027m trying to do it during the laggiest part of the flight and it also means that my stage\u0027s thrust becomes asymmetrical when one engine\u0027s gimbal is active but the other isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T17:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOff the top of my head I\u0027d suggest the mods \u0022Actions On The Fly\u0022 - lets you change action groups in flight - and/or KOS - scriptable autopilot which (probably) would let you type the instructions to toggle several engines at once or (less likely) might be able to track the COM and do it automatically (and no, you don\u0027t have to let it do any flying for you if you\u0027re against that sort of autopilot).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
