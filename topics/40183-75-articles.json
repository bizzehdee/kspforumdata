You do need plenty of parachutes. The requirement is 70 drag per ton. To get the \u0022true drag\u0022 of a parachute you have to multiply it\u0027s mass per it\u0027s fully open drag.

When the booster is 2.5km away and bellow 25km altitude, the game will unload it (it disappears) and MCE will calculate everything it needs. A window should pop-up telling you how much recycled value you got. If not, check the debug via Alt\u002BF12. MCE calculations are there.
