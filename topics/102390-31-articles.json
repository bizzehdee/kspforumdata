Everything seems to be working pretty well now too, I loaded up the admin building and had a new base scan contract which is nice. However there may be an issue with something still as almost immediately the supply run I had available (which I think had a few days left to accept) cancelled out and a medical emergency popped up. However then in the process of alt-tabing and starting to type this post (maybe 1m) I wanted to go check something in-game for this post and the medical went away to a crew rotation. The crew rotation seems to be stable now, so it could have just been a hiccup on the upgrade but I thought I should mention it just in case."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T08:27:08Z","Content":"[@Cynor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170028-cynor/) - that\u0027s two separate things at play at once.\n\nThe LSResupply mission you had available disappeared because that contract changed in the update. CC withdrew it as it was no longer valid (because the file had changed). This is intended behaviour.\n\nThe evac mission disappearing and then re-rolling is a CC issue, which happens occasionally.

Ignore any AVC warnings. If it works, stop here. However, Contract Configurator may complain you are not running the latest version (I can\u0027t remember the last time I updated the minVersion file, and if I version locked it to 1.2.2 or not).
