Advances in technology and pilot skills, especially the success of our Duna mission, have allowed us to gain the confidence to undertake this bold adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Statement: Perform drone reconnaissance and manned landings on all 5 of Jool\u0027s moons. Return crew and data from manned landings to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased upon the mission statement, Porcine Avionics decided to tackle Jool with 3 craft: a manned mothership, a drone mothership, and a heavy lander for Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/q5eoX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The landers\u0027 ascent stages will function as landers for Bop and Pol. The imaginatively named Tylo Lander will only be used for landing on Tylo. The Old Major tug will remain attached to Napoleon station until departure, and will be the fuel dump. Napoleon station will be the return craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe at Porcine Avionics are fairly confident in the success of this mission. More to come as this historic mission unfolds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate 1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have successfully aerobraked Napoleon, Snowball, and Squealer. Snowball was the lead ship, and got a lucky break: it was able to come out of the aerobrake on Jool straight into a Layethe intercept, which was parleyed into a Layethe aerobrake. Snowball is currently in orbit around Layethe. Napoleon and Squealer had successful Jool aerobrakes, and are waiting for their Layethe intercepts. Once all 3 are in orbit around Layethe, we\u0027ll dock everything back together and top off the landers\u0027 fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xeqcU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Unfortunately, the Hell Kraken devoured the ship as soon as we switched over to it, and the vessel was lost. While we at Porcine Avionics are saddened by the loss of this vessel, we are relieved that it was unmanned. So far no kerbals have been harmed in our attempt to explore the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo Lander is still coasting toward Jool intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned so far: It would have been easier to use just one heavy lander glommed onto the top of Napoleon station instead of trying to manage a small fleet of separate ships. The original plan was to have the landers pursue their missions independently, but I don\u0027t think is is feasible given the landers delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-26T20:58:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2013 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
