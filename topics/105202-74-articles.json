It\u0027s clear that the LS clocks are based on the ship, not the kerbal. Also, there is always strange stock funkiness with unfocused ships that either consume or create resources.\n\nIf you have the right saves to try it, it would be interesting to see what would happen if you moved your focus to the empty ship when you were, say, a day out. Let it \u0022catch up\u0022 to the main game clock. Then make your rendezvous and see if they only much down on a day\u0027s worth of supplies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T04:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T04:50:31Z","Content":"I know nothing about coding for KSP.

It says when the Kerbal last ate a meal, when the kerbal was last on kerbin, etc.\n\n    \t\t\tSTATUS_DATA\t\t{\t\t\tKerbalName = Mirsan Kerman\t\t\tLastMeal = 25564382.191148\t\t\tLastOnKerbin = 24179431.4976173\t\t\tMaxOffKerbinTime = 996179431.497617\t\t\tLastVesselId = 9f2c1eac-df49-463c-90ea-ec5dcf691a83\t\t\tTimeEnteredVessel = 24179431.4976173\t\t\tIsGrouchy = False\t\t\tOldTrait = Engineer\t\t\tLastUpdate = 25564382.191148\t\t}\n\nI think the problem happens when kerbals switch ships (including going EVA). The ship you dock with, board, or KIS-attach is always, by necessity, unfocused when you join it. I think the code must be doing some kind of \u0022catch up when receives focus\u0022 action. But ideally it should do that for the unfocused ship just BEFORE the joining action. However, it seems like the catchup calculations are done AFTER the join, and so they affect the new kerbals.\n\nAlso, it is clear that \u0022LastOnKerbin\u0022 is not set correctly. It is supposed to be independent from \u0022TimeEnteredVessel\u0022, but it\u0027s not. When I send a Kerbin on EVA and it comes back inside, it resets the \u0022LastOnKerbin\u0022 number, thus explaining why EVAs can give infinite hab time."},{"CreatedByName":"PocketBrotector","CreatedById":135814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T16:04:24Z","Content":"Expanded the wiki again with pages on habitation, FAQ, configuration, etc. If people are directed there it should now hopefully be able to answer most of their questions about how to use the mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Cawdeen","CreatedById":159145,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T16:43:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Kaa253 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Cawdeen](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159145-cawdeen/) \u0026 [@mikegarrison](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137807-mikegarrison/) reported recently some issues with crew transferring to different vessels, docking, etc. I left a lander (LEM) in orbit of minmus with no crew.

I\u0027ve found it all incredibly useful. I\u0027ve got a few more questions, for you or anyone else, that I haven\u0027t seen answered yet. I figure they might point out a few more things that would be helpful on the wiki. I tend to overthin problems, and I like to understand EVERYTHING that\u0027s going on... So maybe most people don\u0027t have the same questions... But for what it\u0027s worth:\n\n**1) Can you explain how multiple recyclers work, and how they play together with crew capacity?**\n\nI assume that anyone above the crew capacity consumes at the normal rate. So 6 Kerbals with a Science Lab eat at a rate of: 5\\*16.2\\*0.3\u002B1\\*16.2=40.5. Five get the discounted rate and the sixth doesn\u0027t. If I add a second Science Lab, the 6th guy (and up to 4 more) would also get the discount. So the idea is that you start with the most efficient recycler and hand out discounts until the crew capacity runs out. Then you move to the next recycler and so on until you run out of crew capacity on recyclers or until all Kerbals are getting the best discount possible. The wording of \u0022their effects are cumulative\u0022 makes me doubt this understanding a bit though... To me that would imply that two recyclers can somehow combine to give an even better discount. Just wanted some clarification.\n\n**2) How does Habitation work with EVAs?**\n\nI know they get a timer as soon as they go out the door. What happens when that timer runs out? From the settings it looks like they turn into a Tourist by default... Does he teleport to a nearby vessel? Otherwise I don\u0027t see how you\u0027d save an EVA Kerbal that you can\u0027t control. And is their Habitation clock ticking while they\u0027re out or is it put on pause?\n\n**3) Can you talk a bit more about how Habitation works? Particularly, what\u0027s the deal with the habitation clock attached to a particular vessel?**\n\nSay I\u0027ve got a ship with enough habitation or 10 months, and Bob is on board. He will last for 10 months before turning into a Tourist. But what happens if Jeb stops by after 5/10 months have passed? I imagine this cuts Bob\u0027s time remaining down to 2.5 months, because he had the whole thing to himself for 5 but now he has to share the last five with Jeb. But how does Jeb\u0027s timer work? He only gets 2.5 months because Bob has \u0022used the space up\u0022? I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case, because I haven\u0027t noticed any ships becoming \u0022worn out\u0022 like this. But I can\u0027t think how else you would determine how long Jeb can last. It all makes sense to me when we talk about confining a set number of Kerbals to a certain ship. But I\u0027m really confused how the math works out when you start adding fresh Kerbals or new parts to the ship.\n\n**4) Lastly, a more specific question that I\u0027ve had...** \n\nI\u0027ve got a station with a Science Lab and the Nom-O-Matic 5000. Both are active and I never run out of Electric Charge. I\u0027ve got \u002B1000 units of Mulch and Fertilizer. And I\u0027ve got 3 Kerbals on board. So with the Science Lab their consumption comes down to 3\\*16.2\\*0.3=14.6 supplies/day. And that\u0027s what the USI-LS window is telling me. The Nom-O-Matic *should* be producing 27.54 supplies/day. Again, it\u0027s turned on and I\u0027ve got plenty of Mulch, Fertilizer, and Electric Charge. If I EVA all three Kerbals I can see that it\u0027s producing Supplies. However, my Supplies are CONSTANTLY drained down to zero, and the USI-LS window always shows them with negative time remaining. If they EVA and come back in, it resets to 0. And if I go to another ship and come back it resets. But otherwise it just keeps counting down. And by my calculation the Fertilizer isn\u0027t being used up as fast as it should be. I checked the part.cfg and everything looks right... Am I just completely missing something? If it might be a bug, what do I post and where?"},{"CreatedByName":"PocketBrotector","CreatedById":135814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T19:33:37Z","Content":"[@jofwu](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/94705-jofwu/), those are all good questions - unfortunately I don\u0027t have any of the answers yet!\n\nMultipler recyclers should be \u0022cumulative,\u0022 but I don\u0027t really know more about the details other than that the total recycle rate is capped by the best recycler.

That can be used as a cheat at the moment, but RoverDude mentioned that he\u0027d fix this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **3) Can you talk a bit more about how Habitation works? Particularly, what\u0027s the deal with the habitation clock attached to a particular vessel?**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Say I\u0027ve got a ship with enough habitation or 10 months, and Bob is on board. He will last for 10 months before turning into a Tourist. But what happens if Jeb stops by after 5/10 months have passed? I imagine this cuts Bob\u0027s time remaining down to 2.5 months, because he had the whole thing to himself for 5 but now he has to share the last five with Jeb. But how does Jeb\u0027s timer work? He only gets 2.5 months because Bob has \u0022used the space up\u0022? I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case, because I haven\u0027t noticed any ships becoming \u0022worn out\u0022 like this. But I can\u0027t think how else you would determine how long Jeb can last. It all makes sense to me when we talk about confining a set number of Kerbals to a certain ship. But I\u0027m really confused how the math works out when you start adding fresh Kerbals or new parts to the ship.\n\u003E \n\nYou have some good questions. Do the experiments and report back!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, jofwu said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **4) Lastly, a more specific question that I\u0027ve had...** \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, my Supplies are CONSTANTLY drained down to zero, and the USI-LS window always shows them with negative time remaining. If they EVA and come back in, it resets to 0. And if I go to another ship and come back it resets. But otherwise it just keeps counting down. And by my calculation the Fertilizer isn\u0027t being used up as fast as it should be. I checked the part.cfg and everything looks right... Am I just completely missing something? If it might be a bug, what do I post and where?\n\u003E \n\nYeah, all of that is still kinda buggy. Vessels do not handle docking and EVA very well, often the Kerbals munch away everything. The consumption catch-up happens after the production catch-up, so when during production the vessel gets full, it stops, then the kerbals munch everything away. Could you, however, check out what happens when you replace your USILifeSupport.dll with thise one: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/usi-ls/pr-87/USILifeSupport.dll](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/usi-ls/pr-87/USILifeSupport.dll)?

When the next crew arrive to re-use the lander I am finding that they immediately consume all the supplies left on the lander and all the supplies in their own (CSM) vessel as well. It seems like LS is assuming that the crew have been in the lander vessel the whole time it was left in minmus orbit and now it does a catch up, resulting in sup: = -49 days.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/), I have a lot of mods installed and the vessels are non stock but I have saved the quicksave and player.log if you want them.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 28.2.2016 at 5:20 AM, mikegarrison said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Interesting.
