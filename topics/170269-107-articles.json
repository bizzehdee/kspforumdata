Archetypes also get used to simplify complex histories when the reality of the events is more complex too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI blame the format. For example, George Lucas had an interesting opportunity to make a different kind of war series with The Clone Wars TV show, as the conflict was hinted at being much more complex in the original prequel movies (Padme\u2019s thoughts of how the Republic had become the thing they were fighting against, and the \u201Cheroes on both sides\u201D line in the opening scrawl).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, the Separatists were turned into a pseudo Empire. Yet another black and white, easy to digest story. Partially because the target audience was children and having good guys that do bad things and bad guys that do good things would be too hard to understand, but I think it was also because the format of Star Wars has always been black and white, good vs. evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least Andor kind of got into how the Rebels had to get as dirty as their enemies to try and win.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-TSqjRgh2ZY?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022How Liberty Dies: The Politics of Star Wars\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas an excellent analyze on this, newer watched the clone wars.
