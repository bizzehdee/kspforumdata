After going into the input settings I found there was no way to assign trim to anything. I\u0027m pretty much stuck having to go back to the keyboard mid flight if I want to set the trim, or just deal with the aircraft pitching down each time I turn. Is there a mod or work around that addresses this issue that I haven\u0027t found? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
