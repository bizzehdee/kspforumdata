I probably still don\u0027t have enough tech ( aerospikes would help ) but my problem involves a strange rolling effect in both of the two SSTO designs I made.\n\nThe effect is stronger in mark 1 and it\u0027s noticeable even with SAS on. Without SAS they roll A LOT. I also noticed that it only happens when I pull up... and they both roll in the **same** direction ( to the right )\n\nI removed some struts that could induce strange drag, checked all control surfaces, but still nothing. Here there are some photos. BTW I forgot to open the cargo bay: in both version it\u0027s filled with 4 1.25m RCS tanks ( attached on the rear side of the cargo bay ), 2 big radial batteries, some static solar panels attached on the bottom ( with simmetry enabled ) and the KER module.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Your rudders are slightly inclined inward. While this is accurate to the Blackbird, my experience has been that any rudders that are not perpendicular to the lifting surfaces tends to negatively impact stability.

Since they are not mirrored below the plane\u0027s centerline, the yaw correction will also induce roll. If the nose is sufficiently offset in crab yaw, it will induce a roll that is unrecoverable.\n\n Since the yaw command itself can\u0027t be turned off, the only recourse is to either a) fly without SAS or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) disable the yaw response in the rudders and steer with pitch and roll only. So long as you have sufficient vertical stabilizer area and leverage, it will still naturally track in commanded turns and these problems tend to disappear.\n\n Full disclosure: I have noticed that some other pilots don\u0027t like how my planes fly when I do this. It makes them feel a bit vague in roll and they prefer to have more positive yaw response. So *caveat emptor*, ask your doctor if disabling the rudders is right for you, etc.\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy\n\n\\*edit\\* Addendum: I also tend to use a lot less active control surface than most pilots in my spaceplanes. I hate the laggy, excessive response that KSP\u0027s stability assist gives and I find that it interferes with the stability, making it twitchy and erratic IMO.\n\n Reducing (or in some cases eliminating) the active control surfaces gives a lot less control authority, but IMO makes it much more stable, reassured, and pleasant to fly. YMMV.\n\nAs an example, my \u0022Shuttle Kourageous\u0022 \n\n![Kourageous1_zpsiovlv8m6.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kourageous/Kourageous1_zpsiovlv8m6.jpg)\n\n Shuttles are notoriously ill-tempered.

Interesting concept and a good way to stop novices from trying to change heading with yaw.\n\nStill, the ability to vary AoA means you need less stabilizer if it is also a control surface. It\u0027s also nice for correcting inclination as you transition to ballistic flight. Even a passive stabilizer will induce roll while slipstreaming if it\u0027s unbalanced.\n\nI find that you need surprisingly little yaw stabilization for most craft if you are careful during reentry and avoid high slipstream manuvers. A single winglet is enough to keep my 60-80 t craft stable.

You have multiple wing sections.

Stock KSP does not have a tweakable for control authority. StockPlus does have this option.\n\nAlso, the amount of yaw authority needed will depend on a combination of how resposive you want the plane to be, and how statically stable you want. You could easily make a plane that is stable in yaw with zero vertical stabilizers. But then it might not be super responsive.\n\nAs for the \u0022pitch up\u0022 timewarp thing, make sure you aren\u0027t accidentally inputting trim. It\u0027s easy to do when flying, especially under warp.
