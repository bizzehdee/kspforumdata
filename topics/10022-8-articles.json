The soft hum of it\u0027s levitation drives almost hypnotic. The underside is mostly black heat tiles, still smoldering from it\u0027s descent from the heavens.\n\nThrough the sun-blotting silhouette you manage to catch a glimpse of the identifying roundel. The black, diamond-shape emblem of an eagle is familiar but you can\u0027t quite place it. Suddenly panels on underside of the craft slide open, hatches spring to life as dozens of weapons platforms take aim at the ground below. Missile batteries, CIWS, railguns, even battleship-caliber turrets set their sights on the squabbling hilltop below. The din of the craft\u0027s engines are joined by the faint sounds of more, smaller craft. Several formations of fighters catapult themselves into the air, followed shortly by barges.\n\nAs the lead barge approaches [music emanating from it becomes more audible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1d_MGBKik), with a dull thud the craft touches down atop the hill. Soldier clad in white and grey body armour march forth from it\u0027s hold and from a pair of ranks along the path to the top. The other barges give birth to strange tanks and bipedal mechs, paratroopers fill the sky beneath the mothership...\n\nBy the time the song has reached it\u0027s crescendo, a young woman pridefully strides down the boarding ramp of the dropship to be greeted by soldiers saluting in perfect unison. Her ebony hair swaying gently in the vortexes of idling engines. After acknowledging her subordinates she marches forward, her piercing red eyes fixed upon OdinYggd... she stops, a mere meter from the moderator.\n\nA scowl creeps to her face...\n\n*\u0022You\u0027re on* ***my*** *hill.\u0022*"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:06:29Z","Content":"A hammer appears out of nowhere in Odin\u0027s hand, glowing with blinding brilliance. \n\nIt erupts into lightning bolts that send all of the craft reeling out of control, and the soldiers ducking for cover. \n\n*You and what army.*"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:14:13Z","Content":"You mean \u0022Me and my army\u0022 \n\n\\*points to the SFD1 hovering in the background\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"chobit-389","CreatedById":40105,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:19:04Z","Content":"*\u0022Now now, look here Mr. \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC sir.
