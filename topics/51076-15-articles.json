But, any ideas on server specs to run just the server?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking at super low utilization here. In the near term we are talking one player at a time, me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I have KSP running on multiple machines (desktop and laptop), but I almost only play on my laptop, because it is annoying to synch my save between machines. Easily doable, but I am lazy and I don\u0027t always remember to do it after I am done with a play session. That means if I switch machines I am playing on, I might have to boot up the other machine, grab the save, toss it on my server, shut it down and then hop on my other machine to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like it could be PERFECT to run effectively a synchronized play world. Oh, sure I might not be able to hop in to something I just launched, but the fact that I could be building the same world between the two machines, just generally controlling different missions at any given time is fine with me (and hey, I can board a station launched from my other machine and \u0022take it over!\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy server is a dual core G1520 Celeron Ivy bridge based machine with 8GB of memory (its mostly there for storage/file sharing).

So that is the machine I\u0027d be running it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome future date if I keep the KSP bug, and KSP continues being developed, etc, etc I probably would play true multiplayer. My oldest son is only 5 1/2, but he loves watching me play and has played a couple of times himself (mostly launching rockets I\u0027ve built for him). I could see him able to really get in to the game in another year or two.
