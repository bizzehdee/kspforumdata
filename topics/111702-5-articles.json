If you\u0027ll notice, the stock fairings separate perfectly neatly and float away perfectly parallel to each other. Freaky. Well, real fairings don\u0027t do that! In fact, I recall, and my screenshot earlier in this thread seems to support that recollection, that the clamshell fairings from this mod had a slight spin imparted to them at separtion, and I do miss that.
