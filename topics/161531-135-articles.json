Nuclear energy technology forusus on generating long term power production and allows engines which are foremost ment for propulsion, also to generate power. It starts with Molten Salt reactor (first nuclear power which if reprocessed can produce almost infinate long term power), followed by pebblebed, which offer high power at higher temperaturer with minimum maintenance (at the cost of storage), followed by dusty plasma which allows the construction of fission fraction propusion, allowing very high ISP, followed by fusion reactoroffer better charged particle performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T11:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Derwan","CreatedById":133233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMost likely you are not generating any electric power, please verify if your reactor has run out of fuel, power to sustain the reaction process or the overall system was overheating causing a reactor shutdown.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few dozen solar satellites in orbit around kerbol to fuel things that require a lot of energy.

For instance, their is no limit on the amount of power that can be transmitted by a single transmitter. But transmitters are essentialy tiny lamps which generate infrared light. Like all lamps they have an upper power limit and tend to be less efficent to more power you try to generate. Also The conversion from infrared back to electric power is way to optimitistic as it essentialy photo electric cells that convert photons in the infrared sectrum back to power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T08:33:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T11:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick question for you Free Thinker.
