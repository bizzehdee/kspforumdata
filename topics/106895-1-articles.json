After some testing with spaceplane builds, I\u0027m pretty sure that rapier engines only reach their power band at around 360-400m/s, after which they\u0027ll often run away with themselves and get faster and more powerful until you exceed their altitude limit. Below this speed, at *any* altitude, it\u0027s hard to get more than 100-150kN out of them without diving, while above this speed they\u0027ll easily head for 200-250, and beyond.\n\nHowever, it can be impossible to *reach* that speed with what seem to be very sensible ships. This plane, with only two rapiers on it will max out at 310m/s, will not be able to reach the upper atmosphere, and will never go fast enough to engage rocket mode. If given a pair of turbojets, it will reach 750m/s at 21km.\n\n![7QINKaQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7QINKaQ.jpg)\n\nAdding third rapier makes the difference, because it gets you past the 400m/s barrier and suddenly the power spikes up and past 5-600m/s you can shut the third engine down because the primary pair are pushing out 275kN each. But, like pretty much everyone who flies SSTOs, what I instinctively want to do is put a nerva on the back end for a bit of range.\n\nMy question is thus this:\n\n***Is it intentional that rapiers require either an excessive number of them, or additional turbojets, in order to make them reach their operating speed?***\n\nIf it\u0027s intended... well, ok... but I can put two turbojets and one LV-T45 on *that same plane* and it will do the same job, for less money, and much lower science investment. Is *that* intended?\n\n![Qtncrwf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Qtncrwf.jpg)\n\nI don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a problem with the maximum thrust output - as said, once you can get a rapier past ~400m/s it\u0027ll basically run away from you - but the power curve may need some love in the low-mid range.\n\nRight now there seems to be no compelling reason to research or use rapiers for small-medium size ships. It\u0027s possible that as craft scale up, rapiers become more appealing, but at the size illustrated here, they are not useful and do not feel like they reward players for researching them.\n\nAppreciate thoughts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\\*edit\\* \n\nHere\u0027s my napkin maths on where I think the problem that I (and others) are facing is coming from. (Note I\u0027m not a modder, I may have the meaning of these configs completely wrong, and if so I apologise and just let me know. I have also used simple linear interpolation rather than drawing a proper curve. I suspect the real values are actually a little lower than I have reached.)\n\n![kWpbBin.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kWpbBin.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m not sure what altitude results in a pressure of 0.16atm, but taking both engines side by side, approaching mach 1, we can see that the rapier is clearly very far behind when it\u0027s trying to cross the supersonic threshold. These are also about the numbers I observe in the part menu when a rapier plane has hit its maximum velocity, vs it\u0027s turbojet equivalent which will be zooming off ahead. And remember that there are two engines on my plane! Two turbojets are worth almost exactly three rapiers - which interestingly is what I already concluded based on the illustrated configurations above.\n\nIn short, the rapier\u0027s lifting potential from ground to orbit is significantly less because on its own it can\u0027t get through the transitional phase to where it is better than the TJ at higher altitude. You have to support it with a TJ, or simply have more of them, which rather makes the point of a hybrid engine a bit redundant.\n\nPerhaps this is by design, but if so it is a curious decision, since rapiers are an end-of-tree and expensive (in science) part. My belief was that they\u0027re there to free up an engine slot on the back from being a high TWR rocket, to being a high efficiency rocket (or simply save weight). In their current state, I\u0027m not convinced they are capable of doing this at this scale of plane. I completely accept that larger planes scale well, and four rapiers resolves this problem; but it also means a bigger, heavier plane that needs a bigger set of interplanetary engines... etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T21:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:35:03Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been making aircraft of about that size and using 4 rapiers, but if your issue is just breaking past 310-320 m/s, keep in mind that you get massively increased drag as you cross mach 1, but it will then drop again.

Unfortunately, there\u0027s three reasons that doesn\u0027t work so well...\n\na) The air mode will generally be delivering 130-150kN at this mach 0.95 between 10 and 15km. Rocket mode is 170; the difference is very small.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) When you go back to air mode, your thrust is reset and the engine spools up, so you lose about 80m/s. Getting that while in rocket mode in thick atmosphere will burn up half your fuel.\n\nc) You can\u0027t go higher before a and b because you lose lift, and you need a crazy AoA, which ramps up your drag and just makes the whole situation worse ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:06:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:20:10Z","Content":"Try it, I think you\u0027ll find it works.

For this particular plane, if you try rockets at 10km you\u0027re lucky to gain 100m/s for all your fuel due to thick air; by 18km the AoA is 20 degrees to stay level, and you can\u0027t overcome the increased drag.\n\nThe power curve on rapiers simply isn\u0027t competitive with turbojets when in the mach 0-1.5 range. Swap the rapiers for turbos and you can ascend rapidly all the way to 21km at 750m/s, which is what I would have expected rapiers to also deliver, being the more advanced part.\n\nAgreed, I could add a third engine; which I indeed tried, and it was a great ride to orbit - but what I want to add is an LV-N to give some range past LKO, not another inefficient LFO rocket or air-only jet. Scaling it up to 4 rapiers and a nerva is of course an option, but it doesn\u0027t get around the original observation that two turbojets and a starter rocket engine are *as good as three* rapiers.\n\nThis does not seem right for an end-of-tree part."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:04:11Z","Content":"Added some napkin math to the initial post."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:16:07Z","Content":"Maybe your ascent profile is too aggressive or you need more lift.
