I looked closely at all the objectives and stayed within the required speed while I was at the altitude it wanted, but when I recovered the vessel, the contract wasn\u0027t completed. Is this because I only recovered the command capsule, or because I didn\u0027t actually activate the booster or some other reason?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T18:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you activate the test engine at the required altitude?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose contracts are finicky anyway.

Hit F11, and somewhere in those menus you can force the contract complete.
