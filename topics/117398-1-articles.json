When i messed in career mode in 0.90 days (where these missions did actually exist btw), i often deployed a satelite alongside anoher mission, although my satelites were just decoupled from the main ship that launched 2 or more satelites as well as the usual land somewhere mission. Always liked to kill multiple birds with one stone, so many of my mission oriented games were done that way, large rocket, bringing a plethora or smaller stuff to the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T17:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESatellites can be detached from a manned vessel and still count toward your contract.
