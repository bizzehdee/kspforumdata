This would provide the player with a graphical landing ellipse (which they can turn on or off) which is drawn on the surface of the body in map view if a trajectory is suborbital, and which *does* take account of the atmosphere (or lack thereof) of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, on your first launch from Kerbin you have no data about the atmosphere, so you do not get a landing ellipse for Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have gotten into orbit and landed at least once, the game should reward you with a landing ellpise... but a big, inaccurate one. As you perform further landings the ellipse should be refined down to some maximum accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it more accurate still, you would need to use the atmospheric ysis (Edit: LOL profanity filter. a.n.a.l.y.s.i.s) part to perform ysis on the atmosphere. This would then give you the most accurate landing ellipse possible for that particular body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn bodies without an atmopshere the same mechanic would still apply.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-19T08:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2014 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T10:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough theoretically - you can pinpoint the location - no need for ellipse, as atmosphere is a perfect gradient, there are no turbulences that could push you off the course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T10:43:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game could calculate a pinpoint landing location and show it, but then you wouldn\u0027t be able to improve it over time with more research.
