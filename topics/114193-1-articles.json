I\u0027ll have to check, but the other day I had one whole \u003Cem\u003Ewing\u003C/em\u003E occluded during reentry on a Spatha (it was a bigS delta, and nowhere near inside the bay, just attached to it). Fixed it by cycling the bay open/close. I\u0027ll try to reproduce, but there was also a payload with a Klaw badly clipped in the bay, so that may have had something to do and maybe I won\u0027t be able to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I don\u0027t bring much info to remove the bug, but I have a workaround: if your plane starts to act wonky, turn on the aerodynamic overlay to check whether all your surfaces are generating lift, and if some aren\u0027t, cycle the doors to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
