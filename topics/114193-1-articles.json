But after just opening and closing the bay it\u0027s possible for all 3 parts to loose drag altogether or worse one of the pars starts getting massive drag while others sit at zero.\n\nexamples:\n\n[![nrdRnndm.png](http://i.imgur.com/nrdRnndm.png)](http://imgur.com/nrdRnnd)\n\nthe large holding tank is inside the bay to note that parts inside are shielded\n\nother cases fromthe same design - two small mods were installed but i did test later on completely stock install (used in the above picture and the more indepth description mentioned later) and it worked the same way:\n\n[![fuNjjd7m.png](http://i.imgur.com/fuNjjd7m.png)](http://imgur.com/fuNjjd7) - drag completely gone from bay, it\u0027s contents and two adjacent mk3 parts\n\n[![QtVfUKZm.png](http://i.imgur.com/QtVfUKZm.png)](http://imgur.com/QtVfUKZ) - some time later same flight after opening and closing the doors - one of the parts get 250 points of drag.\n\nHere is the craft link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjr0jf6rfo3j3jz/cargo%20bay%20bug.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjr0jf6rfo3j3jz/cargo%20bay%20bug.craft?dl=0)\n\n**What happens usually**:\n\nOn first load everything is fine - then moving cargo bay can disable drag on stack connected adjacent parts - after that if we revert flight to runway the cargo bay loose drag value from the start, and moving doors start to do more random glitching (adjacent parts can gain or loose drag).\n\nNotable things that can be causing this: the cargo bay have two docking ports inside (stack connection), removing one of them changes the glitch behavior, removing both fixes it for first launch - if the revert is used, it\u0027s possible to get the bug without any parts inside.\n\nedit: after a suggestion from other forum member, i tried renaming physics.cfg file, the new file is different (i was on a stock install earlier... so idk why), but the bug in question prevails.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T20:57:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nao**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:13:47Z","Content":"An update, the cargo bay part needs to be a **root** for this to happen.

I\u0027ll have to check, but the other day I had one whole *wing* occluded during reentry on a Spatha (it was a bigS delta, and nowhere near inside the bay, just attached to it). Fixed it by cycling the bay open/close. I\u0027ll try to reproduce, but there was also a payload with a Klaw badly clipped in the bay, so that may have had something to do and maybe I won\u0027t be able to.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u0027t bring much info to remove the bug, but I have a workaround: if your plane starts to act wonky, turn on the aerodynamic overlay to check whether all your surfaces are generating lift, and if some aren\u0027t, cycle the doors to fix it.\n\nRune. Every new 1.0x version brings new and amazing bugs. Thank Kod we had a beta version, right? ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)"}]}
