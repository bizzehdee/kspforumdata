I just got KSP a couple of days ago and I can\u0027t stop playing it. It really is an awesome game and I love how I am learning about orbital mechanics as I go. After college I was choosing between designing satellites and job in finance and i eventually took the finance job but this lets me see how much fun I could have had! Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T21:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, derrickchan.
