I launched a shuttle and deployed a satellite in LKO then landed the shuttle at KSC. Next step, launch an empty shuttle and retrieve it. All went well, I loaded it into the cargo bay and attached to an internal docking port and set off for home. Then I noticed the load was drooping through the bottom of the cargo bay and flapping about like crazy (if you have ever seen a stallion side on you will get the idea). Anyway I tried again with a claw but it did the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts only work when building a load in before launch, so how about a load securing clamp option that stops this happening. When a load is docked or clawed inside a cargo bay a \u0027secure load\u0027 option appears. It could then automatically add a couple of struts to stabilise the load? Not necessarily any real need for a graphic representation either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T19:56:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope once we (hopefully) get fuel transfer hoses they will be sturdy enough to hold this kind of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also KAS and KIS that adds special struts that can be added on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think everything inside a closed cargobay should just add mass, and do nothing else, like stuck.
