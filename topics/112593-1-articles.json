I launched a shuttle and deployed a satellite in LKO then landed the shuttle at KSC. Next step, launch an empty shuttle and retrieve it. All went well, I loaded it into the cargo bay and attached to an internal docking port and set off for home. Then I noticed the load was drooping through the bottom of the cargo bay and flapping about like crazy (if you have ever seen a stallion side on you will get the idea). Anyway I tried again with a claw but it did the same thing.\n\nStruts only work when building a load in before launch, so how about a load securing clamp option that stops this happening. When a load is docked or clawed inside a cargo bay a \u0027secure load\u0027 option appears. It could then automatically add a couple of struts to stabilise the load? Not necessarily any real need for a graphic representation either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T19:56:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:21:30Z","Content":"I hope once we (hopefully) get fuel transfer hoses they will be sturdy enough to hold this kind of things.\n\nThere\u0027s also KAS and KIS that adds special struts that can be added on EVA."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:16:50Z","Content":"I think everything inside a closed cargobay should just add mass, and do nothing else, like stuck.
