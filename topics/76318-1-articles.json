The problem is I need to pack it by folding it up so that when the doors close the folded panel goes inside the fuselage part. I have the animation to spin the panels but not to fold them and I can not find any tutorials on how to fold up my parts and such like that in unity. Does anyone have a tutorial or know of an animation tutorial? Or have a solar pannel animation file for unity i could look at?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T00:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe spinning of a solar panel to face the sun is controlled by raycast and transforms, you do not need to animate that part of a solar panel , just make an animation for the unfolding. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38408-Rotating-solar-panels-%28Unity-configuration%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETHIS threads information is still relevant and works\u003C/a\u003E, well did a couple of weeks ago when i made and emergency panel thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T01:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParent and children objects Pivot points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of your panels as the children, the bars that hold the panels as the parent. If you use a simple cylinder for the bars you can use it\u0027s point of origin to rotate evenly, and just ensure your parts are all added in the hierarchy under one another. If you move the top bar, anything under it is affected, so to fold out a solar panel, you would just have a range of cylinders rotating with children objects, being the solar panels. Move the top bar, they all move, and then as you go you rotate each parent one at a time and fold the panel up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T03:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks... I got the animation working in Unity, but now the part wont show up in the game... I made a cfg, and thought maybe it was the code for the panels but that still didn\u0027t fix the problem, I think the problem is in something I did in unity I am not sure what I broke... if someone wants to have a stab at showing me my noob mistake I would speak kindly of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5GoisSOPfY4SXpjWlhWdnJkY3M/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eassets2x1solar.zip\u003C/a\u003E this is the assets folder for it.... I changed the hierarchy I am not sure if it will be saved in the file the way i have it set.... when I preview the anim directly from the anim file its a little messed up but it worked correctly in the render. I would like to know what I fuggered so I can learn so if someone can tell me or show me that would be AMAZING! thanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
