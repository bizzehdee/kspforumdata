I am having an issue where the amount of liquid fuel and oxidizer are not being displayed when you mouse over the parts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of what I am talking about. \n\nThe information is displayed when you select the part and then press the middle mouse button, but I want the information back in the window when you mouse over it. Any ideas? \n\n![f50glLz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f50glLz.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"kungfufishstick","CreatedById":144240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:07:39Z","Content":"I noticed I was running with close to 60 mods and Interstellar Fuel Switch was one of the mods I removed to cut down on my total mods.

Definitely my fault. And the crashes have to do with memory use by KSP over time. The workaround for me will be adding the mod sentinel to notify me when I reach a certain amount of memory usage so I can just save, exit, and restart the game."}]}
