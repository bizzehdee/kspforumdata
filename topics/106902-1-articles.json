The key is to move all the files in GameData called ModuleManager.#### into your new gameData directory as well as the other mods. (I only moved the subfolders before, e.g. KIS, Mechjeb2, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I moved my save game folder out of the Kerbal directory, deleted and re-installed the game, but I think the above was the step i was missing, since that didn\u0027t work by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, this all happened after migrating to 1.0.3 from 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
