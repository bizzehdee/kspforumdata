The best way to do this seems to be to dive at the sun, as you get an incredibly high velocity with a low periapsis about kerbol. However, doing this I get a velocity of merely 130,000m/s or so. Far lower then I would hope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, I decided that the way to increase it would be to first drive out to an orbit ridiculously far from kerbol, and dive in from there. So I give you the following. My orbit with the apoapsis at 65 trillion meters from kerbol, the furthest I could get before the kraken munched me, and the apoapsis still at kerbin orbit. The program claims a time of 68 years to reach apoapsis, but I fear this to be far incorrect. The time seems to cap out at a 32 bit integer value of seconds. This leaves me with my kerbals sitting a long, long way from home, so far away right now that the sun is only a dim point of light far in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sort of mission really leaves me wanting a time warp factor of at least 1 million. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will update with progress if I ever get to the sun dive part of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached is my craft file for doing this. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Australian Sloth","CreatedById":12111,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T04:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what\\\u0027s gonna come first, the end of time, half life ep 3 or your sundive?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T05:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what\\\u0027s gonna come first, the end of time, half life ep 3 or your sundive?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got lazy and cut it short to a ~9 year orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill about 3 hours to go until I do the sundive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince its 2am, that will happen tommorrow.
