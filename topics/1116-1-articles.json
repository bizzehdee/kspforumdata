If there\u0027s interest, I can generate an updated version.\n\ninzmru, you might want to add your plot to this thread:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=647.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=647.0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T13:35:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a graph of velocity versus altitude...for a given altitude, there\u0027s nothing to graph.\n\nErr... duh.
