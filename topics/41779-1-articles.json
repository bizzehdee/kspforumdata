If you were mostly playing with yourself and the occasional friend, multiplayer might not be a big deal at all. Heck, you could introduce full on timewarp to the highest speed. Just make it collaborative time warp. When someone wants to engage time warp, it pops up a request to all players on the server who have to okay it. ANY player on the server can also disable time warp at anytime. If players are in the KSC scene instead of actively in flight, then of course you don\u0027t need to ask about timewarp, though as soon as any player goes from VAB/SPH to launch pad/runway if time warp is occuring, time warp immediately ceases (though anyone can request it again right away, and then polls the players if it is okay to engage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr...no multiplayer ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of like the idea of collaborative/polling time warp.
