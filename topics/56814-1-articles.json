I then squeezed the bug so hard the tissue broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday was awful\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe point is...?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoveycat","CreatedById":71091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T02:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou think bugs are bad?
