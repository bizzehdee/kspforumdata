Also, things seem to like randomly exploding when quickloading in the atmosphere, but I think I remember having that problem before as well so it might not be fixable. I could not find any solutions, nor anyone else with this problem on google so I decided to post this here.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy main question is whether this is a common bug, and if so whether there are any standard solutions to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference the mods that I though are most likely to have somethign to do with this are:\u003Cbr\u003E\nRO with dependencies\u003Cbr\u003E\nRP-0 with dependencies\u003Cbr\u003E\nFAR\u003Cbr\u003E\nDeadly Reentry\u003Cbr\u003E\nRSS\u003Cbr\u003E\nB9-Prcedural Parts\u003Cbr\u003E\nProcedural Parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T17:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Make sure your mods are fully updated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. If so: The first B9 proc wings are rated only for subsonic flight. They will be fine for that, but if you go fast, they will overheat. You need to unlock the supersonic wings, and then the spaceplane wings, if you want to go faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T19:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
