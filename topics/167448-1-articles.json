It\u0027s not something easy to fix, though. It seems to be much worse if you leave you ship parked on a steep slope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs spricigo says, a good workaround is to increase gravity before you switch focus to a ship that jumps. If it still jumps, you can reset the gravity to normal while it is in midair. That way it comes down soft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Urus28","CreatedById":182121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T14:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223216874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510429651\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spricigo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Spricigo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor you more pressing isue, the rover being throw in the air.
