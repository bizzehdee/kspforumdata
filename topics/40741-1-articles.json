I\u0027m still in the vicinity of kerbin. I\u0027m just outside of the orbit of Minmus. They are unfortunately not able to shoot back toward kerbin, sicne they are out of fuel basically.

This is because you are going to need a lot of fuel to get them if you are right about their orbit and they are the most fuel efficient (next to ion engines). Your rescue craft could be remote controlled if you want, but unless you had a docking port on the first craft you are not going to be able to latch on to them (assuming stock). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead your ideal craft will have a hitchhiker pod in it.

It had enough fuel for me to slow it down to about 800 m/s, but I only have a small spritz of fuel left now. I\u0027m still completely new to this game. I\u0027ve been playing now for 3 days.
