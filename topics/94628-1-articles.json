It doesn\u0027t have a name, but the SPS abbreviation comes from \u0022small personal shuttle\u0022. This line of crafts was originally designated as space station escape craft (and plane capability after reentry), but due to plentiful dV I began to use it as an SSTO for single crew transfer to my space stations. In it\u0027s new form (Mark 4), it has been bundled with a vertical launcher (not unlike the X-37) and a transfer stage, giving it a total of 10k dV, plus a large amount more for atmospheric flight. I obviously decided to land it on the Mun.
