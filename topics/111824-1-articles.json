Although the story of the game along with the gameplay and its art (the city missions felt like a cyberpunk game) are the really strong points, and i enjoyed the game for those reasons, it has many bugs and it\u0027s poorly optimized, the lag i faced at the last mission was terrible and many of the bugs that were at the pre-release versions some youtubers had are still there. The sad thing about it is that Firaxis will not fix these issues because they rather keep on their \u0027\u0027principles\u0027\u0027 that admit \u0027\u0027defeat\u0027\u0027.
