Today I will be presenting my space program! Here, I will do a sorta space program like the real thing, sutch as first sending up sub orbital probes, kermans into space, lunar flybys, and eventually, the ultimate goal.... Get to Minimus and put 3 kermans on it! I will be posting pics about my journey. however, this will only happen if you vote so!

I did do a sort of replica of the US space program, sending up missions that were carbon copies of what happened at NASA. Once I got to Gemini 7, however, it got VERY hard to do. So I gave up.

If you master powered vertical landings on Kerbin, you will find its much easier to do in lower gravity environments. Also, restarting is much less frustrating when your launch site is 30 seconds from your landing site. This helped me successfully land on the mun back before landing legs existed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T03:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, i generally didnt do it COMPLETLY real, because there wasent much testing. tho, i did start off with probes and not going to mun admediatly. i will soon uplaod vid of pics.
