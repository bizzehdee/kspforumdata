I will be doing a rebalance pass over all of the command pod/service module stats -- mostly weight and fuel capacity.  ISP/thrust will use the stats from the engine.  As I\u0027m using scaled real-world stats for the engines, I want to use scaled real-world stats for the command pods and service modules as well.  The question/point of discussion here is:  What balance should be used for these?  Should I apply basically the same scaling as for the engines? (0.64\\*0.64\\*0.64\\* mass \\*4).  Something else?   (This balance would place the Orion-CM at 10t total mass; which is nearly its exact real-world value; other parts would likely come out similar)  Perhaps only a 2x mult for mass rather than 4x?  Basically, I\u0027m trying to bring down the mass of these pods a bit through some proper realistic balancing rather than use the current \u0027close enough to stock balance\u0027 that I have in place (have noticed that stock is actually very inconstent with pod/crewed part masses, so there is quite a bit of wiggle room).\n\n2.)  What engine clusters should be included in the default download for SSTU?  I have a feeling that many of the clusters are used rarely, if at all.  I can certainly trim down the default engine cluster list while offering the rest as a separate download - no need for everything to be in the default installation.  Could possibly even offer just the single engines in the standard download and have all of the cluster-config-patches as a separate \u0027optional\u0027 pack (where users could then trim it down further themselves to keep only those they want).  Thoughts?  Favorite engines/clusters?"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T22:40:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And first pass at rework on the HUS:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Still need to go back over the spec masks on both parts and bring them up to my new standards, and perhaps add a few details, but these appear to be mostly done as it is.  -Might- be able to get them into tonights testing release with the rest... a bit of config work to do on them, but should be able to get it sorted quick enough.\n\u003E \n\nAre those the RL10-A-4?

The images that I based the HUS on I think used some other non-extendable engine, judging from the diagram (was part of some NASA .pdf files).  But yah, exactly the problem that the modular-upper stage parts are intended to solve (well, one of the problems anyway).  Also why I call it the \u0027Heavy Upper Stage\u0027 rather than any of the many different names that have been given to the SLS block II upper stage (Earth Departure Stage, Exploration Upper Stage, Large Upper Stage, DUUS (not sure what it stands for), likely a few others that I\u0027ve missed as well).\n\nI\u0027m still going to try out the B-2\u0027s on it though... its all MODEL node based, so simple enough to change all that stuff up if I find that it works out well in blender.\n\nEdit: Silly auto-merge...\n\nUpdated testing pre-release is available:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.25-pre2](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.25-pre2)\n\nNew Series-B CM, SM, BPC, HUS, ICPS.

Also, this is why I wanted to reduce the CM/SM masses -- so that the scaled engine is not painful to use.  Realistic balanced engines need realistic balanced pods.\n\nAlso still debating how to best do a minor rebalance on all of the engine stats; though I still would like to wait until I get at least a few more engines before I start really worrying about the balance on those.\n\nIn the end, I believe all engines will have their thrust increased but a percentage (with HLOX engines getting a bigger bonus), but probably not more than 50% for the HLOX, and more like 10-20% for the rest.  However, even 11\\*1.5 is still only ~15, and very pitiful thrust.

Not sure if its something with the new water changes, or what... but will be investigating this over the next few weeks.  It seems very inconsistent -- I\u0027ve had them land just fine; had them land, then shoot into the air; had them land, then explode due to overheating (when at 300k...); and had them land and then slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean (~-1000m @ 1.4m/s; takes a few minutes).\n\nLikely this will involve removing modules one at a time / altogether and testing the part as a \u0027dumb shell\u0027;  could be a module conflict, or perhaps might just be something odd with the part itself.  Honestly, I have no idea how the buoyancy model was implemented, so it is all just guessing at this point.

The docking lights should work however as far as emitting light, but no glowy texture there either.\n\n2.)  Noted.  I have not done a pass on the heat balance, so they are using the heat-output from the engine; and as stock has some strange inverse-mass heat output specification, I need to rebalance the heat for the mass of the SM; which needs balancing the SM first.\n\n3.)  Hold middle-mouse button and drag; you can rotate the camera around so that you can see the entire GUI.  Nothing really that I can do about it at the moment, but with 1.1 many things will be moving to their own config GUIs (fairing controls, others), so that many of those buttons will be removed/etc.  Also, I\u0027ll probably remove the fuel cell from the SC-B-SM, as it does not belong there (those things were solar/battery only as far as I know)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T16:53:36Z","Content":"1.) yep, docking lights worked  \n\n2.) moar radiators! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  \n\n3.)
