It\u0027s not really snake oil, it\u0027s just not quite as amazing as they\u0027re making it out to be. The thorium is really just a fertile material that\u0027s converted into Uranium (233 actually, an odd isotope) which is then used. Outside of that common misconception, liquid salt reactors are not very well suited to be scaled or modular. They would, essentially, be a small units which are self contained and have everything from the energy generation equipment to the recycling equipment all built into a single unit. As such, you would actually need arrays of these systems to offset the power output of something like a PWR or LWR.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u0027re absolutely on track with saying that Thorium is a useful material that we\u0027re ignoring though.
