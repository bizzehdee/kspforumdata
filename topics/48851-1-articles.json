Through rigorous study, it was discovered that these tiny lifeforms are useful for even more than just painting rockets and splattering inside containers after all! It turns out, Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is also very efficient at breaking down various waste materials! And so we built the Micro-Biome... Basically nothing more than a space faring petri-dish, the Micro-Biome provides a suitable environment to cultivate Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 on a large scale. In doing so, the Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 then consumes various waste products through the fermentation process. As the Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 lives out it\u0027s life happily consuming our waste products, the tiny microbes convert that waste into resources we can then use to maintain adequate environments for our Kerbals, as nutrients for cultivating more complex photosynthetic organisms in the Greenhouse, and for reactants in the Bio-reactor!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
