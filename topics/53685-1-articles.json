Jacob (1999)[26] defines the lifetime of an atmospheric species X in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of X remains in the box. Mathematically can be defined as the ratio of the mass (in kg) of X in the box to its removal rate, which is the sum of the flow of X out of the box (), chemical loss of X (), and deposition of X () (all in kg/s): .[26] If one stopped pouring any of this gas into the box, then after a time , its concentration would be about halved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified precisely.[27] The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is estimated of the order of 30\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015395 years.[28] This figure accounts for CO2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean, photosynthesis, and other processes. However, this excludes the balancing fluxes of CO2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs, which have slower characteristic rates.[29] While more than half of the CO2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20%) of emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.[30][31][32] Similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases, many of which have longer mean lifetimes than CO2. E.g., N2O has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years.[19]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd mdatspace.

CO2 response in ppm CO2 is roughly half of that value -- 500ppm CO2 just by burning all the coal. Pre-industrial CO2 levels were 275 ppm, we\u0027re now around 400ppm. That would kick it up to around 1000ppm CO2. You\u0027re correct that CO2 has a half-life of around 50 years in the atmosphere so it depends on how fast we burn it all up, but if you assume we are unrestrained in our acceleration of fossil fuel burning we can do that on the order of 50-ish years, and throw in oil and nat gas (and lets not talk about methane release from fraking nat gas) and 1000ppm CO2 is probably conservative. From paleoclimatology, the last time the Earth saw levels that high was roughly 40 million years ago -- and the Antarctic had melted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you put the poles melting on the table, you get ice-albedo-feedback for one since the ice caps at the poles reflect radiation back into space, and that leads to further warning, so that even if you decrease the CO2 levels you have to take the time to re-freeze the whole Antarctica. There\u0027s also a feedback between high temperature as a cause and higher CO2 as an effect -- so that once temperature changes have taken hold, the biosphere actually produces more CO2 and doesn\u0027t wash it out as effectively, so you can\u0027t consider just the half life of CO2 without considering that you\u0027re bumping the equilibrium up to higher values all along the way. There are a whole lot of feedback loops that occur which make it likely that if we hit 1000ppm that the Himalayas will melt in 300 years or so, and Antarctica will be gone (probably on a longer timeframe like 1000 years, which is still a blink of a geological eye).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it will return, but it took 15 million years from the Eocene maximum until the Antarctica reglaciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the globe was clearly habitable the whole time. We\u0027re not going to sterilize the planet through CO2 by any means. The problem is what kind of issues we cause ourselves in the meantime and what the cost is. Humanity will also survive (assuming we don\u0027t kill ourselves through strife and nuclear war or secondary effects like that). But far from having to worry about the Antarctic melting, we already are likely to have an ice-free Arctic in the summer months. There\u0027s evidence, and a strong reason to believe, that this is already changing weather patterns, and leading to very strong atmospheric blocking and a series of heat waves and (seemingly paradoxially) cold snaps, leading to a rapid rise in the number of billion-dollar weather disasters per year (more than can be accounted for just by land usage and inflation). You also dump more heat in the atmosphere and you energize weather systems. You have more moisture in the atmosphere so that rainfall is on average heavier -- and even snowstorms are on average heavier (they\u0027ll still occur and when they do they\u0027ll be more energetic). And then sealevel rise and inundation is terrible for communities living close to the sea (lots of them being very poor and not having any ability to mitigate the problem).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T21:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jim DiGriz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jim DiGriz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E -snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn informative post.

You\u0027re raising an argument that is over 100 years old. Arrhenius first postulated that CO2 increases could lead to a warming climate in 1896, and Angstrom in 1900 raised the problem that you cite here that water vapor saturates the IR spectra and that increasing CO2 will not result in any change in emissivity. The problem is the CO2 is well mixed in the atmosphere from the surface high into the stratosphere and in the 1950s studies by the USAF and meteorological studies found that the stratosphere was very dry. At that level, increasing CO2 will block IR, and if you block IR at any level of the atmosphere you create a thermal blanket effect which warms the levels below it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you understand anything about how the \u0022thermal blanket\u0022 effect works, you should realize that it\u0027s only relevant in the troposphere. \u0022Greenhouse\u0022 is a terrible misnomer, since the actual greenhouse works completely differently. Upper troposphere is not particularly moist either, but still well within water vapor saturation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jim DiGriz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jim DiGriz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe can also use satellites to measure both incoming and outgoing radiation and we can see that its not in balance so can observe the greenhouse effect, and we can use satellites to watch the IR lines for CO2 get wider as CO2 levels increase. eg: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E balanced.
