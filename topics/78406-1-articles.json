It says to be going between 230 and 730 m/s, altitude between 8300 and 12000, flying at Kerbin. OK, I did all that, but when I activate it, the contract is not completed. It activates the system, but I don\u0027t get the contract completion. The \u0022Test Launch Escape System\u0022 task is still unfulfilled. What the?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that sometimes during tests, you have to use a special \u0022test\u0022 button on the object, but in this task, there is no special test button.
