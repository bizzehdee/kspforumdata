And I do try to adjust the power via the thrust limiter to be about 0.35 TWR. But no matter what, the fuel time seems to be 30 minutes at full throttle (on a high bypass TF), and 2 hours at cruise with no marked improvement in the fuel time with altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I suspected Real Fuels to be involved, but some of the cross-connectivity of these modules makes it hard for me to determine which mods are \u0027outranking\u0027 the others, and the real fuel mass is something I would assume I want to leave alone since it should mass what the fuel ACTUALLY masses. So I\u0027ve spent most of my focus on the engine itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve been doing is playing with the FHV value in the engine sim. When I researched a little into AJE\u0027s engine sim, I noted that all the turbofans have the value around 20-ish E6. The Github explanation of the Engine Sim defined Kerosene at 46.8E6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Values for a P-W F100 set with modded FHVs tell me the following at 66 % throttle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFHV @ 22.2E6 = FF: 2.48 %\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFHV @ 46.8E6 = FF: 1.21 %\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the performance output is telling me that things stay \u0027mostly\u0027 in the same functional ranges in terms of thrust and the like. But that percentage value is a slice in half. I expected for the same throttle settings in-game for that engine, I should have gotten half the fuel flow, and in relation, double the operational flight time at cruise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if Real Fuels is doing something else amidst the module mess, I don\u0027t know what it is. But my main concern is I need to know how fuel flow (in mass or volume) is connected to the configuration of the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I\u0027m testing an F-15 mockup, hence the P-W engine stats above to see if I get any changes. But unless I load it down with so much fuel that the rotation speed is above 250 knots, it doesn\u0027t even get an hour flight endurance at a throttle of 50% at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, one thought I had, is that there might be interference from the B9 Aerospace folder. I grabbed the 0.9 version without it breaking my game. (Mainly so I can have the conformal spotlights), but I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a patch or override hiding out in the folder that is upsetting my engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reference thought I had about it is that I have a Global Hawk that I designed that had terrible fuel consumption on the ground, which I expected, but once cruising at altitude, had enough endurance to last 18 hours. And I could visibly see the endurance time climb rapidly above 6000 meters even before the throttle eased off for the cruising height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thinking about that, and how \u0027thrust\u0027 drops rapidly as I climb, I should technically be seeing fuel consumption drop as thrust drops as you implied. But point is, the Global Hawk performed to spec nicely and it was before I added the B9 folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And I think I found the culprit, because this F-15 now has over four hours of flight time at altitude. I\u0027m\u0027a poke at this and see if my experiment is true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Partial fix. If I want the CFM engines, I need to find something else since they\u0027re part of the B9 mod set. But removing the \u0027stock rebalance\u0027 patch from the B9 folder fixed the P-W F100.

I can verify that just by putting the B9 engine rebalance config back into the folder, which takes over stock engines. The behavior as I\u0027ve learned last night appears to be that any B9-based engine, or any engine B9 touches, uses the B9 values instead of the AJE values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is weird, because it does it in a frankenfritter fashion. This is what I learned over eight hours of dicking with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CFM engine, which is a B9 medium engine pod, has its text data replaced to match the AJE file, but the performance of the engine appears to stick to the ISP defined by the atmosphereCurve value in the B9 Medium Pod engine config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I cracked open AJE\u0027s B9 cfg, the engine pod cfg, and one of the squad STOCK jet engines, I learned for myself that the recent updates did completely reconfigure how the jet engine parameters were being handled. The B9 turbofan at the moment uses older engine code. Obviously, since this was 0.90 B9 for 0.90 KSP, I\u0027m sure you would expect that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the course of my dicking around, I learned that commenting out the atmosphereCurve and velocityCurve sections were a bad idea. As soon as I started the engines with those disabled, the game collapsed into null-space. (Null-space: My now and future term for when the game world and vessel vanish, leaving only empty space and the HUD.) Not to be taken for a fool, I understand what occurred. The game looked for those curves, found a lack of code defining them, and generated a cyber singularity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn looking at the code in comparison, I of course self-facepalmed that the code I tried to null was in fact, only part of a module subsection. So I removed the module and tested again. The game stayed alive, but the engines no longer had engines. So I know for a fact now that I still need to have the moduleEnginesFx in there for the AJE code pull and reinject. (Something that is likely a \u0027Well DUH\u0027 to you, but for me, I\u0027m poking at code I\u0027m not familiar with trying to get parts I want working right. Bear with me as I go step-by-step.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the code comparisons, I noted in the stock engine the code switched up the calls for atmosphereCurve and velocityCurve. Shorthanded down to atmCurve and velCurve. My next experiment swapped those out and put their codes in. Hellooooo Nullspace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecomparing the code again, there was STILL an atmosphereCurve with a single \u0027key\u0027 line showing a rather obvious ISP value (9600). So I added that line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunctionality returned, but engine behavior got... weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I noticed was that my engines would spool up strangely. They would start spooling to about 100 kN and then \u0027jump\u0027 to their max at around 300 kN in an instant. This behavior was mirrored in reverse. They would spool down, then jump to zero. Never mind what this meant for trying to fly a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I noticed that no matter how I played with the throttle, the throttle indicator wouldn\u0027t budge. In retrospect, I think I have a mechjeb with acceleration limitation turned on (Mechjeb was so I could check craft mass in flight), which may have been preventing the engines from powering too high, and would explain the next behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeactivating the engines, I played with the throttle and got full range of motion. Then I set it to a 1/3 setting and turned the engines on. A moment of silence for Wile E Coyote, Super Genius. As the moment I activated the engines, they blew off the plane, taking the wings with it, and dragging the plane to 20 knots and yanking it 30 meters into the air. It was like witnessing an ACME rocket set in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the code, I set the use atmCurve and use velCurve to False. And I\u0027m at where I am now. I see the AJE engine descriptions for the engine, but the ISP of the engine is very clearly the 9600 from the atmosphereCurve value in the B9 pod cfg. The engine works, but it doesn\u0027t give the slightest rat\u0027s aft-end about the AJE engine code itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the code as it stands.
