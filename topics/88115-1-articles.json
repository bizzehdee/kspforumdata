I worked hard on getting the rocket\u0027s altitude in KSP to sync up properly with the real rocket\u0027s altitude, so that everything looked relatively realistic. As for the music, I made it myself. It\u0027s one of the In-Game Plugin Songs, only slowed down a bit (I\u0027m still not sure why I did that, but it seems to work fine, anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original song can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/zZHatC2JB0Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to do literally every aspect of this video myself.
