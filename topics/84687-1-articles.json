A surprisingly small number of rocket engines are capable of arbitrary in-flight restarts. There are a number of extra design considerations you have to make, including feed pressurization, turbopump transients, ignition reusability, and difficulties extending from any dependence on ablative surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand your question correctly, though, what you\u0027re really asking about is the transient problem: how does an engine go from cold start to a fully-opened throttle? (Please correct me if this isn\u0027t the case.) This is a tremendously-difficult problem, and one that engineers usually solve empirically on the test stand. The flow behavior that takes place during transient events (I.e., startup, shutdown, and throttling) is turbulent, excitable, frequently discontinuous, and only on the margins of stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, consider the SSME startup procedure (slide 94 of the PDF linked here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;ei=qUsXVM7EBoiONsfsgbAN\u0026amp;url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/nguyen1/docs/SSME_PRESENTATION.pdf\u0026amp;cd=4\u0026amp;ved=0CC4QFjAD\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNE8N8kdYHGKVYKlxhgJFjyLwxi9UQ\u0026amp;sig2=JL7kwmC9VhUk3vixoIDXPg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;ei=qUsXVM7EBoiONsfsgbAN\u0026amp;url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/nguyen1/docs/SSME_PRESENTATION.pdf\u0026amp;cd=4\u0026amp;ved=0CC4QFjAD\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNE8N8kdYHGKVYKlxhgJFjyLwxi9UQ\u0026amp;sig2=JL7kwmC9VhUk3vixoIDXPg\u003C/a\u003E). That\u0027s one hell of a convoluted startup curve, with vastly different profiles for each component. For every point of inflection on that contour, there is an empty shell of an exploded SSME (or turbopump) sitting out in the desert that proves that particular step is necessary (OK, not literally, but very close to it). It\u0027s fascinating stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transient problem and related stability issues become more challenging as you scale the size of your engine in an attempt to increase thrust performance. This is an interesting problem that both the Americans and Soviets ran into around the same time when building bigger and heavier rockets during the space race. They ended up taking two very different approaches: NASA\u0027s team used some very innovative explosively-driven tap-testing techniques to explore impulse responses for engine under stress. They were then able to isolate and control the most problematic failure modes, which enabled the successful operation of behemoths like the infamous F1. Conversely, the Soviets circumvented the problem by routing a single turbopump systems\u0027 products through multiple, smaller combustion chambers and nozzles, an approach they have continued and refined with engines like the RD-180. It\u0027s funny how simple choices can lead to significant long-term programmatic discrepancies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T20:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022travis575757\u0022 data-cite=\u0022travis575757\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo in KSP, all you have to do is a press a button and the rocket engine fires.

Here on earth when you light a fire, the air provides the oxygen to let the burnable material burn. In space or when you need to have something burn really fast (think Gunpowder), you have to have a stored source of oxygen. In gunpowder it comes from Potassium Nitrate (aka Stump Remover, KNO3). The oxygens get broken off in the burning process to burn what ever. For Liquid Engines the most common Oxidizers are LOX, RFNA, WFNA and some other Ammonium compounds. All these mix with varying degrees of success with the fuels commonly LH2, RP1, NH4, and some other very specialized ones... All chemical burning reactions of ORGANIC compunds produce heat, CO2, CO, and H2O. LH2/LOX is a bit simpler creating HEAT and water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heat is what is important because it keeps all the reaction products as a gas. Gasses are nice to work with because they are compressible. The nozzle design is of great importance and can really effect the performance of the engine. See DeLaval Nozzles for more. As the gasses are going though the nozzle and thrown out the back of the rocket, there is a resultant force (newtons 3rd law) that pushed the rocket forward. As a side physics note for forces and accelerations of a rocket you CANNOT use F=ma you have to use F=(d/dt)(vm) because both mass and velocity are changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some one mentioned how rockets are started in space. There are some fuel and oxidizer combinations that are Hypergolic (they ignite upon contact, no external energy is needed). Those are the best to be used in space so you dont have to worry about an igniter system. BUT hypergolics often have the drawback of they give less Thrust and have less Isp (specific impulse). Other upper stages are designed to not use hypergolic propellants, like the F9v1.1 Upper Stage. To ignite the engine there is literally a slug of hypergolic propellant that is fired into the combustion chamber, where it reacts hypergolically with the LOX and starts the reaction (if you want to REALLLY get specific, the TEA/TEB system is not Hypergolic it is Pyrophoric (it ignites when the temp is cold)). On the F91.1 upper there are 3 such slugs meaning the engine can be relight 3 times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn pads before the ignition of the main engines it is common to see sparklers. Those are not the primary ignition source of the engines. The primary source is either an electric sparker in the engine or a Hypergolic slug as discussed above. The Sparklers are there to burn off any escaping Fuel or oxidizer before it can \u0022pool\u0022 on the pad and pose an explosion hazard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of this I have to know because of the degree I am studying for (Aerospace Engineering), the rest I have learned from various sources like watching hours of NASA tv, John D Clark\u0027s book IGNITION.

Of course, there were safeguards: you had to enable several circuit breakers and activate some safety valves before you could start the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, most burns on Apollo were controlled by the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_PGNCS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo PGNCS\u003C/a\u003E computer. They would input the parameters of the burn (basically the XYZ orientation of the spacecraft, start time, and duration), and the computer would count down, point the spacecraft into the correct direction, and start and stop the burn accordingly. There was no throttle (there rarely is a throttle on rocket engines), so the duration of the burn controlled the dV that was imparted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays, modern spacecraft work pretty much in the same way. Burns are controlled by a computer. The role of the astronauts is to monitor the systems and input the burn parameters into the computer. Flying a spacecraft is much closer to using MechJeb than flying an aircraft with a stick and throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T12:30:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T12:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d imagine modern spacecraft are considerably simpler if comparable advances in aircraft are anything to go by.
