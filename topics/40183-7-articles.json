In the first mission of CommerzializationOfSpace pack i should dock two ships, i\u0027ve already done this, but Mission Controller don\u0027t think so. Is it a bug? Or maybe i\u0027m an idiot.

I have since fixed them since you showed this.. There is no longer a time restraint and now all docking in this pack are by themselves and there own Objective.. They really don\u0027t work well at the moment.. So making them simple docking objective should fix them.. Good Luck.. Its updated in the download for the Plugin.. And you should be all set.. If your on this same mission you will have to undock.. And dock again for it to stick I think..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood Luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink you guys are going to be pretty happy with the next version. .17 some things that we been working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe I have added a hardcore mode.. 40% reduction to payouts for you Hard Mode Addicts out there.
