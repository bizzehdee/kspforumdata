It\u0027s main features are automatically detecting which mods craft use (and creating a mod list for you) and a search that enables you to filter craft by what mods they use (or just list pure stock), part-count, VAB/SPH, specific science parts etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach craft has a page that you can customize with text, pics and vids and you can create custom groups of craft (hangars). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use CKAN you can download .ckan metafiles for craft (and now hangars) which tell the CKAN mod manager which mods it needs to install for that craft. You can also drop your installed-default.ckan file (found in the CKAN folder in KSP) on the mod filters part of the search interface and KerbalX will find craft that are compatible with the mods you have installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still adding features and improving existing things so if you want something particular or have other suggestions add it on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93548-KerbalX-com-craft-sharing-site-with-Auto-Mod-Detection-and-Search-By-Mod-feature\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eforum thread\u003C/a\u003E and I\u0027ll see what I can do.
