I attached a ship with a boatload of parachutes to a Class B asteroid and flew it in for an ocean landing. Recovered it and... no science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea ok it got a little contaminated in the ocean but I should get a little bit of science for that. Thus the suggestion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you guys add science reward for recovering an asteroid? Depending on the size of course and it could be single time or multiple time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to recover one IRL: attach a heat shield to it an a bunch of parachutes... fly it into the atmosphere, pop the chutes... and your science lab has a piece of ancient rock to study for years instead of fragments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T17:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince bringing a multi-ton mass of asteroid substance to an intact soft landing would be insanely improbable, it seems reasonable to me that there\u0027s no science to be gotten from something that shouldn\u0027t be possible in the first place. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T18:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, maybe an A?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shna_na","CreatedById":14950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T18:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re pretty easy to land, I flew a class C in straight from interplanetary space on a highly inclined orbit.
