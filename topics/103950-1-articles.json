For the greatest accuracy, you would first have to calculate each and every force change for each part at point and then add that force change back in... then act upon the physics. What likely happens is physics is serially or semi-serial (even 16 cores won\u0027t calculate every calculation at once) and acted upon after that calculation, the force propagation isn\u0027t entirely accurate and requires a recursive approach which feeds back force data to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another method. You can use a matrix to model the entire ship. This gives easy SSE capable code and allows one to write an algorithm to reduce the matrix and make it even faster. Does a part weigh only 0.01T and the ship weighs 100T? That is an entire line of calculations that would need to be done for either method, but can be removed as \u0022physically insignificant\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, we can turn these calculations into something more sparse which also has methods of greatly improving calculations on a computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are issues with simply doing it straight forth; (i.e. a single matrix with a set of \u0022dampening\u0022 \u002B angle). That would assume a fixed structure that is non-changing. For the most part, we WANT to use a single calculated matrix the whole way through, but we can also improve the model by adding on state variables. We can optimize this by considering what is \u0022physically insignificant\u0022 so that we aren\u0027t calculating the effective change due to the energy held by a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m getting at is while changing the COM might be fairly simple, just to get small parts to act right... this is really dependent on SCALE. A 1000T single-stage rocket isn\u0027t going to care about the 5T can you put on top. At the same time that can becomes much more significant at 100T or even 20T. I could be over complicating things, we could use mass ratios and adjust the COM... but I also think that, physically speaking, there is a lot a hard core mathematician could do to optimize while maintaining general assumptions that don\u0027t result in too much inaccuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T07:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Fel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large part of the fun of playing KSP is that a vessel is treated as a \u0022collection of parts flying in close formation\u0022.

So the actions of the 5t upon the 1000t might be removed (or, more accurately, the actions of the 5t load upon the engine, or other parts far enough away as to have a very small effect that can be ignored)... but the actions of the 1000t mass pushing the 5t mass ARE calculated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, they\u0027ll be calculated unless the mass is ductaped on with space tape and the effects of the state-variables are negligible. (Basically, initial assumption, the part doesn\u0027t move and the joints are unbreakable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis matrix would have to be calculated each time a change occurs (i.e. losing a part, or manually changing flows), but for every frame that no change occurs it could improve how fast the physics calculations occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, yes... in the end you start sacrificing accuracy here and there for speed. Oddities can easily pop up when you\u0027re not directly calculating something and instead relying on a model; and implementation would be hell and any speed gains would be highly dependent on how well implemented it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust insanity for thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
