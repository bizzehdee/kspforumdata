In KSP term, that would mean this is an inline solar panel assembly instead of a radial attached solar panel.\n\nWhat I can\u0027t see, from the diagram they have, is how they are going to deploy the solar panels. On one of the diagram, it apparently shows a set up where the adapter/solar panel assembly docks to the side of a craft and deploy the solar panels up and down, but that doesn\u0027t seems terribly efficient.

I can imagine that there would be more than one set of solar panels into it, so that it could essentially cover the outside of the craft with solar panels. Basically, it might look something like the following (and admittedly horrible) ASCII drawing:\n\n| = Solar Panel\n\n[ ] = Fueltank/Assorted \u0022Stuff\u0022 in Main Fuselage\n\n{ } = Solar Panel Stowage\n\n| [ ] |\n\n| [ ] |\n\n| [ ] |\n\n { }\n\n| [ ] |\n\n| [ ] |\n\n| [ ] |\n\nShould be something like that. I hope.\n\nP.S. I have absolutely no technical knowledge, and just went off of the pictures and a quick skim of the background.

Your application should include at least one embodiment of that concept. In other words you need to describe at least one way of getting the concept to work and describe it in sufficient detail that a suitably skilled person could read the patent and also get it to work. The key words there are \u0027suitably skilled person\u0027. In principle they\u0027re included so that your patent application can take some things as read and doesn\u0027t need to describe absolutely everything in mind-numbing detail (which is good because they\u0027re not exactly a riveting read at the best of times, and I say this as somebody who\u0027s worked with them for over 15 years).\n\nUnfortunately, how much you should take as read is a matter of interpretation. I\u0027ve seen brick-thick chemical patents that reference Pauling\u0027s \u0027The Nature of the Chemical Bond\u0027 and at the other absurd extreme, I\u0027ve seen patents that pretty much do just describe the concept. Sometimes that can be enough - if the invention really is coming up with the concept and the implementation (once the concept has been pointed out) is entirely obvious to the skilled reader, then the patent will be OK. \n\nThat might sound a bit contradictory but how often have you looked at something and thought \u0027I can\u0027t believe nobody has done that before\u0027? You can instantly see how it works but figuring out that it would work at all was the clever bit."}]}
