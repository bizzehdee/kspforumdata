My personal view on this is that yes, there\u0027s certainly life out there. The probability for any given star system to harbor life is extraordinarily slim, but the sheer amount of stars in the universe ensures that it\u0027s happened millions upon millions of times across the observable universe. In fact, there\u0027s probably a decent chance that at least one of the systems within a hundred light years contains a habitable planet with life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then you must consider that not all planets that start out habitable remain habitable forever. For every Earth there are probably hundreds - if not millions - of planets that began harboring life but became uninhabitable for any number of reasons, cutting short the process that got us this far along. Considering the rocky past that Earth has, this is not hard to imagine. Then there\u0027s the question of sentient tool using life... For all the planets harboring life for long enough, what are the chances that a sentient tool using species arises? And for how long will they exist. I think our own case study here on earth is showing that it has a very high chance of being ridiculously short. (I am always reminded of the comic I saw somewhere of the Earth sitting in the doctor\u0027s office feeling ill, and the doctor says \u0022You just have a case of humans.

In the afterglow of the successful encounter, before remembering the old mountaineers\u0027 credo that reaching the summit is only half the job, I felt content to relax and read a book and sip my coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore long, things started to go quite badly. A micrometeorite punctured a fuel tank. I was quickly losing the precious fuel I would need for the return burn. I quickly began a panic burn to attempt a partial transfer back toward Kerbin. However, the tiny rock had also clipped a critical sensor, and my burn was sending me off in a random direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFear and anxiety pervaded. The cabin stank of sweat and vomit. I was on an accidental escape trajectory that would send me toward the Kalpha Keti system, most likely to my doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen a shocking thing happened. While I was staring longingly out the viewport at a receeding Eve, the face of a huge, pink-skinned Kerbinid appeared, blocking my view! I was dumbfounded. As the face receded, allowing a broader view, what I saw only heightened my fear. It was a giant space-bound Kerbinid, though whether an organism or a robot I could not tell. It seemed to be grinning at me. Not a benevolent grin (\u0022Don\u0027t worry, Jeb...I\u0027m here to help!\u0022) but an apathetic grin (\u0022Lookit that little green bugger! Ain\u0027t he somethin\u0027?\u0022). The indifference was humbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe giant then \u0027reached out\u0027 with a colossal arm as if to grab my ship. I cowered, wishing I had a closet in which I could lock myself. The hand extended a finger (GAWD! There were FIVE FINGERS!) and applied what, for such a large being, must have been an infinitesimal force. The effect on my tiny ship was as if I had ignited a Skipper engine attached at some random angle. I was sent hurtling, spinning, sickeningly, and further off course than before. Now I was sure to be marooned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoments passed while the giant seemed to be caught up in some thought. It turned it\u0027s head to one side and transmitted a message to some unseen entity at an unknown distance, using some kind of laser that caused my ship to vibrate with the sound of the message:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022DAMN YOU, CAT! GET THE HECK AWAY FROM MY KEYBOARD!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no idea what the message contained, but the tone sounded like a warning. It was frighteningly cryptic. I had hoped that, with such power at it\u0027s disposal, the giant might take pity on me and help me back to Kerbin, but the warning message left me so shaken I had forgotten all such hope. And it was probably for the best. The next message the giant indifferently transmitted left me feeling empty and small:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, well. I guess I\u0027ll have to terminate that mission and start another.
