For the record, your original idea of having all the former KSC staff disguised as the tourists would have been perfect and would have made it all clear, even though the real tourists were great fun ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNo worries, actually I think putting Team Bobak in the plane would have better, but I wanted to go ahead with posting the comic and did not give myself time to do the custom artwork I would have needed to do...plan was to make a \u0022Kabob Kerman\u0022 and somehow get a helmet on him in the IVA view, to hide the hair. Oh well. Don\u0027t worry though, sometimes when an airlock closes a cargo bay opens--I have some ideas for more fun given the status of the tourists going forward ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To be honest, the very beginning, where Herr Wernher was talking about how impossible it is to get from the surface of Eve, was practically a foreshadowing of them having to get somebody out of there. \n\u003E The Chekhov\u0027s Gun hint about the Dipperkraft - the actual trope implies the object (originally - hunting rifle, not really meant to be pointed at people) being used the way originally not intended (from the characters\u0027 point of view). The only way to work like that in this case was landing of the unlandable ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E And, of course, the Order Zero - I was suspecting that it is what it actually is (maybe not the way it was introduced) for quite a while.\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, everybody running to KSC2 was a good surprise (on the other hand, M7 can launch from anywhere if it\u0027s meant to launch from Eve). Looks like Wernher had this planned for quite a while. And that\u0027s the answer to the question who is really in charge!\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh well, still brilliant beginning, and now that being Kerbal for the purpose of the script is kinda mostly over... now the actual big mission the Kerbal way may start!\n\u003E \n\u003E And what\u0027s the crew capacity of M7? 5 Kerbals? Holey Moho! Wasn\u0027t 1 Kerbal EAV already quite a challenge before? I definitely was expecting a 2-Kerbal ascent vehicle just to pick the guys up. But looks like there will be quite a trip on Eve. \n\u003E \n\u003E Love these series and can\u0027t wait to see where it goes now!\n\nThanks! Well, of course you\u0027ve been correct--saying something\u0027s impossible on Page 1 in an adventure story is a pretty good indication it\u0027s at least going to be attempted ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd yes, the M7 really can carry 5. Remains to be seen whether it gets down and up, of course. I originally designed it with just the crew cabin and a probe core as I only foresaw needing to carry a maximum of four passengers. But I couldn\u0027t stomach having a probe fly the thing, even if I waved hands and said Jeb was really at the controls. So I added the Mk1, and like the look a lot. We\u0027ll see if that extra mass costs me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAppreciate the comments, thanks!\n\nETA and BTW since the barratry discussion I\u0027ve been watching \u0022Hunt for Red October\u0022 bit by bit, much of it with my 10 year old son. He\u0027s completely entranced, and now I have \u0022Dosvidanya Rodina\u0022 playing in my head as the background music when the Mortingale launches. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-13T00:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T01:36:57Z","Content":"I have to say that Eve: Order Zero is probably the most entertaining and thoughtful Kerbal fan work I\u0027ve seen... perhaps eve.
