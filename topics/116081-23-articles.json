The only way to work like that in this case was landing of the unlandable ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, the Order Zero - I was suspecting that it is what it actually is (maybe not the way it was introduced) for quite a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, everybody running to KSC2 was a good surprise (on the other hand, M7 can launch from anywhere if it\u0027s meant to launch from Eve).

Holey Moho! Wasn\u0027t 1 Kerbal EAV already quite a challenge before? I definitely was expecting a 2-Kerbal ascent vehicle just to pick the guys up.
