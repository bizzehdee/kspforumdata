I was testing out the Taurus command module with a couple of Kerbals aboard, basically just a medium length XL fuel tank and engine (kind of a large version of Mercury\u0027s Little Joe), and splashing down in the ocean to confirm how many parachutes I needed (I went with 6). Testing was going well, when I got the \u0022brilliant\u0022 idea of using the abort rockets aboard the Taurus module to slow down the very last of the decent, Soyuz style. I had already slowed down to about 6.8m/s, well slow enough to splashdown, when I hid the spacebar to activate the rockets. The abort rockets of course did EXACTLY what they were designed to do and sent the capsule soaring up into the air, leaving me wondering \u0022why the heck did I think it would do anything different\u0022? In case you haven\u0027t made a mistake like this yourself, if you get a positive vertical velocity while under parachutes, those parachutes disapear. So here I was, flying up into the air, parachutes gone, no way to slow my decent, with death imminent and seemingly unavoidable. The only thing I could think of to rescue the two Kerbals, was to send one of them outside the soon to crash capsule, on a probable suicide mission, repack the chutes, and redeploy them all before crashing into the very quickly approaching ocean. Hudvan Kermin bravely volunteered to go outside (he may have just been trying to get away from Philmund\u0027s screaming), and while hanging on the side of the capsule repacked the first chute. With the ocean approaching VERY quickly at this point I didn\u0027t want to wait to deploy the chute, so I redeployed it with Hudvan still hanging on. I thought Hudvan was going to go flying off the side to his death, but he actually managed to hang on. With the first chute deployed, and the capsule now slowing down, the process was repeated with all but one of the chutes before safely splashing down in the ocean. Not surprisingly, Hudvan did come flying off the capsule and into the water once the capsule splashed down, but it didn\u0027t matter because both he and Philmund inside the capsule where alive and even though he couldn\u0027t get back inside (the hatch was underwater), they could be recovered seperately. I wish I had screenshots of it all, but naturally I was a little too busy clicking on things and panicking (I may have actually held my breath though all of it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T04:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlew to the pyramids on Kerbin.

There it deployed the build station and became the first parts to add to the station. Second a mun base was deployed on an ore field. This base would launch ore from the surface to rendezvous with the build station. Aiding me here was the fact that my engineers discovered the components of solid rocket fuel within the mun soil near the base. Some refinement later and we could launch solid booster equipped vessels into orbit. The kerbin ground teams had to ship up a tug to grab the raw launched material and drag it to the final construction site. Since there are no lagrange points in KSP this is harder than it seems. The tug is equipped with powerful ion engines to make this process a little more efficient. It wasn\u0027t efficient enough though. I set out to deploy a second base in a location where Kethane and Ore were close together if not on the same node. Once such place was found where and ore field and kethane field were adjacent. The second base was deployed there. A mere 5 minute ride out to the kethane field is all it takes to get fuel for the launches. Thus the base you see in the imgur was born. It\u0027s not without some drawbacks that I solved on the way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launchpad had to be equipped with outriggers for stabilization and landing gear.
