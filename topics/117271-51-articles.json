I always thought that if El Quicko could handle missiles better it would be the strongest plane. Is that against Anduril Mk1 or Mk2? Did you need to angle the wings on your plane?\n\u003E \n\nThis is against the Anduril Mk2, wings not angled. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s got better at missile dodging, but the main changes I\u0027ve made since it got comprehensively slaughtered in the tournament have been simply reducing the fuel load and removing the sidewinders (which seem to have made the AI delay missile avoidance whilst trying to get a sidewinder lock and caused it to try and fight at long range where it\u0027s more vulnerable to missiles). Seeing as at the moment it only comes to 28 points though, I\u0027m thinking of adding tonnes of countermeasures to further boost it\u0027s missile avoidance capabilities.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After 7 more fights, a clear winner still hasn\u0027t emerged:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 more guns kills for the El Quicko.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 more missile kill for the Anduril Mk2\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 guns kill for the Anduril Mk1 - the El Quicko was travelling straight to gain speed and got shot to pieces.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 more collisions.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **The overall score is:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anduril Mk2 **5 - 5** El Quicko X\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With the best fighter obviously being Unity\u0027s collider system with an outstanding 6 kills.\n\u003E \n\nSo the fighters look to be overall pretty much equal, with the Anduril having a clear advantage in terms of missile kills but the El Quicko winning every single tight maneuvering gun fight.\n\nIf the El Quicko could dodge missiles better, or the Anduril could somehow keep it far enough away to avoid entering a maneuvering gunfight, this could change, however.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EmKIc/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-03T17:58:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2016 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T18:57:26Z","Content":"Have you tried swapping out the Tail Connector parts with Advanced Nosecone A\u0027s?

It would make a nice missile in between the AIM-9 and the AIM-120.

Heat seeking versions would be cool although they would be for ground targets only. It would be fun to see them launched against planes though. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nWell I got them to work! I made a Maverick Type R (for RADAR) and it works just like the AIM-120\u0027s.....just alot slower (375m/s versus 600m/s for the sidewinder), lower thrust at boost, but longer boost stage, and a long 15 second cruise burn at a slightly higher thrust than the standard Maverick (think more propellant, but slower burning for a longer burn). Some planes may be able to outrun them, but I\u0027m guessing alot won\u0027t be able to....but it would be fun to watch them try! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\nBUT, they have a very wide FOV when targeting and they move slow enough for decent maneuvering. I rigged them for low explosive damage over a wide area (think fragmentation damage, 45 metre radius). First hit will knock weaker parts off, but most of the damaged plane will turn red (hence simulating alot of frag damage) and the plane is really fragile. After that just bumping it will pretty much finish it off.  \n\nAs for making them readily different, I inverted the colours so they are mostly black vs white.  \n\nI\u0027ll get some pics later. It\u0027s 20 minutes to one AM up here and I\u0027m done.  \n\nEDIT: After doing some historical research the Maverick missile was never RADAR guided, so I converted it to Infared Imaging (Heat seeking) and it acts just like a Sidewinder, just slower. It does seem to track a bit better than the Sidewinder, but only by a small margin.  \n\nSince the Maverick missile was designed to be Air-to-Ground only, I\u0027m going to consult with someone that knows the code better to make it a Air-to-Ground missile again, if possible.  \n\nAnother way is to use the standard Maverick and slave the laser guidance to RADAR, which from what I\u0027ve read, we can do that now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T23:32:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T11:51:02Z","Content":"[@Redshift OTF](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78679-redshift-otf/) The Anduril Mk2\u0027s damage resistance is insane.

If your planes both have equal points worth of weapons, number them in whichever order you prefer. This naming scheme is to make tournament organization easier to understand.**\n\n**EDIT: Plane AI must be configured such that the minimum altitude is between 1000m, and the default altitude is 2000m. Planes which do not abide by this will be edited to do so.** \n\n**LANDING GEAR MUST BE PERPENDICULAR TO \u0027FORWARD\u0027 ON YOUR PLANE.**  \n\n**FORWARD IS DESIGNATED BY THE DIRECTION THE RADOME POINTS IN.** \n\n**ALL COCKPITS MUST BE POINTED FORWARD.** \n\n**ALL GUNS MUST BE POINTED FORWARD.** \n\n**WHEN SITTING ON THE RUNWAY, YOUR PLANE\u0027S DIRECTION INDICATOR ON THE NAVBALL MUST BE PERPENDICULAR TO THE HORIZON SUCH THAT IT BISECTS THE BLUE AND ORANGE SECTIONS OF THE NAVBALL.  (This means it can not start sitting on its engines with its radome pointed straight up.  It also means that your plane can not have angled landing gear, it must be flat.  In other words, the front of it must be pointed at 90 degrees relative to the ground and sky.)** \n\n**KerbPaint, along with numerous other visual mods will be installed for the tournament!  So if you want to paint your planes red, blue or whatever then go right ahead!** \n\n**If you would like to fly a custom flag as well, then provide the .png file for it when you submit your planes and I\u0027ll attach it to your planes.**  \n\n**IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR REQUIRE CLARIFICATION, POST IN THE THREAD.** \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T00:09:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CreativeCombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:56:37Z","Content":"![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\nThis is gonna be fun!!
