SSTO!?","CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:42:32Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:42:32Z","Content":"To help learn Interstellar, and so that I have a craft that can go anywhere, from anywhere, I needed something that can refuel. Would this make an interesting challenge? Possibly, as refuelling in Interstellar, is very different from the Kethane type mods.\n\nSo the goal is simple, make a rocket/spaceship that can refuel almost anywhere and fly anywhere in the Kerbin system. With some rules to make it a challenge, and some points for special designs.\n\nMods allowed are Interstellar (any current version) and any flight or building assist (mechjeb or engineer etc).\n\nFirst rule: Under 150 parts. We do not want something too big or computer intensive. Bonus points for under 100 parts.\n\nSecond rule: Must be able to refuel and fly to another planet/moon. There must be no restriction on what planet the craft can get to. So if you pack only Alumina rockets... bring enough fuel for a Jool trip and return to the mun! But a better option is to run off multiple fuel types for in situ refuelling.\n\nThird rule: The craft must launch from Kerbin as a SSTO... ah, did I forget to mention this bit?!\n\nForth rule: Vacuum mode in the plasma thrusters does not count for this challenge (but the part can be used with other fuels).\n\nFifth rule: No beamed microwave power. Unless the transmitter is taken with you and docked/undocked in orbit. It must also be taken with you to the next destination if used (so no parking it in solar orbit! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ).\n\nOther than that, Interstellar as a mod does allow for some interesting options. Points are mainly just for fun, and to set some interesting goals for designs.\n\nPoint scoring as follows:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E STTO from Kerbin and return, for refuelling at KSC: **Your doing it wrong** = 1 point\n\u003E \n\u003E All 3 types of docking port: **Adaptable** = 3 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Unmanned: **HAL** = 7 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Manned: **Along for the ride** = 10 points\n\u003E \n\u003E 0.05 TWR is all that is available for transfers: **Asleep** = -15 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Above 0.05 TWR for transfer: **No time to wait** = 15 points\n\u003E \n\u003E No Control Surfaces: **Plane Stupid** = 25 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Use Thermal Rockets: **Hot Stuff** = 35 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Use 4 or more resource sensor parts: **Spider Sense** = 44 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Spaceplane (must take off/land horizontal): **Plane and Simple** = 50 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Use 5 types of rocket fuel: **Over engineered** = 55 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Crew space of 4 or more: **Room for a View** = 75 points\n\u003E \n\u003E 100 parts or less: **Lightweight** = 100 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Bring a rover with you: **Sight Seeing Tour** = 125 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Push off the Atmosphere with Magnetic Nozzles: **IronMan** = 150 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Only use chemical rockets (no thermal/magnetic/ion etc): **Classical** = 175 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Can land in water: **Voyage Home**: = 180 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Cool looking craft: **Rule of Cool** = 200 points, give yourself this one!\n\u003E \n\u003E Only 2 types of engine: **Keep it Simple Sunshine** = 202 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Use only ion/plasma drives: **Greased Lightning** = 225 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Do not use Antimatter: **Does not Matter** = 250 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Refuel *anywhere* (that has resources): **Resourceful** = 275 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Have lander/launch craft and orbital dock/fuel/transfer stage as separable craft (Apollo style), but still SSTO!: **Engineering Miracle** = 300 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Special bonus points:\n\u003E \n\u003E Use only nuclear fuels: **Radical Design** = 1260 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Over 9k DV: **It\u0027s Over 9000!** = 9001 points\n\u003E \n\u003E Use quantum vacuum for fuel: **Forgot the Rules** = negative value of all your points!\n\u003E \n\u003E Needs no \u0022fuel\u0022 (no idea if possible): **Flying on Hopes and Dreams** = Infinite points!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nMy entry is called \u0022David\u0022, and racks up 9738 points.

If you can think of anything to add to that list, I\u0027ll add it in if you can hit it. Like \u0022do not use X\u0022 or similar, if it sounds good enough I\u0027ll score it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
