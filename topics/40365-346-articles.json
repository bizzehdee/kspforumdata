You can attach reactors directly to thermal rocket engines, and you can attach reactors with generators to run plasma engines. Power networks are not required, but the work put into setting one up definitely pays off. Reactors can get very heavy and having a power network up allows you to use their power without any of their weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Might I suggest watching the excellent Power Network tutorial video made by WaveFunctionP which can be found in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76917-Video-Tutorial-KSP-Interstellar-Power-Networks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T22:34:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rabada\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T22:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iforgotthis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Iforgotthis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know little about interstellar, and I\u0027ve been wary of getting it because I don\u0027t feel confident enough with maintaining a whole power network.

This isn\u0027t particularly realistic, especially as it means the next impact under otherwise identical circumstances will only provide half the data, but it\u0027s how things are now. However, there is a bug in how transmissions work, where timewarping does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E speed them up - it does, however, speed up how quickly you recover electric charge. My Eve seismic probes had a single RTG for power generation, and no batteries to speak of, but at either 100 or 50x time warp, I was making more ec than I was using. Yes, it\u0027s not ideal to rely on a bug, but even the smallest fission reactor on an unupgraded reactor provides far more than enough electricity to transmit the entire thing. I can understand not wanting to slap a reactor on a probe for the purpose of transmitting a few reports, but the reason no one can give you a definite answer for how much power a given impact result will take to transmit is because no one can predict offhand how much data a given impact will generate. Each planet has a different pool, and both the number and the placement of your recorders will determine together how scientifically useful the impacts are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFractal: Are there plans to set the seismic transmissions to a set size?
