I just launched the game went to settings and the input. Everything works fine except for characters, I think there is a workaround by mapping the hat stick to keys and those keys to the character movements, but that is something I have not done. It really makes driving rovers better since I can turn by twisting the stick and use the controlling pods torque in the roll axis to prevent tip overs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
