I might be wrong, but if you downloaded ksp as a zip file (not the installer thing), I think what you described (the \u0022black screen with an orange rectangle at the bottom\u0022) is a result of directly clicking the \u0022ksp.app\u0022 and not following the aforementioned procedure. To be fair, I have no idea why that needs to be done (I\u0027m not a computer scientist) but it worked for me (after a lot of trial and error) when I first started playing ksp a long time ago. By the way, have you downloaded and opened ksp v1.12.3 in the same way as \u00A0you did in v1.7.2? Hope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-26T17:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s what works for me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpen the KSP folder in a finder window.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLocate the KSP app. \u00A0This is the file you click on to run, and has a Kerbal icon next to it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag that app file to the desktop, and drop it on the desktop.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNext, drag the file from the desktop back to the folder where KSP is located. \u00A0(Right back to where you found it..)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDouble click the app, it should start just fine now.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou only need to do that the first time you run a new download of KSP, after doing that procedure once you won\u2019t need to do it again. \u00A0I have no idea why this works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jora","CreatedById":223057,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-27T15:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Both of the above solutions worked.\u00A0 Thank you!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
