At its core is a OKTO2 attached to a Reaction Wheel (it was called a SAS Module back then), with Structural plates below that. That\u0027s a key element of rover design IMHO - you got to encase the crucial bits in parts with high impact tolerances (panels and girders). If you don\u0027t, you risk having a catastrophic accident if (when) the rover flips over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember - build them low, build them wide, SAS on, drive in Docking Mode.
