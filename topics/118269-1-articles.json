After playing for a few hours today I went to spend my science points. Upon entering the science building I found that there were no icons to click. I zoomed in and out and moved around on the screen but there is only the blue grid background and none of the icons that are usually there. I tried re installing and loading my save file but encountered the same problem. Does anyone know how to fix this? MODS installed: KIS, KAS, and KER. I have not changed any mods or moved any files recently. I\u0027m using the most recent version of KSP.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
