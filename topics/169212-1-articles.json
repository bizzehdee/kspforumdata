The good news is, if that\u0027s the only thing that\u0027s wrong, it\u0027s easy enough to fix unless you\u0027re completely out of fuel.\u00A0 Just a very small normal/antinormal burn at the ascending or descending node to correct it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possible problem is that even if your apoapsis and periapsis are at the right distances, they could be in the wrong place(argument of periapsis). Check the orbit in map view and make sure that everything lines up correctly there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, make sure your probe has ALL the required parts.\u00A0 There\u0027s been plenty of times when I finally got a probe launched, into the correct orbit etc, and had everything else correct...only to realize that the contract required an accelerometer or something and I hadn\u0027t put on on there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, make sure it\u0027s actually showing up as a probe if that\u0027s what the contract requires. Mostly only an issue if I\u0027m using certain mods, but there\u0027s been times when a contract failed to complete because it required a PROBE, but the game was classifying mine as a RELAY.
