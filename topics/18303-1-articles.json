Eventually I just had the other 3 boosters drop off and kept tanks instead, that way I had the 3 main engines (center of the 2nd stage) into orbit. Though the problem being now I have that whole center section stuck in orbit each time I launch one of these.. that\u0027s a lot of space junk.. but at least it\u0027s big chunks instead of a lot of little bullets. My next test will be to see if I can strip it down a little and bring a new radio telescope to minimus using the same inversion landing I used last time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T20:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell it certainly looks nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NetBlitzer","CreatedById":14551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T20:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice launcher and lander!

Remember, space is VERY large. If you use a parking orbit of 70km, that gives you over 4200km of circumference before a conflict may arise, and that\u0027s not counting the rough altitude judgement, or perhaps the slight heading error. You second stage is only around 6x6x10 METERS large, so you\u0027re not taking up too much space.

Either way it seems it went fine in the end. The inversion uses 10 RCS thrusters which is adequate for Minimus, I don\u0027t think it\u0027d work well for Mun though, you would need quite a lot more for a lander my size. I was rather pleased that I didn\u0027t have to do massive modifications to the lander to get this done. I stripped the extra antennae and landing feet from the tanks but that\u0027s about it.. even that was probably unnecessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way back I managed to get a perfect polar orbit on Mun, but decided not to land, which was a good idea since I barely had enough to get back when I finally landed in the sea... (though I\u0027d rather have landed on land...) I think Bill was happy to make it back what ever the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy space junk isn\u0027t that regular,.. one problem with these mid stages is they\u0027re 9 fueltanks a 3waycoupler, and engines, They\u0027re also in a steep orbit because they provide a lot of the force to get to final orbit. Luckily, yes, space is huge. The odds of hitting one are pretty rare. One time I did have the game stop to 1x speed because a chunk came within 100m of me, I didn\u0027t even have that much out there!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T21:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Znath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
