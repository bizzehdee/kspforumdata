It seems pretty much ideal for practice. I\u0027d recommend to start with something easy like a fuel-tank and do it from scratch to finish to find your work-flow. From what I can see you did no unwrapping or textureing or unity-stuff yet, right? I think it\u0027s vital to know the entire process from start to finish because somethings you can only learn by encountering them further down the road. Every step has its own pitfalls that make some parts harder to do than they appear at first (if not impossible at all). With every new part you start, it becomes easier because you get a better idea of what is important and what not. It\u0027s not like \u0027you do the model and the modelling part is done\u0027, it\u0027s more of a back and forth between modelling, unwrapping and texturing. For example, you texture an area and suddenly you have an idea how this would look better with a different shape on the model, so it\u0027s back to modelling, new unwrap and texture again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I personally found it much easier to do models I came up with. Requests can be easy but can also be very tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-13T08:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA possible relatively simple model to create would be a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2009/09/14/lightcraft-a-laser-push-to-orbit/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elight craft\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lightcraft1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022342\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/lightcraft1.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022light-propulsion-smallcraft2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022322\u0022 src=\u0022https://s.hswstatic.com/gif/light-propulsion-smallcraft2.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nave.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.ecojoven.com/02122000/nave.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022296\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-15T18:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223397991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528812949\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183478\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nivee~\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E6\u200E/\u200E12\u200E/\u200E2018 at 10:15 AM, Nivee~ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello!
