[album](http://imgur.com/a/etXOP)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Rules:**\n\n**Rule 1: Don\u0027t take fuel from, do damage, occupy a docking port on, or move ships without permission from the ship\u0027s owner.** \n\n(You may want to add a few words in the player communications that says who owns it and what people are allowed to do with it.)\n\n**Rule 2:** **Maximum 50 parts per player per craft\\* and maximum 300 parts per craft.**\n\nUnfortunately, if a lot of people have a lot of crafts with a lot of parts in one area, it causes a decrease in framerate and simulation speed.\n\nSo, for example, if one person sets down a base core on Minmus, then no one/no module can add more than 50 parts per turn to within that base\u0027s area (e.g. a 20-part craft and a 30-part craft), and if there are already 300 parts in that area, you cannot add more.\n\nAn \u0022area\u0022 consists of a 2.5km (craft loading distance) radius around a craft.\n\n**\\* \u002250 parts per player per craft\u0022 is recommended and is polite for public stations and bases. If necessary, it can be disregarded for private or remote crafts.**\n\n**Rule 3: Time warping.**\n\nIdeally, you would finish all time-sensitive maneuvers before handing over the save. If this is not possible, notify subsequent users in the player communications.\n\nIf a rule is broken, the save file from before the offending user\u0027s offense will be used.\n\nWe can have projects (\u0022Alright guys, let\u0027s build an Eve water base!\u0022), but no one would be required to participate in that project.\n\nQuicksaving and quickloading is allowed.\n\nCheating (editing save files, hyperedit, debug menu) is prohibited **except for changing the names of kerbals.**\n\n**Participation Schedule.** \n\nThese two systems are the ones that work the best , based on my research, and we have not yet fully settled on one:\n\n**System 1: Calendar.**\n\nEach user has 2 days to do what they want with the persistent file. A calendar is used so that people can sign up for certain days.\n\nUsers are not be allowed to sign up for another turn until they have completed the session they are signed up for.\n\nPros: Users cannot keep save file for extended amounts of time and prevent other users from participating.\n\nCons: Possible extensive waiting period for large numbers of users.\n\n***(Currently in use)*** **System 2: Free.**\n\nEach user can grab the persistent file whenever they want. The time limit for keeping this file is 2 days. A user cannot participate multiple times before everyone has participated in the current cycle.\n\nPros: Decreased waiting period.\n\nCons: Requires shared folder.\n\nIf the time limit for either system is violated, the user should be skipped and the save file from before the offending user\u0027s turn can be used.\n\nIf no one uses a save file for 72 hours straight, a new cycle starts. Unused turns are not carried over.\n\n**File Sharing.**\n\nWe are using Google Drive. Shared folder: [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B99mIHx34OkjSXBvdlBMejRDWm8\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B99mIHx34OkjSXBvdlBMejRDWm8\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nThe above link should give your account editing permissions for the shared folder. If not, contact Thunderous Echo immediately.\n\nWhen you begin your turn, change the Current User file\u0027s content to your name and estimate a finish time. If the file has someone else\u0027s name in it, it is currently someone else\u0027s turn and you should wait until they are done.\n\nDownload the save file and put it in your KSP saves folder. **If you have any problems downloading or using a save file, contact Thunderous Echo immediately.**\n\n**Read through the** **Player Communications.**\n\nWhen you finish your turn, change the Current User text file\u0027s content to \u0022No One\u0022. **If someone has a reservation, contact that player.** Upload your save file to Drive, but do not delete any older ones!\n\n**When uploading save files, always use .zip format because certain machines do not like .rar**\n\n**Mission Logs.**\n\n**The minimum report required of your turn is a list of what you did and a picture or craft file of each craft on the launch pad or near the beginning of the flight.**\n\nBut extra images are nice and videos are even better.\n\n**Reservations.**\n\nYou can reserve the next position in the Current User File. **This means that when the current player finishes, he/she/shklee will tell you when they are done, and if you are available, you have dibs on the next turn.**\n\n**Mods.**\n\nTo be open to be users, the save files (when resubmitted to the shared folder) should not contain any modded parts, but usage of all mods is permitted.\n\nThis means you should terminate any crafts that contain modded parts before handing off the save file.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Osprey\n\u003E \n\u003E Spartwo\n\u003E \n\u003E SelectHalfling\n\u003E \n\u003E Robotengineer\n\u003E \n\u003E Godit\n\u003E \n\u003E Monopropellant\n\u003E \n\u003E GregroxMun\n\u003E \n\u003E jman508\n\u003E \n\u003E Avera9eJoe\n\u003E \n\u003E TheXRuler\n\u003E \n\u003E Thunderous Echo\n\u003E \n\u003E Tapejara\n\u003E \n\u003E Musil\n\u003E \n\u003E Starwhip\n\u003E \n\u003E monstah\n\u003E \n\u003E RAINCRAFTER\n\u003E \n\u003E AlexinTokyo\n\u003E \n\u003E Alchemist\n\u003E \n\u003E bakanando\n\u003E \n\u003E Xannari Ferrows\n\u003E \n\u003E dharak1\n\u003E \n\u003E Yukon0009\n\u003E \n\u003E Asharad\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T04:04:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunderous Echo**"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T05:11:30Z","Content":"Huh, interesting.
