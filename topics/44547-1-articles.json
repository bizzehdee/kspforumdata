So unhappy my face turned upright. My kerbals successfully landed on duna after playing for a week. While I\u0027ve been my friends instructer to the game, I\u0027ve looked how nasa got to mars. replicated that and got good results. I never sent a probe there, only kerbals ever went to duna. none of the kerbals got lost. I had enough fuel for corrections. I have one armed missile ship in orbit protecting the tiny lander on duna going to be our new lander base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I have over 21 kerbals on a ship heading to duna. 10 will go to duna, And 11 will go to eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm really surprised I got to duna without going to minmus or mun.
