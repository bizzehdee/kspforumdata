The acceleration was much more significant than that. When I finally blew up at around 8 km altitude, I was on a Kerbin escape trajectory and going well over 4,000 m/s. The effect seemed to get worse the further down I fell into the atmo. Luckily I had a quicksave before reentering so I was able to try again several times, doing this and that differently, but still experiencing the issue. I even tried firing my engines retrograde but that actually seemed to make the problem worse (i.e. craft would speed up even more despite burning retro). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003ECuriously enough, the problem seemed to fix itself by extending my landing gear (medium sized landing struts) before reentering, so I suspect this was some phantom force caused by the gear clipping slightly into the body of the lander (the \u201Cbutt\u201D of the lander to which the legs were attached was a Mk2-Mk1 adapter, which is slanted, so the legs had to clip slightly into it in order to deploy with the \u201Cfeet\u201D parallel to the ground; I don\u2019t have a screenshot at the moment, sorry).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EAnyway, the problem was solved in this instance and I was able to land safely but I still wanted to post here in case others or I have this problem again (or in case someone wants to explore this as a Kraken Drive possibility!).
