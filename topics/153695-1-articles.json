The two giant hexagons on its side probably serve some purpose,but it is difficult to tell what. It is propelled great distances with a piece of technology known as the Hyper-Edit Drive. \u00A0Therefore, it has no need for an engine that can take it to orbit, or anywhere, really.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228RJ6WaU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8RJ6WaU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, the engine behind it can send the ship places, as long as you remain in the same planetary system and don\u0027t intend on landing anything larger than Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock X-wing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn response to the new threat, the Kerbal rebellion has produced a new starfighter of their own:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bPFCWqe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bPFCWqe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing four afterburners, it can launch at a pretty high angle, as well as climb almost to space.

It is quite common to completely lose control, but the afterburners can reverse course quite rapidly, and without losing too much altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228WTfuun.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8WTfuun.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fighters have used Hyper-Edit Drive to get to Orbit of Laythe. Perhaps there will be a big battle between the one TIE fighter and the one X-wing.
