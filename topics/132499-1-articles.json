orbit of Ike.\u00A0 then I sent it back up to the main vehicle I used to get everything from kerbin to duna/ike.\u00A0 So I sent over a kerbal, collected all the data from the probe and returned to the vehicle.\u00A0 When i tried to board, it says that it would have to dump a bunch of my data.\u00A0 I don\u0027t understand.\u00A0 Is there a limit to the amount of data that can be stored on different capsules?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s effectively no limit.\u00A0 Or rather, there is a limit, but it\u0027s one that\u0027s not \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emuch\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of a limit in practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA command pod can store only one copy of any given science result.\u00A0 A science result is the combination of, 1. instrument, 2. celestial body, 3. biome, 4. situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, for example, \u0022temperature scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Highlands\u0022 is a science result.\u00A0 This would be a different science result than if it was some other experiment (like \u0022EVA report\u0022), or some other celestial body (e.g. Duna), or some other biome (e.g. \u0022Grasslands\u0022), or some other situation (e.g. \u0022landed\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as they\u0027re different results, you can store as many as you want in a pod.\u00A0 You couldn\u0027t store two of \u0022temperature scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands\u0022, but you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecould\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E store one of those with, for example, \u0022temperature scan while landed at Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands\u0022 or \u0022temperature scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Shores\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat \u0022can\u0027t have two of the same thing\u0022 limitation doesn\u0027t really matter much in practice, because you don\u0027t really get credit for more than one of them anyway.\u00A0 Once you bring home a \u0022Temperature scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands\u0022, you get a chunk of science points for that, and then bringing home another identical one of those doesn\u0027t give you anything.\u00A0 (Well, actually it gives you a very small fraction of that, but it\u0027s such a tiny amount that it\u0027s generally not worth bothering with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, if you\u0027re trying to enter a command pod and it\u0027s warning you that you\u0027ll have to dump some results, that\u0027s fine:\u00A0 it means you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealready have that same identical science in the pod\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so what your kerbal is carrying is just an extra (nearly worthless) copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that not all science experiments are per-biome for all situations.\u00A0 Thus, for example, in \u0022space near ___\u0022 situation, EVA results are per-biome, but Mystery Goo (for example) is not.\u00A0 So if you\u0027re orbiting the Mun, say, and going over all the different biomes, you can repeatedly hop out of your pod to get different science results for \u0022EVA report over Mun\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;biome\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u0022... but you can only get one Goo result, because it\u0027s just \u0022goo observation from space near the Mun\u0022 and it doesn\u0027t matter what biome you\u0027re over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

you 100% credit when you transmit them-- you don\u0027t lose a percentage, like you do with other experiments.\u00A0 So when you get a crew report, just go ahead and transmit it and then you have
