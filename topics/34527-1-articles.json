There\u0027s no drag, but the game doesn\u0027t always zero things out correctly.

If you do a perfectly equatorial orbit, then obviously your radius will need to be higher than the highest point on the equator; this should be easy enough to visualize. But any non-equatorial orbit will eventually pass over every point on the surface between its minimum and maximum latitude, as the orbit precesses around the surface. So, just because your orbit doesn\u0027t hit that 3000m mountain on THIS pass doesn\u0027t really mean much, because eventually it\u0027ll run into it unless it\u0027s too far north/south for your orbit. In theory there\u0027d be altitudes where you could have some sort of synchronous orbit (passing over only a few discrete lines), but in practice that won\u0027t happen because of simple rounding errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the answer given earlier is correct: whatever the highest point is, add a little to that, and that\u0027s what your periapsis would need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kanga","CreatedById":23008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T08:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to orbit below the highest point, by making sure that the highest point is not in your orbital path.

Around the equator the highest hill is just over 2km. 2500 is a good orbit to keep reasonably safe from the Mun. You just have to be careful not to accidentally get too below that at the wrong time while burning to circularize or lower periapsis. With MechJeb you can see your true altitude, so you can get into a low orbit and then watch the altitude until it reaches a minimum point and then subtract the value from your current orbit.
