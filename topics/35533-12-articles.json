I am not sure why, but this worked the first time when I moved the craft file to the VAB, and opened it there (for another reason). May not be related at all.

Is it because of module manager or something. Everytime I go to weld the game freezes up for a bit like it\u0027s reloading but then the welded parts aren\u0027t appearing at all anywhere in game, nor can I find them in the UbioWeldingLtd folder; the parts folder is just empty.
