In many ways it\u0027s the successor of its wild but somewhat unstable cousin the Scythe, and in my humble opinion is my best light SSTO VTOL yet. As you\u0027ve (hopefully) come to expect from my designs, the Stratos is stable at all fuel loads and a new drag management system ensures the craft stays controllable at all atmospheric speeds, something that was an issue with R-Type and to a lesser extent the Scythe. All in all it\u0027s an inspired choice for all aspiring rocket jockeys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/88yZBmM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002288yZBmM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetachable drop tanks and RCS Pods are fitted as standard, you even have the option of ejecting the air intake stacks, all of this without affecting the center of mass. A new front mounted port makes docking and re-fueling a breeze for novices and pros alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/alFo7w7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022alFo7w7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stratos features an extremely versatile and adaptable air-frame which can be tailored to suit almost any mission. By replacing the air intake stacks with extra fuel tanks you can turn it into a standard lander while still retaining the ability to operate in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The whole ship has been built around the top docking port so can be easily integrated into existing designs using the sub-assembly saver, yay! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PSR9KfX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PSR9KfX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance is roughly the same as the Corgi, and with the side drop tanks attached they share the same fuel load and power-plant. Like the Corgi the Stratos can do a return SSTO mission to Minmus, but the fuel margins are a bit tighter. All told it\u0027s a touch heavier then then Corgi due to the weight of the cockpit, however if you\u0027re not fussed about running a pure SSTO mission, you can eject the drop tanks and air intake stacks to make up the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONTROLS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Toggle Jet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Toggle Rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Toggle Landing Mode (shuts down 2 of the 4 rocket engines for a broader throttle response)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 - Toggle ASAS Torque \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0 - Toggle Intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EABORT - Un-Dock/De-Couple\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPACE - Eject Drop Tanks/RCS Pods/Air Intake Stacks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EINSTRUCTIONS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you bought that joystick yet?

The top docking port operates in line with the engines and \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be used when performing burns with the navball. You can also use the top docking port if you\u0027d rather fly the Stratos like a regular rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to dock and re-fuel the Stratos is by using the front docking port, however if you need to preserve the balance of your target vessel the top docking port should be used as this runs along the center of balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stratos is usually pretty economic when it comes to power however if you need to top up the batteries you can find an extendable solar panel located just under the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESSTO MISSION PROFILE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you waltz out to the runway you\u0027ll have to choose between taking the drop tanks or the RCS pods, delete one of them otherwise the Stratos will barely make it off the tarmac let alone into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivate the ASAS press 1 to fire up the jet and fly verticaly into the sky. This will be a good time to make a cup of tea as it\u0027ll take about five minutes for the Stratos to reach it\u0027s pitch over point at around 15,000m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first you\u0027ll want to ascend on a 40-45\u0060 angle. Once you get to 20,000m pitch down enough to slow your rate of ascent, from here on in you\u0027ll want to squeeze every bit of speed you can from the jet. At this point the air pressure will try and force the nose down slightly but the new ASAS system does a commendable job of keeping you on course. I\u0027ve added an air intake aft of the vessel which acts like a dive brake and makes the Stratos controllable at almost any speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you hit 30,000 you\u0027ll want to be going at least 1800 m/s, keep the jet going as long as you can by slowly reducing throttle and press 2 to light up the rockets. When the jet chokes hit 1 to shut down the engine and 0 to close the intakes. (this will be the time to eject the air intake stack if you want) Pitch up to around 20-30\u0060 and keep the rockets burning until you\u0027ve cleared the atmosphere (keep an eye on the drop tank\u0027s fuel level as they\u0027ll be ready to ditch pretty shortly). You can now (if you haven\u0027t already) switch command over to the top docking port and circulariize your orbit or set a course into the heavens. The Stratos comes with 160 units of jet fuel so you\u0027ll want your liquid fuel gauge to read a minimum of 500 units before you fire the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce out of the atmosphere I usually press 9 to de-activate the SAS torque as I find the craft can be a bit twitchy otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re ready to land back on Kerbin swap command back over to the cockpit. Press 0 to re-open the intakes and 1 to fire up the jet. Upon landing press 2 or 3 to give yourself rocket assist, this will help get rid of the throttle lag from the jet and ensure a smooth touch down. When I land I usually like to press 9 and reduce the ship\u0027s torque but that\u0027s just personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, oh and BTW I wasn\u0027t planning on releasing the heavy LV that featured in the video, but if anyone desperately wants it, make yourselves known and I\u0027ll give it a bit of a tart up before it gets sent out into the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECupcake...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JkzlhX2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JkzlhX2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T11:27:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cupcake...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hippiepanda the IIV","CreatedById":74437,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei still don\u0027t understand how your drop ships are so stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T16:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Cupcake\u0027s crafts are so Star Warsy!
