For example, once you open the computers GUI you have this side bar with lots of actions, variables\u00A0and commands (for example two\u00A0of the actions might be: (input craft name) set target (input variable (1) ) | activate (input function) , throttle (input variable (2) ) | target (input variable (1) = range 0.5 (input command). Now all that I said above may seem like nonsense but here a brief description so a\u00A0variable is information that can change so variable (1) could be something a part like a\u00A0docking port or a number such as 5. When you do open it instead of all that nonsense it will be in the \u201Cblocky\u201D language so what you see is simplified but underneath it is something the computer can read so let\u2019s say variable (1) was a docking port, the function was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, variable (2) was 5, the craft name was ship 1\u00A0and the command was dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou will see something like this: \u00A0Ship 1, set target as |\u00A0docking port |\u00A0|\u00A0activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E | | \u0026amp; | throttle up to |5| \u00A0 \u00A0When | docking port | is in range | dock | . And the game will see something that it can understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif this was implemented it would allow you to do stuff such as make the solar panels extends when the battery runs out, make observations and deploy parachutes once below a certain altitude.

Sure, you can use it to build an autopilot which brings your vessel into orbit but are you going to do this everytime you want to launch a vessel or would you like to use the same script everytime? As soon as you get into it, you will just create a script for the most common maneuver: Launch, docking, hohmann transfer and maybe landing. You might be able to share these scripts as well, so you don\u0027t even have to do it on your own and just download the script of someone else so the editor will be abandoned as soon as these scripts are done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah...I like the idea, would love to see it, but I guess it is not worth to implement it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T01:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223522354\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221547514506\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00224x4cheesecake\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, 4x4cheesecake said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;SNIP\u0026gt; A simple GUI which provides programm blocks so even people without knowlegde about programming can write an autopilot for their rockets and I have to admit, I would love to see something like this.
