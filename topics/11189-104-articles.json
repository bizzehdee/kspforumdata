On rocket mode, it is best to just pitch for best lift/drag ratio rather than \u0022pulling the nose up steeply\u0022.  So if your wings aren\u0027t angled up , that\u0027d be about 5 degrees above prograde, if you have angled wings, and it looks like you do have built in incidence, then just fly as close to prograde as possible without having the nose actually go below prograde.   If you angle the canards up a bit in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E so that the plane flies with a small positive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E with no control input,  you can just set prograde hold on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E at this point and it will take care of giving you the most efficienct angle.\n\nHowever, you\u0027ve got low melting point airliner wings and a pointy cockpit so you may need to cilmb straight up to avoid melting.   With an inline mk2 cockpit and big S wings, heat is less of a worry.\n\nAlso note - \n\nyou have a lot of liquid fuel storage, you could perhaps think about fitting a nerv or two to make use of it.\n\nthe mk2 fuselage pieces have awful drag characteristics.  mk1 tanks of the same capacity have significantly less drag, even better are wings and strakes if you are just storing liquid fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"SG Aero","CreatedById":174890,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-11T17:56:32Z","Content":"Just a question: how big would my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E need to be to make the maximalist challenge?
