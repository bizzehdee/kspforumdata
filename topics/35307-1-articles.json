One could quite easily automate an entire launch/rendezvous/docking/deorbit sequence using the various autopilot modules, or simply use Smart A.S.S for attitude control. It also, as Jack Wolfe said, helps educate the player about making orbital manoeuvres or RCS if the player doesn\u0027t feel confident doing it. All you gotta do in that case is watch the autopilot set up it\u0027s course and nodes, then try and understand that yourself. Personally, I get along just fine with using MechJeb purely for the Smart A.S.S, Delta-V stats and orbital stats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T03:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022entaran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022entaran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHang on.
