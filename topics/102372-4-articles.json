Do I change some of the stuff over to stock systems? Do I disable/replace the stock contracts or do I simple add stuff around it? Bunch of things that I need to think about once I\u0027ve had time to play with it.\n\nI\u0027ll put this out now for people to answer once they\u0027ve had a chance to play with the stock tourism contracts:\n\n1. What do you dislike about the stock contracts?\n2. What do you like about the stock contracts?\n3. What do you like better about this contract pack?\n4.

Players will have become used to manual loading of passengers, so there\u0027s likely to be some player confusion if they do not see the tourists available to load in the VAB/SPH/launch window. However, this contract pack has some late-game contracts that require 50-100 tourists to be loaded. I\u0027m not going to ask players to do that manually. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2.[/TD]\n\n[TD]Tourists have individual itineraries.[/TD]\n\n[TD]Tourists within a contract have the same itinerary.[/TD]\n\n[TD]No change.

Station/base tourism\n2. Contracts for building space-tourist attractions (and contracts for visiting them)\n3. Asteroid tourism\n\nSo the general plan for this contract pack:\n\n1. Make sure nothing\u0027s broken\n2. Potentially re-balance rewards based on stock\n3. Disable stock tourism as part of this contract\n4. Rename it to Tourism Plus to prevent confusion with stock\n5. Possibly add more unique elements to differentiate it even more from stock\n\nSo, anyone have feedback on this plan? Suggestions on additional features/contracts that would make it even better?
