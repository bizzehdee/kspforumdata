I\u0027ve always used TAC and am likely to switch to USI, so having real tourist missions of lengthy duration increases the challenge with life support - particularly with a OKS setup if you are trying to get close to closed loop - adding 20 tourists becomes somewhat nontrivial. For those without life support, make it hours or whatever is suitable.
