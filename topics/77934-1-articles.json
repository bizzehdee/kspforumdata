People also don\u0027t like paying someone to fail, so successful launches are a must for a positive reputation. Completing contracts is an obvious rep boost, but sitting on contracts will frustrate the customer, resulting in a slight hit to reputation.

Then once you test them all, you pay the manufacturer a license fee to use their parts (the research cost that was mentioned earlier), plus make parts a little more expensive, while leaving contract payouts the same. If you decrease contract payout, it needs to be by a factor less than the adjustment to part cost (in my opinion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eex : You launched easily 3 satellites during your big mission, and now you can\u0027t revert it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a neat mechanic to add.

Long term missions might be a little tricky, since your income will drop back down to whatever basic is, but Squad have actually said that they imagined the player doing one long mission and doing a few smaller ones concurrently, so maybe it\u0027ll work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T20:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess the thread are quite redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoastduck I think I wasn\u0027t clear enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t suggesting of forcing the player to launch his rockets/satellite per batch like you seem to describe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was more remarking that if you launch several short missions while you had \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eanother\u003C/span\u003E long mission running, you will not want (or even be able) to revert to the very start of the long mission to change your design and avoid thing like mission failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo play on this you would be incited to launch ship in parallel.
