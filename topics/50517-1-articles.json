If Jeb and Jeb alone can gather all the science by himself, it renders multiple-kerbaled missions pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince mental health reasons have already been suggested, I\u0027m suggesting something along the line of kerbonaut specializations. I\u0027m also thinking is that hiring kerbals with specific skills is not a one-mission deal, rather, you hire them for life, and you have the option of either using them on Kerbin or sending them to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Scientist kerbals is needed on Kerbin for studying science probes and getting technology, but sending to space them will even yield more science that can\u0027t be obtained by probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engineer kerbals are used to assemble your rockets, and the better your engineers, the bigger and less expensive your rockets can be. You can also send engineers to space to do orbital assembly, or maintain and repair parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Medic kerbals can prepare other kerbonauts\u0027 health before sending them to space, and you can also send a medic to space basically as a ship doctor, minimizing health issues and treating ailments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiring kerbals isn\u0027t done with money, but rather, with reputation. In the beginning, you only get backyard kerbals eager to launch random things into space available to you, but as you do more achievement and gain reputation, you can hire better and better kerbal to suit your evergrowing space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-25T09:29:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2013 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UbioZur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESuggestion tag\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T09:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the suggestion forum since it is a suggestion (try to post in the appropriate forum please).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been suggested a few time here and there but it is still a good one (and well explained).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have a different approach/view from everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buback","CreatedById":67519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T15:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed-shirt/blue-shirt/yellow-shirt?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding an engineer could allow you to auto burn at nodes, and the more experience, the more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
