This always\u00A0causes your plane to veer slowly to the left as you roll down the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour SAS system will try to compensate for this with aerodynamic, gimbal, and steering control inputs. But with your current settings on your wheels, your plane is not stable when rolling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to modify the friction settings on your wheels until the plane is stable when steered during takeoff -- there really is no other solution. Try setting the front wheel friction to .3 or lower, and maybe set the rear wheel friction to .4 to .6. You just have to try some values and see what works -- there are no rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raideur Ng","CreatedById":158532,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T04:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not part of the runway that causes the veering, it\u0027s wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more wobble between each wheel, the more it will disrupt your runway roll. His main\u0027s are attached to his wings, which wobble like a mother. I am aware you want a tricycle style layout, but attaching it to solid main body parts that have very strong connections between each other (Mk3 body parts) will reduce wobble to the point you can take off. Ideally, you can attach all three gear to a single large structural piece and basically remove wobble entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully expect Slashy or someone with solid stats to come in and show me up, but I assure you, it\u0027s wobble and eliminating it will make for a better takeoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Runescope","CreatedById":2947,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T04:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheels aren\u0027t actually attached to the wings.\u00A0 I\u0027m aware of the wobble problem, so I always attach the wheels to the main base and move them out into the wings.\u00A0 That way I get the wide tricycle layout, with the stability of a narrow one.\u00A0 I turned the friction WAY down and it works ... sort of.\u00A0 I can get off the ground in a straight line, but if for some reason start to slide sideways, I REALLY start to slide sideways, like I\u0027m taking off on ice.\u00A0 It\u0027s a hacky workaround anyways and I think they should just fix the bug.\u00A0 It\u0027s not the first and only bug with the runway.\u00A0 I think it\u0027s mainly because it\u0027s a \u0027created\u0027 structure.\u00A0 If they just had it as flat ground, there wouldn\u0027t be this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
