Obviously, both skill and design factors are part of this problem, and should remain so, and also I know it is possible to turn a wheel\u0027s power off, reducing speed but complicating propulsion balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, I would like the option to set a wheels powered speed to say, 10/20/30/40/50% of max so as to reduce the crippling/fatal/stranding flips that really discourage me from playing the game and basically dictate that I design whole new rovers for each new environment rather than adjusting them. Speed governors, as I understand it, are actually a part of rover/probe design IRL, so I think this is a tweak which is useful, realistic, and not game-breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T10:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb already has Speed Governor/Cruise Control.
