It appears to me that vessel battery charge is not simulated while I am piloting another craft using time acceleration (which is most of time allowing for the acceleration). After I thought about it I\u0027ve concluded that perhaps this is a deliberate optimisation to avoid slowing the engine down. Am I correct about this effect?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be a bit of a bore to have to sit there watching a huge battery slowly charge up (for long night locations) if I notice that it\u0027s low; is there a mod that improves this otherwise unexpected behaviour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing that occurred to me was to wonder about researching in the sci lab. I think it continues regardless which is convenient. Am I right about this or have I simply not been paying enough attention to the research level?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this sort of behaviour impact anything else of importance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T22:16:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, most things in the game turn off completely when a vessel is \u0022on rails\u0022 (i.e. isn\u0027t the currently piloted vessel, or within a small radius of it).
