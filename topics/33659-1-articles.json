Downside to that is that it\u0027s only really practical with upper stages (unless you are certain you can get the spin to stop), so I\u0027d also say that your friend is the seperatron. One other thing to add: It can take some trial and error to work out where the center of mass is, but try not to unbalance the booster too much as you drop it unless your rocket has enough thrust-to-weight to accelerate away quickly once you\u0027ve hit the stage button. Otherwise as Tex_NL says, you will flip your spent boosters back into your rocket as you eject them and you will not be going to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, you can also use aerodynamic forces to separate boosters using fin/wing parts, but it\u0027s not generally practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T23:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may not need sepratrons... you may just need to reposition your decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nitevision92","CreatedById":71293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T00:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the help!
