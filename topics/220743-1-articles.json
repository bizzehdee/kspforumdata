For example, off the top of my head - we can use a drag prediction tool so we can get the right parachutes config...but only if we\u0027ve measured the atmosphere composition at the relevant altitudes. We can EVA...but we need to have measured the temperatures, radiation etc. so we can \u0022have a suitable spacesuit\u0022. I\u0027m of the camp that says it doesn\u0027t have to make perfect scientific sense. It\u0027s a game and they rarely are completely logical.

I\u0027ve mentioned parachute predictions earlier - it\u0027s disappointing that we need to guess the number. Equally, landing stability calculations - will my craft balance OK with this much fuel left on this angle of slope (ok so perhaps we have CM indicators for that, so never mind). I\u0027m not sure how realistic re-entry will be but do we need to identify how much ablator we need? Heat/solar management predictions.

The interface. The team had a bunch of nice ideas posted publicly (and probably few more never revealed) but settled for style that neither fits the general feeling of the game (high tech civilization heading to other planets, even stars) but also is barely readable thanks to 15000 different font types, sizes, inconsistencies and general clunkyness of the chosen style - retro pixely text was never good at being easy to read, which brings me to the next point:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Accessibility.

And some additional structural integrity would be nice if, say, I want to build an interstage fairing and hold the munar module in it. Right now the only place where the fairing is connected is on the base. The open top should also work as structural element. KSP1 sort of allowed for mounting points in the middle, it wasn\u0027t the perfect solution but it was something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.
