I got so many mods (3.3gb including the expansion) that 16 gigs of RAM is not working out too well in 1.4.4. Sure there is the delete good mods option, but I would like to see if there are other methods before I reduce my enjoyment. Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T14:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemgraph mod comes to mind.
