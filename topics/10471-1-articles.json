Northern mountains, I\\\u0027ve heard, from the main KSC.\n\nI\\\u0027ve tried getting there with my A-Wing, but I tend to run out of fuel too early.

The best way I\\\u0027ve found is to fly a spaceplane that glides well, set a sub-orbital trajectory ending in the basin and just coast the rest of the way. You\\\u0027d only need enough fuel for the initial ascent, which in my experience has been one-and-a-half tanks using the standard-size C7 fuselage (my spaceplane is four tanks long plus cockpit with a delta-wing configuration). Using a stock rocket would follow a similar path, only you\\\u0027d overshoot the landing site by a little bit to compensate for atmospheric drag then perform a powered landing. If you\\\u0027re at the right basin, it should be visible from the surrounding mountains. If your draw distance prevents a visual from the mountains, simply fly (or fall) toward the center and you should find it.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T08:44:41Z","Content":"The second KSC happens to have a munolith at the site. So you can find it with the MuMech Muon Detector plugin. In this case, it works best attached to a spaceplane.
