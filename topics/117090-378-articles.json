The goals of the launchers were to be scalable with the ability to put serious payloads into TLI to support continued Moon base operations into the 2010s and 2020s. So basically, an SLS-type project in the ETS universe, but scalable and with different LEGO pieces. My rules were that I could only use derivatives of the components outlined in [the AH Wiki article on ETS spacecraft and launch vehicles.](https://www.alternatehistory.com/wiki/doku.php?id=timelines:eyes_turned_skyward_spacecraft_and_launch_vehicle_technical_data) That meant engines, tank diameters, etc. The result is the Helios rocket family.\n\nThe designation system follows the fairing-booster-upper stage model of the Atlas series. So the 621, for example, uses a 6(point 625) meter fairing, two SRMUs, and an S-IVD upper stage. There was not enough of a gap in performance between the 621 an\uFEFFd 661 to justify any variants with four strap on boosters. The two upper stages have the following codes: S-IVD (1), and HAUS (2)\n\nThe core tanks are based aesthetically on the Atlas V. Like that rocket, they are bare aluminum with an anti-corrosion conversion finish, which appears bronze. I chose this look because it\u0027s both a good design and aesthetically striking. I wanted the rockets to be ultimately Saturn-derived, but not look like they came out of the Apollo program. The S-IVD upper stage tank is an improved and lightened S-IVC with revised avionics. It uses unpainted orange spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) like the Space Shuttle external tank. The S-IVB upper stage from which the S-IVD would ultimately be derived is a very lightweight common bulkhead design, so it\u0027s not visually correct for these models to have the SLS-like intertank section (the lighter ridged bit in the middle), so I used the end-and-end bulkhead option in SSTU instead. The HAUS upper stage (a clean sheet design) is a heavily insulated LEO-storable balloon-tank design, so it gets no prominent interstage feature, and sports the gold MLI covering texture. It should be noted that the engines have no direct analogues IOTL, although the F-1B is similar to the real F-1B in that it\u0027s production optimized and uprated. It is represented by SSTU\u0027s (IRL) F-1B. The J-2D is represented by SSTU\u0027s J-2X but is unrelated except for shared heritage (it, like SSTU\u0027s J-2X ironically, is higher performance than the historical J-2X would have been). It is a reduced cost J-2 with improved thrust and specific impulse. Both are pretty unsurprising improvements over their predecessors.\n\nAll of the Helios series are fully expendable. These rockets are intended to fly in the 2010s and 2020s, and even with some private ETS companies developing reusability during that time, I do not think NASA-requested rockets would be reusable by that point (although, ironically, ETS canon contradicts me - I was a little behind in my reading when I started this project). Another issue is the location of the long and short first stage tanks in the timeline. Are the L-variants concurrent with the rest, or did the L-variants come about later, as an even further improvement? Should the regular variants exist at all (well the 601 clearly should)? Fairings are another matter. Right now each upper stage has its own unique fairing. These stages are big enough that this may be all that is ever needed, especially since these rockets are designed primarily to send cargo to the Moon.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-30T09:13:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2019 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Gremillion**"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T13:08:22Z","Content":"[@Gremillion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190021-gremillion/) o/\n\nVery cool, I love a nice clean looking LV family! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedShot7","CreatedById":198993,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T19:11:06Z","Content":"Is there any consideration towards giving the Orion capsule a black or shiny texture like it does in reality?![orion_featured_image.jpg](https://appel.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/orion_featured_image.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"jinnantonix","CreatedById":188889,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-31T13:45:18Z","Content":"Hi [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), just wanted to say thanks for this excellent mod, I am really enjoying it.

I have checked SSTU code, and I do not have or use any classes called \u0027ResourceRatio\u0027, so whatever is causing that error is not in SSTU directly.  Now, stock code -does- have a \u0027ResourceRatio\u0027 class, but SSTU is not interfacing with that class directly in any fashion, and that class *does* have a constructor.  This all points to the likely cause being some out-of-date mod that you have installed that was not compiled for recent KSP versions (e.g. was compiled for KSP 1.3).\n\nAt this point your only real recourse to solve that error (and it ***does*** need to be solved), is to remove mods one at a time, until the error goes away.  Whichever mod removed last is likely the culprit.  Or do the reverse and start with a clean installation, and then install mods one at a time until the error occurs, at which point the last added mod is likely the culprit.\n\nDo you have this issue with any non-SSTU parts?  Can you duplicate the issue in a stock\u002BSSTU only installation?\n\nIf you can find a way to duplicate the issue on a Stock \u002B SSTU only installation, then I can likely find how to reproduce the problem, at which point I could do further debugging.  However, if the problem is not present in a Stock\u002BSSTU only installation, that would point to the error being in another mod, at which point I cannot really offer any further assistance (I can\u0027t fix other mods\u0027 issues)."},{"CreatedByName":"fxcustoms","CreatedById":129110,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-01T22:21:57Z","Content":"Sorry to have taken up your time I figured it was a issue with something I have done I will work on removing some mods and seeing if I can find the culprit or try the fresh install method thanks for the advise."},{"CreatedByName":"jinnantonix","CreatedById":188889,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-02T02:50:55Z","Content":"Hi [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), I am wondering if it is possible to resize the NASA logo on your tanks?  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-02T07:23:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2019 07:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by jinnantonix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-02T15:11:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, fxcustoms said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry to have taken up your time I figured it was a issue with something I have done I will work on removing some mods and seeing if I can find the culprit or try the fresh install method thanks for the advise.\n\u003E \n\nNo worries, sorry I couldn\u0027t point to anything more specific.
