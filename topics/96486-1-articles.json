Spacing out the engines or having more non-engine parts (including struts) in close proximity helps reduce the heat load. lso notable is the orange tank bug where its center of mass is so far from an engine that it cannot effectively transfer heat away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If they explode there\u0027s quite a bit of effectiveness lost. But as long as they don\u0027t, you get 100% performance. The orange bar filling up is more of a guideline than anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If they explode, you\u0027ll want to throttle down slightly, use a thrust limiter, or rearrange the craft.

In KSP, engines are not less efficient when they get hot. The only problem with hot engines is that if you let them overheat too much (in other words, if the orange bar completely fills up), they will explode. This may or may not be a problem depending on how much you like explosions. To avoid that, you can either place them a little further away from each other or do as Worir4 says and just throttle down a little.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T20:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) they overheat because they\u0027re too hot.
