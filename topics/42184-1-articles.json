I\u0027m making this in the VAB, and I don\u0027t know if that creates any issues. All my tests are below 1000m, too. I\u0027m sorry don\u0027t have any craft to show since the design keeps changing constantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny design I try with the common technique of putting the center of mass just in front of the center of lift is not working. The planes just nose down no matter how many wings I add, weight I remove, or how close I put the CoM to the CoL. After experimenting, I found that putting the CoM just underneath the CoL at least keeps me steady. It\u0027s like the CoL is acting as a kind of pivot, and the CoM just wants to settle underneath it. Putting it below and just behind/forward makes it easier to nose up/down, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this make sense to KSPers? In a powered aircraft you want the CoM, CoL, and CoT all aligned axially. But, without engines to push the craft, does that change the situation? Could there be some problem in the design with weight vs. lift vs. drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side question: any way to turn off/suppress/work around the infinigliding behavior?

They just seem to fall like a rock without control surfaces and only manage to glide - barely - in the last few metres before crashing. If your design weighs more than a paperplane you also need a lot of wings to support it, which quickly looks ugly and detracts from the point of the exercise (which is to create good-looking planes). I think the main problem is that the aerodynamics model used is flawed and doesn\u0027t take aerodynamism at all into account - every part has constant drag regardless of its geometry, meaning that gliding would seem to be impossible as as a glider with no control surfaces and no engines would have no way of maintaining horizontal velocity while killing vertical velocity to air resistance and aerodynamic lift (which is what gliders are supposed to do) because both are equally lost to drag. It appears it\u0027s a bit more complicated than that in KSP but yeah, atmospheric drag effects are not very accurately modeled at the moment. But then I kind of suck at spaceplanes, so yeah, maybe I am just really bad at KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think infiniglide is built into the stock game (basically a hack used in place of proper lift forces) but you can try the FAR mod to have some more realistic flying.

It takes very, very long to get down to a safe speed for landing. Any ideas at all about how to stop this madness? Maybe a joystick?

If the CoM is vertically aligned with the CoL, the control surfaces act very weird. Sometimes they\u0027ll turn opposite directions when trying to pitch.
