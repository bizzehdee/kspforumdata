Classic issue repeated itself yesterday while playing the current version (0.90) on my Windows 7 PC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launched a probe to Eve many (real) days ago. Timewarped a few days out, to clear Kerbin SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Flew many missions since then, completing contracts and going through the usual game progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Decided to check back in on the Eve probe (flown at the behest of a contract), see how it\u0027s doing. Got there via the tracking center, which had been upgraded a couple of times to allow mission planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, arriving at the Eve mission, I got a blank sky, a messed up Navball (showing NaN as the speed, etc.) and could not do anything but exit back to the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at the space center again, I could not get anything to work by clicking it, even the exit button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExited using the Windows way (top right window corner red box with X) and restarted game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. My Eve probe no longer exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: I suppose an occasional backup of the game save file is in order. However with so much more going on...tracking money and prestige now in addition to science, not to mention Kerbonaut stats, one must back up very frequently, which is a real drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny further ideas or comments?
