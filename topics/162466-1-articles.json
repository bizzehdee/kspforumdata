Attached to the side is the payload. Between the 32 and the orange is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheel.

Reaction wheels and control surfaces do not respond to input the same way: reaction wheels pretty much apply full torque instantly while control surfaces take some time to deploy and react depending on the airflow. By forcing your craft to move using the reaction wheel, you \u0022throw\u0022 your surfaces out of the airflow by the difference in response or simply because the torque of the wheel exceeds the torque the surfaces can apply/withstand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReaction wheels and control surfaces usually don\u0027t work that well together, but it can be amplified depending on the craft itself (ie: shape, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E positions...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just an hypothesis but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is known to destabilise crafts when too much torque is available.
