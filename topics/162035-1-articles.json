However, recently my nodes have started acting very weird. For instance, when i tell \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E to circularize, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator continuously ticks up to way more than i need. The node itself is in the wrong place because instead of being in prograde, the marker is somewhere below that and as the burn goes on, it transfers down to radial in, which screws up my orbit entirely. One more thing i noticed is that the time to the node is counting waaaay to fast and is saying that the craft is, for instance, T\u002B a few seconds but the node is not even close to the ship. it counts down probably in double or triple time. All of the above also holds true for maneuver nodes i make myself, so i\u0027m not sure if mechjeb is the problem. Another thing to note is that the engineer in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is telling me that the AR202 case is facing the wrong direction but i have found that this is a known little bug and doesn\u0027t do anything. I changed nothing from when it was working fine to now and i have tried reinstalling mechjeb. I have made sure the problem isn\u0027t my ship and have tried probably 10 different ones that worked for me previously as well as stock ships. My only other lead on the issue is that i think it started happening after i researched ascent guidance for mechjeb and tried using it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T23:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease read the linked thread and follow the instructions there.
