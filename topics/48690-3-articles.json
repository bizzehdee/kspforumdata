After reaching apoapsis, I then brought my periapsis up to Pol\u0027s orbit and captured just inside its SOI. One EVA touch and go later, I leave Pol orbit for Bop, and repeat (the ascent there was very tight on Jeb\u0027s jetpack fuel, I got back to the pod with .2 remaining, and one of my previous attempts was similar and I ended up grabbing on to the ladder, but because of the velocity, I flew right back off. Reminded me of Gravity lol). After being done with Bop, I raised my Jool apoapsis again to nearly out of the SOI, then at apoapsis brought it down closer to Jool. Rather than burning at periapsis, I got a perfect gravity assist from Tylo that flung me all the way down to below Eve\u0027s orbit (could have even gone to Moho if I had the fuel), and an amazingly lucky Kerbin encounter. After aerocapture at Kerbin, I went to the Mun in a polar orbit and got as many of the biomes as I could find before returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal science haul was 2461, plus 10 from poor Kerton Kerman who stayed on the launchpad the entire ~6 years that Jeb was away XD (what?!

Just 6 science points left over! I know for sure that over 3000 science with tier-0 would be possible, with more flybys of Jool\u0027s moons, possibly a Moho visit (not really hard to do), maybe landing on Gilly and/or Minmus (which I just barely didn\u0027t have enough fuel to do), and more transmissions, since I neglected to remember the fact that my engine recharged electricity until I made it to Pol, whoops!
