So I think the 3-person command module should be the kernel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI experienced two major problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. the time went slow that in the game 1s cost real time 2 seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and the responsibility is laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I do not know why, cpu cost is very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. during straight rising, the rocket is hard to change the direction (heading). And even with all boost gone, this issue remained in the space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I attached 8 RCS on CSM, this can do a little help for changing heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Then I decoupled the first stage that only CSM and lander are left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Then I decoupled the two and turn around CSM to dock with lander like the real Apollo did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, with such a relatively small vessel, it\u0027s still hard to change heading (While for Kerbal X which has same command module and last stage, it is easy to control).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I thought it could be the MJ issue, but so I further decoupled the two duiring low Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But the problem was still there for CSM on the orbit. And the lander is too small to control the direction even turned on SAS (no sas module but using 1-person command module\u0027s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help me figure the two problems out? Especially the 2nd one. During rising and into Kerbin orbit, MJ on lander has same heading direction with CSM (it has slow heading change issue), after docking the lander, MJ has opposite direction (but the control is on CSM, and I did not use MJ), the problem exists, after CSM and lander separated, the problem still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I observed problem 1, but I do not think that\u0027s the source resulting in problem 2.
