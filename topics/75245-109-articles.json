This allows those that want to place their satellites into very specific orbits to be able to easily calculate these orbital elements without the need to do the calculations by hand or through external tools (excel sheets, etc.). One of the main benefits of the in-game tool I have wrote is that it pulls the physical and orbital characteristics of all the known celestial bodies directly from the game, so it automatically accounts for any solar system changes that would come from mods like Kopernicus (Outer Planets Mod and the upcoming RSS being examples). Also, specifically with Remote Tech in mind, the tool will also calculate the theoretical maximum time spent in darkness, so you can plan your solar panels and batteries accordingly.

Ethically, RT-XF is a licence-compliant fork of RT, and I offered my code as a pull request back to the main RT project (with the XF-style behavior turned off by default in the configs), but they didn\u0027t want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the RT devs feel that a cardinal rule of RT is \u0022you can\u0027t do anything without a connection.\u0022 The ability to control an antenna and re-establish connection violates that rule. So I think they\u0027re working on a more \u0022hands free\u0022 mode, where \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech/issues/107\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe probe can go into an autotargeting mode\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, no drama or anything is going on. They just didn\u0027t want the RT-XF options. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T19:26:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pharylon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
