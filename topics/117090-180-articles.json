Sounds like it is a problem related to the module-switching, and might not be something that I can solve (meaning docking ports switching will have to be removed from all parts).\n\nWill do a bit of investigation on it before todays release to see if I can clean it up.  No guarantees though; stock code -really- doesn\u0027t like module-switching.\n\nEdit:  The good news is it looks like I might be able to get this problem fixed.  Seems that during symmetry counterpart creation my modules are creating a second set of docking port modules, and the difference in module-list-length between the base and symmetry parts is what is causing the error.\n\n(But again... why must there be so many different loading/part creation code-paths?  Why could they not just instantiate the symmetry part from prefab, like every other part, call onSave() on the base part, and feed that config node into the symmetry part during its OnLoad() call?  Symmetry parts are my worst nightmare in the coding end of modding this game; they are 100% inconsistent with the loading and creation of parts anywhere else in the game, except for maybe contracts.. those are terrible as well for part-creation consistency).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-11T17:04:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2016 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-11T16:56:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, I think [@NecroBones](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105424-necrobones/) solved this issue with his radial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E module in his SpaceY mod.

In order for a shader to be ever found by the Unity built-in function Shader.Find(\u0022shaderName\u0022), it has to be compiled with the application.  This is a Unity limitation as near as I can tell, and there is little/nothing that SQUAD can do about it.  So mod added shaders will never be findable for the stock model-loading functions.\n\n2.) Loading of surface shaders is not supported through the built-in (but deprecated/obsolete) Material(string shaderSource) constructor that is currently used by every other mod that is loading custom shaders.  It will work for fixed-pipeline shaders, but not for any more advanced setups.  Will need to find a new method to load shaders.\n\n3.)

Base texture has AO baked into it, specular comes from the alpha channel in diffuse texture.\n\nRight = SSTU/Bumped Specular AO shader.  Base texture is RGB only.  Specular is separate RGB texture.  AO is separate RGB texture.\n\n![9QYPZPE.png](http://i.imgur.com/9QYPZPE.png)\n\nNo real noticeable differences between the two; I would say that the custom shader is so far looking like a quite nice replacement/addition.  Need to add back in rim-highlight support as apparently stock uses that for part highlighting in the editor (or is otherwise incompatible with the custom shader).\n\nI also just realized that I can control the specular hardness value directly from the shader as well, perhaps from the alpha channel in the specular texture (though I\u0027ve not once changed the hardness on the shader from the default value for any of my parts, so no clue how much I would use that ability).\n\nSo, looking good towards having some no-piping fuel tanks.
