Oh, and most forumites, though they don\u0027t physically show on any planet here, just on my comms devices. No, the green beings are not on the forum. Here they call themselves ...

E.g., why is it that my rockets go boom on the launchpad, what secret is in those tanks to make them swivel and detach even before the countdown begins?
