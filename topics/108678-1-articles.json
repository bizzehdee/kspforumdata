Embracing the math and science behind this game is a great step forward, but you might also consider finding some professionals in the field and sending them some emails. Say you are interested in the field and would like some suggestions on how to get started. We live in a world where too often what you know matters less than who you know. And many career professionals will enjoy hearing from a young person interested in their field. Of course many won\u0027t as well, so you might need to send out a few emails before getting a single response. Maybe google the aerospace engine professors at the university you wish to attend or google some folks from NASA. Or search for a really old person, long retired, who once won a Nobel prize in physics. Good luck and may you be the first human to play a video game on the surface of Mars!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
