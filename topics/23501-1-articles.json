I would love to store some huge fuel tanks in space to have other craft later refuel for long interplanetary voyages. Since the Kerbals don\u0027t care about how much money I spend, I figure that\u0027s grand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the problem is I would like to be able to use a sort of \u0022Tug Boat\u0022 ship to move my modules around and link them up. I keep trying to build ships that will let me move laterally in space but so far all I do is rotate or roll. RCS\u0027s are giving me a fit. I suspect this is about a center of gravity issue and I don\u0027t see this problem going away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to get my \u0022Tug Boat\u0022 balanced nicely, whenever I would connect to something in space I am quite sure that will screw up the COG up again and start this mess over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?

I\u0027ve recently decided to go a different route on getting the fuel up there, but what I was working with was essentially a flying gas can; it was an OKTO probe with 4 PB-NUKs stuck radially on its sides attached to a Mk2 adapter, attached to an FL-R1 RCS Fuel Tank, attached to a Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank with Clamp-o-Trons at both ends (on the bottom of the fuel tank and one sitting on top of the probe). It had 12 RCS thrusters and that was it; four at the top, four at the bottom and four along the center of mass of the whole thing. A real simple design as a whole. Total mass was 22.66 tonnes, so you\u0027d need a reasonably hefty rocket to get it into orbit but after that it could maneuver on RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might try something similar in this case; you need the RCS thrusters at both ends and along the center of mass to dock successfully.

It is definitely hard to translate with the tug if your center of thrust is not in the same place as the total docked center of mass. Every time you thrust you set up a moment proportional to the distance between the center of mass and center of thrust (moment arm) which causes the whole thing to spin. If you don\u0027t want to relentlessly abuse the time acceleration to violate conservation of angular momentum my advice it to put at least one set of RCS quads about the center of mass of each docked module in question. My general advice for a Space Tug is to put an ASAS module on it, and also set up an action group to turn off RCS quads such that they are \u0027balanced\u0027 about the center of mass (in other words, when the tug is free flying, leave all of the thrusters open, when docked with another module turn off all the RCS thrusters except the ones in a ring about the center of mass). When docking make sure you\u0027re pointed in the direction opposite of the docking port you are going for then turn on the ASAS and use only RCS translation to complete the docking maneuver. It helps to pick a point of reference that doesn\u0027t precess as you orbit, otherwise you will be trying to track a moving target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joe_Bender","CreatedById":60838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T10:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve had that very problem myself lately; still haven\u0027t come up with a good solution for it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really would be nice if the docking clamps had the \u0027green dots\u0027 every 45 degrees around the clamping side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would insure a consistent connection between two objects and allow an uniform looking structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry about the \u0027green dots\u0027 thing, I dont really know a better way of describing it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T11:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy heavy tug consists of the following...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA command pod MkI-2 sat on top of an ASAS, a FL-R1 RCS Tank and a X200-32 Fuel Tank.

If I\u0027m launching the tug with it\u0027s load as I often do for small and medium pieces (5-100 tons) then I work out the center of mass and install a set of RCS at the correct distances both on the tug and the load (with a second set around the tug-only center of mass to give it some re-usability). I also have a tug up there that has about 12 rows of RCS along it. This one I use for picking up massive loads I\u0027ve launched on their own... I can model the center of mass in the VAB and it should have a set that corresponds ok to the load. have seen a few other near-identical designs in people\u0027s pictures so this seems to be a common design people come to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have a massive 800ton load to move in space, and my heavy tug has proven inadequate.
