Well, it is a mod designed to add more variations of each engine! For example, we have the Mainsail, Skipper and the poodle, and in KSP right now, there\u0027s the Reliant / Swivel and the Terrier, so the 1.25m variant of the Skipper is missing! That\u0027s the basic example.\n\nSo right now in version 0.8 of this mod, it has four engines and they are the **\u0022Private\u0022** the **\u0022Rottweiler\u0022** the **\u0022Vase\u0022** and the **\u0022Tsar\u0022**\n\n![B6vFzrd.png](http://i.imgur.com/B6vFzrd.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![6VcZx8L.png](http://i.imgur.com/6VcZx8L.png)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![Tc2TpiT.png](http://i.imgur.com/Tc2TpiT.png)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![MSr8js8.png](http://i.imgur.com/MSr8js8.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![RAfVRfQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/RAfVRfQ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![e66lBMS.png](http://i.imgur.com/e66lBMS.png)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![iYdiFeY.png](http://i.imgur.com/iYdiFeY.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![NfcSh8d.png](http://i.imgur.com/NfcSh8d.png)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![4YtlEnz.png](http://i.imgur.com/4YtlEnz.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![GiDA4Dc.png](http://i.imgur.com/GiDA4Dc.png)\n\u003E \n\nI think one more engine will do!
