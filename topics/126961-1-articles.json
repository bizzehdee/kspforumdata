I have accepted a (what I thought) juicy contract of extracting Ore from Gilly and \u0022bringing\u0022 it to Eve. Little did I know that it actually wanted me to *land* it on eve. I should really start reading the fine print, huh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226HNI5qO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022573\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6HNI5qO.png\u0022 width=\u0022499\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, my plan is to make use of this contract to pay for my Gilly mining infrastructure, including a mining station and a lander. I want to land on Gilly, mine the Ore, transfer it to a tanker, rendezvous with a dedicated eve landing module, and transfer it to the landing module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is: does this still count? I mean techically it should, because it\u0027s still \u0022the ore\u0022. But I have no idea how the contracts actually track it, since it\u0027s just a number in a config file. Will my plan work, or do I have to do that directly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T23:13:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kobymaru\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T22:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso wondering about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finox","CreatedById":138088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T23:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222306957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126961\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449180839\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107372\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kobymaru\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Kobymaru said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I want to land on Gilly, mine the Ore, transfer it to a tanker, rendezvous with a dedicated eve landing module, and transfer it to the landing module...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, question: Are you transferring the ore from one tank to another after leaving Gilly?\u00A0\u00A0 If so then I don\u0027t know and am curious as to the answer.\u00A0\u00A0 However, If you mean that you are transferring it to a tanker while on Gilly then you should be ok.\u00A0\u00A0 I did something exactly like this only on Minmus, basically I \u0022pre-mined\u0022 a tank of ore (after accepting the contract, critically important) and transferred it to a tanker that had docked with my base on Minmus.\u00A0\u00A0 The ore tanker then proceeded to its destination and the contract completed for me.\u00A0\u00A0 So as long as the ore stays in the same tank from origin to destination the contract will complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T10:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222307134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126961\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449186542\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138088\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Finox\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Finox said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, question: Are you transferring the ore from one tank to another after leaving Gilly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the idea, yes.
