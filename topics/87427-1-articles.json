With a hope and a prayer it made it there, Jeb transmitted the orbital crew report and EVA, and then touched down, transmitted the surface crew report (with which the mission was complete) and got the surface EVA and surface sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then checked the available contracts and found already a \u0022collect science from space around the Mun\u0022, and \u0022collect science from the Mun surface\u0022 so figured I\u0027d pick that up on the return leg, along with a \u0022collect science from space around Kerbin\u0022 for good measure. The makeshift Mun lander somehow made it back to Kerbin with fumes left in the tank and I recovered the craft to see that I now had over 300,000 funds available!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I\u0027ve been raking in money as even without a permanent Mun base or satellite I can accept the flag and science missions and sent my el-cheapo Mun lander up for 15k to collect combined rewards of over 50k.

I like that you now have to purchase every part after researching a node but I think it could be even better. Say with each node you unlock that there is research time. Meaning that it takes a day or two to research cheaper nodes, and much longer to research more expensive nodes...and that you could only have one node being researched at a time. Add an option where you could spend additional science on a node to decrease its research time, but it costs greater funds to unlock the parts if you do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple this with something akin to construction time and more pressing contracts and you can add a dynamic to the game that just isn\u0027t there right now.

Thus ( IMHO, others disagree ) the game balance in terms of difficulty/reward is heavily unbalanced towards the Kerbin minisystem ( mainly the Mun and Minmus missions ) in the \u0022Normal\u0022 difficulty , and as the sliders do not address that particular aspect, that behavior is carried towards the other difficulties ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T14:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am ok with the balance shifted towards mun and minmus for new players.
