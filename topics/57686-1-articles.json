Getting into the air so far has not been a problem. Think the wings and the engines are reasonable for the size. If i tweak the control surfaces to smaller max numbers the ossicilations go away with SAS on... also noticed SAS only did it for some altitudes/pitch angles -- i\u0027ll try strutting everything up though, so far had no struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could tweak down the starting fuel and see if it is easier to land with barebones. I guess that is about what it should be returning to the surface with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust slapped those airbrakes on before the screenshots. They drop speed quickly -- first time i tried them i was a little too high up and it sent me into a nose dive. Triggering them at near the last safe second seemed to work, but need to be skimming the surface, which used some engine power to maintain. Got a keyboard landing with them and took off to try again... not so lucky the second time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound engine power could save the day if my glide stalled and started to nose down. Maybe I should pull more/all the weight off the front, so it is easier to keep the nose up on landing -- have cockpit, structural fuselage, and mono-propellent fuselage there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thought it could just be the keyboard input. Not having a flight stick i just plugged in a 360 controller and what a difference. Up and back down on the runway no less on the first try, no air brake it was like i was play Battle Field 1942 again. Landing was a little fast, so i think i\u0027ll map air brakes and other brakes to the gamepad, but so much easier to have at least a thumbstick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i right click a B9 control surface I can set it to \u0027use for flaps\u0027 and use for x? but the x is cut off.

Then click on the control surfaces you are using for rolling your plane (the ones on the outsides of your wings) and change the surface deflection to 10 or 5 or whatever seems to work better. You can also assign control surfaces to be used only for the roll, pitch, or yaw axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the air brakes go, I\u0027d recommend not using them. I tried for a while, but in FAR they\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E (pun intended) less effective than in stock. Just come in for a nice, slow landing without them and turn on the brakes when you hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mod I would recommend to make building planes that much easier would be the RCS Build Aid mod. It has the capability of showing the dry center of mass of your plane. Make sure it is as close to the center of lift as possible. What always seems to happen to my planes is that they lift off fine, get to orbit fine (since they are spaceplanes), but when it comes time to land them, they are uncontrollable because the center of mass has shifted too much. Try moving fuel tanks around to get the center of mass to stay in more or less the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I\u0027ve attached a video from my YouTube channel in which I fly two SSTOs.
