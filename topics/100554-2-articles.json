Not having to send up all your stuff in a single launch really opens the game up. \n\nThe key, I think, is you have to really understand what the NAVball is telling you. Once you understand what the \u0022position\u0022 and \u0022velocity\u0022 indicators really are, docking really isn\u0027t all that difficult.

Well, not tea, but I made dinner. My computer is near my kitchen, and during a landing there\u0027s only a couple quick spots where you need user interaction, especially with the new SAS that can lock onto the retrograde or prograde vectors. As it is, I almost always have several other applications open when I play KSP, since I get bored easily. So yeah, I\u0027ve made lunch or dinner quite a few times while doing something monotonous in KSP.\n\nWhen I say it\u0027s a crutch, I\u0027m not saying that it\u0027s not still useful; it WOULD remove the tedium from an operation you\u0027ve repeated many, many times. (Crutches are useful in real life, after all.) But most of those situations are already somewhat avoidable with a bit of design work; for instance, I haven\u0027t done much docking recently, because most of my designs are SSTOs with plenty of fuel. (My long-range spaceplane can go all the way to Laythe from Kerbin without any refueling, for instance.) My stations are launched in one piece, too, so I don\u0027t need to assemble large objects in orbit too often.\n\nSo as long as you\u0027ve got a few other key mods to help with manual piloting (like the Engineer mod, which adds some critical data readouts) I\u0027d say to avoid any sort of autopilot. Learning how to dock, or do a gravity assist, or optimize a maneuver node will go a long way in making you a better pilot in general."},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:48:36Z","Content":"The only thing I haven\u0027t really done is gravity assists, simply because I\u0027ve never needed to. \n\nI\u0027ve never used an autopilot for any of those things."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:52:28Z","Content":"All of the above save precision landings and gravity assists, I\u0027m still bad at those (though I have done them).\n\nI will say that watching how MechJeb performs some of those maneuvers made me better at them.

I initially docked with MJ, but then discovered DPAI and found that it was super easy to do myself (plus, I not-infrequently find myself having to capture spinning cargo, which \\*requires\\* manual piloting -- while it\u0027d certainly be better automated, and if I used kOS I might write routines to do it, MJ doesn\u0027t handle that situation). I generally execute nodes with MechJeb even when I made them myself, and as soon as I unlock ascent guidance on a career save use it for all ascents (again, I\u0027ve done them without, and can do them OK without, but the ascent is somewhat time-consuming and I\u0027d really rather not have to babysit it for the whole time)."},{"CreatedByName":"obi_juan","CreatedById":89945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T23:24:19Z","Content":"I have always mechjeb installed, but I use it only to deal with task repetition.\n\nBut mechjeb is awful to deal with FAR, with VTOL ships, docking complex ships... but I still using it for the informational windows...
