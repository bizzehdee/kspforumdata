You can certainly do that for the fun of it if you want to, but in my experience it\u0027s not really worth it. Getting from munar orbit back to Kerbin takes very little dV; the only savings you\u0027d get would be saving that amount of dV for the lander\u0027s return, and it would likely be more than offset by the added cost of bringing along more hardware. So I\u0027d suggest just a simple land-and-return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to bear in mind: If you do the mission and end up finding that you\u0027ve slightly miscalculated and don\u0027t have \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E enough dV to make it home again: you can go home in a spacesuit. Kerbal EVA packs are ridiculously overpowered, they have several hundred m/s of dV. Also, kerbals on EVA are astonishingly tough-- they can handle reentry without any problem of overheating, and they can drop out of the sky and land without injury. So if you\u0027re ascending from the Mun and run out of juice, just go EVA, take all the science out of your ship, let go, and just EVA your way home. Hopefully it won\u0027t come to that, but it\u0027s nice to know you have the option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Fun fact: An EVA Kerbal standing on the surface of Minmus can go home without a spaceship, with dV to spare.
