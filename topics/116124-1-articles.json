Get to LKO (you\u0027re already doing that, I assume you need no advice)\n\n2. Boost to go to the Mun, ~850 m/s\n\n3. Enter munar orbit and land, ~1000 m/s. (escape velocity is a good rough measure of that, see [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mun;](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mun;) 800 m/s for Mun, then add a bit to account for not entering its SoI at zero velocity, and for some safety margin)\n\n4. Take off from Mun, achieve orbit, launch back to Kerbin: this is just #3 in reverse, so another ~1000 km/s\n\n5. Aerobrake and land on Kerbin; no dV needed.\n\nSo if you can build a craft that can get itself to LKO, and then have another ~3 km/s of dV on top of that, you should be reasonably well set.\n\nNote: You may be tempted to want to do it somewhat Apollo-style and leave a return-module in orbit around the Mun (i.e. get to munar orbit, detach from orbiter, send a lander down and back, then on return, dock with the return module and leave the lander behind). You can certainly do that for the fun of it if you want to, but in my experience it\u0027s not really worth it. Getting from munar orbit back to Kerbin takes very little dV; the only savings you\u0027d get would be saving that amount of dV for the lander\u0027s return, and it would likely be more than offset by the added cost of bringing along more hardware. So I\u0027d suggest just a simple land-and-return.\n\nAnother thing to bear in mind: If you do the mission and end up finding that you\u0027ve slightly miscalculated and don\u0027t have *quite* enough dV to make it home again: you can go home in a spacesuit. Kerbal EVA packs are ridiculously overpowered, they have several hundred m/s of dV. Also, kerbals on EVA are astonishingly tough-- they can handle reentry without any problem of overheating, and they can drop out of the sky and land without injury. So if you\u0027re ascending from the Mun and run out of juice, just go EVA, take all the science out of your ship, let go, and just EVA your way home. Hopefully it won\u0027t come to that, but it\u0027s nice to know you have the option.\n\n(Fun fact: An EVA Kerbal standing on the surface of Minmus can go home without a spaceship, with dV to spare. Not from the Mun\u0027s surface, though.)\n\nIf you do end up EVAing your way home from the Mun, aim for a higher Kerbin reentry periapsis than you would for a spaceship; ~45km works well. (Kerbals have a lot more drag for their mass than ships do, so the high periapsis allows for more gentle aerobraking and avoids reentry heat. You\u0027ll enter as gently as a feather and won\u0027t even get any reentry f/x.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T03:37:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T03:41:40Z","Content":"I would verify you have enough delta V left after getting into Kerbin orbit.

Then determine what dv and fuel is needed to bring that back from the Mun to Kerbin. Lastly, we know all of that, the lander and the return fuel tanks, needs to be pushed out to the Mun, and since we know how much that payload is together, we can calculate the fuel needed to meet the dv from Kerbin orbit to Mun orbit.\n\nFor just the lander part identify the total weight of the \u0022payload\u0022. Assuming we\u0027ll leave the command module in orbit for the return trip and just bring down the lander:\n\nMk1 Lander Can, .66t\n\nVarious other science and RCS, docking port, etc 1t\n\n(you should do this more accurately\n\n~Payload: 1.66t\n\nUsing [http://garycourt.github.io/korc/](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/) with Mun local gravity and 1500 minimum DeltaV is one way to get ideas, but alot of these are more complicated. I like to uncheck alot of the parts and limit it to a single stage for Mun landers. This isn\u0027t completely accurate but is an intersting starting point. It also verifies for me that the spark has enough thrust/TWR to get such a lander off the ground.\n\nSimple lander might use a FL-T400 Fuel Tank and \u0022Spark\u0022 engine with lots of wiggle room, but that\u0027s 2000 delta V and you might can get away with something smaller if you have toroidal or oscar fuel tanks, especially since my 1t estimate for \u0022science/RCS/legs\u0022 is probably overkill.\n\nI can verify this rocket design by taking it\u0027s wet and dry mass, ISP, switch radio button to specific impulse and Compute: [http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html](http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html)\n\nFull Mass, 4\n\nDry Mass, 1.91 (1.66 \u002B .25 empty T400 \u002B .1 spark)\n\nISP: 300\n\nComputes DeltaV 2174, plenty more than enough.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve decided the lander payload, consider you need to get back to Kerbin: ~230\u002B80 to get back if you aerobreak into Kerbin:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png](http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png)\n\nDetermine how much fuel is needed to get back. This probably wouldn\u0027t be more than 1t fuel, assuming what part of the ship you are bringing back is small. If you are hauling lots of big empty fuel tanks around from Kerbin out to Mun and back, then that\u0027s really bad and a lot of dead weight.\n\nNow consider, you need to get all of that, the lander\u002Bthe fuel for return, out to Mun from Kerbin in the first place. That\u0027s 680\u002B180\u002B80\u002B230=1170dv. \n\nIf the lander\u002Bcommand module\u002Breturn fuel totaled 5t, then you\u0027d need about 3t fuel to obtain that 1170 dv. I can put dry mass 6t into the DeltaV calculator, and guess around 9t wet mass, for a difference of 3t fuel burned, and the calculated DeltaV is 1192.\n\nOf course you need to get that 9t of fuel and ship into Kerbin orbit.\n\nThis is a very rough example, and I\u0027m really not as detailed as most people on this."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T10:10:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just plan it out stage by stage:\n\u003E 1100 m/s to Mun orbit\n\u003E \n\u003E 800 m/s to landing (value given is 640, but if there\u0027s one place for plenty of margin, it\u0027s HERE ... and you can use any excess in your transfer stage too)\n\nThe only thing I\u0027d add, is that ^^^^ is cracking advice when you\u0027re learning - just because Apollo went all the way down in the Lander doesn\u0027t mean you need to - put on an excessive transfer stage - my first landers were de-orbitting dropping down to within a km or so from the Mun\u0027s surface on the Munar injection engine before I separated to leave just the lander - and even then I could well be ditching it with fuel still in it\u0027s tank. \n\nYou \\_will\\_ make a hash of landings, and you will want to make sure you have all the spare fuel you want when you take off and want to come home.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T22:29:46Z","Content":"Thanks for all the help, guys!\n\nSo, about delta-v: How can I get an accurate count of how much I have, while I\u0027m building?
