Funny enough docking a ship with another is by far, much harder than getting to another planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe being able to dock with a station to refuel is not only the first -big- hurdle in KSP, but one that opens doors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Space program tends to be a lot like the Germans in WWII... Now I know what your thinking.. How could you possibly compare the two? Well it\u0027s quite simple.. My ships tend to be far to big, and break alot... Much like the German war machines.. (The Tiger being one of them. Big, Bulky, and despite being very powerful, tended to break alot). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis caused an issue, because I could never properly get a station into orbit it seemed, would be simply to big.. If I tried to slim back on the size, it would be too small and I couldn\u0027t get it into space.. It was a lose/lose. I could never seem to find that sweet spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few attempts, I gave up. Fast forward awhile, I finally decided that today would be the day I do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I managed to finally do it today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy station doesn\u0027t look like a station per-say, since I use ferram which makes aerodynamics matter, I figured, why make an aerodynamically challenged ship and make it harder? Therefore my station just looks like a bloated ship with a lot of extra fuel tanks. That being said, it\u0027s still rather.. huge.. I made 3 docking ports for ships, with 2 red lights on either side of the docking bays. I then placed several lights facing towards where the ship docking would be, to light it up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I managed to dock the refueling ship to it today, and I am so excited.. after about 5 more refueling trips I\u0027ll finally be able to refuel in orbit and reach the distant planets and return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Only regret? I didn\u0027t use single large fuel tanks... /facepalm.. I love the look of the tri coupler, so now I have to individually refuel many many smaller fuel tanks... oh well..

Though the chase view for mine didn\u0027t work well at all since my docking ports are positioned to the side of both ships, which just made me disoriented. It will help with conventional ships with docking ports on the nose. \u003Cp\u003EThat being said, as Caelib said, easy does it. It\u0027s not a race, and the only objective is to simply dock it. When within 500m don\u0027t go above 20ms, and when within 100m don\u0027t go above 5-10ms. Within 30m, stay 5m/s or lower in speed. Switch to the docking button, and use the RCS thrusters from there on out. Again, easy does it. Slow and steady definitely wins the race for docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso..
