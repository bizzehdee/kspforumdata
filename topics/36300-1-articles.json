Think of your rover as a pyramid, where the peak is the center of mass, and the wheels are the base. You want it to be wide and flat with shallow sides, so it doesn\u0027t tip over when pushed to the side. The more height your COM has, the wider you need the wheelbase to be to compensate. Your craft is narrow, with wheels near the COM, which means it can roll easily.
