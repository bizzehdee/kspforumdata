The Deinonychus seems more appropriate to a mod like real fuels than KSPI-E which is about high tech engines and Deinonychus isn\u0027t particualr high tech. This would also solve the issie with fuel tanks not beeing consistent. Thermal nozzle require a fuel rich mixture because only the Fuel is heated in the NTR, the Oxygen is added as an afterburner and connot be mixed like in a regular engine. Note that the ratio is currenly fixed but technically, we could make it variable. This would mean we could make the Lox modes have variable Isp/Thrust similar to how the Vasimr operates.
