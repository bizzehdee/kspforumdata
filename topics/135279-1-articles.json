Each engine searches for fuel, lists the fuel tanks available and then starts pulling from those tanks, backwardish (exact rules on priority for fuel pulling are a touch complicated). It reports its total fuel as the percentage of the total available tankage that contains fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, four engines pulling from one big quarter-full tank plus their own fully-full tank will see a lower percentage per engine available than the total percentage of fuel on the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T04:38:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T14:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, it\u0027s not a \u0022bug\u0022 so much as a missing feature.\u00A0 The engines are greedy and assume that all the fuel belongs to them-- they don\u0027t know that \u0022that fuel is not all mine because someone else will also be drinking it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that the natural, instinctive reaction when seeing something like that is a \u0022well, that\u0027s dumb, they should fix that\u0022... but the problem is actually a surprisingly tricky one to solve, not least because it requires making some assumptions that could prove true or false depending on future user action.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
