Sadly I do not think that is supported with the inbuild mono version. I do that all the time for .NET (real .NET code) and they can show you exactly where the objectss are allocated (down to line of code if debug information is available, otherwise methods). IIRC the unity editor has some such functionality, but then you do not have this available as a user for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T14:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see so much fluctuation in memory usage from just restarting KSP even if I make no changes, I can\u0027t accurately determine the effect anything really has on how much memory is being used. I\u0027ve found that the majority of memory usage comes from added textures and I use the file-size of the mod folders as a very rough estimate of what effect it might have. IE, I reduced the size of my GameData folder by about 250MB by adjusting textures and give or take about 50MB I saw my RAM usage decrease by about that much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
