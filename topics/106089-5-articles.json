Ever since NFP was first released I\u0027ve wanted a lander engine capable of using NFP\u0027s LH resource. This definitely fills that.\n\u003E One idea for a part I\u0027d love to see added here is a radial version of these engines. Way back when in the HOME pack Bobcat had a radial Aerospike that was absolutely perfect for small landers. I build a lot of my landers dropship style so they have a very low vertical profile which means a full length engine can be hard to fit without part clippage.\n\u003E \n\u003E In any case, with the update to NFP rolling along, eventually I think I\u0027ll find it really interesting to try building some hybrid long range landers that use both NFP\u0027s super efficent engines for most stuff and these for landing / takeoff.\n\nRadial engines aren\u0027t really my cup of tea. It\u0027s lots of work to model an engine and a radial engine just seems so... unversatile.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E About the LFO config found in the extras folder, do I just copy the .cfg into all the engine folders or do I place them somewhere else?

I love those LH2/LO2-Engines, they are awesome!\n\u003E \n\u003E I have yet to see if the density of LH2 is believable in the tanks, but even if it isn\u0027t, there sure is a way for me to adjust that to my liking.\n\u003E \n\u003E But there is one thing that I find really odd. It\u0027s the presentation of the exhaust stream of the engines. This slow-motion effect looks cool when you turn the engine or throttle it and the exhaust \u0022lags behind\u0022. But it isn\u0027t really believable to anyone remotely familiar with how engines work. You even show us those amazingly pretty shock diamonds in the exhaust stream (whether they should occur in a vacuum or not is an entirely different story) which make my heart jump with joy! However, as the high Isp of these engines indicates, the exhaust should me moving several km/s and therefore should update instantly as you turn or throttle the engine. Could you consider changing the system to a more static approach? It\u0027ll look so much better for the slightly trained eye!\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you and keep up your excellent work!\n\nI might take another pass at it eventually, perhaps when I do the RO versions. Not really a priority though. \n\nLH2 capacity is calculated based on approximate volumes of stock tanks and is correct assuming 1U= 1L (CRP definition). Oxidizer is about 1U=5L so it\u0027s a bit confusing."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:24:42Z","Content":"Hi Nertea!\n\nAmazing set of engines.

Is it supposed to be like this to balance the engines in the Near Future Propulsion pack? (i\u0027m asking because i haven\u0027t messed around with the engines much, just the tank models, they look amazing)\n\nInteresting to note: if the tanks \\*would\\* fill with LH2 to their maximum logical volume it would open up interesting design possibilities. The oxidizer and lqdhydrogen take up the same space and are used by engines in a 1:1 volume ratio, so two tanks could be stacked but one filled with only the heavy oxidizer and one with the lightweight hydrogen (hard to pull off with stock LFO tanks).

Cryogenic engines in this pack use a 1:10 (ksp unit) or 1:1 (volume as supplied by the tanks in this mod) ratio of LH2 to O\n\nIf balancing were to be done so that the LF and O tank setups would provide 9:11 ratio of fuel to eachother, you would not be able to build separate LH2 an O tankage to feed a cryo engine properly\n\nIf balancing were to be done so that the LH2 and O tank setups would provite the 1:1 ratio of fuel to eachother (volumetrically), you would not be able to build separate LF and O tankage to feed a LFO engine properly\n\nnote: i\u0027m going about this with the assumption that you\u0027re keeping the \\*as is\\* balancing for LH2/O tanks in this mod (1:1 volume ratio between LH2 and O)\n\nLose/lose situation :c\n\nA thing you, i or someone else could do with a handy MM patch is balance the only LF and only O tank setups on a 9:11 ratio to eachother, the LH2 only tanks would have to hold a lot more to allow for separate LH2 and O tanks feeding a cryo engine.\n\nexample: the FL-T800 would have the setups 360/440 LFO ; 4000/400 LH2/O ; 720 LF ; 880 O ; 8800 LH2 (the large amount of LH2 on the LH2 only tank would help with both feeding a cryo engine AND a nerva in LH2 setup, win win, except realism oriented people would be upset)\n\nanother setup: 360/440 LFO ; 4000/400 LH2/O ; 654.54 LF ; 800 O ; 8000 LH2 (this would bring down the volume on the LH2 tank a bit and bring it in line with the LH2/O tank setup, the problem with this way is you get very little volume in the LF tank too and realism oriented people would still be upset)\n\nOf course on both setups you\u0027d want to give the LF and O tanks altered dry mass (.9 and 1.1 times the standard tank mass) to preserve balancing. The only way i see to go about this semi realistically would be to have the cryo engines use a more extreme (volumetric ratio) of LH2 to O2 (2:1, 3:1 or 4:1) but without altering tank dry mass that would make the cryo engines useless.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027d like to add i prefer the as-is balancing if it\u0027s of any worth to anyone, i don\u0027t believe in realism in ksp. Legit looking awesomely modelled engines with a \u0022Cryo!\u0022 sticker slapped on the side? YES; real life fuels setups, nah. There\u0027s RSS and real fuels and whatnot for that.\n\nAlso i pretty much have a patch doing exactly what you want, problem is it\u0027s for the firespitter tank switcher, i\u0027ll post it here if it\u0027s ok and if you\u0027re intereted\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T13:55:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by igor\\_perusco**"}]}
