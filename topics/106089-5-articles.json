It\u0027s the presentation of the exhaust stream of the engines. This slow-motion effect looks cool when you turn the engine or throttle it and the exhaust \u0022lags behind\u0022. But it isn\u0027t really believable to anyone remotely familiar with how engines work. You even show us those amazingly pretty shock diamonds in the exhaust stream (whether they should occur in a vacuum or not is an entirely different story) which make my heart jump with joy! However, as the high Isp of these engines indicates, the exhaust should me moving several km/s and therefore should update instantly as you turn or throttle the engine. Could you consider changing the system to a more static approach? It\u0027ll look so much better for the slightly trained eye!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you and keep up your excellent work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might take another pass at it eventually, perhaps when I do the RO versions.
