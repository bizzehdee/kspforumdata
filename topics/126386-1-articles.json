Kerbal Space Program is a labor of love, and we want to see the game all it possibly can be. In the case of update 1.1, three weeks of QA \u0026 experimentals just wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do justice to the quality of the game we aim for if you consider that nearly all areas of the game have been updated in some way. And that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s assuming we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be able to finish the work on that by the end of the week. This will be the largest overhaul to existing parts of the game we have ever done, and that we ever intend to do. Almost every single part of the user interface has been changed. .Releasing the update with minimal testing is going to leave a lot of bugs unsolved and will ruin the experience of everyone who plays the game. As a result, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve decided to swallow our collective pride, drop the internal pre-Christmas release deadline and push the release for update 1.1 into 2016 meaning that 1.0.5 will have to hold you over until then. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re confident you understand this decision and support it. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This past week then Ted and Joe (Dr Turkey) have been in many meetings, planning the allocation of time and resources for the next couple of months. Pragmatism is key here. Optimizing the internal communication is a big part of this, because all the little changes will amount to large amounts of time won in the long term. On top of all the meetings there we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also got some interesting partnerships looming on the horizon, though it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s too early to talk about them. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Back to development then: it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s getting monotonous saying this but this week is all about more interface work. Felipe (HarvesteR) has updated the final dialog systems that used the old interface system, being amongst others the crew hatch dialog, the science results panel, and the stats tracking prompt on the main menu. Today\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s milestone was that all parts of the user interface have either been transferred into the new system already or the work on them has started. A good sign of progress which is very welcome after six to seven months of user interface work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;More progress comes from Jim (Romfarer) who has been throwing himself at the stage manager and the application launcher positions on the screen, and how that changes in different scenes. Smart use of the screen space in different settings means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re freeing up much-needed space and remove clutter from the screen so we can fill it with different clutter. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The antenna relay system is still being worked on: Bob (Roverdude) implemented new mechanics that will encourage developing robust relay networks with buffs, instead of nerfing the current mechanics. A good relay system will for example allow you to return more science from instruments than is currently possible but it will require a lot more work to set up. Think of how the Curiosity rover uses the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to send signals home, or how Philae uses Rosetta to do the same. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the contract side of the game, Brian (Arsonide) has written a new system which he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been looking forward to for quite some time now: instead of the current behavior where the game generates new contracts in a random way within the restraints of player progress, the game will now attach a weight to every type of contract, and use that to learn the player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s preference of contracts, making those contracts that the player prefers more likely to show up. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Chris (Porkjet) has been tackling the changes that Unity 5 has brought to the shaders. For example, the Blinphong lighting model which is used by most of the part shaders suffers from an odd issue that causes the specular highlights to look as if they are low quality vertex based. Instead of writing a workaround it was a more robust solution to switch to the new \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153standard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Unity 5 shader. The two shaders are very different though, the new standard shader is a physical based rendering model, which means different inputs (for example smoothness and gloss) and outputs (such as metalness and occlusion) are now required and given. Reworking all the textures from scratch is out of the question because it would simply take far too much time, so a conversion had to be worked out and it ended up working quite well. An outstanding advantage of switching to the new shader system is that we can now have shiny real-time reflections on smooth areas like windows and canopies.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Dave (TriggerAu) meanwhile has continued work on the KSPedia and finished around 45 screens to the point where they are ready. The QA team is now going over them with a fine-toothed comb, checking them for any errors that may have slipped in. .\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On to the community then: the forums will be migrating from vBulletin 4 to IPS 4 by the end of the week, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re bringing back the community to its core, which means some data will unfortunately be lost. Kasper (KasperVld) has been working overtime during the weekend to make sure the old links will keep working where possible, and to finish a test migration of the database. The final bits are still being worked on but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very excited to move to a platform that better suits our needs and was actually developed in this decade. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unless unforeseen circumstances crop up the forums will be closed Friday and Saturday to make the transfer possible. After the migration some features may initially be missing and some posts will appear as if not updated yet: after the forum is installed it works in the background to update all existing posts. The KSP forum however has over 2.3 million of them and we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to burn down the data center so this process will likely take a couple of days. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it for this week, be sure to leave your questions on our official forums, Twitter, Facebook or on Reddit!\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:44:57Z","Content":"\nyay! and first!\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut 2016? :C at least we got an amazing version to play until there! :D\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:45:58Z","Content":"\nGood to hear you\u0026#39;re not rushing it, take your time, a good, late update is better than a rushed early one. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I\u0026#39;m [B][I]very[/I][/B] glad to hear about the new contract weighting, that sounds like it\u0026#39;ll help with some of the problems the current system has right now.
