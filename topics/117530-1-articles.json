The screen goes black in normal flight mode, and the map mode is also pitch black but it lags a lot too. If I go back to the space centre, it\u0027s gone and all I can see is the skybox. I\u0027ve seen this glitch before but this is a rather unique instance of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the issue is KSP not being able to recreate a maneuver node I set up years ago because I keep getting null reference exceptions in the tracking station when I click on the craft in question, and when I look at the output log, it says it can\u0027t create the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I can fix it if I remove the maneuver node because that\u0027s what\u0027s causing this whole ordeal, but I have no idea how to remove it without switching to it first - I can\u0027t switch to it first because when I switch to it, the game goes weird with the black screen and everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T15:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe maneuver nodes should be somewhere in the save file.
