I\u0027ve already launched a station, and now I got a new contract: send up 4 Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo complete it, there are two checks: \u0022Crew: at least 4 Kerbals\u0022 and \u0022Dock with Station Core\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I sent a pod with 4 Kerbals, docked with one of several docking ports on the station, and transferred them inside. The \u0022Crew: at least 4 Kerbals\u0022 is checked as complete, but \u0022Dock with Station Core\u0022 is not. I\u0027ve tried re-docking with different docking ports, but it makes no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station is named \u0022Station Core\u0022 and it\u0027s type is Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not sure what is wrong here. Am I missing something, or is this a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T05:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou shouldnt need to transfer kerbals at all, they can stay in their pod and as long as their docked, that part should be checked off\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think that you have run into a naming bug. try closing and reloading.
