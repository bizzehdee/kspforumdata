From what I\u0027ve read, there is a different PQS model being talked about that might work better, but that may not be implemented for a while. This is important for me though, as I\u0027d say at least 30% of the fun of this game (for me at least) is the challenge of landing on another planet/moon without ending up rolling down a mountain or running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T02:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is my compass is off.

So I guessed, perhaps in error, that the commented out values were the original ones that were modified to create the current real solar system config. Based on that info, and the fact that Kerbin is supposedly about 1/10th the size of earth (at least from the information dropped around this thread), I went ahead and simply increased the heightMapDeformity to 75000. My thinking here was that the reason the object is so flattened is because its trying to implement the same vertical height map over a 10x larger horizontal space, resulting in very gradual, flattened terrain. Anyway, initial testing shows that this made the Munar surface look much like it does at stock system size. Right now I\u0027m putting a lander in the same place in the stock game, RSS without my modification, and then RSS with my modification so I can share some pics of the end result.

I\u0027m not sure what else might be wrong, but I\u0027m pretty sure this isn\u0027t the only departure from the config I want to be using. How might I go about making the old config work with the new RSS?

Even that mountain in my testing pics was higher than 20km, but based on visual assessment, if you want to carry the look over from stock, that seems about right. In addition, I\u0027d point out that abnormal proportions are not unheard of beyond earth (e.g. olympus mons). That being said, I\u0027ll have to go back and see if I can find a better balance between how tall everything is and how it feels when going there. After all, I\u0027d personally prefer 75km mountains to landing in a planetary wide flat plain. The problem, of course, is that the height map we\u0027re using doesn\u0027t account for the larger scale, so you can\u0027t really get steep slopes spaced around flatter areas without lots of smoothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for SimplexHeight, there was a setting I tried there (can\u0027t remember exactly what right now) that made the ground look like a cactus, with endless needle sharp spikes sticking out. I\u0027ll have to do some more testing in the next day or two, but it may have been setting persistence too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old cfg is what I was trying, which I\u0027m guessing probably isn\u0027t compatible with the new release. Unless jsimmons decides to update his config to the new release, I may have to make one for myself. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s as simple as converting the orbital body locations to those from the original game, just at a 10x scale? Can you tell me where the original planet files are located so I can work with those numbers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
