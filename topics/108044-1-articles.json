Note the time difference in these two pictures, according to the game I mined 8 tonnes of ore in 12 seconds with a craft that only has 600 ore capacity:\n\n![UhyQbMX.png](http://i.imgur.com/UhyQbMX.png)\n\n![Hj8U5iB.png](http://i.imgur.com/Hj8U5iB.png)\n\n(Ignore the black asteroid texture, it\u0027s a problem with my graphics card (i945GM) that\u0027s been present ever since asteroids were introduced)\n\nI\u0027ve noticed this when mining a planet for ore as well, it manifests itself as your ore tanks jumping instantly to full."},{"CreatedByName":"GagaX","CreatedById":57813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T17:30:45Z","Content":"\u003E I\u0027ve noticed this when mining a planet for ore as well, it manifests itself as your ore tanks jumping instantly to full.\n\nSame thing happened to me.

Was trying to mine Class Es, and each time I intercepted and latched onto one I started my drills and processors. The second I did, the asteroid goes empty, the CG shifts to the ship, and I am left with a single tank of ore. \n\nNot sure what is going on, but I can confirm it is happening consistently, and even after shutting down and restarting.\n\nI was accelerating time with the ship in orbit until I found a class E to latch onto each time... that is the only thing out of the ordinary I can think of."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T08:17:19Z","Content":"Make sure you guys are posting whats required in the sticky: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29)\n\nMost important of all is KSP version and reproduction steps.
