It runs fairly smoothly as long as I\u0027m not looking at Kerbin. The main trick is to lower the texture size and don\u0027t go too crazy with lights everywhere. I run at half textures and there is no visual different between that and full texture size, but the RAM use is about a third less and it\u0027s an easier workload for your video card. A total of eight lights (4 symmetrically placed at each end) plus the lights on the FUSTEK parts fully illuminates my station. Lights will kill your fps more than adding an extra 100 parts will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also basic building principles to limit part count. Some people love adding battery packs everywhere. Five battery packs provides the same power as a single 4K stack battery. That\u0027s four less parts for the same electrical power. Same with those radial monopropellant tanks, people seem to add those all over. #1) they are a pain to fuel because you need to click each one and #2) one of the large monoprop tanks holds 750 monoprop, a radial one holds 40, so 18 radial ones equals one large tank, a difference of 17 parts for the same fuel capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for solar panels.

Do not edit cfg files. Get ModuleManager and write cfg patch files.
