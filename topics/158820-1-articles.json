I know Bdarmory has a radar function, but I don\u0027t like having weapons in a game not meant (imho) to have weapons. Is there a way to make a part similar to the radar in that mod, and maybe even make it detect easter eggs within a certain distance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T07:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t believe there is such a thing, no.
