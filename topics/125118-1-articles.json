I never played the demo version, but the basics should apply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need a spaceship with around 3200 m/s of delta v (energy) to achieve low Kerbin orbit (LKO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon launch, you\u0027ll need to start pointing your craft eastward. Just 5 - 10 degrees early on, then up to around 45 degrees by altitude of 30,000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the map view \u0026lt;M\u0026gt; to see your trajectory and the apoapsis/periapsis indicators. Apoapsis is the highest altitude of your orbit, periapsis is the lowest. You need a minimum of 70,000 m altitude for a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf things start going wrong, hitting \u0026lt;Esc\u0026gt; and reverting back to the pad or the VAB (ship editor) let\u0027s you try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of videos on youtube that can provide more details -- I\u0027m a fan of Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials.
