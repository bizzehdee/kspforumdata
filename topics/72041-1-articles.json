So I know I have to bring something pretty impressive to the table to compensate. I\u0027ll let you all be the judges of whether I\u0027ve succeeded or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I stumbled across the Challenge I\u0027d already gotten a 0.23.5 Career save most of the way through the tech tree using MechJeb and NovaPunch 2 for mods, so that seemed like a good place to start. I added Kethane and KAS and got to work, later adding PreciseNode for mission planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up: the lander, which I named \u003Cem\u003EStork\u003C/em\u003E. I knew I wanted a single universal lander so I\u0027d only have to bring one set of drilling/refining equipment, and it needed to return a full set of science from each moon I visited. A nuclear engine seemed like the obvious choice, especially one of NP\u0027s shorter fusion engines, but I just couldn\u0027t get the TWR I needed to lift off from Laythe or Tylo. The solution I came up with was to mount four aerospike engines on radially mounted boosters to act as \u0022afterburners\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FErO18i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FErO18i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn microgravity, she can land on just the nuclear engine for greater efficiency. On Tylo or Laythe, she can light the aerospikes for extra thrust to get to orbit- and since they\u0027re aerospikes, efficiency is reasonable at all altitudes on Laythe, which is very much not true for the nuke. It took a fair amount of testing with a full-sized mockup on Kerbin, but by using struts to spread out the landing gear I finally had something I was reasonably sure I could land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not easy to see in the shot I ended up with, but the \u003Cem\u003EStork\u003C/em\u003E is actually made up of two modules- the main lander, and a separate section in the rear with the nuclear drive and kethane drill/refinery. That was intentional, because to make the complete \u003Cem\u003EStarcrane\u003C/em\u003E spacecraft I separated the two and put a \u0022Cruise Stage\u0022 in the middle: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PFB2hFL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PFB2hFL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cruise Stage is mostly a giant fuel tank with some extra drives attached to keep acceleration reasonable. It also had a series of docking ports for the Hitchhiker canisters I planned to attach- 4 total for a planned crew of 6, just to make sure there\u0027s plenty of elbow room for the trip out to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c1M7xfD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c1M7xfD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe habs were launched separately on a heavy-lift booster I gave a suitably heroic name to but have been unable to think of as anything but \u0022the wedding cake\u0022. They also served to fuel up the \u003Cem\u003EStarcrane\u003C/em\u003E, since the Cruise Stage burned itself pretty much empty getting into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MDv4yQo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MDv4yQo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the Cruise Stage partially assembled, with two habs attached and a lab module forward. I did the weight calculations out, and it turns out that if you\u0027re landing on all five of Jool\u0027s moons with the same craft you do save (a little) weight by cleaning out and reusing your Science Jrs. and Goo Capsules instead of bringing extras. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hxLHGyZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hxLHGyZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS has been a lot of fun to play around with and has made modular ship design a lot easier, since I can dock the modules and then install struts to help brace them. Here Chuck Kerman works the day shift, hooking up the lander module to the Cruise Stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/luPLfuC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022luPLfuC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all 4 habs are attached! Since each one was launched separately, I got to put a different flag on each. In addition to the KASA logo, the \u003Cem\u003EStarcrane\u003C/em\u003E proudly bears the logos of our sponsors: NovaPunch, Kethane, and Squad Development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7YfrewG.png\u0022 alt=\u00227YfrewG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here she is, assembled in all her glory in LKO. Mass, with not quite full fuel tanks, is just under 400 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where do we go from here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First stop will be Minmus. I\u0027m planning to land the entire ship, with the help of KAS anchors winched down from the habs to brace her. The Minmus landing will essentially be a dress rehearsal for microgravity kethane mining/refueling- if there are problems I want to find out about them before we get to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Entire ship boosts out to Jool. I\u0027m planning to aerobrake a bit, but have some reserve fuel in case I don\u0027t lose as much velocity as I\u0027d like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to Pol. Yes, you read that right. The ship\u0027s built to refuel, and I don\u0027t want to do that at the bottom of a gravity well. Assuming the Minmus operation went well I\u0027ll land the whole ship with anchors and fill her up all at once. Otherwise it\u0027ll be a bunch of trips with the lander, but with the Cruise Stage in orbit I\u0027ll only be burning a few m/s to and from Pol\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the ship refueled I\u0027ll have the delta-v to explore Jool system at my leisure. Visit the moons, take samples, get a full set of scientific observations, and move on. Bop is a potential refueling point in the middle, since it also has low gravity. The only major complication is that at Tylo and Laythe I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to hit a kethane deposit the first time I land- the \u003Cem\u003EStork\u003C/em\u003E has enough delta-v to land on those moons, but not enough to take off without surface refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Refuel once more at Pol or Bop before heading home. The lab module has been outfitted with solar panels and a control module, and will be left in Jool orbit for possible use by later expeditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Return home with a full set of science for Jool\u0027s SOI and high/low space for each moon. Since I don\u0027t have any science from Jool currently I am expecting a ridiculous number of science points that will more than make up for my stupidly large ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Did I mention I\u0027ve only done one interplanetary transfer before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well.
