Remote tech also plays a part in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission I had planned involved placing two small communication satellites in munar orbit with a manned ship to conduct science also (similar to what Scott Manley did). The first part of the mission went by nominally. The problem occurred when I realized I placed a decoupler backwards so it was stuck on the engine. This prevented the engine from generating any propulsion to conduct the munar capture burn. I was basically stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news was that I was not on an escape trajectory out of kerbin. The apogee of my new orbit was around the altitude of the mun while the perigee was near geosynchronous orbit altitude. The bad news was that I didn\u0027t pack enough snacks to keep the kerbal alive for long. I had just over 12 hours of life support remaining. I would reach the perigee in 12 hours. If I conducted a rescue mission, it would be close. (due to the nature of the orbit, it would have been basically impossible to get back just by pushing on the pod from EVA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I quickly put together a rescue mission. I would only have one shot at doing this correctly. Because the remote tech communications network was not yet fully established, I needed the rescue ship to be manned. I had not unlocked much in the way of command pods so I just stacked two command pods on top of each other and had one piloted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched the rescue mission into low kerbin orbit and waited for an intercept. I got a decent intercept and completed the burn. Unfortunately, I was running low on fuel. As I got closer to the target, I was closing in at 700 m/s. After I burned all of my fuel, velocities were still about 400m/s apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstinctively, the brave kerbonaut of the doomed ship went on EVA to try and match velocities. At this point, he had minutes of life support left that he took with him on EVA. I was in no position to be patient. I watched the distance from target increasing. Eventually, the relative velocities started slowing down until they started getting closer. I made it to the rescue vessel with minutes to spare and about 20% pack fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves one problem: The rescue vessel is out of fuel. I included RCS on the ship but being the idiot I am, I forgot to include thrusters. Luckily, I packed enough life support to keep the two kerbals alive for 5 days. Plenty of time to plan another rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is not much to say about the secondary rescue mission. It wasn\u0027t hard. I included more than enough fuel. It successfully rescued the rescued and the rescuer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy did I go to such great lengths to save a single kerbal? First of all, it\u0027s fun.

Bill (the only survivor of the original 3 as Bob and Jeb had both died in TAC Life Support related incidents) did NOT kill all of his velocity and like a moron he smashed in to the Mun, leaving only his capsule, 1 day of life support and some solar panels - the dark side of the Mun was coming and he would run out of electricity and die should he not be rescued. What follows is probably one of my proudest moments as a KSPer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did originally have an unmanned rescue lander orbiting the Mun due to a failed rescue mission of Bob, so I tried landing that. Unfortunately, the unmanned technology did not do its job and again that crashed in to the Mun at high velocity, leaving nothing. I designed and sent a rescue mission as soon as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, Bill was entering the dark side and he his life support was running low. As I entered Munar orbit with the rescue vessel, Bill had ran out of everything and was on the cusp of death, and so I set about the descent. Achieving the first pinpoint landing of my entire career, landing mere meters from the stranded Bill, he EVA\u0027d and made it to the rescue vessel with literally minutes to spare, and happily he gorged on snacks and oxygen as the unmanned technology took him back to Kerbin, and he was praised as a hero. TAC really does make things a lot more interesting and especially for me personally as I don\u0027t use respawns and if all the original 3 had been killed, I would have been seriously dissappointed.

I also decided to attach a landing probe to gather some sweet science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I have remote tech, I had to set up a ring of satellites to beam information back and forth to the Probe. That was the first challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second was to make a nice probe from the parts I unlocked in career. After fitting it all together, it was time to send it off to Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying with remote tech gives the game quite a nice challenge and the Map Scans make probes more interesting to send to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso having to plan the mission according to remote tech\u0027s line of sight and power requirements was also a nice challenge and once everything came in place the sense of reward was incredible: \u0022I did it all myself.\u0022 Detaching the landing probe and landing it on the surface of Duna while communicating to the Orbiting satellite relaying info back to Kerbin gave me quite a different appreciation for real life Mars missions and all the detail and engineering it has to go into it to make it all work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a brilliant game.
