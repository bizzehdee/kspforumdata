I\u0027ve also tried editing the persistence file and deleting all the rcs blocks, but that just disappeared large chunks of the station.

The parameter has a number which describes the parent part of the current part. The parts are numbered in the order they appear in the VESSEL{} section, starting from 0. So, when you remove a PART{}, you mess the ordering up. You might be able to get around this by manually editing all of the \u0022parent = xx\u0022 lines (e.g. if you delete the 5th part -- part number 4 --, you\u0027d have to subtract 1 from all of the \u0022parent = x\u0022 lines where x is 5 or above.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
