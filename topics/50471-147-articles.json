I wanted to stick with 7-3 so after accidentally ending up with Coruscant on my night-time side and a couple other minor issues, I got it working! I also just noticed and I don\u0027t think it was like that before, but the city lights appear to be some distance off the ground, noticeable when looking from the side and not from above.

I believe Scott Manley said in one of his videos when he was trying out RSS some time ago that the engines also had their power increased to compensate for the rescaled Kerbin (and the Kerbol system).

I did my first day-time flight and I was rather appalled to be honest. Not at RSS. But at the way RSS and EVE worked together. The clouds were flying above at supersonic speeds and they were passing me when I was flying at Mach 1 (real immersion-breaker for me). Also due to the geometry of how the clouds are set, the vertices of the grid are where they should be but then the planes between them disappear into the ground, causing a sudden appearance/loss of clouds that are going into or coming out of the ground at ground level (another immersion-breaker for me). I probably fly in the atmosphere 80% of the time I play KSP so I had to let go of RSS for now. Without EVE I\u0027m sure RSS is great, but EVE is just as important to me as FAR and B9, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t committed to yet nor started a Career mode save and I use sandbox to build and fly aircraft about 95-99% of the time so I\u0027ll still keep an eye out for any improvements. Though I\u0027ll probably begin a Career mode save once B9 gets a new official update. Again, I\u0027m sorry that I have to say all of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
