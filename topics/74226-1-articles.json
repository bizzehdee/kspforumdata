But all I found in there were planes. I loaded a few and then I proceeded on with my career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this has done is set my green \u0022Launch\u0022 button to always send my rockets to the runway instead of the launchpad. And I guess this also explains why all my rocket parts come in sideways (flipped 90 degrees) when I grab a new part. I always have to click the \u0022W\u0022 key to rotate the part vertically before I do anything. The game thinks my rocket parts are plane parts, because I notice the plane parts were all flipped 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line... how do I make the game understand that I\u0027m building rockets, not planes?

You get science points by having your kerbals run experiments in their ships on on extra vehicular activity (EVA) which are used to unlock more parts to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe starting technology you have does not allow you to build space planes to launch off the runway. You lack wings and landing gear. You get wings by the time you unlock the second tier of the center branch in your tech tree. You get landing gear on the bottom branch by the 5th. Because of this (and a noticeable lack of types of landing gear) you\u0027ll rarely if ever use the Spaceplane hangar. It can be fun to play with though. Most of my laughs are at space planes spiraling off into destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of the subassemblies tab in each builder allows you to transfer a ship between the VAB and the SPH or vice versa if you take the whole ship minus a starting part and put it in the subassemblies spot.
