There are no tricks or \u0022be careful whens\u0022 in this craft, it flies exactly as you\u0027d expect and has good control authority throughout the flight profile to authentically replicate a complete real Space Shuttle flight. The simplest way to fly is with MechJeb, since launching the same way a dozen times to build a space station can get tiring!\n\nWithout MechJeb, I suggest you use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Radial mode during launch and roll maneuver, roll heads down to your desired heading and pull up until your prograde vector points about 10 degrees along your desired heading, then just switch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Prograde mode the rest of the way.\n\nOtherwise, there are NO \u0022be careful it will flip over at X thrust/altitude\u0022 or \u0022you have to manage the throttle blah blah blah\u0022 instructions with this shuttle.  Just fly.  You have full control authority in all flight regimes, you can easily stress the wings off if you attempt to fly too sporty but you can experiment with all REAL shuttle maneuvers including RTLS and reentry side slips.\n\n**Suggested MechJeb settings for authentic launch profile**\n\nThese settings will send you on a launch profile that closely replicates a real shuttle launch. You can see why the shuttle flies upside down on its way to orbit (it helps shield the wings from the airflow), and how it uses a gravity turn to reach orbit. You can also watch the boosters separate and coast to a maximum height before landing back in the ocean for a safe recovery, and how the external tank remains sub-orbital for disposal even after the main engines shut down. Use these numbers as a guideline, you\u0027ll have to adapt them depending on your payload and orbit target. For reference, this shuttle has been tested to successfully launch an 18T fuel tank to a 300km 90 degree polar orbit.\n\n    Orbital Altitude: 100 to 500km\n    Orbital Inclination: 0 to 90 degrees\n    Limit Acceleration to: 40m/s (this is about 3Gs, just to replicate the real shuttle limits)\n    Force Roll:  (This replicates the shuttle\u0027s roll maneuver after launch)\n      Climb: 180\n      Turn: 180 (Real shuttle rolled to heads up during the last third of their launch post-1995ish, just change this to 0 when you want to roll to heads up, or leave it at 180 to simulate the earlier launch profile)\n    Corrective Steering: on\n    Autostage: on\n      Pre-Delay: 0\n      Post-Delay: 0\n      Stop at stage: 4\n    \n    Edit Ascent Path:\n    Automatic Altitude Turn: off\n      Turn start altitude: 0.5km\n      Turn start velocity: 100m/s\n      Turn end altitude: 60km\n      Final flight path angle: 8 degrees\n      Turn shape: 66%\n\n**Action Groups:**\n\n1 - Toggle OMS engines\n\n2 - Shut down SSME\n\n3 - Toggle CargoBayDoors/Lights/K-Band Antenna\n\n9 - Toggle OMS fuel dump\n\n10 - Deploy braking chute\n\nHere are some \u0022concept\u0022 shuttle variations that NASA explored during the Shuttle\u0027s golden age.

His shuttle is probably easier to fly, particularly for landings, and his RCS balancing helps a lot with on-orbit operations. I\u0027ve mainly focused on the ascent, trying to make it so that my shuttle can re-create the various abort scenarios and the flight profile relatively accurately. I also have been working on re-entries, testing S-turns and such, but landing is not something I\u0027m all that good at ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I\u0027ve been playing on a Mac so I really haven\u0027t been able to use any plugins to help with the build since it just keeps crashing once I add any, but I definitely want to look into the RCS balancing now that I\u0027ve tried his shuttle.\n\nIt\u0027s not so much competition as it is taking the best bits from everyone\u0027s shuttles and making what each of us think is best =D Lots of shuttle forks if you will lol\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T12:23:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Naito**"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T00:21:45Z","Content":"Updated with a split-rudder airbrake!"},{"CreatedByName":"Naito","CreatedById":18126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:01:07Z","Content":"Updated Revision 1.5, rather major update that rebalanced the SSMEs.
