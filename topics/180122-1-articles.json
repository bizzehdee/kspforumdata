I could refuel it in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E that would be pretty fun I guess! I like docking even though I\u0027ve only done it a few times. And i would prefer to get back to kerbin again. For the landing, yeah I would like to land on the wheels. I did that the first and only time I landed on Duna. I\u0027m not sure what the mass of the cargo is yet because I haven\u0027t made it. I\u0027m working on that right now but to be honest I dont really care. I\u0027m just playing sandbox and having fun. All I want is to bring more than the science junior and the other small gadgets... As long as I can actually move it out of the cargo bay and to the surface of Duna then I\u0027m pleased. Could be a tiny rover or a small rocket with a science lab or just a rocket with some kerbals on it. And I\u0027ve never tried to launch a spaceplane vertically, nor tried to land one vertically. I\u0027ve only built 1 functioning spaceplane \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that I landed on Duna and crashlanded in the ocean on Kerbin and that took me 5 days.
