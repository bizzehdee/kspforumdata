If I make the Kerbal let go, the ship heads off in one direction and Jebediah, Valentina or whoever tumble away in another. I\u0027ve tried chasing the ship using RCS but with it tumbling so chaotically it\u0027s impossible to get a grip and board (for me anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can I do to prevent this, or at least work with it?

Is that still too close to the hatch/ladder?
