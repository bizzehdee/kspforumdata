You can re-download it and install it into a different folder, as noted above. Then, you can copy your save file from the updated copy to your new 0.90 install, and everything should work nicely. \n\nIf you bought the game through Steam, I would imagine it\u0027s possible do do something similar, but I\u0027m not the guy to ask about that."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:02:59Z","Content":"The game won\u0027t auto-update itself. However, if you are running steam, steam might update for you.\n\nAs was stated, if you are downloading from the store, just unzip the new download to a new directory.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
