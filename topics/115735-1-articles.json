My next step in my career is to get to the Mun, I have upgrade the Launch pad to, well, I guess you would call it Tier 2. I built a ship appr. 34t, and I do not have the Launch Stability Enhancers(not enough science). I can\u0027t launch my ship, I assume the nozzles of my craft are getting stuck in the launch pad grate? I can start the SSR\u0027s (BACC Thumpers) and nothing happens, then I hit the \u0022stage\u0022 button, and wahlah! I launch, but the horrible spin is not very conducive to a successful trip to space. Help!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T19:01:28Z","Content":"Hi Mango, yeah the tier 2 pad is sticky, it\u0027s the grill I think, your best option is to use launch clamps, though there is a bug with them, so another option is to use decoupler \u0022feet\u0022.\n\nI also find that by moving my craft off to the side far enough it\u0027ll be on the concrete and won\u0027t stick."}]}
