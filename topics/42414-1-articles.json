Towns could be collections of house models. Having actual Kerbals walking around in them is probably an unrealistic suggestion, but that would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn linking the cities could be simple roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the coolest aspect of these cities would be if they lit up at night and where visible from space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think this would make Kerbin seem like a much more vibrant and living place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has been suggested before, I just wanted to provide my take on it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T03:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood day, please see the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E list, Cities are listed down the bottom under miscellaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
