It was a system designed by a German entrepreneur, you can read about it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTRAG was a system for massively parallel rockets. The idea was, you built a rocket out of many individual rocket lifting units, and instead of stacking them on top of each other, you stacked them side by side. That way, the same rocket would be used, just in different quantities, thus (hopefully) resulting in economies of scale. They would ideally only ever have one rocket design, and would just add more rockets for heavier payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/z/zotrstg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zotrstg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system never got off the ground for various reasons, but I\u0027ve always found it interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, massively parallel rockets are nothing new in Kerbal Space Program - people have been using them for a long time to lift heavier payloads than they probably should have. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But I decided to check out making an OTRAG-style launch system, using only one rocket engine type, and with all engines having their own fuel supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy system, however, is a little different. In OTRAG, they did regular staging, it was just with parallel rockets. In my attempt, I wanted to create a launch system that used no staging whatsoever. It should all be a single stage. My thinking was, \u0022if 4 rocket units can achieve orbit with no staging, carrying X payload, then 16 rocket units should be able to do the same, but with a heavier payload.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my two rules are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. All rockets must be the same type, and have the same amount of fuel. No cross-feed allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Nope! These rockets will cost you quite a lot more than a vertical, normal staged rocket - assuming you have access to those engines. And of course the economies of scale never enter the equation, because in KSP, no matter how many rockets you build, they all cost the same amount. The one big advantage it has, though, is the ability to launch very heavy payloads into orbit from pretty early on in the tech tree. And if you wanted to make an OTRAG-style launcher with bigger engines and tanks, you could put huge payloads into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou pretty much need to get to struts in the tech tree, though. These things do not fly well without some stabilization.
