It was a system designed by a German entrepreneur, you can read about it here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG)\n\nOTRAG was a system for massively parallel rockets. The idea was, you built a rocket out of many individual rocket lifting units, and instead of stacking them on top of each other, you stacked them side by side. That way, the same rocket would be used, just in different quantities, thus (hopefully) resulting in economies of scale. They would ideally only ever have one rocket design, and would just add more rockets for heavier payloads.\n\n![zotrstg.jpg](http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/z/zotrstg.jpg)\n\nThe system never got off the ground for various reasons, but I\u0027ve always found it interesting.\n\nNow, massively parallel rockets are nothing new in Kerbal Space Program - people have been using them for a long time to lift heavier payloads than they probably should have. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) But I decided to check out making an OTRAG-style launch system, using only one rocket engine type, and with all engines having their own fuel supply.\n\nMy system, however, is a little different. In OTRAG, they did regular staging, it was just with parallel rockets. In my attempt, I wanted to create a launch system that used no staging whatsoever. It should all be a single stage. My thinking was, \u0022if 4 rocket units can achieve orbit with no staging, carrying X payload, then 16 rocket units should be able to do the same, but with a heavier payload.\u0022 \n\nSo my two rules are: \n\n1. All rockets must be the same type, and have the same amount of fuel. No cross-feed allowed.\n\n2. The system should deliver a payload to LKO in one stage.\n\nSo here\u0027s what I have so far:\n\n**OKRAG 16**\n\n![V9crSW2.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/V9crSW2.png?1)\n\nThis vehicle can deliver a 16-ton payload to a 100km orbit.\n\n**OKRAG 32**\n\n![RD4113y.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/RD4113y.png?1)\n\nThis vehicle can deliver a 32-ton payload to a 100km orbit (actually somewhat more).\n\nIs this a good idea, from an economics standpoint? Nope! These rockets will cost you quite a lot more than a vertical, normal staged rocket - assuming you have access to those engines. And of course the economies of scale never enter the equation, because in KSP, no matter how many rockets you build, they all cost the same amount. The one big advantage it has, though, is the ability to launch very heavy payloads into orbit from pretty early on in the tech tree. And if you wanted to make an OTRAG-style launcher with bigger engines and tanks, you could put huge payloads into orbit.\n\nYou pretty much need to get to struts in the tech tree, though. These things do not fly well without some stabilization. Also, in the OKRAG 32, I had to put fins on the bottom, as it had a tendency to flip over at about 15km.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T12:09:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:12:01Z","Content":"When I read the first bit of this thread I was thinking \u0022...Great.

Fantastic!\n\nOTRAG is not quite boosters, it\u0027s using a cheap, simple rocket design as both the core stage and boosters. \n\ni did something similar a while back. there was the Tiny Cat 1 that could get about 5t into orbit, using a long 1.5m tank (from a mod) and engine. then the TC2, which was a TC1 rocket with 2 other TC1 cores setup as an asparagus staged boosters. next one (Tiny Cat 3) had 3 TC1 rockets as a central stage, with 3 asparagus TC1 boosters.\n\ni think the TC4 might have had a TC3 core with 6 asparagus boosters, in two stages.\n\nfrom memory there were also heavy versions that used SRBs on the initial launch.\n\nthey were cool to design, but not practical in Kerbal logic.\n\n@RocketBlam it would be cool to see what your rockets could do if you had them staged, either asparagus or sequential."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T05:21:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @RocketBlam it would be cool to see what your rockets could do if you had them staged, either asparagus or sequential.\n\nWell, yes and no. \n\nI have no doubt that I could make a more cost-efficient launch system using staging... as I said, lower costs are not a feature of this get-up. But staged, massively-parallel rockets have been done in KSP, and frankly, they\u0027ve been done to death.

The lift grows linearly while the structural costs grow exponentially. It\u0027s not a very fast growth and until a point it\u0027s not much of a pain. I\u0027m fairly sure OKRAG-128 would be a total pain to hold together, and OKRAG-256 would simply not be doable because it would rip itself apart on the landing pad - or fail to lift off due to the total strut weight."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:25:15Z","Content":"That sounds like a very Kerbal way to build rockets ^^\n\nBut, anyway, this type of design might be interesting, though not for larger payloads...\n\nAnd, btw, due to the natural logarithm in the rocket equation, twice as much rockets do not mean twice the payload to orbit, unfortunately.

Alternately you could think of shooting up two individual identical rockets with identical payloads, and then just strutting them together. Double the rockets and double the payload.\n\nNote the above logic ignores strut weight, so doubling the rockets does result in just under double the payload, unless you use certain mods (such as KJR).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T21:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T21:41:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E because it\u0027s in nautical miles.\n\nWhich raises the question of why the altitude is indicated in nautical miles, which are only really useful for navigation along the surface of the Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T22:10:04Z","Content":"The soviet N1 was supposed to work in a kind of similar way.
