Well each of those programs has a system in place in which you can build a part; save; and then reference that part in another model via xref (in autocad). If changes are made to the reference model they are carried over into the \u0022master model.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I think this is useful is that throughout a career one gets upgraded parts and wants to change parts within a model without having to rebuild the entire craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo imagine it like this. In my Science career I like to build a shuttle system for LKO. I build the orbiter in the SPH to have it horizontal and make sure COL And COM are all good. Once completed Load her up in the VAB and mount her up to the ET and boosters (just like the Space Shuttle used to do *tear*).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the current system is that when I first build it I usually don\u0027t have all the parts to make a shuttle system that is large enough or I just feel like upgrading. So when you go to upgrade your orbiter you basically have to rebuild your entire launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we could build with xrefs we could just load the orbiter assembly in the SPH and modify it make sure your COL and COM are copacetic, and pop it on the ET and booster assembly make minor adjustments and go to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I figure that the current \u0022merge\u0022 function attempts this, but fails miserably every time I try to use it in this way. And the \u0022sub-assemblies\u0022 doesn\u0027t allow vehicles without attachment points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T22:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited thread title for clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand this suggestion correctly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You want to start off by building a small shuttle, with a small cargo bay, small cockpit, small engines etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - When you progress through career mode, you unlock bigger / better parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You want to click a button to automatically swap out the small cargo bay with the bigger / long one, swap out the small engines with the bigger / more powerful ones etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You want the other parts on the current vessel you\u0027re not interested in changing (e.g. the cockpit) to automatically shift position to work with the bigger cargo bay / engines etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I read this right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T21:10:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFix typographical errors\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrokracker","CreatedById":137300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly. Nothing automatic with anything. So if you were. To create an assembly such as a shuttle system. It would be composed of multiple sub assemblies that can be edited on their own. For example if you were to extend the cargo bay in the orbiter you could open the sub assembly and edit it independently from the et and booster system. Then reload the full vehicle and the changes to the orbiter would be there. You would then obviously have to adjust the assembly for changes in COM and/COT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe subassemblies system would work but the added feature to edit them independently and have then update when referenced to a vehicle would be amazing. I would also suggest the ability to choose whether a sub assembly is bound to the changes made or not if the same sub-assemly is used in multiple vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight.

I believe the reason for this is to make it easier to share crafts between users - just send one craft file with all the parts, instead of several craft files with interlinking relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrokracker","CreatedById":137300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see where there would be pleased problems with dependencies. But giving the option to bind and unbind would be the key to sharing between users and not have a problem. Although once a craft would be saved all the depencoes would be there. A relationship manager would have to deal with this issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are going to be issues within a users crafts already also. Say you change the cargo bay and the current bay is an attachment point to the et. That relationship would be broken upon updating. It would get quite complex with struts I\u0027m sure. But I think it\u0027s doable as once you detach a part and reattach it currently its minor to fix those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
