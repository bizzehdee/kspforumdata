I have searched these forums and can not find anything so apologies if I have missed something.\n\nSearching the web it would appear that there should be other contracts but I can not find them, I have tried going higher and faster in case there is one hidden but I just run out of cash.\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T16:22:53Z","Content":"Are you referring to the little drop-down window?
