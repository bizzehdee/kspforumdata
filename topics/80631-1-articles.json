Real planes, including those modeled in proper flight sims, are precisely constructed, which allows for very fine tuning, which in turn provides a ride that\u0027s quite smooth for the pilot. You\u0027ll notice in proper flight sims that it isn\u0027t particularly hard to keep control of the plane with minimal knowledge, and this even translates into real life as well to a degree. Planes are just designed this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in KSP, planes are cobbled together from various parts that aren\u0027t necessarily designed to work with each other. Thus, planes in KSP aren\u0027t as easy to use out of the box compared to a realistically constructed plane, be it simulated or otherwise. This is why the shuttle mods like Buran from Bobcat or the KSOS fly better out of the box compared to a freeform design. They\u0027re full models that are just broken up into pieces rather than pieces stitched together into a model. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the issue with controls.

You mean FAR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anyway, the allure of spaceplanes is that you can get about twice the payload to orbit for the fuel consumption. That, and the challenge of designing a good spaceplane is far greater than that of a good rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With better aerodynamics plugins like FAR, you actually have to build your craft fairly aerodynamically as well. Meaning you can\u0027t put mostly-flat surfaces along the leading edge (ie. the front-side of the craft) and expect to have any sort of stable flight past mach 2 (and it\u0027ll be shaky before then even at that). A good tip for a balanced spaceplane is to place the fuel mass on the sides of the fuselage, and have the central part of your spaceplane have no draining of physical resources at all. If you use tweakables to empty and refill the fuel tanks, you can gauge when they are at the point of least resistance (ie. the center of mass does not meaningfully shift at all as the fuel levels change), meaning your craft will fly the same at a full tank as it does on an empty one. Besides making sure you have enough aerodynamic and control surfaces, and making sure center of lift is slightly behind center of mass, that\u0027s all you really need to know to make spaceplanes easy to build in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, one last warning: gauge your center of mass/center of lift balance \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E you add landing gear.

Personally, I find atmos/exatmos flynig rather dull without at least FAR, Deadly Reentry and a _bunch_ of parts for aircraft, in particular cockpits (edit; CARGO BAYS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spend a clear majority of my time playing KSP in the design phase. Generally when a plane is done, it can perform extended missions in a reasonable amount of (real world) time. Transonic testing is usually what takes the most time-- getting the center of lift and center of mass in the right spots so that it flies well at mach 0.5 as well as mach 5 can take a lot of fiddling about with wing angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying space planes definitely moves the focus to the craft creation, even if you don\u0027t go overboard with cost/performance like I tend to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T10:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SSR Kermit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T10:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eplane in KSP is lackluster now.\u003Cp\u003Ethe lack of a stock cargo bay make the whole point of flying a plane meaningless, and how weak the stock control surfaces are forces you to install B9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut the problem of B9 is, the maker hasnt updated it since 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou have to find the communtiy fixes for the .dll youself\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fly spaceplanes almost exclusively, and I don\u0027t use B9 (just downloaded Spaceplane Plus today, but I don\u0027t expect to use it much; sure, they\u0027re pretty, but all your planes end up looking kinda the same if you use those parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile a stock cargo bay would certainly be a sensible addition, it isn\u0027t that hard to build your own from parts.
