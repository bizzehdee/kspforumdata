The idea is that by making the base wide, it can land on slopes without falling over. But I had set MechJeb to show the TWR on Mun, and then I tried to land on Kerbin. and there wasn\u0027t quite enough thrust.\n\nOne thing I had done was use one of the multiple-engine adaptors in the Space-Y set. which gave me space to carry extra fuel and stuff. The sky over the Space Center experienced a rain of decouplers and part-filled fuel tanks. but I couldn\u0027t quite get rid of enough weight."},{"CreatedByName":"Sorcie","CreatedById":61164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T17:40:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But I had set MechJeb to show the TWR on Mun, and then I tried to land on Kerbin. and there wasn\u0027t quite enough thrust.\n\nI\u0027ve done this! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:03:38Z","Content":"I rather like the cockpit. It\u0027s the M27 from the B9 Aerospace Parts mod, but it took me a while to find it. You can put a tube under the cockpit to mount a docking port, but I recommend adding a few struts if you want the connection to the cockpit to hold up to parachutes. The Fustek set has a docking module which works well, and there\u0027s a couple of alternatives. With two kerbonauts in the cockpit and four in that conical capsule you have something that can be a good start for supporting a space-station.\n\nThere are other alternatives in stock that can carry the extra kerbonauts. The PDP-10 Hitchhiker container, for instance, has the same diameter as the command capsule. A bit of length, to allow two widespaced rings of RCS thrusters, lets the beast handle some awkward objects.\n\nI have already mentioned this on Twitter. Searching for the right part can be tricky. I should have done some better planning when I loaded the Mods, there are some thoroughly awkward Mod creators out there, and the default filters (use the Advanced tab in the VAB) could be better. You can filter by the (fictional) manufacturer, you pick by clicking on the corporate flags, but they are tiny grey-scales. Some designs, OK in colour, are just grey blobs. At least there is a text pop-up.\n\nThis is a bit like discovering that you only have one button on the mouse."}]}
