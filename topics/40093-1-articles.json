As for the impact force, I think that means that each wheel can handle 15m/s of vertical downward force. The Mk1 Aircraft Cockpit has an impact tolerance of 45, so it can handle smashing into the ground at anything less that 45m/s.

Impact force can be calculated by kinetic energy / distance required to stop the object. You do not, however, have to include the distance in the equation since things in KSP stop instantly (they do not sink into the ground or become deformed). I tested this with an imaginary spacecraft: Weight 5000 kg, impact velocity 100 m/s. Using the equation, I got an impact energy of 25,000,000 J. That\u0027s equivalent to 1 kg of TNT. I think that\u0027s about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just noticed I only calculated the amount of energy released in the impact. I don\u0027t think one can calculate impact force though. Force in newtons is 1 J / m, which in the above example would be 25,000,000 J / 5000 kg, but that leaves me with 5000 N, which is only a tenth of the force the craft would exert on the body if it was just lying on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T18:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T18:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I am building a lander and wanted as few parts as necessary.

The severity of the impulse is its duration. The common expression of force is F=ma but Newton actually expressed force as F=dp/dt or in words the time rate of change of momentum. Impulses (changes of momentum) with short durations result in high forces and impulses that take a while are low forces. For short duration interactions the local gravity is insignificant compared to the existing momentum due to motion. Basically a 60mph crash is the same sideways or downward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
