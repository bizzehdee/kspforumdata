Bloody things always, always seem to tumble or have runway issues, lack fuel or are too heavy for their wings. I tried iterating on designs but most of the time it made more sense to scrap the whole thing rather than try to adjust it, they were so far off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even started using my nemesis... FAR aerodynamics mod. I\u0027ve had maaaaaany issues in the past with this, but for in atmosphere flight with wings I figured I would rather have realism than bang my head against the wall any more. Perhaps my planes have come a long way since then and I might have success in the old model, but well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing OK now.

I was trying to build an SSTO PURELY to ferry up one Kerb at a time, going small every time because I thought it would be more efficient for an atmospheric craft with a rocket strapped on the back. This thing (probably in part thanks to the huge Sabre engines in B9\u0027s pack) gets to 100km orbit with roughly 1/3rd its fuel empty (about 1200 / 1700), and with 3 engine options including the nuclear inline which gets great mileage of course. Oh, and a cargo bay. That means many Kerbs \u002B fuel. O.o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying her in now, hitting the atmosphere I forgot I needed to put the fuel in the front to keep from going in backwards.

Just an orbit capable small plane that can hold 2 Kerbals. I must have made 20 or more that looked similar to that (and yet often different as well). It was important that I make it myself, though I did try a few designs from the premade stuff to see how they handled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things I learned that solved my major hurdles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The rear gear should not be too far behind the Center of Mass or you wont be able to lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing gear needs to be straight... and I mean STRAIGHT. You can\u0027t place it on a non-straight surface even, and rotate and hope its straight, because it can still be off by a fraction of a degree and cause the plane to lurch and roll on the runway during takeoff. I now plan landing gear as part of the design, from the start, because with bad gear you never even get to see if it flies properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Center of Lift needs to be behind the Center of Mass, further behind if you want to go very fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The most sure fire way to make a plane more stable (as in avoid having it tumble once you\u0027re airborne) is to have an extended tail out behind the main wings by quite a bit with horizontal winglets or stabilizers. If you don\u0027t have this many designs that are otherwise good will fail. It is good if you use FAR to set these far aft wings as the pitch control and ensure that your main wings are NOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I am unsure why the plane I managed to make that worked, actually works. It seems to be at some kind of balance point and I dare not attempt to change it, even if I might improve its flight and stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I will be building a smaller craft now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T18:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess I\u0027m not the only one who figured out that bigger was better for making SSTOs.
