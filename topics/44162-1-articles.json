Any tips on how to make sure I\u0027m absolutely stationary in relation to the ground ? other than checking my altitude ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having fun learning how to establish orbits.......I finally got my first geostationary comm-sat in place (using RemoteTech mod). Love the \u0022progression\u0022 that forces on you.

A geostationary orbit is still an orbit after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check if you\u0027re absolutely stationary by clicking on the digital display right above the nav ball that shows your velocity. After clicking it you should see \u0022Surface: x m/s\u0022. This is your velocity in relation to the surface. If you\u0027re in a geostationary orbit it should show 0 or something very close to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also dive into the modding community. The addon Kerbal Engineer Redux adds a handy readout that shows your orbital parameters, including the period. If the period is 6 hours and the eccentricity is close to 0 (How close it approximates a circle, 0=circle) you are in a geostationary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
