Anyhow, I decided to update from my\u00A0most recent version of 1.7.3 with Making History and Breaking Ground expansions. I assumed that each of these would incrementally update the game to 1.9.1, but I don\u0027t think that is the case? Please correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, I bought KSP ages ago, through GOG, I think. But that was two computers ago. I\u0027m on a work computer these days, and I wasn\u0027t about to\u00A0download all of GOG\u0027s stuff just to update KSP, so I spent\u00A0the extra money and bought the base game from the KSP store, knowing I can update from there easily enough. I\u0027ve spent many, many hours over the years on KSP, I figure $40 once every five years is well worth it, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, can someone explain why buying the direct download requires a wait of up to 48 hours? The expansions went through in seconds and I was happily downloading. Honestly, I\u0027m baffled. The receipt email I got says the order is being processed. What has to be processed that can\u0027t be accomplished in 10 seconds, like my purchases of the expansions? Pretty annoying, really. I didn\u0027t spend $40 to NOT play the latest KSP. I know this is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, I\u0027m just really confused by this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
