It\u0027s key was being very small and light so the load on the wheels was minimal (also most of the rover was protected by the wheels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YnOK7QX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YnOK7QXm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YnOK7QXm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2kT6Kw6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2kT6Kw6m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222kT6Kw6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(original 0.90.0 version, on minmus)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ended it\u0027s tumble down the mountain in a 40m/s roll in which a few bit\u0027s broke off (head lights, a battery, couple science bits, one of it\u0027s roll bars), but none of the wheels broke, it was still very drive-able afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/AsuAwwA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AsuAwwAm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AsuAwwAm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/tHmeQ04\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tHmeQ04m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tHmeQ04m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(0.90.0 version on Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded the craft from 0.90.0 and found it wasn\u0027t working anything like as well. So I re-made it from scratch (in case there was some issue with a 0.90 craft file), but the problems remain. The main issue is the wheels are extremely weak now. I went over this little bump at about 20m/s and one of the wheels broke (it used to be able to jump that fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/H0swMCR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H0swMCRl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H0swMCRl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(remade 1.0 version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is that the steering locks out completely at around 35m/s. Steering has always been reduced at higher speeds but this is a complete (and sudden) lock, let the speed drop off while trying to steer and the second it drops below 35m/s it will suddenly be able to turn hard again. 35m/s isn\u0027t a constant for all rovers, with the same type of wheels a slightly longer wheel base rover locked it\u0027s steering at around 40, so I\u0027m not sure what the logic behind the lock is. If this is a \u0022safety feature\u0022 I really don\u0027t like it, if I want to drive dangerously that\u0027s my prerogative! With SAS and RCS thrusters to help keep it pushed down this one used to be able to corner ok at 40-45m/s without turning over, it couldn\u0027t turn hard at those speeds, but it was enough to adjust course to avoid hitting things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS was key to this rover for down-thrust, acceleration and braking. It used to have 3 of the small roundified tanks and that would last it quite a while. The new version uses it\u0027s RCS in no time at all. Have RCS consumption rates changed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other odd thing I\u0027m finding is that when a wheel does break and you stop to repair it, the rover goes into spasms after the wheel is fixed, fix several wheels and the darn thing starts driving around in circles on it\u0027s own like a demented cat chasing it\u0027s tail. switch away to another craft, or manage to board it and instantly the twitching stops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally only use the rear wheels as brakes on rovers, especially small ones like this. I also have forward facing RCS to help slow down from high speed, but the wheel brakes used to be enough to stop it from low speeds. In 1.0 I\u0027ve been finding the brakes are really poor, even if I\u0027ve adjusted the braking torque to max. That coupled with increased RCS consumption rates (limiting how often RCS brakes can be used) and not being able to adjust course at all at high speeds has kind of diminished rover joy for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, rovers aren\u0027t meant to be driven at 40-50m/s in real life. BUT in real life there is an awful lot more scenery whipping past which gives an increased sense of speed. In KSP the terrain is rather sparse so I feel trading that off against having unrealistic speeds is ok. So if these are the result of changes to make rovers more \u0022realistic\u0022 I\u0027m rather disappointed by that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone experiencing these things? Are they by design or are they a knock-on effect of all the other changes in 1.0?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, actually, I haven\u0027t been having many of the same problems. I\u0027m not sure exactly what, but it may be that I have a tad less experience with really putting rover wheels through their paces in regards to impact tolerance. I actually have been developing a hummer-style offroad Kerbin rover for a road trip and am finding that the ruggedized wheels can stand up to most of what I\u0027m putting them through. Though I don\u0027t think I do any jumps at 20 m/s like that, because I know there won\u0027t really be a situation where that happens to my rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for steering slowing down- I\u0027m not quite sure if it actually does slow your turn speed when you\u0027re going that fast, for me the sudden flipping makes it hard to tell how fast the wheels actually turned... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
