In theory at least - in practice, the rules for figuring out whether the grace period applies are complicated and vary from country to country. So as a rule of thumb, file your patent before disclosing your invention.\n\nThe debate over grace periods is a long running one. On the one hand, they make things much easier for the inventor, particularly in an academic environment, where publishing your work is key.
