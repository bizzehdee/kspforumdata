I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m not the only player around here that would benefit from such an agreement.

Watching Youtube KSP videos I\u0027ve also noticed that even high-performance\u00A0computers tend to struggle when put up against huge part numbers, so I don\u0027t have any unrealistic expectations from my machine.\u00A0\u00A0I just did a side-by-side test with my rig vs GFN, for the lolz, as one might say. No mods (as you can\u0027t use mods on GFN atm), 1080p, maxed out graphics settings,\u00A0taking the AeroEquus to a roughly circular 150km orbit. It takes me about 4 minutes to do that on GFN vs. about 6 minutes on my rig. The thing that annoys me the most on my rig is the \u0022time dilation\u0022 (aka low fps) during launch and atmospheric climb (it takes around 2.5x normal time to exit the atmosphere). Long story short, yeah, the difference is noticeable. One may argue that I could get around this by simply lowering some settings, or that the vast majority of KSP gameplay takes place, well, in space. Barring performance issues, I am still a strong proponent of cloud gaming, as you don\u0027t have to deal with a lot of issues regarding hardware/software compatibility, hardware fatigue and obsolescence for high-end expensive gear, storage space, power management aso.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlas, I think I went off on a tangent for long enough, and I don\u0027t want to pollute the forums with my rants. Thank you for your replies. Guess we\u0027ll have to see what happens next;\u00A0they might even go for a different cloud gaming service such as Stadia or it might simply be a non-issue, as not a lot of people depend on this type of service\u00A0still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Appelmoessi","CreatedById":207994,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-06T11:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry to necro this topic.
