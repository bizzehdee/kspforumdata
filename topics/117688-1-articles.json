After searching for tutorial and all, I was able to make some simple parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I would like to make something a \u0027lil more difficult and have some questions about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve searched for tutorials but there isn\u0027t any who could really help me understand what I wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0027s more easy to answer while knowing what I\u0027m using, I\u0027m doing modeling on Blender then I\u0027m using Unity to finish the part (and export it as .mu)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first question is more for information. It\u0027s about colliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen that you can either add one when modeling (calling it node_collider) or applying one in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the difference between the two method ? it seems for me that the two method worked ... so I don\u0027t really know which one is better and above all, why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, I\u0027ve imported some parts in Blender to see how they were made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this, I\u0027m now wondering another things about collider. I\u0027ve seen somes with a totally different name and well ... I don\u0027t know if it was done in the modeling program or in unity but ... what I want to know is how the game know that it is a collider ? From what i can tell, I think when you use a mesh for collider, you need to call it a special way, but you don\u0027t care if it\u0027s done with a collider object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly for now, I wanted to make a simple wheel but ... I don\u0027t understand how you add an axis of rotation \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI searched on the web but couldn\u0027t find a tutorial for this. Could someone redirect me on a tutorial for this, or explain me how it works please ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(if possible, not a video so that I could print it or at least follow it without having to rewind the video X times when I don\u0027t understand something =p)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndyMt","CreatedById":123144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout colliders, the way I do it (I\u0027m not at my KSP PC, so this is from memory): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- model part in Blender, including the collider object, the name actually doesn\u0027t matter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- importing in Unity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- remove the mesh renderer on the collider object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add component \u0022physics \u0026gt; mesh collider\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- select \u0022convex\u0022 for the collider\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy adding the physics, the KSP part tools do the right thing and know that the collider is a collider...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried wheels yet.
