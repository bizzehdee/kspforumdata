Mun is easily visited and exploited for science with small rockets so that\u0027s not a huge problem. This plane requires refuelling in LKO and seems to be working. I goofed during refuelling and failed to fill 220 units of LFO and missed the return from Minmus by Dv 60 m/s. I guess it can work but can\u0027t prove it yet.

I would not add two; the limiting factor with a TRJ based SSTO is your thrust on jets, I think you only want enough rocket thrust to circularize after flameout and no more (0.55 to 0.70 TWR seems about right)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, you must be totally flying the jet wrong then! Don\u0027t let them get over 15kms without at least 800m/s going to 900. They drop thrust fast with height, so they need to take their time building speed in the 10-15kms region so when they go over there, they are going so fast the lack of air doesn\u0027t matter. Watch your vertical speed! You can build it back up once the temp gauge comes up (I assume you do use that very useful mod that lets you get over the stock memory leak on temp gauges). I do overfeed them air, too, that might have something to do with it. I fact, your use of just two little radial intakes on that RAPIER runabout makes me wonder whether intake area has or hasn\u0027t a big impact on thrust and/or drag.\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case, I am still dumbfounded with these 15-20mT single engine experiments. Every time I think I know what is going to work and what isn\u0027t, I get it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
