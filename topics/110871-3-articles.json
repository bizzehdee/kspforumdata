How long did it take you to adjust to the new aero? You\u0027ve been designing (awesome) spaceplanes for quite some time; I imagine some of that skill had to be re-learned. Either way, that Arrowhead is rather impressive.\n\nThanks! The new aero was quite the shock, suddenly everything worked completely different... yet really, the basic principles are the same, only more realistic now. And there is the small fact that I studied aeronautical engineering, speciality in aerodynamics and structures... ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) that sure helps. That, and the long hours of KSPing, and basically once I had gotten used to the Mach wall and the thermal barrier mechanics (and installed the heating bar indicator, that one is a must), I got very quickly back to where I was on the old model: this design was entirely eyeballed, and made orbit on first try. It just got an aesthetics pass before (some) of those pics.\n\nRune. I will admit it is one of my most inspired ones lately.

A single shock cone, or a pair of XM-G50s, or about 6 of the structural scoops is fine to feed a single turbojet.

Just easy up, EVA hops to the station, and easy down. Let dedicated, non-athmospheric shuttles do the rest.

Also carry some sciency doodads or whatever. Landing on the Mun may be out of the question, but orbiting could be ok. Mun is easily visited and exploited for science with small rockets so that\u0027s not a huge problem. This plane requires refuelling in LKO and seems to be working.

Both designs use Twitch engine clusters which are less efficient but do not require side tanks.\n\nSatelites in Kerbin system seem to be better of using a Kickback booster \u002B 909 to get roughly where they need to be.

It may very well be that over three tons and under six is just not a payload class that RAPIERs do. Or that I insist on overloading it. In any case, further experimentation is warranted, methinks... because with similar fuel/payload weights (they have a similar weight after all), the RAPIER is just anemic at 10kms and transonic speed, getting TWR 1 at most, while the turbojet easily pushes me past the Mach barrier with \u003E1,2 TWR. That is a 20% difference... especially troubling if you think that the turbojet version is lugging two extra Terriers, or 0.8mT in extra powerplant weight. Oh, and if we are counting the shielded docking port as payload (since it carries docking fuel, could go either way, but it\u0027s not really crucial to SSTOing), then it\u0027s 4 mT over 18mT for my TJ example (cockpit, docking port, crew cabin), so right there with your RAPIER example at 22.2% payload fraction.\n\u003E Rune.

Multiengine designs can exceed 18 tonnes per engine and still break Mach 1. \n\n The difference is that while getting supersonic isn\u0027t a big deal for turbojets, getting hypersonic is a problem. That\u0027s the end where all the fuel gets wasted in closed cycle.\n\n Perhaps I\u0027m flying them incorrectly, but my TJ lifters are barely exceeding Mach 2 at 20km up.

Don\u0027t let them get over 15kms without at least 800m/s going to 900. They drop thrust fast with height, so they need to take their time building speed in the 10-15kms region so when they go over there, they are going so fast the lack of air doesn\u0027t matter. Watch your vertical speed! You can build it back up once the temp gauge comes up (I assume you do use that very useful mod that lets you get over the stock memory leak on temp gauges). I do overfeed them air, too, that might have something to do with it.

For example, I worked on a passenger SSTO, (with your help BTW). I tried switching the 3 rapier with 2 TJ and 2 Aerospikes. But that didn\u0027t end well. I see now that may have to deal with the design of the ship. Some ships might get some better results with rapier, some ships with other confirguration. And I\u0027ve discovered it also depends on the flight plan to orbit. \n\nI find 1.0.x way better than 0.9 because of that game balancing SQUAD did. At first I disliked it, but now I appreciate it a LOT ! I use most of the engines where I only used a few of them in 0.9.\n\nSure Rapier have some downfall, but what the point if they outperform any other configuration (or the other way around) ? I find interesting we have to fly (and probably design) our planes differently depending on its engine configuration.\n\nThx for your valuable input ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:00:46Z","Content":"Have posted this before on other threads, but here is a 3xTRJ \u002B 2xLVN SSTO that has worked very well for me. You could replace the LVNs with LV-909 and probably carry a lot more payload. I get to orbit with a fair amount left in the tank.

I would not add two; the limiting factor with a TRJ based SSTO is your thrust on jets, I think you only want enough rocket thrust to circularize after flameout and no more (0.55 to 0.70 TWR seems about right)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:19:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh, you must be totally flying the jet wrong then!
