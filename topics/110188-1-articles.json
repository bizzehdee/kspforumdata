So, I started over in 1.0.2. In fact, this is a sandbox game because 1.x career mode is boring what with no science from contracts. And this way, I can catch the 1st Jool Window about Y1 D50. The boffins decided it was time to do Jool right with 1.x complications so the story begins with the launch of the 1st Jool Flotilla. The whole Jool system will be the main objective of this game as Duna is currently being covered quite adequately by Brotoro and he\u0027s left Laythe open to schmucks like me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

First, it\u0027s all probes, no Kerbals, and you can\u0027t have an expedition without Kerbals, so this is a flotilla. Second, this is just laying the groundwork for later operations, primarily in terms of scouting for Ore deposits, and nothing in this game has yet been to Jool, so it\u0027s the 1st.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there\u0027s no Remote Tech or even Antenna Range involed here, I like to play as if there was, so the 1st priority of the 1st Jool Flotilla is to set up a communications network to support subsequent operations. To this end, there will be 2 satellites in highly eccentric polar orbits of Jool, 1 going up and 1 going down, so that at least 1 will always be well out of the line of sight of any intervening body except Kerbol once in a while, in which case hopefully relays elsewhere can pick up the slack. So here\u0027s the Jool contribution to the overall network, 1 rocket with 2 long-range commsats.

For 1JF, the boffins sent out a rocket with 6 short-range COMMsats, 2 for Laythe, 2 for Vall, and 2 for whatever else strikes their fancy in the future. They sit on an inverted 3.5m-to-7x-1.25m thrust plate from Space-Y Lifters. To be able to move between the various Joolian moons, the rocket needed a rather large OMS, so the whole thing was large as a result.

They stopped on a huge shoal that had built up on what appeared to be a mountain-sized mound of debris and scree, no doubt the leavings of a monumental tsunami in ancient times. They noted a line of cliffs here, too, lower and more eroded than back as Kasuha Cliffs, but apparently part of the same faultline.
