So, I started over in 1.0.2. In fact, this is a sandbox game because 1.x career mode is boring what with no science from contracts. And this way, I can catch the 1st Jool Window about Y1 D50. The boffins decided it was time to do Jool right with 1.x complications so the story begins with the launch of the 1st Jool Flotilla. The whole Jool system will be the main objective of this game as Duna is currently being covered quite adequately by Brotoro and he\u0027s left Laythe open to schmucks like me ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). So here we go....\n\nThis game is mostly stock apart from the necessary instrumentation. The only real part mod I\u0027m using is Space-Y Lifters for the big stuff. I\u0027ve also got Mk2 Expansion because Jool means Laythe and Laythe means spaceplanes. And finally, I\u0027ve got BDynamics for .... things like retactable RCS thrusters to help with drag. And the Taurus 3.5m command pod mod, mostly for the Quadrapoodle engine, there being no good stock 3.5m OMS engine.\n\nAnd as always, thanks to everybody for inspiration but I\u0027d especially like to credit Brotoro who continually shows us all how things should be done. Anyways....\n\n\u003E [Episode 1: 1st Jool Flotilla Launch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2)\n\u003E [Episode 11: Departure of 1st Jool and 1st Duna Flotillas](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1993841\u0026viewfull=1#post1993841)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 13: 1st Jool Flotilla Arrival, Part 1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=2005937\u0026viewfull=1#post2005937)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 14: 1st Jool Flotilla Arrival, Part 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=2016955\u0026viewfull=1#post2016955)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 15: 1st Jool Flotilla Arrival, Part 3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-15-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-3?p=2020279\u0026viewfull=1#post2020279)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 16: Prospecting on Vall and Laythe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-16-Prospecting-on-Vall-and-Laythe?p=2044659\u0026viewfull=1#post2044659)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 17: FOOL-1 Prospecting](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-16-Prospecting-on-Vall-and-Laythe?p=2047979\u0026viewfull=1#post2047979)\n\n\u003E [Episode 11: Departure of 1st Jool and 1st Duna Flotillas](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1993841\u0026viewfull=1#post1993841)\n\u003E [Episode 12: Arrival of 1st Duna Flotilla](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=2001149\u0026viewfull=1#post2001149)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 13: Loose ends of 1st Duna Flotilla but mostly about 1st Jool Flotilla](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=2005937\u0026viewfull=1#post2005937)\n\n\u003E [Episode 2: Kerbin by Water, Part 1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1964455\u0026viewfull=1#post1964455)\n\u003E [Episode 3: Kerbin by Water, Part 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-re-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1966774\u0026viewfull=1#post1966774)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 4: Kerbin by Water, Part 3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1967990\u0026viewfull=1#post1967990)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 5: Kerbin by Water, Parts 4 \u0026 5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1970496\u0026viewfull=1#post1970496)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 6: Kerbin by Water, Part 6](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1971559\u0026viewfull=1#post1971559)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 7: Kerbin by Water, Part 7](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1977283\u0026viewfull=1#post1977283)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 8: Kerbin by Water, Part 8](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1982666\u0026viewfull=1#post1982666)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 9: Kerbin by Water, Part 9](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1984965\u0026viewfull=1#post1984965)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Episode 10: Kerbin by Water, Part 10 -- Complete](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-14-1st-Jool-Flotilla-Arrival-Part-2?p=1987201\u0026viewfull=1#post1987201)\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**1st Jool Flotilla**\n\nThe boffins call this the 1st Jool Flotilla for 2 reasons. First, it\u0027s all probes, no Kerbals, and you can\u0027t have an expedition without Kerbals, so this is a flotilla. Second, this is just laying the groundwork for later operations, primarily in terms of scouting for Ore deposits, and nothing in this game has yet been to Jool, so it\u0027s the 1st.\n\nWhile there\u0027s no Remote Tech or even Antenna Range involed here, I like to play as if there was, so the 1st priority of the 1st Jool Flotilla is to set up a communications network to support subsequent operations. To this end, there will be 2 satellites in highly eccentric polar orbits of Jool, 1 going up and 1 going down, so that at least 1 will always be well out of the line of sight of any intervening body except Kerbol once in a while, in which case hopefully relays elsewhere can pick up the slack. So here\u0027s the Jool contribution to the overall network, 1 rocket with 2 long-range commsats. Price: $260,265\n\n[![17888960196_63618657c6_o.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7700/17888960196_63618657c6_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tfMACd)\n\nThey\u0027ll link up with these similar satellites at Kerbin and also some elsewhere by the time they get out to Jool.\n\n[![17915924981_2e1edaf4b0_o.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7764/17915924981_2e1edaf4b0_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tiaNji)\n\nAt each world of interest, there will also be 2 short-range COMMsats to relay info from the surface to the main network described above. For 1JF, the boffins sent out a rocket with 6 short-range COMMsats, 2 for Laythe, 2 for Vall, and 2 for whatever else strikes their fancy in the future. They sit on an inverted 3.5m-to-7x-1.25m thrust plate from Space-Y Lifters. To be able to move between the various Joolian moons, the rocket needed a rather large OMS, so the whole thing was large as a result. Price: $324,250\n\n[![17915924901_b915408e09_o.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8869/17915924901_b915408e09_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tiaNhV)\n\nThis pic also shows what has become a standard feature of the OTC, as with the KTC before it. That is, using TAC Self-Destruct to remove spent boosters from cluttering up LKO. The OTC believes recycling is a commie plot to undermine our economy so takes especial pride in eliminating that possibility. Besides, explosions are cool ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nMoving on to more interesting matters, we have the Dual FOOL. The 2 FOOLs (Finding Ore On Laythe) are the jet drones at the bottom, sandwiching an orange tank nuclear tug. Due to all the funky 1.x aero stuff from the wings of the FOOLs, they had to function as the tail feathers of the lifter, and the lifter kinda needed to be an SSTO rocket as a result (not necessarily, but for cool points ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). The boffins exulted in such totally Kerbal things still being possible despite the changes in the atmosphere caused by the successive Supernovae of 100 and 102.\n\n[![17727503938_73647dacc7_o.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7781/17727503938_73647dacc7_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1w6iC)\n\nThe FOOLs carry both the Surface Scanner (probably redundant) and the Narrow-Band Scanner, and pack enough fuel to fly nearly 1/2-way around Laythe. They\u0027ll be sent down to investigate the most likely areas spotted by the FOOLSCAP (see below) and will fly low to spot good landing areas nearby. Once they find a good spot, they\u0027ll land there to mark the LZ for later expeditions. Price of the Dual FOOL: $486,662.\n\nSpeaking of the FOOLSCAP (Finding Ore On Laythe SCAnning Probe), it packs all the orbital SCANsat stuff plus the low-res Ore scanner. $293,454\n\n[![17292777644_9be1209835_o.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/17292777644_9be1209835_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sm71jG)\n\nThere there was the SLAC (Station, LAythe, Core), consisting of a Hitchkiker, a Mobile Lab, an empty orange tank, tanks for everything else, and lots of docking ports. This will be added-on to by later expeditions. Price: $373,688\n\n[![17294877813_3c81b603c8_o.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/17294877813_3c81b603c8_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/smhLCv)\n\nThen there was the SPOOL (Science Probe On/Over Laythe). This single rocket carries a \u0022doggie-style\u0022 lander and orbital probe, meaning the p-robe is atop the lander but they don\u0027t ever dock as in Apollo-style. Both are covered with DMagic Orbial Science parts as well as stock science. Their job is to finalize info about Laythe\u0027s atmosphere and surface prior to exiling pressganged---er, I mean, committing Kerbalnauts to Laythe landings.\n\n[![17727761620_cb0fe9b858_o.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7673/17727761620_cb0fe9b858_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1xpUq)\n\nThere was also the VAPID (VAll Probe Identifying Desirables). Vall is willy-nilly the best place to get fuel for bluewater ships calling at Laythe so establishing an ore-refining system there is a must. This probe has the same payload and lifter as the FOOLSCAP, differing only in having a nuclear transfer/OMS stage, mostly for comparison purposes. $302,564.\n\n[![17729093639_3319cc7ca7_o.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8810/17729093639_3319cc7ca7_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1EeSg)\n\nAnd last but not least, there was the PERV Carrier (Probe Exploring Rovers at Vall). This rocket carries 4 small rovers (each with surface and NBS scanners) all intended to scout likely spots to set up a refining base on Vall. The job could probably be done with 1 or 2 rovers but roving is treacherous and there\u0027ll be no conscripts to fix flats for a while, so the boffins opted for redundancy. And any leftover rovers can be used at Bop and Pol should need arise.\n\nThe PERV Carrier is one of the biggest rockets designed by the boffins in a long time, over 1100 tons on the pad. Still, it\u0027s quite simple in operation, just the usual thing of starting out with SRBs and sustaining with the core, it\u0027s just that all these parts are bigger thanks to Space-Y. And it\u0027s got a big price, too, $1,156,096.\n\n[![17292776474_3dc009899a_o.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5338/17292776474_3dc009899a_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sm6ZYw)\n\nI\u0027m glad this is a sandbox game so the boffins don\u0027t have to worry about prices. The cost to launch the 1st Jool Flotilla came to $3,548,356 or thereabouts.\n\nAnyway, all is up in LKO with about 50 days to go until departure.\n\n[![17727502778_774d49601b_o.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5336/17727502778_774d49601b_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1w5XC)\n\nNote that most of the transfer stages are chemical instead of nuclear. The nerfing of the LV-N is the main reason, not its heat problems (which I have tamed thanks to ModuleManager). It\u0027s just that now there are other, often better options.\n\nTune in next time for when all this stuff leaves, and possibly other stuff of interest.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T19:24:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:45:03Z","Content":"Nice explosions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nGood luck with the mission!"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:03:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice explosions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Good luck with the mission!\n\nThanks.

I really hate to waste so much time via warping so I was wondering what to do in the meantime, and decided this Elcano Challenge would be a great diversion. By attempting to circumnavigate Kerbin itself, I could avoid having to fly something somewhere, and by doing it mostly by boat, I could avoid most of the hazards of rovering except for a \u0022short\u0022 portage due to there being no land-free corridor around Kerbin.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So the boffins set to work on the idea of an electrically powered boat using a lot of Firespitter parts (pontoons, cockpit and sleeper cabin, and electric engine), and decided the Near Future solar panels would suffice for power. And thus was born the Electro-Boat Mk 1\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8802/17802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t8aYde)\n\u003E \n\u003E This proved the overall concept but was too slow, top speed on water being only 35m/s. The boffins therefore scaled it up into the twin-engined Electro-Boat Mk 2. This proved to be excellent, just needing a few minor tweaks, resulting finally in the ECK-1 VACUOUS (Elcano Challange, Kerbin #1 Very Ambitious Circumnavigator Upon Oceans and Up Shores). The overall design was inspired by the Soviet Ekranoplans but ground effect doesn\u0027t seem to work and in KSP and is against the rules of the Elcano Challenge anyway, so I\u0027m cool that it stays in contact with the surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17801161338_e706f0dfd5_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7660/17801161338_e706f0dfd5_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t82B5N)\n\u003E \n\u003E Using the retractable rover wheels in the Firespitter pontoons, the VACUOUS can reach 29m/s on level ground and a totally insane and useless 90m/s with the props running. But the props are intended for moving on water and there it can cruise along at 50m/s in full sunlight. As the light fails, it has to shut down 1 engine to use all the juice in the other, which limits speed to about 25m/s. But it\u0027s as stable as can be expected at 4x physical warp so 50m/s turns into a good speed to cover ground in a reasonable amount of real time. Thus, with the vehicle finalized, it was time to go. But the Kraken had other plans.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17989027735_f75da4ecaf_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7784/17989027735_f75da4ecaf_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tpCtdB)\n\u003E \n\u003E It turned out that the day selected for departure began with a total eclipse of Kerbol by Mun. In all the time I\u0027ve been playing KSP, I\u0027ve never seen an eclipse on Kerbin, so I took this as a sign of special favor from the Kraken, even though waiting for the eclipse to end delayed departure. There was only one appropriate response---choosing the KSC Monolith as the start/end point for the circumnavigation attempt.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17366436714_4595685a91_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8879/17366436714_4595685a91_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ssBwAE)\n\u003E \n\u003E With the ceremonies concluded and the eclipse over, Jeb and Val set off on their adventure.

This would have involved a stop at a small island near the middle of the Inland Ocean. The 1st leg was no problem but from there on, experience had shown that the VACUOUS probably wouldn\u0027t reach the farther shore before dark, even they had a whole day\u0027s run from the island, and this was just based on performance in the tropics, not the higher latitudes. So, the OTC instead directed the VACUOUS to follow the coast westwards until it reached the last of several big headlands, then do the bluewater crossing. As before, the stage would take about 2 days but there\u0027d be more margin of safety.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thus, Val called for a course of Northwest and VACUOUS eventually reached the 1st of the target headlands, its first actual landfall on the main bulk of the \u0022Eastern Continent\u0022 instead of an offshore island. They named this spot Point Maximus97 after another intrepid explorer.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18084195075_dd7b41f74c_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5335/18084195075_dd7b41f74c_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty3e9P)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18085125541_960557ec6b_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8880/18085125541_960557ec6b_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty7ZKk)\n\u003E \n\u003E From here, Val navigated them Northwest by West across the mouth of the vast Sarbian Sea, an arm of the Inland Ocean that penetrates deeply into the bowels of the Eastern Continent. It\u0027s named for one of the greatest navigators in Kerbal history. During this crossing, the VACUOUS crossed the Equator and started the long haul to the north. Jeb and Val did the necessary \u0022Crossing the Line\u0022 ceremony, enjoying a double rum ration and pouring some overboard in honor of King Keptune.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17896263228_94a3fcb974_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5323/17896263228_94a3fcb974_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tgr2yy)\n\u003E \n\u003E The landfall after this crossing was on another of the large headlands, apparently yet another volcanic feature, although old enough that the caldera had largely silted up and been filled by later eruptions.

It marked the end of gaining great chunks of Westing for a while and the the start of the uncertain run to the north, where VACUOUS would be tested like never before. So Jeb and Val had another luau, enjoying their last tropical evening for some time to come.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17896487410_1e555e9964_z.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7750/17896487410_1e555e9964_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tgsbcL)\n\u003E \n\u003E It had been another good day\u0027s run.

However, it turned out they left a bit early. While they\u0027d waited for the solar panels to reach the usual level of power they\u0027d been using thorought, this morning they discovered that the orientation of the panels affected their performance. VACUOUS had been facing more or less E-W the whole trip, even at night, but when it headed off north, the power fell dramatically. The result was that for the 1st 30 or so clicks of this stage, VACUOUS was limited to about 35m/s. Both engines could run but not at full power without depleting the charge.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17461590344_31bb260ecd_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5447/17461590344_31bb260ecd_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sB2dsu)\n\u003E \n\u003E This problem didn\u0027t last long, however, and soon VACUOUS was bounding along at its normal top speed of 49.something m/s. The top speed of VACUOUS had varied slightly every day of the trip, and sometimes during a trip as well, from a high of 49.9 to a low of 49.2m/s. Nobody could quite understand this because VACOUS was actually getting lighter with the consumption of rum, so the boffins had put it down to variations in salinity and temperature.\n\u003E \n\u003E In any case, the first job today was the long bluewater crossing of the Inland Ocean. The target was a prominent bulge in the western shore and Val put them on course North Northwest. She had proven to be the better navigator so it was fortunate that the watch schedule had so far always put her in charge of long passages out of sight of land.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17461590014_a7f30a2eff_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8764/17461590014_a7f30a2eff_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sB2dmN)\n\u003E \n\u003E As usual, her navigation was spot-on and soon the destination rose above the horizon. It was a fascinating contrast to the long line of volcanic features they\u0027d been passing previously. Here, a great cliff rose high and sheer from unimaginable depths and ran straight N-S for many clicks. It was obviously some massive geologic fault, doubtless a plate boundary. Definitely tsunami territory. The Kerbals decided not to linger. However, it was now past 8 bells of the forenoon watch and time to switch seats, so Jeb guided VACUOUS onto a beach at the south end of the cliffs. The Kerbals named this place Kasuha Cliffs in honor of a famous sane scientist who has been of great help to many would-be engineers.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17463639423_d8a071f7ae_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5470/17463639423_d8a071f7ae_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sBcHzr)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18084191245_bc5ae95abd_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8822/18084191245_bc5ae95abd_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty3d1M)\n\u003E \n\u003E Val now took the conn Fortunately, Kerbol was still high so the cliffs cast no shadow out to sea, allowing VACUOUS to cruise along close ashore to better examine this feature. It was as if the Kraken\u0027s Own Battleax had fallen here. Definitely not the place to be should the fault decide to let go. Forutnately, VACUOUS was in a racing mood at this point, surging along at 49.8m/s, and soon passed the north end of the great cliff.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18085121871_ff972abcf4_z.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7772/18085121871_ff972abcf4_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty7YE4)\n\u003E \n\u003E This leg of the voyage headed due North with the western shore of the Inland Ocean often just out of sight. But before too long, snow-capped moutntains poked above the northwestern horizon. This reminded Jeb and Val of how far north they were going, and they began to keep a very watchful eye on the performance of their solar panels. Thus, they named these the Mountians of Ill-Omen.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18085121521_8e48bb94c9_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8791/18085121521_8e48bb94c9_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty7Yy2)\n\u003E \n\u003E And sure enough, power began to fail. While both motors were still able to run at full throttle without depleting the battery, speed began to drop off. As VACUOUS pulled even with the south end of the mountains, she was barely making 48m/s. Kerbol was slanting down and the Mountains of Ill-Omen were now near at hand to the west, threatening to throw shadows across VACUOUS\u0027s path. But fortunately, the planned landfall was already just above the horizon ahead, and they were now so far north that Kerbol would set behind the lowest, most distant peaks at the southern end of the mountains. Thus, Jeb and Val decided to press on rather than stop here.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17897945619_96e919e3a2_z.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7716/17897945619_96e919e3a2_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tgzDFi)\n\u003E \n\u003E And they made it, although it was another near-run thing. As in the morning, they had to throttle back to maintain charge and thus made the last few clicks at about 30m/s, but they did ultimately reach a safe landing before dark. They stopped on a huge shoal that had built up on what appeared to be a mountain-sized mound of debris and scree, no doubt the leavings of a monumental tsunami in ancient times. They noted a line of cliffs here, too, lower and more eroded than back as Kasuha Cliffs, but apparently part of the same faultline. All in all, an ominous place to spend the night but they had no choice. Hopefully, the fault would remain quiet a few more days, long enough for VACUOUS hopefully to be well away from the area. This place they named Squiggsy Shoal, in honor of another inspirational explorer.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17897945659_42b8ee2036_z.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7675/17897945659_42b8ee2036_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tgzDFZ)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17461588314_8c7038c4b1_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8826/17461588314_8c7038c4b1_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sB2cRu)\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb and Val noticed a distinct chill in the air. No luaus on this beach, that was certain. Still, it was a rather scenic spot, in a creepy, gothic sort of way, so they took another travel pic.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18085121371_8500bd8d9e_z.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7791/18085121371_8500bd8d9e_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty7Yvr)\n\u003E \n\u003E So all in all, Day 5 was another good run. VACUOUS didn\u0027t make much progress towards circumnavigation but still put good distance behind her. This day she made good only 13^ of longitude but made up for that with 37^ of latitude.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18085119971_0e68e92d60_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8807/18085119971_0e68e92d60_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ty7Y6i)\n\u003E \n\u003E VACUOUS had also demonstrated the ability to perform adequately in northern waters. She\u0027s not as fast up there, nor can she steam as far in a day, but that was expected and the results are a bit better than anticipated. Of course, that\u0027s not really an issue at present because VACUOUS is only up here to make a portage anyway, and that will test the design in new and dangerous ways.

The goal was to reach the eastern end of the big lake in the middle of the neck but there wasn\u0027t a really good direct route. Thus, she planned to run the ridgelines as much as possible to avoid big slopes. Of rourse, this was about the exact opposite of marking a trail for the later digging of a canal, but she decided to leave that chore to the distant future when Kerbals actually invented a means to move dirt. By then, they\u0027d probably also have a means of doing such terrain surveys from orbit anyway.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17913618630_96115fa70b_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8845/17913618630_96115fa70b_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/thXYHC)\n\u003E \n\u003E So Jeb started driving VACUOUS up the ridgeline framing Trailhead Bay. VACUOUS had no trouble with traction but lacked anything resembling suspensions, a condition made more noticeable by having small wheels widely separated on the ends of the pontoons. Thus, it was a rough ride punctuated by large tilts and hard bumps as one wheel or another lifted high in the air crossing a change of slope and then slammed down as the vehicle\u0027s CoM crossed the ridge. Oh, and the CoM was rather far aft to improve seakeeping, which accentuated the slamming. It was about this time than Val admitted she\u0027d never learned how to fix a flat, and Jeb realized the Supernova of \u002790 had killed those brain cells, so a mere flat tire would be unfixable. So both resolved to drive slowly and carefully, but even so it was a rough and painful ride.\n\u003E \n\u003E Eventually, however, the VACUOUS made it to the top of the ridge surrounding Trailhead Bay and the Kerbals paused for a last, longing look at the ocean before it disappeared behind terrain.

Of which there wasn\u0027t a lot. Due to the frequent changes of slope, Jeb kept the speed between 15-20m/s and Mission Control forbade using more than 2x warp. Once they had a few flags out, Val had estimated that it was 45-50km from Trailhead Bay to the end of the lake as the rocket flies, rather longer by the route they were taking.

There was still a fair amount of daylight but they decided it wasn\u0027t enough for another fairly long bluewater crossing towards the east, so instead they continued along the coast. And Jeb, decided he\u0027d been short-changed on stick-time earlier, took the controls for this final leg of the day.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18246781822_e088a7acf1_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/414/18246781822_e088a7acf1_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tNpwwA)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18062720738_62c164f287_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/287/18062720738_62c164f287_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tw9azC)\n\u003E \n\u003E VACUOUS passed the 1st headland to the SW and the crew decided they could make the next one. However, as they started getting close, the light began fading rapidly. Even worse, there was no good place to put ashore close at hand. However, the map showed a small harbor around the corner on the southern side so they decided to head there.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18064330949_b9eb0edfa6_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7793/18064330949_b9eb0edfa6_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/twhqeT)\n\u003E \n\u003E Despite having to reduce power slightly by this point, all went well until Jeb made the final turn towards the harbor. This changed the orientation of the solar panels and power dropped almost to nothing. The sudden deceleration nearly stood VACUOUS on her nose but Jeb reacted quickly, shutting down the pusher prop and throttling way back on the tractor prop, and disaster was just barely averted. VACUOUS then limped towards shore, not the more desirable location further on but the closest practicable slope. Any port in a storm, as it were.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![17627915844_57e9a1d4b0_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7791/17627915844_57e9a1d4b0_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sRHFew)\n\u003E \n\u003E With Jeb constantly tweaking the throttles to use short bursts of power and then let the charge recover, VACUOUS eventually to the beach where the front wheels could get traction and pull her out of the water. The slope was very steep, meaning another uncomfortable night sleeping half on the mattresses and half on the bulkheads, so Jeb and Val named this place Cape Disappointment.

Due to the need to hurry on before dark, Jeb and Val hadn\u0027t given a libation to King Keptune, which they with hindsight decided was the cause of their anxiety. So they remedied this situation immediately and had a double rum ration themselves.\n\u003E \n\u003E VACUOUS is rather more than 3/4 of the way around Kerbin, this day having made good 27^ of longitude and 24^ of latitude.

And rather than waste time switching seats mid-ocean again, they decided that they\u0027d break with routine. Jeb would be at the wheel all day today and Val would conn the entire final stage.\n\u003E \n\u003E Another notable distinction of Day 9 was multiple crossings of the Equator.

They could have stopped here but decided that the beach wasn\u0027t flat enough. Besides, most of the last stage of the voyage would essentially be on the Equator, so they thought it appropriate to move back up to the Equator without venturing further west. That way, they could find a better place to camp, properly honor King Keptune and ask his favor for the morrow, and otherwise party.\n\u003E \n\u003E So heading due north from the tip of the peninsula, they reached the coast of the mainland and then headed west just a little along it to find the best landing in that area as close as possible to the Equator.
