Where is that fellow... Oh well. I usually build my rockets about 400-500 parts on launch and 200 or so when in orbit. This means my stations are about 600 parts when I build then but I wouldn\u0027t dare higher. Planes are about 150 ish parts (unless it\u0027s a cargo plan in which case 250). Rovers are usually about 50. Part count isn\u0027t always correlated to computer status though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually stream and run mu own YouTube channel though so...
