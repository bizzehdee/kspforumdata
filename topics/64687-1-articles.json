(Uranium nitride cans from Interstellar. Not taking risks with anything radioactive.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had a DR 2.5m heat shield attached directly to the bottom of the Procedural Fairings base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make the delivery to the orbital construction project and make my deorbit burn. Pilots are Jeb and Bill (again, not mixing rookies and radioactivity). Around 30 km altitude I check on the heat shield and see \u0022IsShielded: True.\u0022 You can probably imagine the rest. I go in with a fraction of the drag I\u0027m expecting. The fairing sides overheat and blow up first. The heat shield is still shielded. I fired the drogue chutes while I was still getting heating, hoping they would make some kind of difference. Note to self: they didn\u0027t last long. So passing through 10k where I would normally pop drogues, I\u0027m still on the high side of Mach 3 with only the mains left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy around 5k, I\u0027m down to around 400 m/s and I can fire the mains. Everything holds together and I splash down. Jeb and Bill didn\u0027t buy the farm on a low-orbit cargo run. But there were moments along the way where I was pretty sure they were going to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that reentry, I stuck an S6 service compartment between the fairing base and the heat shield as a spacer. Haven\u0027t taken the new version up to orbital speed yet, but I did a launch escape system test and confirmed that the heat shield is now properly exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious, though: Does anyone know a way to make a heat shield directly under a fairing base work, or is a spacer the only way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberius","CreatedById":78987,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T10:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the exact same problem with KSP 0.23.5.

Anything that is sticking outside of that cylinder is prone to the heat of reentry. In addition, the angle you are reentering, and the speed, could be your issue. I personally never had a problem with heatshields and procedural fairings, but I always deorbit from 100km. The higher you deorbit from, the faster you\u0027ll go, the hotter you get, and the ship will blow!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I were you, first id try deorbiting from a lower point, and try spending more time in the upper atmosphere to reduce your velocity. If that dont work, you will need to try the bigger heatshield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
