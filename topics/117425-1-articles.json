Set up a maneuver node, and the new orbit was represented by the dotted orange path.\n\nExcept at the end of the new predicted path it also predicted a straight encounter and capture with Ike!\n\n![2ADA2201B84CAC76909B46DF17FA21B1C92FA4BC](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/433821478396172912/2ADA2201B84CAC76909B46DF17FA21B1C92FA4BC/)\n\nI thought \u0027no way this is gonna work\u0027, but surely enough, after the burn, I had the encounter and capture predicted with no injection burn:\n\n![143DDD789C9181FC21CD70FD50FB2C718EE4CB68](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/433821478396173249/143DDD789C9181FC21CD70FD50FB2C718EE4CB68/)\n\nI was pretty amazed since I\u0027ve never had this happen before!\n\nToo bad it didn\u0027t actually work.

It\u0027s very unlikely, of course, but due to the fact that gravity is not uniform across a body, it\u0027s entirely possible. That said, the encounter would have to be very close to already being captured in the sphere of influence of the body that it was trying to capture around, and the gravitational variation would have to be both significant and properly distributed relative to the incoming object\u0027s trajectory.\n\nIt\u0027s very possible to have this happen in KSP because the SOI transition maths are less than perfect.

Therefore orbit predictions are often inaccurate. It is very annoying especially around Jool.\n\nSuch a capture needs 3-body interaction in real world. Third body takes energy and leaves system with higher velocity. However, KSP\u0027s simplified gravity model loses always energy when ship enters into SOI. It is not very difficult to get such an orbit with bodies which have small SOI compared to their mass.

It\u0027s possible in a 2-body system if the loss due to gravity waves or like effects is enough to reduce the velocity of the inbound object. It would probably require something silly like a cloud of gas with a periaps a few feet from the horizon of a supermassive black hole, but there is almost certainly some way to do it even with just two spheres."},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:19:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A gravity assist of a moon can certainly let the planet capture given body.\n\nNot in KSP where n-body gravity is not simulated.
