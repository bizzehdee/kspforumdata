It was reportedly very unstable, the heavy tanks wanted to pitch above the smaller and lighter motor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this could be a great design challenge to all the kerbalnauts out there designing more ambitious designs than this or those interested in the historical progress of rocketry and manned rocket flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I now know why von Braun didn\\\u0027t follow in his direct footsteps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERRs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3622.msg39342#msg39342\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3622.msg39342#msg39342\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics of my first and only attempt not very successful keeps pitching around its center of gravity \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T17:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\\\u0027t getting fuel to the top of the rocket become an issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedRockets","CreatedById":10539,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T22:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh yeah that\\\u0027a serious concern. if you look at Goddard\\\u0027s first rocket the tanks have abnormally long fuel lines runnig up to the motor at the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd he love struts before it was cool!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edvardo Perez","CreatedById":75192,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T06:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys.
