You should have made it 6 wheeled to look even more insect-like \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Six wheels is an option, but it overlaps at the attachment points and looks weird. The wheelbase is actually shorter than it is wide - but naturally this doesn\u0027t matter when your SAS is preventing flipping (rather than inducing it) ^^ The only down side to driving in docking mode is that you can\u0027t turn with SAS enabled, because it\u0027ll go into sideways translation mode... but careful choice of ground makes it safe to slow down and toggle it off while you make your adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really a driving style for those who prefer manoeuvrable rally racer, but very effective when you\u0027re on basic wheels and need to cover 5km to the next waypoint. Totally safe to 4x timewarp this little guy, for an effective 40m/s. 80 if you\u0027re willing to risk punctures \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Tl21rUP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tl21rUP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E - this one has two battery packs and one small reaction wheel; plenty to ensure that the kerbals never hit the floor even under aggressive braking. Unless you drive off a cliff and stun them on landing. Which I did. Fortunately, using the probe core to turn the rover back over shook them loose from their seats and they woke up again! \u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
