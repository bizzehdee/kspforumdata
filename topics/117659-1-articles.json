I downloaded just about every aviation related mod I could find, and after some trial and error I came up with these designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the way the planes usually crash and burn spectacularly on their maiden flights (and the following dozen), I decided to name all my planes after flightless birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI posted them in the FAR craft thread, but I thought I should give them their own one because they\u0027ve become this series of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here are the noteworthy ones so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EF-1 Kakapo\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENamed after a flightless parrot with the face of a Victorian gentleman, the F-1 Kakapo is inspired by light fighters such as the F-5 Tiger II. The rather simple design makes it decently sleek, and the single F100 engine nicked from an F-16 (thanks to the Advanced Jet Engine mod) gives it plenty of oomph. Handling was a priority, the plane is very manageable while still capable of some wacky stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the leading edge control surfaces (slats?): They move automatically depending on the AoA of the plane, which helps maintain stability during sharp turns and stuff. It\u0027s a feature that all subsequent jets also have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/VSIoB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The Ostrich is a delta-canard plane inspired by the \u0022eurocanards\u0022, the Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen. While it is ugly as sin, the plane is surprisingly aerodynamic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-canard design seems to have some pretty funny (murderous) properties. Like, rather than just cobra maneuvers, this thing does backflips (and then explodes, usually). While it can fly with a modicum of stability, the slightest mistake will make it want to kill the pilot. The upshot is that if wrangled properly, it can pull off some really crazy stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Hh791\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Aside from the procedural parts, I also changed the difficulty settings in FAR to the strictest possible area ruling for added masochism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe F-5 Rhea is somewhat inspired by the Mirage F1. In fact, thanks again to AJE it actually uses the same engine. The plane is all around decent, with no major bad habits and a handling that lets idiots like me fly it with some proficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MdZSB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It\u0027s an all-around improvement on the F-5 that turns harder, goes faster, and is easier to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most notable aspect of this jet aside from the insane power of its dual F100 engines, is the sheer stability of it. No matter if you\u0027re going sub-100ms or mach 2, this thing is always very responsive and forgiving even at high angles of attack. Capable of holding just over 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of AoA, \u0022bouncing\u0022 up to 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 for short moments and pulling over 10g at high speed, this thing is an absolute joy to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mToZI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
