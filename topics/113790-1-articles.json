I thought a practical test so I could see the final fuel, but my thrust drops off to fast as I climb, so I never reach supersonic.\n\nHm, right, I miscalculated the delta-v, making a spreadsheet for an airbreathing rocket is a difficult thing. Anyway, half the oxidiser in the FLT-400 is removed, so I have 40\u002B90 liquidfuel units, or 650kg, for the jets, and 45\u002B55\u002B90\u002B110 = 300 rocket fuel units, or 1,5 tons. This gives me 2987,4 m/s airbreathing and 783,4 m/s rocket delta-v, so 3770,8 total, so delta-v to orbit is 3706,6.\n\nThe way to fly it is to go diagonal pretty much right from the start. TWR at zero speed is barely over 1, so build up sideways velocity to increase engine thrust. Then aim for a 20 degree angle at 6000 m and keep it. Throttle slightly back at max Q to avoid blowing up parts. Over 15km go as horizontal as possible without flipping, and a flame-out speed over 1,6 km/s should be achievable. Burn full throttle in rocket mode to 65 km apogee, and then burn lowest throttle to 70,5 km (without throttle the rocket tends to flip in the atmosphere that\u0027s left at 30 km). And most important: try and retry a lot."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:34:26Z","Content":"Er, that last proof shot was of the wrong payload according to the KER mass display, I actually launched again, this one is less invisible too: [http://i.imgur.com/0UgCUL2.png](http://i.imgur.com/0UgCUL2.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:25:23Z","Content":"My entry: Moray Delta II Stock SSTO spaceplane.\n\nThe fully fueled craft weighs 111.3 tons and can carry additional 41.5 tons to an 85 km circular orbit, resulting in 2.68 : 1 craft : payload ratio.
