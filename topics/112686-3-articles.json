Still tweaking some of the uvs and messing around with different texture effects. My intent is to make a booster similar in function to the Spacex proposed Raptor full flow staged engine. Since I couldn\u0027t find any reference for that engine design, (I think the only part that\u0027s been fabricated is the combustion chamber) I based the design on the Merlin 1D. The two pipes in the front are fairly prominent on the 1D, but I\u0027m wondering if I shouldn\u0027t push the design by changing their scale.\n\nEDIT: Had some free time this afternoon, and here\u0027s the result.  \n![21oAQbZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/21oAQbZ.jpg)\n\nI may work on the tank texture a little bit more, but I\u0027m calling the engine done. I plan to give the engine a small degree of gimbal. It\u0027s a trade off given that it\u0027s twice as powerful as the most powerful stock engine. It\u0027s purpose is to be used for asparagus staging just like the Raptor launch system. BTW I think I was right about the pipes, it helps give it the right girth, plus fit in with the Kerbal scale of things.\n\nEDIT 2: Started playing with the heating effects. Looks ok I guess, I dunno, feels like its missing something.\n\n![xmMqRPz.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/xmMqRPz.png?1)\n\nEDIT 3: Oh yeah, textures...haha I\u0027m out of it ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) (The last picture was just a quick indirect light bake in modo)  \n![UZBa5zk.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/UZBa5zk.jpg?1)\n\nEDIT 4: Space!!!

As to the centrifuge, I have two problems with the idea.\n\n1) One of the stated goals of Kerbodyne Plus, is to avoid mod dependencies. So, no firespitter plugin dependencies. There is an experimental module named moduleMotor I believe that might be able to make a spinning part with the ability to attach other parts to it. Otherwise I could try making a one off part with no surface attachments. It would just spin for fun I guess.  \n\n2) Kerbodyne Plus is not a tac/ life support mod, but there are plenty of other mods for that including Porkjet\u0027s, which is a great mod BTW. I would rather support mods that do what they do well.\n\nFrom the beginning Kerbodyne Plus was and is an end-game parts pack. I don\u0027t plan on doing any custom plugin work myself or depend on other plugins. \n\nTo elaborate further as to what end-game means: To me, it means you reached the end of the tech tree, now what? You have a ton of money, what do you spend it on? So, I\u0027m trying to supply prizes for your enjoyment/luxury. If you have the money and the tech, you can for instance launch 500 tons with a handful of parts. All of the parts I\u0027ve designed have some kind of real world equivalent behind them. To unify the pack and to just keep limits on just how hacky/cheaty the parts will be. For instance, there was a launch system designed by the Russians called Seadragon, which was a rocket so big it would be launched underwater. it was insanely expensive, but would have been capable of launching 200 tons into LEO.  There were even some rocket designs that could conceivably launch 1000 tons into LEO, but again insanely hard to build and expensive. \n\nAlso, as much as possible I hope to unlock gameplay that you just can\u0027t do without combining parts together and upping the scale. LIke making LKO  ship docks out of 4 parts.\n\nSo, the focus thus far has been on large structural parts, deepspace infrastructure, and, now, launch systems and large crew cabins.\n\nNow, about that T404 cockpit. I\u0027ve been playing around with the idea for 6 months. I\u0027m still not sure what it should be. The design is becoming clearer now that T404 is a bulkhead profile. There\u0027s no NASA equivalent for deep space cockpits. Not anything real anyways. I like the fact that deep space designs do not have to be aerodynamic. We can have any shape that we want, so flying bricks are OK. But the downside is that the design space is huge! I know what it shouldn\u0027t be.  It shouldn\u0027t be like a star trek main bridge. It needs to be more realistic than that to fit with the visual style of Kerbodyne Plus that has been established. So, no millenium falcons. But, there\u0027s the Hermes from *The Martian.* There\u0027s also the Venture Star from Avatar. What I\u0027m trying to say is, I can\u0027t make up my damn mind! Haha\n\nSo, I may give up on it for now. There\u0027s plenty of other parts that need work before the first release candidate. That would allow people to play with it and help me get a sense of where things should go from here. \n\nHere is a list of parts that still need love. The ones with an \\* (asterisk) may not make it in the first release. \n\n- T404 Service Module\n- T404 Cargo Bay\\*\n- T404 LFO Tank\n- T404 Mono Prop Tank\n- T404 Battery Bank\n- T404 Nrax Converter (I know I said I was done, but this form factor makes more sense)\n- T404 Decoupler\n- T404 quad 2.5 coupler\n- T404 quad 3.75 coupler\n- T404 tri 3.75 coupler\n- T404 bicoupler\n- T404 Data Server (this is a huge store for science experiments with auto science lab)\\*\n- T404 2nd Stage Engine\n- T404 3rd Stage Engine\n- T303 Structural fuselage 3.75 M high 3.75 M bulkhead profile\n- T303 Structural fuselage 7.5 M high M bulkhead profile\n- T202 Structural Truss Family ( a smaller variant on the T404, T202 is mainly structural pieces )\\*\n- XL RCS Thrusters\n- XL landing legs\n\nThat\u0027s quite a lot to do!
