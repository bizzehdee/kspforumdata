I want to swap around who\u0027s on board. I used to transfer crew with Crew Manifest; I removed it as I thought it was now redundant. However, I don\u0027t see a way to transfer kerbals without EVA. Is it possible? I guess I can transfer by EVA but I might reinstall CM if this isn\u0027t possbile. It\u0027s not fun just flying back and forth between ships with 4 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigdad84","CreatedById":49379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T11:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave this same problem...
