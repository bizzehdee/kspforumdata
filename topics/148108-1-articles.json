So you either launch into an equatorial Kerbin orbit and then intercept Minmus precisely at its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, or you launch directly into the same orbital plane as Minmus/match Minmus\u0027 inclination before making your transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T22:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done it before, so I know it\u0027s possible.
