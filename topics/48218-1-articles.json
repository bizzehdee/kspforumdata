Keep in mind that engines become more and more fuel efficient the higher you get up to a certain altitude, and start to produce more thrust, and require more and more intake air at a pretty quick rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience, using 2 ram air intakes can get a dual-turbojet up to around 15-20km before flameout. I don\u0027t want to suggest intake stacking unless you\u0027re into it, but I try to stay away from it and keep my designs \u0022realistic\u0022 when I can. But it goes without saying that more intakes = higher altitude = higher isp = higher thrust = higher velocity, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027d really appreciate seeing is a detailed curve on how intake air is really handled and when it starts to fall off for each of the game\u0027s intakes. To my knowledge, ram intakes are the best of them all and produce the most intake air, while the spoiler scoops and nacelles are at the bottom of the chain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to guesstimate how far you can really get on a set amount of intakes, I\u0027d do some testing now that might save hassle in the future. Use one engine, and see how far up one intake gets you, then two, three, etc, and try to guess the math behind using two engines, three engines, and see if you\u0027re right. While doing the testing I\u0027d make climb rate pretty low, because the flameouts can happen fast, and if you watch your intake air, you can throttle down lower and lower and keep gaining speed the higher you go until your TWR starts to bite you. Until someone can dissect the engine and get raw numbers I think that\u0027s the best way of finding out what the limits of the intakes are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. someone please correct me if I\u0027m talking out of my butt.

In particular, the 10-15km range you gave happens to neatly line up with the altitudes at which air pressure is between 0.1-0.01 that of sea level pressure, which is indeed quite a drastic change. The chart at that link might serve as a helpful reference for more extensive testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
