Now timewarp until your craft just reaches where those two orbits cross. In this case, it happens to be dead center on the sun as well. This is where your perform your plane change burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ryfqb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ryfqb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn at either at the N location on the gimbal, or 180, or you can use MechJeb\u0027s Normal and Anti-Normal buttons. In this case, it\u0027s Anti-Normal or 180. Now burn until the planes line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd bang, we didn\u0027t even finish the plane change, instead we had an intercept because of the super awesome job the Planetary Calculator does at timing everything for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lEffa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lEffa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow check this out, if you look from the top-down view you can see where we are when we performed the plane change. We are well past half-way to the (original) periapsis when we burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YQzhn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YQzhn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is an \u003Cem\u003Eexcellent\u003C/em\u003E explanation Ziff.
