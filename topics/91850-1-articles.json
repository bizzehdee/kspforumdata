This sounds like a protective shutdown to me. Make sure you pc\u0027s fans aren\u0027t blocked. Where is your pc located? Under the desk? In a corner? Make sure it can breathe and the fans are circulating air like they should. KSP will tax the gpu in some circumstances. I notice it especially in the VAB. The fan will really kick up into high gear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike rocketpilot already eluded to, this sounds like a hardware issue. If it isn\u0027t a overheat shutdown, then you may need to start doing diagnostics on the hard drive and the ram. They can both cause strange random crashes at the onset of failure. If you aren\u0027t experienced with performing diagnostics on your hardware, just ask. Either here or over in one of the other community threads like the KSP computer builders thread : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25004-KSP-Unofficial-Official-Computer-Building-Megathread-%28All-Questions-Acceptable-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25004-KSP-Unofficial-Official-Computer-Building-Megathread-%28All-Questions-Acceptable-%29\u003C/a\u003E.

KSP is very CPU intensive and cooling can be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, based on your log, my first suggestion is to get KSP off of your desktop. It can cause a variety of random problems. You will need to copy/paste KSP off of the desktop OR unzip a new copy. Do not \u0022move\u0022 the file or windows DEP may still cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you say \u0022memory doesn\u0027t max out,\u0022 what does it get to? You\u0027re running 32-bit KSP which means it\u0027ll max out around 3.5 GB at the most. A second thing you can try is setting Texture Quality to Half (in the main menu settings page).
