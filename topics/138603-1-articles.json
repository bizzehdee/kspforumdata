I believe the license allows modification and distribution of the code, so anyone could technically try and update it. I also checked on the KSP subreddit for any interest, and there was a lot of positive feedback. If anyone knows of a similar mod, please let me know, and if anyone plans on updating the mod, let me know as well as I am super interested. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
