Something I\u0027ve successfully done in the past to correct a big boom in the game. Well, this time upon restart I get a message saying there is a corrupt save, do I want to delete it? At first I don\u0027t, but the save won\u0027t open properly. So foolishly I agree to let it delete the bad without really knowing what it will do. It totally deleted the entire save directory including all files and sub-directories. OMG! Not what I expected and digging around, the directories and files are not in the Recycle Bin where I could rescue them. I get I should have at least made backups even if I was getting cocky about getting better at the game. Any thoughts on if those files can be found, or am I starting over?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T03:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t anyway to recover those files if they aren\u0027t in the recycle bin, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
