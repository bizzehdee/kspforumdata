Sputtering out for lack of fuel still counts as contract completed. Same about separators, they don\u0027t need to separate anything. \n\nMy absolutely favorite was \u0022test Flea on launchpad\u0022. Place Flea upside-down. Place Stayputnik right in the engine nozzle. Fire. Collect.\n\nThe Stayputnik survived.\n\nThere was another, similar, to test a decoupler. The Stayputnik jumped 20cm up.\n\nHeh, science still in the bushes, and got two \u0022on escape trajectory\u0022 (for Flea and decouplers). And another for \u0022BACC\u0022 solid thruster which was quite a bit above my tier. I built a rocket out of BACCs capable of escaping Kerbin, carrying the Stayputnik and the two test components.

Gathering them fast with close rendezvouses (*rendezvoui?*) needs fuel indeed, but you can just set your AP and PE 1.5-2km lower than theirs, and eventually your carft will get into EVA range without any further assistance.
