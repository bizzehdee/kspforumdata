In that case I was using the Legstrot landing legs on a lunar lander which would then glitch out and erase itself if you ever went back to visit the site (wanted to leave the lander descent stages on the Moon indefinitely somewhat like memorials). Anyway, it turned out that loading those parts would cause the game to spew about a thousand NRE\u0027s and then the part would be deleted, causing the whole vessel to be deleted. Ultimately, the only way I was able to get the issue fixed was to replace the whole lander base on the surface with non-AIES legs. I did try editing the save file to swap the legs, but couldn\u0027t get it to work correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnways, I\u0027m not sure if this has any bearing on your issue, but it could be those AIES tanks glitching in the same or similar way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woahprettyricky","CreatedById":115197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T00:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s almost always been AIES parts, as I really don\u0027t use anything else besides Soviet Engines, Procedural Tanks, and the like.
