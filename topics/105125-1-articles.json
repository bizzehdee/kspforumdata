Anyway, here\u0027s the problem: I\u0027ve launched a Moho impactor probe with somewhat limited dV, had Mechjeb send it off into interplanetary space using the advanced interplanetary transfer mode, and all seemed fine at first with a nice clean trajectory leading me dead center into Moho. A few days after crossing the SoI boundary to a Kerbol orbit, I checked to make sure the orbit would still encounter Moho, only to find out that not only will it not hit the planet, but an encounter with the SoI is a several hundred dV correction away from my original orbit. After doing this correction, I thought it best if I come back to the craft after a month to make sure there is still going to be an impact on arrival, only to find out that I need another correction. The problem is that now I\u0027ve got ~250 less dV than I need for the correction, forcing me to either fail the contract I\u0027m trying to complete or cheat and use infinite fuel to make the correction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m left wondering now where I\u0027m going wrong in this equation... Both transfer window planners that I\u0027m using (MechJeb and the one by TriggerAu) indicate that I left with plenty of dV to run into Moho without a problem. Furthermore, I\u0027ve had intercepting orbits set up twice now, only to have them vanish without warning. It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played KSP, so I can\u0027t remember if this is an issues I\u0027ve had in the past or not, but I really don\u0027t think it is, or else I would have started a thread about it back then. Are disappearing planetary encounters really a thing, or is there a factor I\u0027m not accounting for here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMhhh well one big problem with the calculation system is that if you leave the SOI of one body at high time warp, it is quite likely quite drastically change your resulting orbit, since the game needs a little time to recalculate your orbit in the new SOI. Sometimes, due to this, you will actually enter the SOI at another place, resulting in a different orbit. At least that is what I took from someone elses explanation.
