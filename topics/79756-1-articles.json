As long as you stay within one biome it doesn\u0027t matter where you perform experiment, make EVA report or take sample. So, you don\u0027t have much to do on landing site. It would be nice if there were reason to walk (or drive) around while picking some different objects or samples. Rocks, soil patches, plants etc. I mean, to have scientific diversity whithin one landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bradford","CreatedById":112778,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T20:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be something to look forward to in the final product.
