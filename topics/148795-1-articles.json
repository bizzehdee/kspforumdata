It would open up a whole new avenue of designs, like ground effect vehicles. It would also make takeoff and landing\u00A0in spaceplanes and aircraft easier, as the amount of lift is increased as you approach the ground. However, that could be balanced out by reducing the effectiveness of control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also be easy to implement as the effect kicks in at or below the length of an aircraft\u0027s\u00A0wingspan;\u00A0This data is easily obtained, as it is already in the engineer\u0027s report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease feel free to give your thoughts, whether for or against this.
