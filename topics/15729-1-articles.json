If I were in a circular orbit around the sun and wanted to use a Hohmann transfer to get to Murz, is there any formula to calculate the time at which I would burn to transfer into orbit around Murz? Like, when transferring to the Mun from Kerbin, you have to wait until it shows up on the horizon; what formula did whoever discovered that use to find it out? Is it still at the point when it shows up on the horizon, or would it be different for every orbiting body?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m interested in this because in .17 planetary travel will become a must, so I\\\u0027m trying to learn some more advanced mechanics - however, I figured that if it\\\u0027s possible to just boost into solar orbit and then use a Hohmann to get to the new planet, it would be simple enough for me to do easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T02:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoah, my calculations aren\\\u0027t matching up with what my program tells me.
