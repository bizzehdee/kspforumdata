at all in stock KSP\u00A0but its components do, and there\u0027s zero mass loss in refining,\u00A0using a fuelcell that burns the fuel produced by a mining-refining base that produces that fuel is a closed loop. \u00A0Refining Ore is the reverse of burning\u00A0it. \u00A0There\u0027s no getting around that. \u00A0Therefore the 2nd Law of Thermo is broken because in such systems, you can\u0027t ever capture as much energy by burning the products as you expend separating those products from their low-energy state. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t matter that new Ore is coming into the system, it\u0027s the reactions in the fuelcells and ISRU that limit it. \u00A0A\u00A0mining-refining-fuelcell set-up\u00A0is exactly the same as trying to run a water\u00A0electrolysization plant on the energy released by burning the H2/O2 cracked\u00A0by the electrodes. \u00A0This is a clear violation of the 2nd Law of Thermo and the KSP system also violates conservation of energy by not only keeping itself running, but also still manages to radiate away hundreds of kW PLUS produce enough surplus to refuel other ships. \u00A0It\u0027s totally ludicrous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the toy-sized stock KSP universe clearly runs on radically different physical laws than our own., \u00A0It routinely violates every conservation law we know, and the 4 fundamental forces of nature are obviously extremely different than what we\u0027re used to., \u00A0Because this means the nuclear forces are different, KSP has no elements in common with our own periodic table, and KSP chemistry must therefore be totally different as well. \u00A0So, if you can accept that NOTHING in the KSP universe should be \u0022realistic\u0022 in human terms, then by all means power your mining-refining bases with fuel cells. \u00A0Just toss conservation of energy and the 2nd Law of Thermo on the pile with all our other physical laws that you don\u0027t care about. \u00A0But if you hold the 2nd Law of Thermo to be sacred, then don\u0027t do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this particular breach of human reality has a simple fix. \u00A0Just make it so raw Ore burns\u00A0and loses mass in the refining process, \u00A0Then instead of being analogous to water, Ore would be analogous to fossil fuels and you wouldn\u0027t have a closed loop system with your fuelcell-powered mining base. \u00A0And then explain away the presence of fossil fuel analogs on lifeless bodies by invoking the alien geological processes and chemical make-up of the KSP planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, back to the OP..... \u00A0Use nuclear reactors to power your bases where there sun don\u0027t

comments in the various Ore-related config files. \u00A0He was concerned about the conservation of mass but I believe he\u00A0was misapplying\u00A0that. \u00A0The word \u0022refining\u0022 means separating the good stuff from the bad stuff, which necessarily means you keep less than all of the mass you started with. \u00A0I think RoverDude kept all the mass to avoid having to create a new resource for the by-products, and tanks to put it in, and then a mechanism for jettisoning it. \u00A0But I\u0027d be fine with the by-product mass just disappearing, on the assumption that it\u0027s being vented from the ship automatically. \u00A0If you want to get fancy with that, add a stream of dust blowing out of the ISRU and say that\u0027s the byproduct mass leaving the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you lose mass during refining, that makes non-combustible Ore even more of a violation of the 2nd Law of Thermo than it already is. \u00A0Now the ISRU reaction most definitely is irreversible because not only are you losing energy as waste heat, but you\u0027re also losing mass. \u00A0Which means that the stock game must have a way to burn raw Ore. \u00A0Only when Ore itself burns in stock can we reasonably analogize Ore\u00A0to hydrocarbons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now let\u0027s talk about hydrocarbons. \u00A0 Crude oil is a mix of many different compounds with varying properties. \u00A0The ones we use as fuels are amongst the lighter varieties. \u00A0The heavier compounds get used a low-energy fuel oil, turned into plastics, or used to pave\u00A0highways. \u00A0So if you\u0027re looking to make rocket fuel, which the Rocket Equation dictates must be high-energy and low-mass, the mass loss would be quite significant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads to the question of finding industrial quantities of hydrocarbons on lifeless worlds. \u00A0Sure, hydrocarbons are scattered in relatively tiny amounts all over space, but are only highly concentrated in a few places (as far as we know), like Earth and Titan, and (as far as we know) something like crude oil only exists on Earth. \u00A0But that\u0027s our universe. \u00A0In the totally alien KSP universe, where chemistry is totally different from ours, we can assume that magic Ore is magically

soaked\u00A0into oxygen-bearing rock, or possibly a collection of oxides, or even comes from all the rocket exhaust that was sprayed everywhere before version\u00A01.0--that one explains why it so readily converts into both rocket fuel and monoprop, too. \u00A0The word\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only signifies what is worthwhile to dig up; it\u0027s nothing more specific than

bump the drill efficiency--but that\u0027s beside the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is that in a lossless conversion,\u00A0there ought to be a veritable river of energy running into

\u00A0There would be no problem with the notion that ore can be made of anything at all that can be converted into some kind of propellant, so long as the total energy put into that process is thermodynamically equal to the energy coming out of it, in light of the heat and chemistry involved. \u00A0Energy is lost as heat energy and as molecular bond energy, and it must come from somewhere. \u00A0That also constitutes work and therefore there is a thermal change, as well.\u00A0 Either the energy to do this\u00A0must be present in the ore harvested (which you see in the uranium-harvesting mods and is why nuclear reactors can justifiably power their own refineries), or it must be supplied by something outside the system. \u00A0If ore\u00A0needs to be cracked by electrolysis, it cannot have that energy:\u00A0\u00A0electrolysis supplies that energy. \u00A0Solar panels, RTGs, and mod-supplied nuke reactors\u00A0pose no problem because they get their energy from outside the system. \u00A0The alternator on a Rhino engine poses no problem; it gets energy from the system but gives back less, resulting in a net loss.\u00A0 The real issue is the fuel cells, because they are the only
