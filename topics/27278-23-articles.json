He is faceless, he could be anyone. No one has ever gotten a fingerprint, a footprint, not even a whiff of him. Even the Keepers are oblivious to him. He carries out his work with meticulous detail, leaves no evidence at all that he was there. He has quite a large self image but cares nothing about gaining a reputation. In fact, he wants to remain anonymous. But at the same time, he enters a mission with a heightened sense of paranoia. Nothing can go wrong, he will settle for no error or slip ups in his execution of the job. He is a Paranoid Perfectionist while working, nothing out of place or amiss when he is finished. Not even the Allusion of a Thought in anyone\u0027s mind that he was there. He is also discriminating. Some missions he might not take because he might leave a trail, clue or hint of something.

The Sun reigned, unchallenged, as the Stars appeared. The first, lost to time, passed by. The second, Harmony, created all the Gods. The third, Erudition, became knowledge itself. And the fourth, End, brought the first night. Revealed the Moon and brought darkness to existence. But in that darkness, there was... something. It was not a star, called by the light of the sun. It was not a God of Law, unseen and unheard. It was anguish, loss. Its birth-scream one of longing, of grief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf Desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of the Sun caused a thought to appear. It was, at first, meaningless. Barely more than an incoherent whisper with nothing but darkness and the Moon. But the darkness soon coalesced around that thought, amplifying it, adding a voice. The whisper grow louder, more comprehensible until the darkness could contain it no longer. Its anguished sound shocking the thought into self awareness, at first, and then horror soon after. \u0022I want the Sun!\u0022 it cried, but as soon as Desire made his demand, he realised what he had done. He had given an order to the Sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore it could respond, Desire fled. He ran and hid and hoped he was beyond the Sun\u0027s reach. On the Second day, the Sun rose and heard Desire\u0027s demand, but found only an echo of grief. Oblivious to the thing it had unwittingly created. It spent the second day existing. It\u0027s brilliance brightening the sky. But the bodiless demand unsettled him. And so on the second night, he told the stars to wait. To be a beacon when the Sun could not. But their light was weak. No matter how brightly they shone or how many was among their number, darkness still reigned supreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for Desire, it was a gift beyond measure. His demand of the Sun made him wary. When darkness fell, he was started at the sky, but was soon calm. The light was not the Sun, it was something... else. Desire did not know what they were, only that he wanted them. And so he left his hiding place and went to the stars he saw. They were not the Sun, no, they were lesser beings. But they still held a light and Desire very much wanted light. So he stole some Stars. He stole and stole and stole until the Sun approached and Desire returned to his secret place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Sun arrived, fully, he saw that some Stars were gone and he did not know where. The Sun questioned the Moon, but she saw nothing. He questioned the rest of the stars, all of them, but none saw anything. Their brethren were there but then they were not. Desire, in his hiding place, looked upon \u0022his\u0022 stars. But he found them lacking. Individually, they were nothing but together, they were brighter. Much, much brighter. But together, they still paled in comparison to the Sun. But he wanted more, ever more, until he had a light as bright as the Sun. And so he waited, until night fell once more and he could, unseen and unknown, take the Stars to create for himself a new sun. All his own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd such is his Legacy, The Epithymia. They walk the earth, coveting all they see. Wealth, gold, jewels, they take it all. But they are not without allies.

They wouldn\u0027t overtake us. Also, he thought we were too far along for him to join us, which is why he started his project. He is all for collaboration, but he did say he would like to keep his project. So I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s decided on collaboration and cooperation, with two projects. I was thinking, maybe they do \u0022merge\u0022 with us, as in the are a part of KSP Community CubeSat, just as another project, or division. Our division would be the LEO expirementing division, their\u0027s would be the Lunar Flyby/orbiter/impactor division. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022oarum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022oarum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t think that we should merge, because they\u0027re trying to do a lunar orbit/flyby/impactor, when we are just sticking to LEO, so if we did merge right now, one of the two sides would have to virtually start over again. Also, it doesn\u0027t look like they a have much of a scientific aspect, so in a way, we\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eway \u003C/em\u003Ein front of them stage-wise.

Ultimate project would be sattellites in space. Sub-projects would be LEO expirementing, and Lunar whatever they decide on. Also, I know how they are getting to the moon. Apparently, they found a Lunar payload service. And they plan to take advantage of it. I\u0027ve asked ProjectThoth to give me the link to this service, as I thought if we wanted we could also exploit it, maybe after our LEO CubeSat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA post in the KSP Community CubeSat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xorth Tanovar","CreatedById":71205,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T20:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am only sipping the second glass of that \u0022fascinating, but subtle poison, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhose ravages eat men\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heart and brain\u0022 that I have ever tasted in my life; and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas I am not an American anxious for quick action, I am not surprised and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edisappointed that I do not drop dead upon the spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
