Can you give me hints on how to configure the mole tracks in a 4 piece configuration.\u00A0 A pair in front and one in the back of an elongated tank.\u00A0 I get the forward thrust and reverse but turning is nearly impossible. I have tried many combination of config included the half-track one but still can barely turn.\u00A0 Thanks for your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
