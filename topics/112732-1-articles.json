However, when I downloaded the 1.0.2 patch from KSP and tried to launch it after i had replaced the new files with the old ones within my game directory it will only progress to \u0022squad/parts/engine/LiquidEngineAerospike/LiquideEngingeAerospike/toroidalAerospike\u0022 from which it will not go any further. The random \u0022progress\u0022 text will still cycle through with the witty comments but the game will not fully continue to load. \n\nAny help is appreciated"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T08:05:34Z","Content":"Hi ahyokata, putting all the files from the zip into your current folder might have messed something up, please try installing KSP again to a new folder and verify that it works, you can then copy your saves over ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T18:58:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"ahyokata","CreatedById":146122,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T00:14:35Z","Content":"Thanks Sal\\_vager, thats exactly what I had to do.
