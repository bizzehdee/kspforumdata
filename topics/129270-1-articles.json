The modules are simulating plants, but when a player right clicks on the part, the popup gui is full of info. It\u0027s interesting, but ideally there would be a way to hide things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA example screen shot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cVNn-S5vRZw/VosWifhcOmI/AAAAAAAAKn0/3eaUqYmq5eg/w524-h503-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-01-04%2Bat%2B5.02.29%2BPM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%2BShot%2B2016-01-04%2Bat%2B5.02.2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor debugging, it\u0027s nice to see info on whether germination is active or how efficient something is, but for these always-active, biologically inspired reactions, giving the user feedback like that is excessive and fills the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious solution would be to remove some modules, but I am not sure how to reduce things from the basics of Germination, Respiration, Photosynthesis, and Reproduction.
