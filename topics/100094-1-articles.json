As reaction wheels exert torque, stored momentum increases saturating the wheel and decreasing torque output. Over time the stored momentum decays and torque slowly increases back to it\u0027s original level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy use this mod? From a gameplay perspective it adds another factor to be aware of when maneuvering your vessel. It makes including maneuvering thrusters on your vessels a lot more attractive (especially if you know offset thrust could be an issue eg. spaceplanes, cargo tugs, and asteroid haulers), and means you really do have to find a flat spot to land if you want to be on the ground for more than a few seconds (no more sitting with only two legs on the ground indefinitely). There are also interesting balancing possibilities because of the dynamic nature of the additional parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Crzyrndm/RW-Saturatable/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E - \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Crzyrndm/RW-Saturatable\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESource\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequires \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-0-90-Module-Manager-2-5-13-%28Mar-25%29-An-ode-to-code-duplication\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModule Manager\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gzq1G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
