For now I would recomment the trajectories mod. It\u0027s quite precise and helps a lot. I use it for quite number of missions and it shows how a feature like that can enhance the gemeplay and enable additional possibilties such as precise reentries followed by an unproppelled landing from orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shtirliz72","CreatedById":82933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T08:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it already exist in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93685-0-24-0-25-Trajectories-v0-4-1-(2014-10-16)-atmospheric-predictions-FAR-NEAR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectories Mod\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T14:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shtirliz72\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shtirliz72\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eisn\u0027t it already exist in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93685-0-24-0-25-trajectories-v0-4-1-(2014-10-16)-atmospheric-predictions-far-near\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etrajectories mod\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh my god\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehow am i just finding this????\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
