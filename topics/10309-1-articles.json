For instance, the radial decoupler is half the weight of a vertical - so it makes more sense to have a wider ship than a taller one simply from that. Since I also gain more stability during launch, this also helps in ways I did not expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb 1.8.1 added an interesting feature for its autopilot for launching to orbit which gives you statistics for how your ship\\\u0027s thrust is being used. I was shocked when I discovered 3/4 of all the thrust being put out by the first stage of my ship was being eaten by drag alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was even more surprised when I discovered that simply by letting the solid boosters act alone in this design rather than having the liquid engines fire right off the pad the ship actually has slightly more fuel left in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular variant of the design can get to a 100km orbit via mechjeb with a tiny bit of fuel remaining in the launch phase tanks with four full tanks on the lander. The ship can then land on the mun, as well as fly back and land on kerbin with the remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T00:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a minor revision to V17; after thoroughly testing it the design unfortunately was topheavy and tended to flip over during the second booster stage.
