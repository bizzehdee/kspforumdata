On mostly flat grassland it\u0027s ok clipping along at 25m/s FFx3, but I generally deactivate steering on the rear two pairs of wheels if going fast. It\u0027s wide enough to be stable on pretty steep inclines. The docking port connection gives some flex to the system too. It took on some pretty serious terrain in the mountains and did better than I expected it would. The whole thing drives pretty well. The 6 wheel rover at the front is a delight to drive by itself though. A full string of modules in a mobile-base-train-rover is a bit of a beast to turn though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T22:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love the way that spider web of struts makes it look.
