Like, one to represent the lower, and one to represent the higher atmosphere. When the camera passes a certain height (be4 the Moire patterns start to kick in), the scatterer effect could fade out, while the blue sphere(s) simultaneously fade in. That way, theres no need to fight with the depth buffer, or anything else, and Moire patterns could be eliminated.
