If you look carefully at one part of the video, you can see the F-15 has drifted further slightly, and on the other side of the green is another yellow, with mirrored markings - the pilot\u0027s target is to keep it in the green.\n\nAlso, the wings do move and do provide lift - they prevent the need for a very large hydraulic lift and very stiff boom by supporting the end of it, and are used to push it back up against the fuselage for landing.\n\nI have to comment that the flight seems remarkably stable though. Even with a very skilled pilot, I expected reaction times to mean wash off the lead aircraft would make it behave a lot less smoothly."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T12:32:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As far as I know, the wings are fixed and simply aid the stability of the boom.\n\nIt is my understanding that they are [control surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling#Flying_boom), operated by the boom operator."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:19:23Z","Content":"Ah I dint know that the fuel hose \u0022boom\u0022 was fully controlled in all directions by the cargo fuel plane.\n\nI always thoght that the hose was fixed, and the pilot had to do all the hard work.
