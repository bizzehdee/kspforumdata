In order to achieve functions such as optical lock and mouse pointing shooting, I added BDA mod and some BDA expansion packs such as FoxDefense and KBF to the game.Then I got a question: Despite the primary weapons like tank gun, many armored vehicles also have secondary weapons like the coax and the weapon station on its turrent. Unlike reality, in the game I always can\u0027t attach the parts I need to the turrent parts. Even though some mods allow me to attach parts on turret parts, it won\u0027t rotate with the turret. So I want to ask if there is a solution or\u00A0is there any weapon mods of KSP1 that allow you to attach parts directly to the turret and make them rotate with the turret?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDamn it.\u00A0Looks like I have quite a lot grammatical errors\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
