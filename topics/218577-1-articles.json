My main problem I keep encountering is with the landing system.\u00A0 If i use the starship expanded mod, when i try to land the super heavy, it lands, but it lands like almost a kilometer off target. When i use anything from the SpaceX pack like the falcon 9, it just doesn\u0027t even use the engines until like 3 three seconds before touchdown. Is Mechjeb having a problem, am I being stupid, or is it something else. and just to try and help, i land by selecting a launch pad or drone ship with the select target on map option, and deactivate everything except for the auto warp.\u00A0 I do have ample power but i do not know. Am I missing something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-27T20:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to mod discussion\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesecake","CreatedById":138400,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-28T18:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding exactly on a pad with Mechjeb is almost impossible. Mechjeb is not really good for that. Here you should rather use kos. There are some scripts that can do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
