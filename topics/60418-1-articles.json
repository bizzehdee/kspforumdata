Then send up a rescue pod, rendezvous, switch back to Jeb, and with the remaining jetpack fuel, get into the rescue ship. It\u0027s really easy to build a return-capable mun orbiter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have doubts about having enough fuel in the jetpack, push your original ship while on EVA (literally!), and reenter the pod as soon you need more jetpack fuel. Be cautious when you do this, as on EVA you have no navball, and it\u0027s difficult to determine the correct direction. Also, if you run out of jetpack fuel, your kerbal is dead (well, if you manage to point your ship\u0027s hatch right next to him, he may survive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T15:33:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jmiki8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T15:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETreat it just like a circular rendezvous.

Ideally you want to be captured into Mun orbit as high as possible which will make the plane change more efficient. Extra points for matching the plane during intercept/capture!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you are in a circular orbit around Mun, you need to match orbital planes. Selecting the target, you\u0027ll get Ascending and Descending nodes with dotted lines jointing your orbital path with the target\u0027s. You want these to be as close to zero as you can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlane changes are more efficient at higher orbits, so if it\u0027s REALLY off (more than 30 degrees or so) consider raising your Ap to the edge of Mun SOI by burning prograde at either Ascending or Descending node (whichever is at a LOWER altitude) until your Ap is near 2000km or so. If done right, the ascending/descending node will be close to the Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a node at the new Apoapsis and tweak the purple handles until the Ascending/Descending nodes are as close to zero as you can manage. Tweak the retrograde handle to get your new Pe to match the Target\u0027s Ap plus a little bit. Do that burn to match orbital planes. Note: Direction matters! Don\u0027t accidentally put yourself into an orbit in the opposite direction!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we have everything lined up, recircularize so that your orbit\u0027s Pe is roughly equal to the target\u0027s Ap. Doing this will enable you to control where you lower your Pe to match the target\u0027s Pe. Use another node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get the orbits TOO perfect, because you want to meet up with the target. Remember that LOWER orbits are FASTER, so if your Ap matches the target, bring your Pe lower than the target\u0027s to catch up or leave it higher than the target\u0027s to let the target catch up to you. Wait for a close encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have an encounter, match speeds with the target at closest approach by burning pro/retro grade to it. Once the relative velocity is the same, the orbits should be the same and you can very gently move in closer for a rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thomasjkenney","CreatedById":101509,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T02:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had good luck rescuing by using probes.
