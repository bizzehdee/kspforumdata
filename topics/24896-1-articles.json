I have been a avid reader of the forums and watcher of many you-tube series about KSP for a while, been a participant since .16 it been a real fun ride so far. i am very much looking forward to the next few years. ever since i first saw the game i have been promoting it to friends and family, the game has so much fun crammed into it my very first question was why cant i give them my money faster as i tried to buy the game! I do most of my game-play stock,(0-mods) though the (engineer redux-),(mechjeb) and (Damned Robotics\u0027s) sometimes get a short install from time to time. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching KSP lets plays of , Kurt-j-mack, Scott Manley, Thor from IRD LP and Macey Dean\u0027s LP( if he\u0027s reading this, add the Heavy I-beam strut to your torps for better effect) . they all do wonderful work. we all owe squad mega-grats for the work they are doing and have done so far. will be buy this as a gift for a few friends of mine in the near future! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T18:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
