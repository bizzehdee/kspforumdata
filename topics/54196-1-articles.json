So I send these probes out and I send back all my information that they gather and then... they\u0027re useless. I commonly send them into the planet they are orbiting to gain atmospheric data on the way down to get a final amount of science out of them before they impact. I feel there should be a system that passively gives a small amount of science for leaving these probes in orbit around another terrestrial body and maintaining them. There would obviously have to be some balancing mechanics so people don\u0027t just leave them in space and time warp for max science, however with the plans for reputation should fix that problem. If you\u0027re not launching constant space missions you\u0027re space program is obviously worthless so you\u0027re reputation drops. But say later in the game you have probes orbiting every body, perhaps your reputaion can be based also on the rate at which you gain science, so for having many probes gathering large amounts of science continuously you get better reputation. I\u0027ve read into the current planned release of 0.23 however it doesn\u0027t solve this problem and there is no mention of it even being a problem yet so I thought I might as well say something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T10:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn real world, probes which did their task are often \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_probes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edeactivated or destroyed\u003C/a\u003E, too.
