It\u0027s change in velocity. \n\nHere, you need to know the original orbital velocity, the transfer orbit velocity, and the final orbit velocity. \n\nThen take the difference of the transfer at Periapsis with the original, and transfer at apoapsis with the final.\n\nAdd them up and Voila! Total maneuver Delta V.\n\nKnowing the Vis-Viva equation helps, as well as how to find semi major axis, which is pretty easy."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T16:33:26Z","Content":"Oberth effect... there is theoretical dV between orbits and stored dV as fuel (not the same)\n\nAnd gravity and aerodynamic loses if you ascending from surface..."},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:13:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oberth effect\n\nPlease, can you elaborate on how this applies to OP\u0027s question?"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:29:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Please, can you elaborate on how this applies to OP\u0027s question?\n\nHow much dv it\u0027s takes ... formal velocity difference or actual maneuver?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:29:27Z","Content":"OP said:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The hubble orbits at 510 km.
