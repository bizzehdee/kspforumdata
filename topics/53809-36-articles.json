I\u0027m not sure how squad performs the scalling. I assume it is through the unity render engine, which would scale textures in render, rather than in memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would probably recommend using my mod to manage textures, simply because I know how well the scaling algorithm works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - I do believe the settings would stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Yes, this is what I would do. The KSP settings would be applied on top of the mod settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - PC SYSTEM memory would be used. The graphics card driver would allocate more memory from the system in a driver and hot-swap it in. This of-course is MUCH slower than on-board graphics memory. However, the algorithms tend to keep textures in memory that are being used. Ie. You could a gigantic ship in LKO, and JUST be at the memory limit of your graphics card. If you switch views to a station orbiting Jool, the Jool texture would be loaded into memory, and likely bump the Kerbin texture out, so it would have a one-time frame hit while that texture was loaded out of system memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB - It would free up a bit of system memory, but you probably wouldn\u0027t notice it, and it wouldn\u0027t effect the number of mods you could use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - No, there are no real differences in loading times. All of KSP\u0027s textures are loaded into memory at-runtime. That is why it uses so much ram. However, smaller textures and compressed textures (DXT format) do RENDER faster, so frame-rate is positively impacted. MipMaps also help with this too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hammer Tech","CreatedById":97099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T15:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question about the config files...
