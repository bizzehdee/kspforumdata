You need to get your man outa there! Thing is, the escape capsule has been jarred loose from the main ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, you need some way to boost an undocked and thrustless Mk1 capsule back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my effort...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i395.photobucket.com/albums/pp38/FoxMouldy/Abandon1_zps5fcc3746.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Abandon1_zps5fcc3746.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve undocked the capsule and I\u0027m ready to use the decoupler and light the booster together. After that its all down to being pointed in the right direction and a big slice of luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few rulelettes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You can fly the capsule to orbit docked but before the de-orbit boost it must be undocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can use any engine or booster to accelerate your escape pod but it must not be attached to the Mk1 when running. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once the engine/booster is lit then no steering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The main craft will be recovered later and so must remain in it\u0027s current orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. All stock. No mods that alter parts or physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Your Kerbal must make it safely to the ground and he must be in the Mk1 capsule with nothing attached other than a chute and power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Orbit must be stable with Ap and Pe 70km or higher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. The spirit of the challenge is to use a railgun-type contraption to fire an undocked capsule towards Kerbin. If you want to try to find clever ways around the restrictions then I reserve the right to ignore your entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe winner is the person who gets their capsule closest to the KSC but just getting your Kerbal safely down anywhere on Kerbin is it\u0027s own reward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a screenshot of the craft in orbit, the booster lit (if possible), a map shot of the capsule\u0027s homeward-bound orbit and a map shot showing how close the landed capsule is to the KSC (a Mechjeb landing guidance panel or similar might help with that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s save our Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-04T15:49:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2015 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T20:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf i ever some time to just screw around ill try to pull this off, provided i can use a mass driver, and given i already use mass drivers here and there for various maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, are mass drivers allowed?
