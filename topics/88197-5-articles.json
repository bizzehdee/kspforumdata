Earth is running out of rare earth metals, and will eventually start to run low on its normal metal reserves, but I suspect precious metals will be of greatest contention. Even with EmDrives, building the vacuum-hardened equipment to send mining infrastructure into space is going to be expensive, and you\u0027ll still need surface-orbit launchers to carry the EmDrive vessel into space, which will drive the cost up further. Space-extracted metal might be plentiful but I think it will still cost quite a bit, so you\u0027ll have at least some conflicts over who gets to control the infrastructure. Having missiles/kinetic/laser platforms in space to defend your mining platforms and threatening to destroy other countries\u0027 in order to gain access may be cheaper than building and launching an entirely new mining outfit. Granted, conflicts might be rare, and it wouldn\u0027t be war in any visceral sense, but it\u0027d be intrigue nevertheless, although the conflicts might peter out when you have enough bases established and if/when global demand starts to level off, yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d by Stranded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, huzzah for more possible confirmation of the EmDrive\u0027s functionality!
