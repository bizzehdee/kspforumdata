I desperately want Unity 5\u0027s multi-threaded physics engine, but it\u0027s so many changes!

If you right-click on the asteroid, it will give you this option. It helps.\n\nI\u0027ve put two class C asteroids into orbit around Kerbin just these past few days, and once course has been set and my burn finished, I\u0027ve used time warp (several of them) with no problems. I\u0027ve not tried to land any yet however."}]}
