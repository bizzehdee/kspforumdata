The game simply doesn\u0027t do \u0022background processing\u0022 on anything but tracking the ships orbits and SOI transitions. What you see when you come back to the ship is that it \u0022catches up\u0022 with what happened since the last time it focused.

I landed near him, switched to him, and RCS\u0027d him over to my ship.\n\nThe deal here is that when you accept a rescue contract for somebody in orbit, they are in their capsule. The LS mod seems to recognize that they don\u0027t belong to you until you go rescue them. But when you get a rescue contact for somebody on a surface, they are actually EVA standing next to their capsule. This seems to confuse the LS mod, and they are treated as one of your Kerbals who is on a really long EVA. If I had one of the harsher penalty settings installed, poor Ned might have gone KIA and presumably I would have failed the contract. (Or maybe he would have \u0022wandered home\u0022 to KSP? I wonder how that would have affected the contact....)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T19:46:41Z","Content":"There might be a way to sort this - that is, disregard EVA kerbals who have never been in a vessel before."},{"CreatedByName":"PocketBrotector","CreatedById":135814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T21:55:30Z","Content":"The new infographics, and all of the questions they provoked on the subreddit, has inspired me to make a [tutorial/example](https://github.com/BobPalmer/USI-LS/wiki/Life-Support-Example:-Mission-to-Duna). \n\nMost of the USI-LS documentation is currently on the UKS wiki.
