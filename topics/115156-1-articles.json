It was an incredible station, and served well.\n\nHowever, after 100 days of service, a new module was added. It added lag, but helped the station massivly.\n\nEventualy, parts of the station were taken off and used around Minmus and on Solar Station. A part is also in use around the Mun.\n\nThe station became obsolete.\n\nSo, a Probe was sent up and De-Orbited Barbles with a Rt-5 Flea, before it was ditched to save lag.\n\nHere\u0027s what happened (well, the end of it.)\n\n\u0022Alright, Barbles is hitting the Atmosphere!\u0022 shouted Edgas at KSC. He was in charge of the Station\u0027s death because Gene was outside watching the Station through a tracker scope as it zipped 70 Kilometers above them.\n\nEveryone waited for the Plasma to form and for the probe to separate and give them some photos.\n\n\u0022Photos are coming in.\u0022 Phil, sitting a few rows across from him, put the first photo from the Probe up on the screen.\n\n![otwP26J.png](http://i.imgur.com/otwP26J.png)\n\n\u0022Wow, look at that Plasma!\u0022 Edgas said wide eyed. \u0022How are is the chase plane looking, Tracking?\u0022 He asked.\n\n\u0022She\u0027s intercepting now.\u0022 Richmond said as Cary pulled her Aeris 2A into a dive.\n\n\u0022Look what the probe just got!\u0022 Yelled Phil.\n\n![GYK2V6Q.png](http://i.imgur.com/GYK2V6Q.png)\n\nEdgas glanced at his screens. \u0022I can confirm the Forward Port broke off... And we\u0027ve lost out Coms 88-88. Tell Cary to transmit the photos to CubeSat-2\u0022\n\n\u0022Doing that now, flight.\u0022 Phil forwarded the message to Cary. \u0022Wait... Forward Port Cam 4 is sending something. It\u0027s relaying to Cary. And the CubeSat.\u0022\n\n\u0022Open it up!\u0022\n\n![huwlyyq.png](http://i.imgur.com/huwlyyq.png)\n\n\u0022Huh.\u0022 Edgas was surprised. \u0022So much survived.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll look up on that.\u0022 Phil replied. \u0022Cary\u0027s sending more photos.\u0022\n\n![k6UBsT8.png](http://i.imgur.com/k6UBsT8.png)\n\n![szGBzHP.png](http://i.imgur.com/szGBzHP.png)\n\n\u0022She\u0027s pulling out of the dive!\u0022 Phil said.\n\n\u0022And Barbles has hit the water.\u0022 Edgas sat down and grabbed a drink. \u0022Only 159 days in space. We need a better station next time\u0022.\n\n\u0022I guess. Cary\u0027s coming home, and the CubeSat just forwarded the final image.\u0022\n\n![SRvlmbf.png](http://i.imgur.com/SRvlmbf.png)\n\n\u0022Splash down.\u0022 Edgas muttered.\n\nLeaving the smoking wreckage behind her, Cary flew towards them.\n\nA few hours later, she landed.\n\nHer Aeris 2A had a gaping hole in its left wing.\n\nA piece of Plexiglass had hit her.\n\nThat was the last time anyone ever chased a space station."},{"CreatedByName":"GehringGame","CreatedById":145675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T13:00:05Z","Content":"That second photo from the probe looks awesome!"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:42:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That second photo from the probe looks awesome!\n\nThank you!\n\nNew section today.
