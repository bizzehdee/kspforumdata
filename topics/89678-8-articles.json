I don\u0027t know why I am just seeing this. If there is any reason for you to delay the production of Alexandria it would be because you are making series based on The Martian. I was just gonna ask you about doing a series like that. Also I don\u0027t know if you have read Seveneves but honestly I think something like that is right up you alley. I mean its got everything first of all building an ISS then expanding it and then attaching an asteroid to the front of it. Now that doesn\u0027t give anything away because its all on the inside front cover and first page. After that I wont give anything else away, the space infrastructure and the imagining of the space infrastructure in the book would be wonderful to see in KSP. Also we are gonna see The Martian on October 2nd. Seveneves could be a long way away so seeing something realized in video even if is in KSP would be wonderful especially by you. Good luck man I look forward to whatever you plan on posting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T05:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wLb0P9NWIM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T15:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are planning a Martian series just FYI making the Hermes is actually pretty easy by useing only 3 or 4 mods.
