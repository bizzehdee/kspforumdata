Get into orbit around kerbin at heading 090.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Face forwards so you are lined up with your trajectory (i.e wont do a retro burn if you use thrusters) Wait for the mun to start rising on your horizon (time acceleration helps).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3). Burn those thrusters until your Apogee just about reaches the orbit that the mun follows (its the outer hollow like ring), fast forward time and voila your at the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on how you time the burn when the moon was ascending, you may or may not need to retro burn to create an obrit, most times I end up needing a retro burn but its not much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you could do is at step 1, increase your orbit (ap and per) to be slightly less than that of the mun, and forward time until you connect, i\\\u0027ve heard this is more reliable way to get into an insta orbit easily. Though i\\\u0027m not sure if its as fuel efficient as the above...as you\\\u0027ll still need to retro burn a pretty big apogee and peri.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
