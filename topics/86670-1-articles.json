I was as excited as the rest of us for 0.24 and when it hit, I found myself at a wall. I had almost maxed my reputation and had over 2 million in the bank and had only gone as far as Minmus, but constantly lagging was science (I don\u0027t find it enjoyable to grind science). After setting up an orbital science lab around Minmus, I burned out of landing and docking after my second landing. I already know how to land and dock and click my mouse - don\u0027t need to prove it after doing it hundreds of times. I had explore Duna contracts, but no RTG\u0027s or large solar panels unlocked. I know I could cobble something together with a crapton of batteries and 1 x 6 panels, but why bother? I was not excited about 0.25 whatsoever due to the wall I hit, but figured I would try out the SP\u002B parts....then I found the Admin building and have been pretty much dead to the world due to playing KSP. Again, probably overpowered, but it makes the game more customizeable to different players wants and styles, so overall, I think the idea behind this feature is sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
