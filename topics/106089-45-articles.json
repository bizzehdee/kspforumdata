I would appreciate any insight!\n\u003E \n\nThey need tanks with a higher volume, not mass, around 4x more, and 8x more with you are using only LH2 (for nuclear engines).  \n\nLook at this infographic of Saturn V, the first stage make around 50% of the rocket volume, but have around 80% the weight. That\u0027s because it uses Kerosene and O2 (what the Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer in KSP best represents), and the upper stages uses mostly LH2 and O2, having a lower density.   \n  \n![saturn-v-color-cut-away-sm.jpg](http://heroicrelics.org/info/saturn-v/saturn-v-general/saturn-v-color-cut-away-sm.jpg)  \n  \n![270px-STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg/270px-STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg)  \n\nAnother example is the Shuttle. The orange tank (with LH2 and O2) weights around 760t, while both SRBs weights 1180t, being much smaller in volume. You can also compare the apparency and weight of Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy, to habituate better to the ideia.  \n\nThis additional volume impose some challenges, and allows for you to use the bigger rocket parts more often. One advantage I noted is in the reentry (SpaceX style), they slow faster with the atm.    \n\nHope that helps ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-06T18:15:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2018 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MaximumThrust**"},{"CreatedByName":"Idleness","CreatedById":135510,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T18:24:40Z","Content":"If I understand you correctly then, I need to examine the mass of the part combos a little more closely.
