Attach a probe or remote guidance unit to the part. This way you can control it once you discard it. Unfortunately without a plugin you won\u0027t be able to keep it around if it is in atmosphere outside of 2.5km. In space it will be flagged as debris and left there in its orbit until it collides with something or burns up in an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T15:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eplugin name plz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T15:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eplugin name plz\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that was more meant as a pre-emptive answer to somebody claiming that you can if you have plugin XYZ.
