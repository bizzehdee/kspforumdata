I am a new user who just bought KSP two days ago after painstakingly building my very first gaming computer. I am a noob, but I do know some of the basics from watching streamers like Plexistan, Das, and from youtubers such as Scott Manley. I have managed to build one successful rocket and one successful spaceplane so far, and I can provide pictures to anyone interested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I plan to open up my own KSP livestream, as well as make mods for the game. One mod I hope to start soon will add classic muscle car bodypanels, as well as automotive components. The idea is to be able to build rovers with a bit of style and speed(because seriously, who doesn\u0027t want to ramp a GTO off the lip of a crater?). I will need help with coding though, or at least a mentor, so yeah. That\u0027s all for now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T22:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
