It is unsearchable (basically you cannot buy one and wit will never show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E). The plugin would need to generate this part at \u0027X\u0027 orbit around \u0027Y\u0027 planet/moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach wormhole has a mated partner\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick and dirty way of implementing it would be to\u00A0make\u00A0any vessel with a potential to traverse said wormhole need a special wormhole navigation device (in actuality a\u00A0part with a docking port module of type \u0022wormhole\u0022).\u00A0The \u0027wormhole\u0027 part floating in orbit\u00A0would have the same docking port of type \u0022wormhole\u0022. The part itself could be physic-less, this would allow you to target the wormhole as a docking port but only \u0027pass through it\u0027 with the appropriate navigation module attached (there would also be the issue that you would have to actually approach the wormhole very carefully otherwise it won\u0027t work (you\u0027d have to \u0027dock\u0027 with it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here\u0027s the part which requires a plugin guru and I\u0027m not sure how achievable this would be; once docked to the wormhole the vessel goes \u0027on-rails\u0027 and is transported to the vicinity of the wormhole\u0027s mated pair (as if you used the rendezvous function in the cheat menu). Immediately after the jump is complete and before control is return to the player the docked wormhole part is forcibly undocked and\u00A0destroyed (aesthetically this would be done without the usual explosions and just\u00A0disappear\u00A0on arrival).\u00A0Once the original wormhole part is destroyed the plugin would then re-generate/re-instantiate) the original wormhole back at the original prescribed orbit (alternatively you could write it so the wormhole randomly jumps around the system after each use, meaning you\u0027d have to find it again? just an idea).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see how it would be implemented parts/model wise but alas my plugin writing limit me from actually creating this \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T15:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe something like that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141205-12-esld-jump-beacons-revived-09/\u0026amp;page=1\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150178-12-ftl-drive-continued/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you can try warp drives from\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90899-12-alcubierre-warp-drive-stand-alone-v050/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/100190-122-ksp-interstellar-extended-11118-12-01-2017-improved-beamed-power-network/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n"}]}
