But then I noticed that for some reason I always ran out of fuel before I got into orbit. After a few more tests I realized that My third stage liquid fuel was being drawed into my second stage liquid fuel. I have no idea why this is happening because my decoupler says that it won\u0027t allow fuel crossfeed. I\u0027ve tried fixing it for about 90 minutes and now I think that I\u0027m going to give up on this game because it\u0027s kinda a game-breaking bug for me :/.![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:15:19Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nRight click the tank and disable it by clicking the little green arrow.
