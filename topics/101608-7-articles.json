This mod being for RO just means I don\u0027t intend to do it myself. One problem with scaling this for stock is that the diameters of the parts do not match standard sizes. If you just scale the size down by around 65% upper diameter of the payload adapter and the boosters will at least match fairly closely at 3.75 and 2.5 meters, but the core will be 5.5 meters. It\u0027s not designed to be a modular set though, so maybe it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\nAnyway, now I have issues with the fairings again. I noticed they didn\u0027t fire when the the throttle was cut. I set the throttle to be locked in the config and that sorted that issue, but now the fairing separation has turned a bit more kerbal O\\_o\n\n![SLSfairingIssue.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/SLSfairingIssue.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T18:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T20:29:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Please read the very first sentence of this thread ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAh, it says this is for RO, but it isn\u0027t stopping anyone from making a stock config. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWHICH, I did.

You could push payload fractions of about 2-3%. After the ISP nerf bat that dropped to 1%. Anyways, real fuels is required for this mod to work.\n\nThe latest version of RF introduced changes that made the thrust curve not work, so the boosters burn out faster than they should. I have a fix that I will release tomorrow-ish.\n\nAlso, since I realized that the F9 cores could work as boosters with the Merlin thrust increase I\u0027m also going to make a special made decouples that can hold two F9s on each side of the SLS. This configuration can throw 60 tonnes to TLI!
