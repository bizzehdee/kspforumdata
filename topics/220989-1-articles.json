This can be fixed by changing the game to \u0022Windowed\u0022 mode, dragging the window to the central monitor, and then switching the game back to \u0022Borderless\u0022 or \u0022Windowed\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon relaunching the game, the game only appears on the central monitor again if the game was previously exited via the in-game \u0022Exit\u0022 option on the main menu or via the \u0022Quit Game\u0022 option in the game\u0027s escape menu. However, if the game was closed via the \u0022Close window\u0022 button accessed by right-clicking the game\u0027s icon on the taskbar (which is often how I personally exit from fullscreen games) or via termination in the task manager, the game will once again appear on the left monitor upon relaunch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: While writing\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/220991-game-windows-location-and-mode-sometimes-change-upon-relaunching-the-game/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis bug report\u003C/a\u003E, which covers a different but similar issue, I realized that I had only tested this bug in the \u0022Borderless\u0022 optioning the graphics settings.
