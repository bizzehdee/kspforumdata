Merging and combining can you do to create the body of the space ship. This is how you also did in Kerbal Space Program 1 with the wings but now you have changed it. You can now tweak your wings. Now we can get wings exactly as you want them, easily, without effort.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want the same with the gas tanks in Kerbal Space Program 2.
