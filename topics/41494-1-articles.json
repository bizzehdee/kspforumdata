However it has a small and regular docking port and carries one crew member. The bottom half does take 7 tons with change to a height of 120km with breathing room which would make it good from probe launches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The whole thing is completely reusable, but with no extra safety features which has killed a few of my kerbals along the way in testing.

So I might revise this little thing to carry more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T03:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThePsuedoMonkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThePsuedoMonkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI actually use DSTO for my lifting rockets.
