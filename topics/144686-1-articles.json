Regarding Multiplayer Version: Since there are Console versions of KSP, Multiplayer would not be far behind, since many of the consoles can be linked. This is done with such games as Halo. I would prefer this type where you could link with your friend rather than random people. With linked consoles, you could also have the option of modding and sharing mods. There was an early version of Multiplayer which I tried but could not use with mods. Since I use MacJeb and Kerbal Engineer alot, this was quite restricting. One problem with Random Multiplayer is that the players are at different places in the history of the game. Some might be highly advanced or aggressive while others are just newbies. Even the PC version would be good if you could link with specific players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T13:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMulitiplayer is a fanciful but unrealistic idea for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe distances and time travelling make the idea infeasible as someone would be spending a lot of time waiting for other players so that time-warp could be activated. Suggestions have been made to deal with this but none are really workable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have several players all existing in different time zones then interaction is not possible between them. This makes playing in the same game pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are the multiplayer community members themselves. Many of them are truly evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spend a great deal of time and effort just to find a way onto a server and get into a game. A game where the current players may have spent weeks or months getting stations or bases in place. They would then take great pleasure in destroying the work of other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the moment that developers start to make a game multiplayer all that the players can do is whinge and moan that this isn\u0027t working or that isn\u0027t fast enough and go into detail about how low a level of life form they feel the developers are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would be able to forget about other updates and improving the game in other areas as one thus path is taken there will be no joy until it is done. It will never be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are the KSP players. The vast majority are uncommonly decent and civil to each other.
