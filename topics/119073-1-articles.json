I\u0027m attempting to do a new type of tech tree and arrows are all over the place. Does anyone know how to hide arrows in the tech tree (the ones linking parents to child nodes).

You would have to unlock several for each complex part but that tech would then also be useful for other parts, weather they\u0027d be closely associated or not. Lines going through the whole table to another table of parts would be very messy.
