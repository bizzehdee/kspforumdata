It saves on buildtime and partcount and strutting (a single strut can do a pretty good job of making even a large pWing behave, while lego wings tend to bend on each segment so need many struts) and the pWings we equal in terms of mass and lift when compared to equally-sized stock wings. It\u0027s a win-win in my opinion.\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t have strong opinions about them becoming a stock feature. If the mod ever gets updated I\u0027ll probably go back to that and be perfectly happy.\n\nIf there were a stock version, I would suggest that wings have four tweakables. Root length, tip length, span, and sweep. Let each setting be adjustable in ticks the size of the Wing Connector C (or smaller, if you want). The root and tip lengths describe the front-back length of the wing at each end and span would determine the wingspan. Sweep would determine where the tip is placed relative to the root. With these you could create almost all of the stock wing primitives, or any triangle or parallelogram of most any size, with a single piece. These sliders would save the awkwardness of the hold-and-drag used in the pWings mod, and can align things more cleanly to a grid. It would save the user the trouble of adjusting wings with four roots and twenty parts in chunks and cut down on menu clutter by merging over a dozen parts into one (the aero tab is pretty busy).

I can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve wished for a wing to have *slightly* less of an angle, or that this one part was a little longer.\n\nHence, my compromise is that we keep the stock wings, but make them \u0027stretchable\u0027, in which you can move the wing edges around (within reason) to better fit with the surrounding parts.
