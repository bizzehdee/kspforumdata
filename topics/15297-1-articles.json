Which makes getting to the Mun harder (right?). I have made one Mun orbit transition and was able to soft land with a Munar Lander I found on a youtube video. Unfortunately, our Kerbal heroes had to wait for rescue as I screwed up the return and eventually ended up in a 54M km/24M km ellipitcal orbit around Kerbin and the Mun. (Since the demo doesn\\\u0027t have persistence, I have told myself that the Kerbals were rescued by one of you Rocket Scientists, so I don\\\u0027t feel bad about leaving virtual Kerbals in orbit forever.) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, will this also work for getting into an equatorial orbit around the Mun, but with much, much lower altitudes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun Landing Photo \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ec6.pinimg.com/upload/400046379369496589_hqBYtg2k_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022400046379369496589_hqBYtg2k_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T01:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022grimkriz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022grimkriz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as you always use the same flight path you can easily identify which stages are underpowered/overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is this \u0027overpowered\u0027 of which you speak?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh...no mind.
