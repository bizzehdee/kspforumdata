When you dock two vessels together, the game sticks the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eolder\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0timestamp onto both vessels. So yes, when you docked to the mothership, that probably made your satellite not \u0022new\u0022 anymore (older than the acceptance time for the contract). You have to be very careful about what you dock with, when the contract says it wants a new vessel.
