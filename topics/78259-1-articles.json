Strapped two liquid fuel tanks and engines on side of the almost empty booster and activated by staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is another issue, some test ask you to run test other require staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHint you can disable an engine put it one step up in staging and stage to unlock, very practical then testing large engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peder","CreatedById":57860,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T07:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1). I wanted to rescue the kerbal stranded in orbit.. When finaly reaching him I found out there where no room in the capsul so i had to launch a new mission ;-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2). I had a random generated mission to test the big external boosters in orbit... well rather hard to do in the start of the game where funds are limited since they are rather and into orbit since they are heavy to get up there. I tried a few times, but gave up building a rocket since it became to expensive in the start of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3). test engine in water.. well I landed in water and instant fired the engine.. ( took me 2 tries to figure out I should first \u0022stage\u0022 and activate the engine when in water since I could not see the green text highlight when touching water).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4). I staged the rocket wrong so the parashutes open when i press launch.. ( it was a big expensive rocket dooh ) but I managed to get it into the air and decouple and made an eva in 15km height to repack the shutes. It did this when the rocket go from climbing to falling and the speed was around 10m/s. It was a bit scary.! ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5). I thought I do 5 missions at once and test many parts on one rocket. The big problem was however that I could not not remember what to activate at what specific height and speed while flying.... keep it simple stupid ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-19T08:06:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2014 08:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Peder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
