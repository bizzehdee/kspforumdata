How come that no matter how many batteries I put on my probe, it always ends up powerless when kerbin blocks the sun. Keep in mind the probe in question is in geostational orbit, not that I see that as important, but I don\u0027t know everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have added 3000 battery power over 3 different versions, and they all seem to run drain on power at the same spot, despite there not being an other stuff added to them.
