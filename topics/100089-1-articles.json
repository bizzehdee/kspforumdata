It\u0027s about 1km wide (or tall depending on orientation). Oh, but so far I do have the control rooms, the med bay, the landing pad, the service centre, the manufacturing/repair yard, the observation deck, and 2 nightclubs... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:57:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E with exception to the mechanical/moving parts, as while it is in the game, it is more limited than my imagination\n\nthere are pistons/rotors"}]}
