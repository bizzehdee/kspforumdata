If you\u0027re at the space center, it will hit the surface and be removed. Asteroid impacts don\u0027t actually do anything in the game, unfortunately.

I sent a ship to intercept it on its way down, and was able to modify it\u0027s Pe enough to avoid impact. I also lowered its Ap with my remaining fuel when it got close. I plan to send another mission to it to try and pull it into a circular orbit so I can mine it and get science, and so Kerbin can have a little buddy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
