For one, while in HIGH orbit, I deliberately slow my movement to as close to zero as possible - this reduces (almost) any sideways movement to manageable amounts. During this phase I am (ab)using the map to determine where I\\\u0027m going to land - if I stack the center of the mun on top of the center of where the icon for my craft is on the map, I get a reasonably good idea of where my ship\\\u0027s going to land. I want to land on the lit side of the mun and somewhere in a crater, preferably. If I\\\u0027ve truly screwed this up, corrections can be made on the way down - but I\\\u0027ll need to go through a zeroing of the movement again, which will waste fuel - so it\\\u0027s a good idea to get it right the first time. When I\\\u0027m sure I\\\u0027m going to land, I point my ship vertically, turn on the rcs thrusters with an asas and try to drop down vertically the rest of the way without any further input. Sometimes this doesn\\\u0027t work and I have to make adjustments, so I again zero all my movement. When I get close enough to the surface to see the ship\\\u0027s shadow I should be moving at less than ten meters per second, better to have it even slower than that if possible. When about to touch the surface I want to have the ship\\\u0027s throttle set that the ship\\\u0027s thrust is being very slightly overcome by the gravity, so when I hit the ship won\\\u0027t suddenly bounce off the surface. Speaking of which, remember how I said I have an asas with rcs thrusters enabled all the way down? Three reasons for this: Any stability problems on the way down will be corrected automatically, when you hit the surface if you *do* bounce off, your ship will automatically recover if it decides to flip over, and if you *don\\\u0027t* bounce off the asas will assist to slow your ship\\\u0027s horizontal movement down since you will tend to tip towards the direction you\\\u0027re moving when you hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, the best way to learn how to land a ship is to do it.

As far as I can tell, the best \u0027lander legs\u0027 in the vanilla game are the movable fins - they dip far down at their trailing edge wingtip , well below where they attach. The fixed fins don\\\u0027t, being a trapizodal shape, so though you might not want your legs to wiggle about, you may have to live with it unless you mod or Harv and the boys add some standard legs. Don\\\u0027t worry, their collision mesh does not move, so the movement does not affect their use as legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are very low mass, and also have the highest collision rating of any part, so do not seriously affect the rocket. They do make it much more difficult to get out of the atmosphere, due to their drag, and their location on top of the rocket, when used in this role, is not conducive to stability. Combine them with an Advanced SAS though, and they manage to pull double-duty though on the stability end of things though. I don\\\u0027t touch anything but T, Shift and Space until 30,000 meters on me rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can struss them up with struts too, they must always be the second item attached though. I like 3 struts each, one left, one right, one above. I use 6 fins total, 6x symmetry. Plenty of strength results, the thing can slide (and has) down hills on Kerbal and not loose a fin (well, it lost one). It\\\u0027s also fairly big - my lander is comprised of: 1 gimballing LFE engine, 7 fuel tanks, 2 RCS fuel tanks, 12 RCS motors, 1 Advanced SAS, 6 fuel transfer lines, 6 moving fins, 24 struts, 1 stack decoupler, the command module and parachute. I think this size helps it a lot - the high inertia acts to damp the control inputs and makes it all smoother. This is actually too heavy to lift off the ground with full tanks on Kerbal, but it plenty potent on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, usual approach then is pretty close to E. F. Kranz\\\u0027s method. Fly by instruments, beyone checking that the ground is reasonably level and using shadows (if not eclipsed by Kerbal, it\\\u0027s happened to me) to gauge final descent distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual approuch and landing is as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering moon SoI enter moon orbit between 10,000 and 5,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn approach to desire landing site convert velocity readout to Surface relative (not orbit), point ship retrograde and fire main engines. Holding ship with the retrograde marker (\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E) centered in the navball, much as E. F. Kranz\\\u0027s method suggests, and keep it there until the ship approaches 0m/s. The retrograde marker will rapidly move just before this occurs. When it rapidly moves out of the way, press X to kill the engines. You have probably now managed to reduce your forward and lateral motion to around 3m/s or less - indeed, with some finess you could probably attain a velocity of about 0.3m/s before killing the engines - this is far more accurate than Red Irons map method, and will place you into a nearly-perfect vertical descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the ship begins to freefall vertically, re-orient the ship vertically and place the retrograde market back into the center of the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry not to burn too much fuel doing so but manage your descent speed to what you feel is safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn approach below 500m indicated altitude, reduce speed to about 5m/s and hold it around there with careful throttle control. Try not to go too slow - doing so will exagaggerate the lateral retrograde markers movement - remember, at 5m/s, a lateral velocity of 0.1m/s won\\\u0027t perturb the marker too far from center. At 0.1m/s however, with the same lateral motion (ie, all of it now) the retrograde marker will be completely on the side, and you will probably overcorrect for it - and that\\\u0027s where the shit hits the fan - but continue to follow the marker gently, keeping speeds lower and lower until touchdown, figure around 3m/s at touchdown. Then x to kill it. The total velocity at touchdown is more important than your lateral velocity, and if you follow the retrograde marker smoothly and accurately, it\\\u0027s entirely possible - and sometimes easier (because it\\\u0027s more conventional controls) to do so without RCS - but RCS can help so don\\\u0027t shy from it if you want to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh, yeah, if things start to go sideways, figurately or literally, always remember: Burning directly retrograde, with the marker center to the navball, and doing so as perfectly as you can until speed is as close to 0m/s as you can manage and then killing engines will always put you back into a perfect vertical freefall. Don\\\u0027t be afraid to do so if you need to straighten things out. Just remember that the marker will go wonky-like when you approach 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newman","CreatedById":11547,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-31T09:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, these guidelines should be of help:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - make your lander as light as possible.

Look up Ivan Ivanovich\\\u0027s excellent guides on this to gain an understanding of basic orbital mechanics, and how to modify your periapsis, apoapsis, and inclination. Setting up your orbit so it goes over a crater is easy. After that you just need to break at the right time. Use the map, and you should be fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when you\\\u0027re ready to begin your deorbit burn, try and get as close to zero speed as you can by following the reverse vector icon on the navball.

Use SAS to lock your orientation dead center, use your main engine to control vertical velocity, and use the RCS translation controls to control horizontal velocity. Though I\\\u0027ve done landings without RCS at all, it\\\u0027s easier like this, especially on a smaller lighter lander the RCS will have more of an effect on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- keep your vertical velocity as low as possible and prepare to kill engines completely the moment you touch the ground.

The big craters are said to be nice. But even in the tutorial video, as we get closer, steep slopes appear out of nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I missed a graphics setting, or something?

I am also assuming that the change in spacecraft mass is negligible over the whole maneuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting at a distance \u003Cem\u003Er\u003C/em\u003E from the planet\\\u0027s center, the delta-v to stop the circular orbit is Sqrt (\u003Cem\u003EGM/r\u003C/em\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-\u003Cem\u003Ev\u003C/em\u003E to cancel out the velocity acquired after falling from that distance \u003Cem\u003Er\u003C/em\u003E to the Mun\\\u0027s surface at \u003Cem\u003ER\u003C/em\u003E=200 km is given by \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESqrt(2\u003Cem\u003EGM\u003C/em\u003E(\u003Cem\u003E1/R-1/r\u003C/em\u003E). This comes from energy conservation, if you\\\u0027re wondering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding these, and noting from the Wiki that Sqrt(GM/R)=570 m/s for the Mun, the overall delta-v required to land is then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 570 m/s (1/Sqrt(\u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E) \u002B Sqrt(2-2/\u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E)) where dimensionless \u003Cem\u003Ex = r/R\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smallest sensible value of this function is at \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E=1, i.e. \u003Cem\u003Er=R\u003C/em\u003E or zero altitude (!), and it has a maximum at \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E=3, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei.e. \u003Cem\u003Er\u003C/em\u003E=3\u003Cem\u003ER\u003C/em\u003E, or altitude \u003Cem\u003Er-R =2R\u003C/em\u003E=400km. Graph attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat surprised me at first, I thought there would be more of a trade-off between orbiting (slower with increasing altitude) and falling (faster with increasing altitude). But the short answer is, the lower your circular orbit, the less fuel you will need to land. Of course in practice you\\\u0027ll need to be at least a few thousand meters up because unlike my simplified model, it takes time to slow down. And if you\\\u0027re higher up, you can see landing sites ahead better. I think Kosmo-not\\\u0027s video above shows a good compromise, starting at 10 000 m circular orbit and dropping down from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iskierka","CreatedById":2116,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-08T20:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat model also does not consider another factor: the delta-v required to get to that orbit. From a theoretical infinitely distant approach point, while the highest efficiency descent is from a low orbit, that orbit required more delta-v to enter in the first place. If you can enter a free-return trajectory of 10 km, circularise, and descend from there, it would certainly be more efficient than attempting to move up and descend, but if you entered at 100 km? Considering the reduced requirements for circularization, it\\\u0027s entirely possible it might not be any more efficient to descend to 10 km before making your final approach. Could be something to factor in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
