We already have moving parts.\n\nI\u0027m not saying that animations are inherently difficult - as an add-on author, I frequently make animated parts regularly.\n\nWhat I\u0027m saying is that the time and effort put into adding a door animation to ***each and every*** crew pod are better spent on other, more critical features.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No insides, but a standard animation as a Kerbal emerges from the dark head first as the door open, close door and grab, will be a very good first step.\n\nHave you ever examined a KSP from inside out? You\u0027ll find that it is not \u0022dark\u0022 but transparent to whatever\u0027s in the flight scene, because model mesh faces in Unity are inherently one-sided. In order to have a \u0022dark\u0022 space for a Kerbal to emerge from, you will need to modify the pod model by having a cuboid mesh with reversed normals textured black, located near the hatch opening.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As I previously say, a small hatch and animation doesn\u0027t give enought time to look at the insides.\n\nA user\u0027s camera may be oriented in a manner that allows a good glimpse of the (lack of) insides of a pod even during that short animated duration.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I agree some hatch could be rework in the process, but It\u0027s mostly textures.\n\nWhile for some pods it is only the textures that need to be reworked, for other pods, the hatch may be enlarged/shifted, which requires the corresponding airlock spawn collider / ladder colliders to be redone. Again, it might be easy to do for one or two pods, but very time consuming for the developers to go through all the stock pods and implement this change."},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:49:17Z","Content":"Thank you for theses precisions.\n\nBut in the case of Squad decide to spend/planning some time on this particular subject, wich animations do you feel is lacking and should be implemented first, in the time allowed by Squad for that task?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:56:03Z","Content":"Idles.

The other Kerbal looks at the first and then responds if they have a compatible dumbness level (within 10%.)\n\n-Insult: One Kerbal starts yelling at the other. Depending on courage of the other, they might yell back or look down and frown.\n\n***Idle fiddling.*** No other Kerbal is within 2 meters.\n\n-Examine environment: Science Career Only. The Kerbal takes a moment to take it all in. Looking at the sky, the stars, the planets, looking at the rocks and regolith, everything around them.\n\n-Hand movements: Basically the same motion that Kerbals in command pods do. Clapping, moving hands back and forth.\n\n-Stare at hand: Only kerbals with dumbness of 90% or higher do this. They just look concerned at their hand, moving it around, back and front of the hand.\n\n-Head bobbing to the music: Head slowly moves in a speed that matches most of the stock music.\n\n-Grasp Helmet: Just to make sure it doesn\u0027t come off.\n\n***Walking around*** This can be disabled on the Kerbal\u0027s context menu, but a Kerbal might want to just walk around the lander or rover, jump a bit, stop, do some idle fiddling or talk to a Kerbal, and move away. Maybe fall around get back up again.\n\n***Other***\n\n-Worship. This is done if the Kerbal is within 15 meters of a monument or easter egg, and the Kerbal has stupidity higher than 50%.

Maybe he\u0027s talking to himself, maybe he\u0027s talking to KSC. Maybe he\u0027s chatting with the guy in the Command Pod. Maybe he\u0027s chatting with the other guys elsewhere on the surface.
