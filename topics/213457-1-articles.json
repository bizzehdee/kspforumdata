Would be great if some of those points would be added or altered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Estimated node burn time indicator not found, important indicator to make vague guesses\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/General; camera scroll up and down should be shift and scroll wheel, right now just messes up \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Apoapsis periapsis indicator altitude missing (only current is shown), very crucial in maneuver planning on end point. display should be on respective AP/PE\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Maneuver editor should look like KSP (optimal), arrows too big, directions mostly unclear, also for the rotation tool. KSP direction wheel felt more natural\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- UI is way to big and half the screen is overlay, closing buttons would be nice and size change in options\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- In action group window it should be available to just click on part (group) to add it, not search through the list like currently (KSP 1 blue highlight). Also multiple parts (e.g. 8 solar panels) should be grouped, not each single added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Separator should have an additional attachment point in the middle if e.g. 2 engine part was chosen, not attaching on \u0022left\u0022 or \u0022right\u0022 engine only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be that the option is just hidden and I did not figure it out naturally as KSP 1 player. Generally it would be nice to have a ksp 1 UI and maneuver planning as it was simple, good looking and worked for over a decade perfectly. at least the option to change to the \u0022classic\u0022 UI in the menu would nbe very nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the moon!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
