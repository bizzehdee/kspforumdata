I would agree that it is stock-like in its simplicity and softer consequences. There\u0027s a lot of potential here, especially since it\u0027s integrated with the USI mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: There are plans to add additional supply containers/form factors, yes? I ask because right now, there\u0027s a pretty big leap between the standard 15-day window in a pod with no supplies and the 1.25 m pod that can keep a single kerbal fed for over a year. Empty mass seems pretty low, so only packing what you need isn\u0027t too bad, but the 1.25 m inline part is a fairly large volume if you only need 10 extra days or so of supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, I would very humbly suggest that you may want to reconsider adding supplies to command modules, and possibly decreasing the \u0022no-snack\u0022 window if you want the balance to be the same. Just because a kerbal \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E work for 15 days without snacks doesn\u0027t mean it would be particularly thrilled about the idea. Sending him/her off with no supplies whatsoever for a short trip to the Mun doesn\u0027t feel quite right. Moreover, if you\u0027re shooting for stock-like integration into career mode, I don\u0027t know that it makes sense to go from \u0022supplies don\u0027t matter\u0022 to \u0022supplies on everything\u0022 around the time you start getting interested in Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m excited about this because I really like the USI suite of stuff, and having an integrated life support system makes sense.

I ask because right now, there\u0027s a pretty big leap between the standard 15-day window in a pod with no supplies and the 1.25 m pod that can keep a single kerbal fed for over a year. Empty mass seems pretty low, so only packing what you need isn\u0027t too bad, but the 1.25 m inline part is a fairly large volume if you only need 10 extra days or so of supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, I would very humbly suggest that you may want to reconsider adding supplies to command modules, and possibly decreasing the \u0022no-snack\u0022 window if you want the balance to be the same.

This was chosen mostly arbitrarily, so hopefully balance isn\u0027t too weird.
