It was very cool, and I suggest you go if you can, because you see new things and learn about stuff such as how NASA is renovating the KSC for the new SLS. Another cool thing is that you can see the real SpaceShuttle Atlantis (the one that was in space around 30 times), up close. Me and my family went on the Up-Close Tour, which took us the VAB, The shuttle landing facility, and Launch Pads 39a and 39b. While the tour bus was driving place to place, our tour guide talked about the things that happen at KSC, SLS, and History. He eventually got to talking about asteroid redirect missions. When we got to our next stop, I said to him \u0022I play a video game called Kerbal Space Program, and it was just updated and now has SLS like parts, and asteriod redirect parts. The developers said that they collaborated with NASA to make the update. Do you know anything about that?\u0022 He replied that he did not know about KSP and NASA working together, but he did know about KSP and said that some of the staff and engineers at the space center played KSP as a sort of simulator. I have heard stories that NASA uses it, but I found it surprising that they actually played KSP. Anyways, here are some pictures: \u003Cstrong\u003EPICTURES TO COME AS SOON AS IMGUR WORKS WITH MY PHONE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T13:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow!
