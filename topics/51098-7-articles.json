Yes, if you have a negative void coefficient in a PWR, you can avoid prompt criticality like in Chernobyl, but that\u0027s not the problem, the problem is decay heat after you shut down the reactor, which can quite happily cause Hydrogen explosions, blow the lid off a pressure vessel, or melt the fuel through the floor of the reactor building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolten salt thorium breeder reactors are so interesting because fission only occurs as the salt-fuel mix is pumped through the moderator at operating temperature. If it gets too hot, thermal expansion pushes fuel out of the moderator, and it goes subcritical. If it gets even hotter, the melt plug melts and the entire thing drains into a subcritical cooling area. The primary problem isnt one of nuclear physics or reactor design, it\u0027s material science, as we\u0027re struggling to find something that can resist attack by fluoride salts over the timescale required for an economically viable plant. Interestingly, even though it\u0027s called \u0022thorium power\u0022, most of the actual fission occurs in U-233, which is \u0022bred\u0022 from thorium in the salt solution. Unfortunately, Thorium power is many years behind uranium, because uranium is more useful for weapons development. Not every program who used uranium did it because they wanted to build a bomb, but as the technology was already in place, it was far cheaper to build on the previous reactor technology than go down a completely new R\u0026amp;D path. As a concept, Thorium reactors are far more passively safe than Uranium, and also the reactions lend themselves far more favourably to \u0022burning\u0022 what would otherwise be considered waste (meaning the waste is absolutely screaming with radioactivity for hundreds of years, as opposed to merely very radioactive for tens of thousands)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, these risks are very small.

I know very little about civilian plants except by analogy, but I\u0027m assuming that a PWR is a PWR. And by looking at DoE inspection reports for civilian reactors it seems they have many of the same issues with materials, water chemistry, failure modes that naval plants do (e.g. the steam generator u-tube degradation at San Onofre or reactor vessel corrosion at Brown\u0027s Ferry.) True that naval plants use HEU, and perhaps having a lower neutron flux density in the core might have mitigated \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E of the casualties I described (power peaking and uneven fuel use due to unbalanced coolant flow.) And like fossil-fuel fired plants, much of the personnel danger is due to the steam plant, not the reactor side, but steam plant casualties in a nuclear plant have the added complication of affecting the reactor (e.g. a rupture in the steam system can cause a cold water excursion that could overpower and damage the core.) It is telling that as a plant supervisor, 95% of what I did during operation was materials management through water chemistry and tight temp/pressure control to prevent brittle fracture. And the most dangerous things we did were not operations, but maintenance -- by several orders of magnitude.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know, reactors in submarines are much more unstable.

Most people have no experience of actually quantifying risk, they judge it entirely qualitatively based on what they see on the TV and read in the newspaper. People will hear news for days about a plane crash and worry about getting on a plane for weeks or months afterward but they won\u0027t think twice about getting into their cars and driving somewhere, an activity which is far more likely to get them killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother related point is that most people are also very unfamiliar with (and often outright distrustful of) statistics, hence the common phrase \u0022there are lies, damn lies and statistics.\u0022 This is because while almost everyone has the ability to understand an individual statistic, they don\u0027t have the experience to look at the way those statistics were collected to determine if they have been weighted correctly, determining whether the sample size has been abused to produce a particular outcome, etc. This is unfortunate because it means that even a very sound argument based on good data might be ignored solely because you\u0027re using those damned evil statistics to make a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear energy, unfortunately, suffers from both of these issues. Nuclear accidents are big news because they are scary and have some emotional resonance with the general public, when people see a coal power plant there is not the same fear, they don\u0027t see something that has caused a comparable number of deaths to the entire history of the nuclear industry, even though depending upon its period within its lifecycle and its location, it\u0027s quite possible that it actually has.

The anti-nuclear lobby point often to Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France and draw conclusions about the cost of nuclear power based solely on their costs. Of course, we need to realise that we\u0027re looking at the first two of a brand new type of reactor. In Europe, there hasn\u0027t been a great deal of new nuclear construction since the 1980s, expertise is not as available as it once was and there is a large knowledge and skills base that needs to be built up. Virtually all large-scale engineering projects suffer from cost overruns with their initial units, with costs dropping dramatically for later units. There is plenty of data available from previous rounds of nuclear engineering projects to help estimate just how the costs will change with varying amounts of new construction - those with an interest in performing a meaningful analysis will apply discount rates for later units to try to derive an accurate forecast of costs while those with a point to prove will continue to add up the costs from the two power plants, divide by capacity and point to an excessive cost / MWh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T18:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEstimates vary, though I\u0027ve seen numbers up to a million Curies total over the 30 year operation of the plant.

It almost goes without saying, but when it does so, it is only near the zenith for a fraction of the day, and only a fraction of those days will have clear skies.\u003Cp\u003EA solar power sat near geosync gets full solar radiation 24/7 365.25, and can beam that power anywhere on the globe. The idea clearly has merit, the main argument against it being economic. As electricity prices rise, demand for clean energy increases, and costs decrease, they become viable.

The cost of PV panels has really nosedived in the last few years, but launch costs are still high. A panel in orbit has greater insolation for longer, but not enough to make up the difference. Arrays at ground level may have less insolation available per unit area, but the high cost of shipping mass to orbit means you\u0027ll get way more output per unit cost by simply building a bigger array on the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the economic side, the fact that output of a ground-mounted array matches demand reasonably well (especially in areas where aircon is used) means it can often sell it\u0027s output at a higher price, instead of having to try and sell bargain-bin baseload power like a space-based array would have to. On top of this, I don\u0027t know of any country that\u0027s offering incentives for solar feed-in electricity that account for space-based installations, so there would be a lot of uncertainty for investors about the possible returns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
