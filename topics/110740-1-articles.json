There are two kind of capsules:\n\nOne is a cylinder shaped capsule and the other one is a cone shaped capsule, both of them have small radial size and have 5 monopropellant and 50 electric power! Please note that they are not able to control the ship so put a probe core on the capsule!\n\nAnimals:\n\nThere a 3 animals to choose from:\n\nDogs\\*\\*:\n\nDogs are the least expensive animals to hire and are usually light green with yellow spots!\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey cost 20,000 funds to hire and recovering it from orbit gives you 10 science!\n\nCats\\*\\*:\n\nCats are cute furry felines that are usually brown covered in green spots!\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey cost 40,000 funds to hire and recovering it from orbit gives you 30 science!\n\nMonkeys\\*\\*:\n\nMonkeys are furry animals that are red and there the most expensive animals you can hire!\n\nThey cost 60,000 funds to hire and recovering it from orbit gives you 50 science!\n\nHope you like my suggestion!![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n\\*You will need to unlock the animal capsule in the tech tree\n\n\\*\\*Those names will be \u0022kerbalized\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*They can come in different colors\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*You will need to upgrade the astronaut complex to level 2 and you can only hire 3 animals!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T21:16:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Donterrio**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T03:24:40Z","Content":"This seems like the kind of thing that would work better in a life support mod.

Once the necessary knowledge has been obtained for use with humanoid Kerbals, however, these large mammals become practically useless (Sending a Kerbpig to Jool offers no more data than sending a Kerbpig to LKO).\n\nSmaller animals such as mice and insects would be more practical as experiments for mid-to-late game missions, but I suspect that they would be integrated inside a pressurized crew compartment that Kerbals would be able to access/observe easily (i.e the Mobile Processing Lab).\n\ntl;dr - I personally feel that animals as the OP proposed have extremely limited utility in the overall scope of the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T04:30:44Z","Content":"The proposed pigs are too expensive. I want to strap them into an external command seat during re-entry, for a crispy bacon roll after landing. Probably need a radial attach sauce dispenser as well.\n\nSeriously though, while I like the idea of more types of science, more things to do in career, etc, I see a problem with this. It has to be capped, or people would just have an endless stream of flying pigs to max out the science tree. So, that\u0027s a whole load of implementation effort for possibly not so much use. Taking them to other SoIs, biomes, etc, I\u0027m not sure if that really makes sense for a zero g animal study. Not saying it\u0027s a totally crazy idea and shouldn\u0027t be done, only that a lot of thought needs to go into how to do it in a way that isn\u0027t any of:\n\n1) A 1 shot or 2 shot deal, then never used again\n\n2) Pay 80k and get 40 science, repeat until tree unlocked\n\n3) Completely fake and unrealistic to prevent abuse\n\n4) Completely fake and unrealistic to provide an ongoing purpose\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T04:33:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T06:35:30Z","Content":"There is a KSP pony.
