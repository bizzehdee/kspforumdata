I thought this could be implemented in KSP, in career mode you could invest in higher-quality cameras, heat detection cameras etc. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could put the camera on a probe, and then look back and had taken a photo of kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic Graphics (this will take a while).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe graphics of the game will be improved ? ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I read the suggestion of ME68, about a museum, TOTALLY AGREE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Interstellar Travel (beyond the solar system, on deep space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Let\u0027s say you send a probe to duna, and she finds salt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, you send a mission to colonize duna, it would be interesting if you could manually extract the salt, or build a machine to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals should feel hungry, then they should have a hunger meter, then they should have a limited number of food on the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If a Kerbal crashes very strong on the spaceship, he could die for breaking the helmet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso have tips for multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion they should have two modes: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECo-op: 4 players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 are on the spacecraft, 1 is in the control center, this mode would be in first person all the time. The guy from the control center would be the guy that constructed the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine: you enter on the server, you go inside the spaceship, looking only for a small window, you have to take instructions from the command center and then execute the mission, your life is in the hands of another person. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace-race: 2-4 players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers receive a sum of money and a mission, who execute the mission first wins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
