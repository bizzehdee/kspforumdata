Making it more complex -- communication links don\u0027t just shut down as these factors become less favorable; what happens is the available data rate diminishes until it is effectively unusable. I think the compromise of just requiring both antennas to have a max range less that the distance between nodes is a good one and makes for interesting challenges when designing the satellite network.

The KSC could have an infinite-range antenna, and it still wouldn\u0027t be able to talk to a satellite half the time. Indeed, it\u0027s trivial to work around the KSC range limitation by the time it\u0027s an issue - park a craft next to the KSC with a few of your best antennae and a stack of solar panels and batteries. I really like the automatic-search idea mooted in the thread, perhaps with a Flight Computer setting to \u0022start automatic comms search after X minutes\u0022. In my view, the difficulty in RemoteTech should be dealing with the comms lag and the actual restrictions of dish range and arc - not constantly sawing off the branch you\u0027re standing on.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jiraiyah","CreatedById":97667,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eanyone tried this on 1.0 or will it not work? common can\u0027t wait for this must have mod lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"okbillybunnyface","CreatedById":19009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jiraiyah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jiraiyah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eanyone tried this on 1.0 or will it not work? common can\u0027t wait for this must have mod lol\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joebopie","CreatedById":49911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022okbillybunnyface\u0022 data-cite=\u0022okbillybunnyface\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERead?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehow about answering the dam question instead of being so arrogant? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis typing the word \u0022NO\u0022 so much harder than the word \u0022read\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"okbillybunnyface","CreatedById":19009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joebopie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joebopie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow about answering the dam question instead of being so arrogant? \u003Cp\u003Eis typing the word \u0022NO\u0022 so much harder than the word \u0022read\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETyping \u0022No\u0022 would\u0027ve actually been two letters easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joebopie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joebopie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow about answering the dam question instead of being so arrogant? \u003Cp\u003Eis typing the word \u0022NO\u0022 so much harder than the word \u0022read\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
