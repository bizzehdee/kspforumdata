Only problem is, that the key shortcut alt-s is instead triggering a Steam shortcut. (I\u0027m also hitting issues with alt-f-number keys instead triggering OS X functions, but that\u0027s less significant). Changing the mod key from alt to cmd would solve this, but doesn\u0027t seem to be an option within the KSP settings. Any ideas would be appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T14:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TrueProphet**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T13:15:33Z","Content":"You could manually edit settings.cfg\n\nsearch for\n\nMODIFIER\\_KEY"},{"CreatedByName":"TrueProphet","CreatedById":142415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:17:18Z","Content":"Perfect - thank you.
