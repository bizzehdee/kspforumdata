In this case it even applies. You need struts to transmit the landing forces around and keep it together, since the mk3 joints are very week as r4pt0r said above. Another option is to use the Claw\u0027s bug fix mod that is stickied in the add-on releases forum."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:25:43Z","Content":"Yeah Mk3 parts don\u0027t connect very strongly. Use struts between them to help. Also those big landing wheels are cool but I don\u0027t think they have any suspension whatsoever and landings can be hard which seems a bit daft considering they are supposed to be used fro larger heaver craft. You can always connect the big wheels to I-beam pieces as they flex under load and give a suspension like effect."},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:25:53Z","Content":"There is a fix for that in the stock bug fixes plugin.
