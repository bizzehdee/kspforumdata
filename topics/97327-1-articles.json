Everyone is working on something of their own, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll leave that to each one to write about. On my end, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing my part on the aerodynamics overhaul, but also picking up long-standing issues and unfinished features that were left from previous updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis week, I finished up the new lift model for the lifting and control surfaces which I started last week. I also revised the fuel flow logic for air-breathing engines. To support things like wet wings and such in the future, turbine engines now drain resources evenly from all tanks in a stage (the stage grouping allows setting up drop-tanks and such). This should also help with maintaining a balanced craft as fuel is drained out, and reduce the need to use fuel lines excessively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I was able to get a feature I had to leave out a long time ago up to a nearly complete state now. I call it \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153TimeWarp-To\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Basically, it lets you select a point ahead of you in your trajectory, and have the game auto-warp up to that point as fast as is reasonable (given the time gap).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature was delayed because of the time needed to work out how to deal with the warp limits near planetary surfaces, to stop warping just before any maneuvers you may have set, and also because I wanted to add a time warp limit when approaching an SOI transition. The autowarp system will respect those limits, and step up warp again as soon as conditions allow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gone over the joystick mapping system, and fixed issues with mapping becoming invalid in new game sessions, as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found that Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s device list will change across sessions, whenever you plug anything new to a USB port, so we couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t rely on device indices to map joystick bindings. Now, not only is this fixed, KSP now supports up to 11 joysticks, each with up to 20 axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m back to working on the aerodynamics again, this time on a new UI overlay for the editor, which should help visualizing the air-worthiness of a spaceplane before taking to the tarmac. More on that as it develops into something worth showing. At the moment there is very little to actually see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlex\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (aLeXmOrA):\u003C/strong\u003E January 17th, it marked the 4th year of me working at Squad.

It\u0027s been a really cool and amazing experience, I must say. Hope I can stick around for more years and learn even more things. Right now, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on some tasks I left unfinished for KerbalEDU, tasks that were not necessary for the release last year, but that will help to improve license managing for the users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarco\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (Samssonart):\u003C/strong\u003E Sorry, I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really say much this time, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on a highly experimental project we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not even sure is going to be a thing yet, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to see how it progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (danRosas):\u003C/strong\u003E Getting three things ready before the end of the month.

The other one is that I successfully updated the rig for animations, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still having some minor issues with some multiplyDivide nodes, that are giving trouble to the twist of the Kerbal spine. The rig we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been using until now had only a couple of IK handles at the top and the bottom.

There were a fair bunch. I\u0027ll have replied to them all within the week.

I should clarify that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve upgraded to Unity 4.6.1, not Unity 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnthony\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (Rowsdower):\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve been taking care of some things on the KSP-TV front.
