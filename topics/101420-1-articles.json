I honestly have no idea how to write .cfg files, and I would like something simple and compatible. It could, perhaps, simply allow you to make your own nodes simply by moving parts, or just move nodes around. Does anyone know of a mod like this, or have the time and skills to make one?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T09:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere used to be a third party external graphical UI app in development for Alternative Tree Configurator, but I believe it died along with ATC when it stopped updating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately making such a program is orders of magnitude more difficult and time consuming as just making a tree in config file format. It\u0027s not at all as hard as you think it is. You simply find an existing tree definition for TechManager (the current mod of choice for custom tech trees), copy the header and one of the node definitions into a new file, and work from there. Each node definition is a single block of text that can be copypasta\u0027d in the blink of an eye. The remaining work - giving the node a new name, setting cost, deciding on dependencies, hardcoding part assignment and such - are no slower and no faster done than they would be in a graphical editor. And that is the majority of the work you\u0027re going to be doing in making a tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA graphical editor would have just two advantages: one is sussing out the node positions. Admittedly the coordinate system used is extremely arbitrary. But thankfully you can at least test relatively painlessly with KSP itself, since tech trees are loaded along with the save file, not with the game client. That means you don\u0027t have to restart KSP for every change in the config that you make. You just have to quit to main menu, make the change, then load the savegame again and look into the R\u0026amp;D building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is deciding on an icon for your node - largely because there\u0027s no proper documentation of the names of icons that are actually there for you to choose from. I frankly have no clue where people get them from. Ultimately I always end up grabbing someone else\u0027s tree config and looking up the icon names in that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98942-WIN-TED-KSP-Tech-Tree-Editor-v0-2-4-ALPHA-EARLY-TESTING\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis\u003C/a\u003E might be what you\u0027re looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned though, it\u0027s not pretty and there\u0027s quite a few bugs.
