I honestly have no idea how to write .cfg files, and I would like something simple and compatible. It could, perhaps, simply allow you to make your own nodes simply by moving parts, or just move nodes around. Does anyone know of a mod like this, or have the time and skills to make one?"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T09:34:01Z","Content":"There used to be a third party external graphical UI app in development for Alternative Tree Configurator, but I believe it died along with ATC when it stopped updating.\n\nUltimately making such a program is orders of magnitude more difficult and time consuming as just making a tree in config file format. It\u0027s not at all as hard as you think it is. You simply find an existing tree definition for TechManager (the current mod of choice for custom tech trees), copy the header and one of the node definitions into a new file, and work from there. Each node definition is a single block of text that can be copypasta\u0027d in the blink of an eye. The remaining work - giving the node a new name, setting cost, deciding on dependencies, hardcoding part assignment and such - are no slower and no faster done than they would be in a graphical editor. And that is the majority of the work you\u0027re going to be doing in making a tech tree.\n\nA graphical editor would have just two advantages: one is sussing out the node positions. Admittedly the coordinate system used is extremely arbitrary. But thankfully you can at least test relatively painlessly with KSP itself, since tech trees are loaded along with the save file, not with the game client. That means you don\u0027t have to restart KSP for every change in the config that you make. You just have to quit to main menu, make the change, then load the savegame again and look into the R\u0026D building.\n\nThe other is deciding on an icon for your node - largely because there\u0027s no proper documentation of the names of icons that are actually there for you to choose from. I frankly have no clue where people get them from. Ultimately I always end up grabbing someone else\u0027s tree config and looking up the icon names in that."},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:53:53Z","Content":"[This](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98942-WIN-TED-KSP-Tech-Tree-Editor-v0-2-4-ALPHA-EARLY-TESTING) might be what you\u0027re looking for?\n\nBe warned though, it\u0027s not pretty and there\u0027s quite a few bugs. But as Streetwind said, just opening ready made .cfg files like [this one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0) and doing it with notepad is not so difficult once you know the non display name (the name the game uses to find stuff, not the name you see) of the part and tech you want to edit."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:07:12Z","Content":"People have wanted this (and tried to code it) since the day the tech tree came out.\n\nI think what we need is a mod that makes making tech tree mods easier."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:23:19Z","Content":"According to the latest dev tuesday, they\u0027re actually making it possible to mess around with the tech tree more easily like the OP said."},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:24:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E According to the latest dev tuesday, they\u0027re actually making it possible to mess around with the tech tree more easily like the OP said.\n\nHopefully so, it does seem to be in the works.

The answer right now is, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know. I\u0027m building the toolset for our own use here at the moment, as that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s required of it. Writing release-quality code, even for debugging tools, inevitably takes a lot more time. However, if by the end of the rebalancing and testing phase we think these utilities are presentable, then we might leave them in, along with the rest of the debug toolset. But we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see about that when we get there. No promises yet.\n\nSo I guess the OP should read \u0027make that tech tree editor good enough to be left in the game\u0027."}]}
