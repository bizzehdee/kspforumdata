The other thing that could be going on (you\u0027re gonna have to tell me) is that the whole stack is wobbly. In that case you could decelerate or, as you said, use some struts to try to stabilize the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T23:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes sometimes, even when the whole stack is not wobbly, it seems that the engine base is not aligned with the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t see any mean to add a strut on the engine base and then fix the other end on the tank\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T23:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve added struts between the engine and tank, it won\u0027t break off barring a fairly solid collision. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre your engines actually breaking off, or are you just worried that they\u0027re going to?

If you zoom in and put it in down-top view you can \u0022enter\u0022 the engine, so it disappears and you have a clear view on the bottom of the fuel tank. Then you place the struts on it (i usually use three) and rotate the camera to top-down view so you see the top of the engine (or other fuel tank when strutting two tanks) and just place struts on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T22:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice idea.
