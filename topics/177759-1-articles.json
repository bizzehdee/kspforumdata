Using a completely Tier 1 space center (so that\u0027s no patched conics, no maneuver nodes, no EVAs, 18-ton 30-part limit, no communications beyond Kerbin, and no tech nodes worth more than 90 science), I used way too much orbital assembly and flying via the Mk. 1 Eyeball to send Valentina all the way to the Duna/Ike system, landing on both bodies, gathering every experiment I had access to in every situation I could find, and bringing it all back for recovery on Kerbin. I was limited to just under 2.5 tons payload mass per launch, and I had to overbuild everything because of the lack of accurate navigation. It took 18 (successful) launches in all to assemble the ship, and a lot of testing to figure out how to fly an interplanetary mission without patched conics, but in the end I pulled it off. The landers were particularly fun, since each one had to carry 3 Science Jr.s, which meant I had to assemble each one over the course of 2 launches to make everything fit in the fairings I had, as well as in the part limit.
