If I turn on the TV and surround sound, it adds 260 watts, but I use my computer far more than my TV lately. I figure, even if I watch 8 hours of TV a day, every day, it only adds another $8 per month. My Air conditioner draws 1040 watts per hour, but I rarely run it for more than 2-6 hours at a time, depending on temperatures... but lets just say... I ran it constantly (I don\u0027t) it could not POSSIBLY add more than $100 per month to my bill.

It\u0027s new management (apartment was bought this past summer). I found out through other residents that new resident\u0027s rent is about 50% higher than the pre-existing renters. More than likely, she doesn\u0027t want a bunch of electronics in my place, in case the inevitable rent increases that are surely in store for my future end up with her trying to evict me, if I can\u0027t cover the costs...

If I use the computer actively for 10 hours a day on average (with the monitors on), and the rest of the day let it run 24/7 with he monitors off... I watch less TV these days, but even so, lets say I use the TV 8 hours a day, just for the sakes of an example... And the AC, I rarely run for more than 4-8 hours a day...

Even using my hot air gun, i measured it at 600 watts, and I maybe use it for several minutes at a time, once or twice a month... I don\u0027t use it frequently. I have a microwave, a refrigerator, a standard electric range (oven and 4 burners), and and a toaster oven. The lights are bright, about 40-50 watts of fluorescent lighting.
