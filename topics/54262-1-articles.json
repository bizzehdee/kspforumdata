Here goes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to determine if it would be possible for a satellite to orbit the earth such that it remained squared to the sun at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easier to explain if you imagine a dozen satellites placed equidistant around the earth, all roughly in the same plane, and that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplane perpendicular to a line drawn between the earth and sun. The satellites would always be in sunlight, and never between the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eearth and sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems you would have to adjust the orbit of each satellite every day, otherwise in 3 months or so the satellites would all be parallel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto the line drawn between earth and sun. And if you did that, what type orbit would that be? Does it already have a name, or is it too impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, hope it\u0027s not too far off topic. I\u0027m hoping someone smarter than I has a simple answer.
