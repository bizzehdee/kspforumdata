Add Kerbal Atomics, and Cryogenic engines too. Basically anything Nertea makes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtmosphereAutopilot - A much better option vs \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E for flying planes. Makes it far more pleasant.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nB9 Aerospace Procedural Wings - Goes well with the above as it allows you to make wings any size and shape you want (pretty much) and add tanks in too\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHanger - One of my favorite mods that I don\u0027t see\u00A0 a lot of people talk about. Lets you load a ship into a resizable \u0022hanger\u0022 and you can then launch the ship from the hanger at a later date. For instance, lets say you want to make a 4 commsat setup. You could launch a ship with 4 ships attached together using docking ports, or you could load them all into a hanger and just launch that (it does take weight/size into account so it is balanced).\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStrategia and Contract Configurator - Both make stock contract system far better\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEditor Extensions and WASD Camera - Make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E farm more accessible\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Construction Time - Can\u0027t play without this mod. Makes time a resource to manage just like real life. Basically ships take time to build, research takes time to complete etc..\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbalism - This is a new recommend from me as I\u0027ve only started using it this playthrough. It\u0027s a life support mod, with realistic part failures (and fixing), but it also completely overhauls the entire science system and is just a really well put together mod. You have a lot of difficulty options to change to so if you don\u0027t want part failures it\u0027s easy to disable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOPT Spaceplane Continued (and reconfig and legacy) - Excellent and huge list of parts for a lot of different types of spaceplanes. Adds engines, hulls, wings and more. Reconfig makes it up to date and compatible with lots of mods.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProcedural Parts - Quite a simple mod but very handy and powerful, alternatively you could use tweakscale, or both.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSCANsat - Gives you a reason to make satellites and is a very nice mod overall\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTime Control, Waypoint manager, Universal Storage, Restock (and plus), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid, Mk2/3 Stockalike Expansion, Kerbal Foundries (awesome wheels), KARE (cool nuclear airplane engines), Better SRBs, BonVoyage\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
