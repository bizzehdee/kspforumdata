I\\\u0027ve been using the c7 and other aerospace parts for considerably less time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have built spaceplanes, airplanes and the like and have had moderate success. There seem to be problems that plague my atmospherically bound craft, and they never seem to be the same. Planes and the like seem to be infinitely more complex to build than rockets (stack as much boosters and fuel on the beastie as you can and shoot for the moon you caveman). Perhaps it\\\u0027s the nature of the program itself, but I\\\u0027m wondering if it\\\u0027s my own personal inequities that cause the issues-namely my lack of an Aerospace Engineering Degree (I myself only possess a meager Computer Science/Applied Mathematics double major).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about statics, and lifting bodies, and how wings work (kind of), and I even know how to fly a plane (in simulations, I\\\u0027ve played too much x-plane for my own good) but I\\\u0027m wondering if there\\\u0027s some math I can do here to even the playing field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\\\u0027s my questions in no particular order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Should I be balancing my lift constant of the craft with the thrust the engines can produce? I seem to either have planes that pitch down or up, and I\\\u0027m wondering if my upward force vector should be equal to my lateral force vector (overcoming forces, free body diagrams...etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) My planes seem super tetchy. How many is too many control surfaces? Should I be using a certain number for however heavy the craft is/the lift quotient?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) The air breathing engines in this game seem to have very little science-that I can see-associated with them. Are those nacelle things purely aestetic? They all seem to have intakes, and they seem to max out at some number (correlated with altitude and the thickness of the air there no doubt), I seem to want to get them to their optimal flow, but no matter what I do the efficiency goes down. What is the efficiency? The amount of fuel that is wasted due to insufficient \u0027oxygen\u0027? The efficiency of the intakes in getting oxygen into the engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Is there a point where my excessive lift surfaces generate more drag than lift?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Is it possible to make a plane that is, forgive the pun, \u0027pitch perfect\u0027? Meaning that at some thrust, it will sit on the 0 pitch marker and not translate vertically? It seems like most planes in the (real life) universe do that-or have I been lied to by flight sims, and the meatball is showing an adjusted value? I feel like I have to hold a pitch of 3.5 or some such to stop the plane from dropping into the sea below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate any help you can give me-and don\\\u0027t be afraid to lay it on me mathmatically. I\\\u0027m a big boy and can take some scary numbers (or lack therof as engineering school taught me)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-20T03:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though I have an Aerospace degree, I\\\u0027ve never actually done any math for KSP, I\\\u0027ve always just eyeballed my planes. As to your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) There is no reason that your horizontal force should be equal to your vertical force if constant stable flight is your goal. If you could elaborate it would be much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you think your aircraft is too touchy, then it probably is. If you\\\u0027re placing the number of control surfaces based on what is necessary to get the plane to pitch up and take off, odds are there are too many. Try moving the main landing gear more rearwards and angle up some of the forward lifting surfaces, whether they are control surfaces or simple wings (use shift-WSADQE to do this, if you don\\\u0027t know how \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Nacelles and intakes are aesthetic, so far. All the code is based in the engine nozzles. Efficiency seems to be based not only on airflow, but on velocity, since it diminishes as velocity increases. I think that efficiency is current thrust divided by maximum thrust, though I haven\\\u0027t looked at the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Yes, if you fly at a very low angle of attack, that will happen, since no wing part generates lift at zero angle of attack, but I believe they do create drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) You can kind of do that, but it requires angling every wing part. It\\\u0027s honestly better to design your plane to fly at ~3.5 degrees and angle the engines on the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps. I haven\\\u0027t looked into the math of the aero stuff in the game, since the aerodynamics are wrong (drag force based on mass, lift proportional to velocity instead of velocity squared.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-20T04:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fortunateson1969\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fortunateson1969\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.)

A control surface\\\u0027s force depends on air speed, and its torque depends on leverage (if it\\\u0027s far out at the tip of a wing or tail, it can start and stop a turn much more quickly). So, if you want a compact yet heavy plane, you might need more. For a long, wide plane, only a few control surfaces at the ends will do, for a powerful but slow rate of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3.)

However, you need to know that presently, wings in KSP do not actually lift like an airfoil - they\\\u0027re just like flat boards that resist sideways airflow. To make a plane that flies level yet maintains altitude, you need tilted wings. You can rotate parts in 5 degree increments when building by holding shift and using WASDQE. Getting the balance right is a matter of either trial and refinement, or great experience, or unknown calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-20T10:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I\\\u0027m not an aircraft expert exactly, but with your 5th question I think the guy above is right. For an aircraft to fly at zero angle pitch it almost certainly has an angle of incidence on the wings even at zero degrees pitch (unless heavily cambered) However, I\\\u0027m reasonably sure no aircraft flies at 0 degrees pitch straight and level. Not even Jet airliners, though the angle they fly at is very slight to stop the carts escaping. Ever noted how it feels like a slight hill in an airliner? it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for pitching all real aircraft require trimming for stable flight. Some have \u0027Fixed Trim\u0027 which I\\\u0027ve seen on the rudder of a small stuntplane before to deal with the prop wash. Regardless though dont worry about the pitch movement, just trim for throttle level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar as control goes use big ones on the rudder and tail and if you must little ones for airelons. That usually works for me. It may help to reinforce your structure more, as wings flexing can really screw up the aircrafts behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
