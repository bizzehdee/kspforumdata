Ice at 94MHz is on the order of 1m (very rough estimate, depends a lot on composition). In other words, you\u0027d be losing a factor of e for every meter. Transmitter on Rosetta is 2W. So at 20m, you\u0027ll be expecting ~4nW of power, which seems like too weak of a signal to detect. But if I\u0027m underestimating resistivity (~50 ohm-meters) or simply making mistakes on composition (likely), this could be way off. Cometary nuclei tend to be on the order of .4g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, which would point to large gaps or pores in ice. That could easily more than double the skin depth alone.
