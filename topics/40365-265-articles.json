So far so good. I then built an aluminium hybrid powered rocket and landed it at the base. Hooked it to the main craft with a KAS pipe link.

I know they should make more oxidizer than aluminium, but im getting 0 aluminium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no AH rockets on the base itself so the main structure doesnt technically have anywhere to store aluminium, just alumina in the refineries and oxidizer all over the place.

Gave the refineries a little aluminium storage and they began producing it correctly, but I still have to manually shunt it from the refinery into the rockets. While this may be as intended, I would like the aluminium produced at the refinery to behave like stock liquid fuel when it comes to locating and auto-assigning storage space for it, can anyone tell me which variables I need to alter to get this behaviour?
