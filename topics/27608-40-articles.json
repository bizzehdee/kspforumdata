Just right clicking shouldn\u0027t need recalculation but causes plenty of lag even if you only want to change control surface assignment. Adjusting the sliders or the shape of the wing makes sense but its harder to do small adjustments. Since you have to hold down left-click, T, G or R for these things, is it possible to do those calculations when the key is released instead of doing it continuously? I know this is a bit delayed, but I\u0027ve been playing career mode so I hadn\u0027t unlocked them and \u0027enjoyed\u0027 this yet.
