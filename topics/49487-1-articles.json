How do I increase this amount, also There is a little percentage thingy on the transmission button for data and it says like 20% or 50% how do I change that number?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour friendly Ye Oldy Kerbal, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESir Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore electricity! I think the larger antenna transfer faster, but there\u0027s not much advantage to this, the energy consumption per data sent is apparently constant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"possum","CreatedById":84085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to transmit data from multiple experiments at one time add another antenna, only one report is transmitted at a time so more antennas the faster the transitions can be done, this will drain your electricity fast. The number on the transmit button is the percentage of science point you will get, transmitting has a reduction in point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
