When you get a large complex commsat network up and have lots of probes the map become unreadable especially with remotetech installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have to do now is go to each ship I want to hide change its category to something not being used and then hide all the ships of that type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is bad because each time you switch to ship it consumes a small amount of memory that appears to never get back to the memory pool and I run myself out of memory if I have to show and hide ships a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would see something like the com center display and when you click on each ship you can show/hide it on the map. Heck why not change the ship name as well from there rather then once again switching to each ship to change it\u0027s name. I mean wouldn\u0027t a ship ID change be sent to the probe from mission control anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-09T22:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2014 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ctbram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T22:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore ship types would probably be an easier and more effective option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith more types you could for example differentiate between satellites and probes.

More categories would get messy and sometimes I want to hide a subset of ships within a category say commsat probes. You could add a category commsats. But now what if I want to hide all the commsats but the ones orbiting kerbin? Now I am back to switching to every commsat not orbiting kerbin and giving them a new arbitrary unused category and then hiding all ships of that category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very easy to have another gui windows accessible that looks like the tracking station windowi. Next to each vessel you have a show/hide radio button. You could also add a change ship naame and change ship type button there as well so you could rename a ship or change a ships category without having to physically switch to the ship.
