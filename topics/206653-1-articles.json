This at minimum helps understand it\u0027s shape and form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m watching this. What if we referse the orbital logic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-DjEIlynjE?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if we assumed for instance that hydrogen was only 1 orbital in position 1. It can be positive or negative. Or that helium instead of 2 electrons has 0 electrons. Is there a nucleus with 0 electrons now. Or in that theory that would fit the opposite?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other reversal I saw so far would be that if the outer shells have the most electrons what if they are pushing out the inner sphere first. What if helium is actually a full set of electrons that easily pushes out the inner ring. It seems to have 1 electron because the outer layers push it out easily. And it\u0027s good as\u00A0 fuel source because it\u0027s dense and not because it\u0027s light?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is it possible the inner layer is the most occupied and the atomic model is actually representing the missing electrons. Is there a supposed limit to layers that might say how many electrons are in the middle in such a situation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy levels could easily be the result of missing or easily remove electrons as opposed to the capacity to hold them logically. The value could be a different quality. the outer shells could be the potential to hold and then the missing potential of the ring in practice. As opposed to it\u0027s actual held amount which seems to be the current model. IE helium could be missing 1 electron. Helium could be missing 2. Large atoms could actually be small atoms and be missing the stated electrons instead of holding them and you could be measuring the resulting force from the nucleus escaping and interacting with it\u0027s surroundings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are more ways to invert/reverse the theory. Do any explain any behavior better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Here is another model:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProtons are neutral and neutrons are positive magnetic. electrons are actually positive and negative. This is then why they attract in pairs. Not sure what makes them stick. Maybe another reversal of the logic? Is there more simplistic/common sense model based on any reversal combinations to why things act as they do? Do neutrons potentially push out negative electrons? what if protons are like an empty vacuum space or something that attracts the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible some models would/could describe different behaviors/qualities better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-28T20:56:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2022 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-28T22:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is so much here that I\u0027m forced to be succinct.

The underlying logic behind those energy levels, sub-levels etc. is not discussed at all, and without some understanding of that underlying logic, applying \u0027reverse logic\u0027 is pretty much pointless and will result in conclusions which,\u00A0 to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli (him of the Exclusion Principle), aren\u0027t even wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the video is presenting a \u0027Bohr \u002B\u0027 model, which is still picturing electrons as discrete particles, orbiting the nucleus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing it completely misses - and understandably so given the audience it\u0027s likely pitched at - is that electrons also behave as waves and that a proper description of electrons in an atom requires quantum mechanics. The underlying mathematics are complicated (well they are to me) but one can write down an equation (the Schrodinger equation) which describes a given quantum mechanical system. and for the hydrogen atom, that equation can be solved exactly. For everything apart from hydrogen, the Schrodinger equation can\u0027t be solved exactly but you can calculate approximate solutions to arbitrary precision. Very simplistically you start with an approximate solution, then calculate successive corrections to that solution, each correction being smaller than the last. The corrections therefore converge towards a limit. For comparison, consider the following series:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 \u002B 1/2 \u002B 1/4 \u002B 1/8 \u002B 1/16...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhich converges to 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder a quantum mechanical formulation, an orbital is a wave function describing an electron in an atom, which can be used to calculate the probability of finding it at a given distance and position from the nucleus.\u00A0 Orbitals are normally depicted as closed surfaces which define the space in which there\u0027s a given probability (say 90%) of finding the electron.

At this point, the video is qualitatively correct - you get sets of orbitals defined by their principle quantum number n, and then two further quantum numbers l and m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbitals for which l=0 are termed s orbitals and they\u0027re spherically symmetric. Orbitals for which l=1 are termed p orbitals, orbitals for which l=2 are termed d orbitals and orbitals for which l=3 are termed f orbitals. I imagine that you could continue this out to g, h or i orbitals but in practice, f orbitals are enough for the entire Periodic Table.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nm determines the number of a given type of orbital. For example p orbitals come in groups of three, d orbitals in groups of five.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectrons can have also have one of two spin values \u002B1/2 and -1/2.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers, which means that a given orbital (defined by given values of n, l and m) can only contain two electrons, one having spin \u002B1/2 and the other having spin -1/2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-30T14:11:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2022 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
