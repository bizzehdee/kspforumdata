I mostly replied to this thread at all just in case someone who is against more realism in Kerbal reads this and goes ahead and tries DRE. It is not too hard, try it out. With the stock Mk1 capsule, no parts added (it includes an ablative heat-shield), you can transfer from the Mun, put your periapsis at 30k on Kerbin, and be fine. It just makes you have to take the shock-heating already visually modeled into the game into consideration for aerobraking and stuff like that. If you\u0027re a fan of real space-flight, you owe it to yourself to try out DRE at very least, and FAR when you\u0027re ready for it.
