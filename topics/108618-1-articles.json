As such, Orbit,Kerbin (2) \u002B Land,Minmus (5.75) \u002B Orbit,Sun (6) \u002B Orbit,Mun (3) = 16.75 XP. Level 3 requires 16 XP. Planting a flag on Minmus would be 6.25 XP instead of 5.75, for a total of 17.25 XP instead. Still, every bit helps if you want to reach for that Level 4 (32 XP), I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"Zyffyr","CreatedById":138032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:53:39Z","Content":"Yeah. If you are going to land, you might as well plant a flag. You can take it right back down afterwards if you want."}]}
