Y\u0027all steampunkers like your zepplins, you say. I say fine, show it to me in a way that it doesn\u0027t come off as an utterly silly concept. When you say \u0022based upon 19th Century technology\u0022, I just can\u0027t wrap my head around how any of the technology I\u0027ve been shown is supposed to function based on an early/mid industrial level; without that, the whole concept fails to coalesce into something I can enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it\u0027s based on personal preference.

Steampunk is just one of the genres that hasn\u0027t grabbed me. It\u0027s not the only genre I am not a fan of. Cyberpunk, vampires, transhumanism, and superheros also get a \u0022meh\u0022 response from me. (Maybe there\u0027s a connection between those types that I just haven\u0027t recognized.
