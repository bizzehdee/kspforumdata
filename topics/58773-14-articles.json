In general I agree with Squad/FAR/whoever made those tweaks that as-is they belong in the editor. But, restricting them in flight could make sense and in the example you describe I\u0027m guessing modern control systems would do something similar to help keep things controllable. What if I made an in-flight control range \u0022throttle\u0022 that let you lower the value, but not raise it? So, the value you set in the editor would essentially be the \u0022max\u0022 value.

I confirm the same issue since the last patch on a fresh install with no other mods installed. I looked through the cfg file, but I do not see any place where that option might exist where it can be toggled. Any ideas?

TweakableDockingNode depends on TweakableStaging. Do you have exactly one version of ModuleManager installed? Is there anything else relevant you can tell me?
