So you will have full definitions for those experiments. Right now they are only on the N100 and N120 antennas but I would like to add standalone experiments for them that are different aesthetically to the kind that are in those mods. Magnetometers in particular are made in all different styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture refresh on the antennas is going well. I may switch the textures over to a 1k texture as the current 2k one is very overkill. So that would be something like 10 parts on one texture which I can live with. Similarly, the science experiments texture is currently 1k and used for the ion trap, micrometeoroid detector and the sienno probe parts... for, uh, reasons. I am probably going to move that to a 512 or even 256 texture sheet, depending on whether I add more science parts. The sienno probe core is probably going to be remodeled, as I don\u0027t particularly care for how it turned out. The booster is fine, just needs the texture to get cleaned up. Those will move to their own small texture sheet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of science parts, writing flavor texts is not exactly my thing.
