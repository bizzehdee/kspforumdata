A lot of the time, they use precise and/or simple enough mechanics that all they need to capture is player input. In other cases - a majority of other cases - the recorded data is either simplified to reduce game-time load, or is not all that abundant to begin with. A prime example is FlatOut 2 - thousands of physics objects on the map, deforming cars, but you can see in the replays that only the motion of the cars and the initial states of the objects are captured, with everything recreated dynamically from that. It\u0027s good enough most of the time, but you do see lapses when cars hit things that were, but aren\u0027t there - or don\u0027t hit things that weren\u0027t, but are.
