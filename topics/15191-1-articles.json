The lift and drag coefficients are defined by the shape of the aerofoil they shouldn\\\u0027t need rescaled. That is leaves area. The first step is to assume Unity calculates this based on the rescaling and nothing needs changed, try it out and see how it works. If not Unity maybe using a short cut somewhere and adjusting the coefficients linearly by the change in area might be your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the angular drag. The angular drag of an aircraft is primarily a function of the positioning and orientation of the wings, tail plane and tail fin rather than a function for the aerofoils themselves. So I don\\\u0027t believe the angular drag should need to be changed in theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough with ut seeing the Unity code to understand what assumptions it makes these are only guesses based on my half remembered flight dynamics courses I took nearly a decade ago!
