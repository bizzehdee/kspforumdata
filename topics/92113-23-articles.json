It does work for for me 1.0.2 win 7 x64 so I do have more memory to play with. But I did have it running on a 32 bit install with OpenGL initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all I did was convert the textures in clouds/particles to dds. Also I believe I converted the aurora textures to dds and that\u0027s it. I left everything else alone. The other thing is this only works with EVE not EVE Overhaul. The extras folder isn\u0027t all usable. Lightning doesn\u0027t work but the aurora dust and snow all work (non of which I converted) I have not seen astronomer in a while so I am willing to share my working, modified zip file with updated lens flares and main menus logo. But I don\u0027t want to step on anyone\u0027s toes or cause any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riverey","CreatedById":104594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EV8jester \u003C/strong\u003E I have x64 windows too and it works fine with only core mod installed.

To allot more space for my virtual memory. Usually your page file is set to around 8gb and I hover around 7gb just for KSP. So honestly I am starting to think the virtual memory is just as much an issue for everyone as the physical memory. Google page file size increase. It \u0027a pretty easy. I set mine to 32 GB and I run 32GB of pc 1866 ram. Do you have a memory usage monitor installed, so you can see just how much you are using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mod list is up on my thread linked below, so it can handle a ton of mods in this configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riverey","CreatedById":104594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m testing it on the completely new install, so it can\u0027t be any memory issue.
