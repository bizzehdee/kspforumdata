What options exist for a rescue mission for a craft landed with just too little delta-V to get home? I could land a better-planned rescue capsule to recover the crew, but ideally want to top it off and return it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just unlocked basic rover tech, so I suppose I could try to drop a wheeled fuel tank near my stranded lander... but wait, the lander is an old model, and I never put a docking port on it. Besides, I\u0027ve heard talk that if you don\u0027t line up the height just so, explosions happen. KAS looks like the reasonable way to do it, but I\u0027m looking for something vanilla. (Maybe this is one of the \u0022can\u0027t do without\u0022 mods, though, and I\u0027ll end up installing it anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have the huge claw available, but that sounds way overpowered -- and massive!
