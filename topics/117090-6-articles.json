While this feature is not necessarily needed for the SC-B-SM, it is needed for the module in general (as the module is used in other places as well)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T22:34:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes I am.

The solar panels work fine for me (note the EC charge numbers in the resource panel; negative values indicate that it is receiving charge) regardless of if there is crew present on the ship.

So the IVA\u0027s are coming along well?\n\nI would suggest that you try SSTU on a clean install (only SSTU and stock) and see if you can duplicate the problem. If the problem does not manifest on a clean install, begin adding mods back in one at a time (or in small groups), checking for the function after every mod/batch of mods. When the problem manifests again, you know that one of the mods you just added was the culprit. Sadly, I do not have time to investigate random mod conflicts with such a large mod list; however if you can narrow it down to a single mod or very small list of mods that are causing problems that would give me a good starting place to begin looking into things.\n\nSo far no progress has been made on the IVAs. I\u0027ve spent this week finishing up textures (and prep geometry work on an as-yet-unannounced part) - Fuel tanks are done, ascent and descent engines done, monoprop and rtg fuel modules done. Still have a few more to do (decouplers, pod externals, landing legs, deployable solar panel module). Will likely issue an updated release over the weekend with the updated textures and any bug-fixing/issue cleanup that I can squeeze in tonight/tomorrow morning. \n\nNext week will be more texture cleanup for the remaining unfinished pieces. I might get a start on the IVA internal geometry, but no guarantees. As V. stated, being an purely aesthetic bit, they do not rate the highest on my priority list (and they are a major PITA to model and texture...)."},{"CreatedByName":"Spork of Doom","CreatedById":104262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T00:25:35Z","Content":"Great mod, keep up the good work.
