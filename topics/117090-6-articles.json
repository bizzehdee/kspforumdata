If the problem does not manifest on a clean install, begin adding mods back in one at a time (or in small groups), checking for the function after every mod/batch of mods. When the problem manifests again, you know that one of the mods you just added was the culprit. Sadly, I do not have time to investigate random mod conflicts with such a large mod list; however if you can narrow it down to a single mod or very small list of mods that are causing problems that would give me a good starting place to begin looking into things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far no progress has been made on the IVAs.

Still have a few more to do (decouplers, pod externals, landing legs, deployable solar panel module).

Just 2 things I noticed in the short time I\u0027ve played around with the parts, the VTOL engines for the landing module for the SSTU - Ship Core: Series C. The engines cannot be toggled using action keys. Also the landing legs for the Series C slide very easily on the ground, almost like its on ice or something.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please report issues to the GitHub page to relieve ShadowMage\u0027s poor stressed mind. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdated test release is available:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.9-beta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.9-beta\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease see the link for the full change log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly texture updates, but did fix up one known bug regarding the LC3-FL landing leg module (it was causing some... weird issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, please report issues to the GitHub page to relieve ShadowMage\u0027s poor stressed mind. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a perfect example of why;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had noticed the sliding landing gear problem before while I was testing out other things, but as I was testing out -other- things I forgot to take note of it (e.g. open up the ticket), and as such it was completely forgotten about =\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes, please - open up issue tickets, it is the only way to make sure that I will see it and look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"01010101lzy","CreatedById":118333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T09:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight click on the engine and click the \u0027add node\u0027 button.\u003Cp\u003EI could not have them on their full time last I checked because it aggrivated the stock node bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, my fault.
