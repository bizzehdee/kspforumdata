They lower the minimum safe speed a plane can fly at the cost of more drag, which is good for landing, not as good for takeoff. Unfortunately Squad decided to implement the most basic of flaps systems that can almost not even be called that. Most flaps have 4 settings that deploy them at varying degrees for take off, climb, level flight, and landing... we get 2, unless you use FAR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey probably aren\u0027t suitable for a delta wing plane like yours there where you are using elevons instead of ailerons and elevators. Never the less, to set them up add the control surfaces near the center of mass. Right click one of them and set the State to deployed. Then go to an action group and assign the toggle option to it. Invert as needed so they go down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s it. Turn them on to stay in the air at slower speeds (for landing on that ridiculously bumpy runway) or to pick up off the runway a little quicker. If done correctly they can help your plane lift even when the wheels are significantly behind the center of mass, avoiding the awful tail strike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as control being backward. Pick up the control surface and re-place it.
