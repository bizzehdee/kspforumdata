Hehehehe. Now for the serious answer: depends on how do you want to go up. If you trust your wings, carry enough liquid fuel, and go very shallow, you can get a RAPIER to go supersonic (and therefore, accelerate to ~1,400m/s if you take your time), with TWR as low as 0.55 for low wing loadings (i.e: good gliders). That means a single RAPIER can push almost a 20mT SSTO if you pack enough fuel for it. OTH, forget about going vertical, and it\u0027ll take you a while to get there. But if you go for a more reasonable 0.7-0.9 TWR, you can still put a lot of liquid fuel to keep it lit, climb reasonably fast, and break mach and reach the same cutoff speed, with higher fuel margins on account of a heavier craft. The trick is finding the space to put all that fuel. Here, an example of just how much a single RAPIER can push to orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sE3OMUl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sE3OMUl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did abuse the wings-as-fuel-tanks strategy: no fuel tank is without a lift rating, and no lifting surface is without tankage space, unless it\u0027s a control surface. In any case, I have more than twice the liquid fuel for the ideal rocket ratio, and at takeoff it\u0027s about 18mT.

The current design is also two engines short of the original with a third being marked for deconstruction, if the tests today will say so. Following the deleted engines, two pre-coolers were taken from the underside of the wing, as the new engine setup requires far less intake air. Sadly, due to the intake loss it now has less drag on the underside, resulting in the plane wanting to raise its nose, which is not wanted at all... but a little wing tweaking should do the job...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added a compact RCS tug for orbital construction and cargo delivery, featuring a standard and a senior clamp-o-tron docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Going with 2 less engines seems to have no critical impact on the flight profile so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CSBlWCD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CSBlWCD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Reaching 80 km circular orbit with a hell of a load of fuel left.
