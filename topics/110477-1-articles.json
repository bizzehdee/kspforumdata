I\u0027ve yet to see a single sign of any problem with them. No obvious unreasonable memory growth, no crashes whatsoever, despite long periods of flying mach 2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01533 at 20km with plenty of heating and a number of the bars showing for long periods.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean that the problem doesn\u0027t exist for some people, only that it doesn\u0027t seem to hit everyone.

They turn back on with every launch even if you turn them off, so those that don\u0027t want them even without the memory leak have to be annoyed.\n\nHowever, if you\u0027re graphic settings are too low they may not appear."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:09:02Z","Content":"On that note, it\u0027s not actually the temperature bars that leaks memory, it is the highlighting overlay that accompanies the temperature bars. If I turn off PPFX highlighting, the memory leak appears not to happen, even with the thermometers on. (This probably explains why some people haven\u0027t experienced the memory leak.)\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve recently discovered that the ALT\u002BF12 debug menu itself leaks memory. So exercise caution when labeling things as \u0022memory leakers\u0022 if using the debug menu\u0027s performance page memory consumption indicators.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
