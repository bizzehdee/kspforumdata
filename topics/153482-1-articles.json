All of the sudden ALL of my docking ports no longer respond to the \u0022un-dock\u0022 option. There have been no recent changes to my game, no new mods, no new updates, just normal game play.\u00A0I click, \u0022un-dock\u0022, the option disappears, yet the crafts are still docked. I have noticed in these forums\u00A0that this has been occurring for several versions now. FIX THIS PLEASE! This has essentially killed my save file as it effectively renders my whole space program useless if i can\u0027t dock and un-dock ships. YES I am aware that there is a save file work-around, but NO I am not going into notepad and editing code every time I want to un-dock a ship. This is a very serious glitch that needs to be fixed yesterday. I love this game, but this is killing it for me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP version 1.2.2.1622\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-13T22:19:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2016 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tregeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot to add some text.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T05:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this in 1.2.1 as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T09:14:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you\u0027re dedicated to playing Stock, you should make an exception and install this single mod:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87737-ksp-v113-stock-bug-fix-modules-release-v113b1-10-jul-16/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe undock bug is long-standing and long known.
