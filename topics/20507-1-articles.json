This includes landing (the hardest part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only managed to do this once, and that was on Duna with parachutes, so if you want a real challenge, do not use parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, just for those who don\u0027t know, you can look at the gauges in IVA and one of them will tell you your height, but it only works up to 3000 metres than it looses its trace, so beware. Also, it will go from 3000 to 1000 very fast I find, so make sure to keep an eye on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TheMonster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Since no one else has posted, I didn\u0027t see a point in double posting. This is the my first try on the Mun, it ended horribly but was tons of fun to actually fly. The view from inside the cockpit while crash landing is really cool by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/825/screenshot0tp.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img825/1707/screenshot0tp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0tp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E Yes, this is the pre-made ship from the scenario, I figured if I was most likely going to crash, I may as well not waste a bunch of time building a ship, than getting to the Mun just to do it. \u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-27T18:41:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2012 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by TheMonster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
