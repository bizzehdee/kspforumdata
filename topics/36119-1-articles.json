But to help, why do you need or wish to swap? A craft in the atmosphere is either flying (airplane) or falling/rocketing (rocket on launch/landing). Neither of those bodes well if you DO swap, as you will crash! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome mods may let you change some things like this.

I\u0027ve had MechJeb controlling one while I followed in another and people have launched and docked two aircraft by switching between them. Really though you have to launch both together and never let them drift apart. I think the Lazor system can increase the render range but I\u0027m not sure if that effects KSP\u0027s control system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T18:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to increase render range in general?
