This is lower detail, as I wanted to spend CPU cycles and memory on the ship you actually fly all mission, not on the launcher you discard in three minutes. But it\u0026#39;s there, and both stages terminate at 2.5m so they\u0026#39;re useable with other payloads... though you\u0026#39;ll probably have to have an adapter fairing of some sort for the upper stage, because the top of the centaur isn\u0026#39;t flat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Noto Sans]The launch vehicle adapter is 2.5m, so you can hypothetically launch it on top of any 2.5m parts from the game... but... there\u0026#39;s a lot of aerodynamic surface on this thing, and it\u0026#39;s way up front in the launch configuration. My Atlas V has increased gimbal range to let you counter act the instability instead of fins (just like the real thing) so if you launch this on stock parts, you may need quite a few fins at the base of the rocket. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]The IVA requires: (not necessary if you don\u0026#39;t want to IVA)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]Raster Prop Monitor - [URL]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-25-RasterPropMonitor-putting-the-A-in-your-IVA-(v0-18-3)-8-Oct[/URL] \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Noto Sans]The IVA has 4 unique stations - up front are the pilot and commander who have flight instrumentation, rear facing camera control and resource management options, as well as full control of mechjeb.

I highly recommend planning your missions and adjusting the fuel in these two stages appropriately. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0026#39;s an electric generator built into the capsule. And the output is HIGH. I\u0026#39;ve had to do this to make the batteries last all the way through re-entry. I suppose I could turn the power down on the flywheel system. I\u0026#39;ll play with that. But at the moment you\u0026#39;ll never run out of electricity. Which is a little hacky. I need to get this into balance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mod supports DRE and FAR. The Far support should be considered a WIP. Please give feedback. The ship isn\u0026#39;t designed to be EASY to fly, but if it\u0026#39;s uncontrollable it\u0026#39;s probably a bug. In general - space planes are hard to fly... Over the course of development I\u0026#39;ve bowed to pressure a few times to make this easier to handle during reentry and landing.... but it still isn\u0026#39;t stupidly forgiving... I recommend reentering such that a ballistic landing would put you right on the KSP pad, so your lifting surfaces will make for a long overshoot... then out over the water at around 10,000m of altitude you can come back around to point west for landing. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Atlas V 402 launcher is low detail, but it exists. I\u0026#39;ve put the .blend files in the abandoned model thread and you\u0026#39;re welcome to start with my cfg files.... so if anyone is looking for a mod project, a day texturing what\u0026#39;s already there... a couple of days building fairings and payload adapters, and a day modelling the single nozzle Centaur engine and you\u0026#39;d have a stand-alone Atlas V mod ready to release. :) All I ask is the option to include any improvements you make back into this mod if they fit with it! :) I may move on to this project eventually myself... but I\u0026#39;ve got a couple of projects ahead of it, so please feel free.

I could be wrong as gamers can be finicky, but that\u0027s my thought on the matter. You already took the first step by including gameplay-value added features (cargo bay, nose cone).
