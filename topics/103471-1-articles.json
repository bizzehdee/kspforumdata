On eg. the mun that isn\u0027t as much of a problem since the gravity is so much lower that freefalling for ~7km won\u0027t completely ruin your descent. On tylo however the gravity is so strong that it will acellerate you very quickly, meaning you will not only have to kill orbital velocity, but also kill your vertical speed from falling the ~7 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is horifically inefficient. You might want to try something a little more tricky but also safer. Get a grazing orbit that takes you down to less than 2 km above the surface. Use the LV-N\u0027s to kill most of you orbital velocity. Then land on the triple set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way you want to do this is aim fully retrograde, start burning and when you come to within less than 1km of the ground (use KER\u0027s radar altitude for this) you start pitching up to slow your vertical descent. When you reach about 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on the navball you start toggling the poodle on and off to keep from smashing yourself into the surface. Keep your vertical velocity to something like 10-20m/s depending on the terrain (if it starts coming up towards you quickly you should reduce your vertical speed). When you have gotten rid of almost all your orbital speed you should be realy really close to the ground, within say 300m all you need to do is the standard descent (or let mechjeb do this part if you dont feel comfortable [forewarning mechjeb can make bad decisions when landing from a sub orbital trajectory]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy landing with this profile you will maximize the burn time on your LV-N\u0027s which have a much better ISP and you will be making maximum use of the Oberth Effect.

If your TWR is only 1.18, then once your horizontal velocity gets significantly below orbital speed, you end up using 1.00/1.18 = 85% of your delta-V just to fight off gravity. That doesn\u0027t leave much for positive control of the spacecraft. It also means that once you\u0027re in terminal vertical descent, you can only slow down at 0.18 of a G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I don\u0027t know exactly how the MechJeb landing algorithm works, MechJeb is probably crashing because the spacecraft just won\u0027t slow down as much as MechJeb needs it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also why you\u0027re running out of fuel even though you theoretically have enough delta-V for a Tylo landing. Even if you use the approach articulated by others here (come in shallow and then slowly transition from horizontal to vertical burn as you lose speed), there is no getting around the fact that it will take you a long time to slow down and you\u0027re losing a ton of delta-V to gravity losses along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003EEdit: see \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39812-Landing-and-Takeoff-Delta-V-vs-TWR-and-specific-impulse?p=509986\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post509986\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E for a quantitative look at the delta-V penalty incurred by landing with low TWR.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour gravity losses are, roughly speaking, proportional to the time spent in powered flight at speeds significantly below orbital velocity. If you have a massively high TWR that can slow you from orbital speed to a dead stop in the final few seconds, you will lose almost nothing to gravity losses. For this reason it may be worth lugging a huge engine to Tylo despite the extra mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T04:35:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T11:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis link is very intersting.

Under high gravity, you need engines with a very high TWR, such as the 48-7S. The 48-7S is by far the best engine to use for Tylo, use a bunch of them unless you\u0027re landing something REALLY big, in which case, the KR-2L is better. But very few people are ever going to land something on Tylo so big that the KR-2L is the best engine to use.
