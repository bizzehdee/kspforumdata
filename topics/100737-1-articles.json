The point is, I always wanted to build my own racer in kerbal and having discovered kerbal foundries repulsors, decided to give it ago. But I\u0027m not just going to leave it there. I\u0027m challenging the forums to build their own racers, not actually for a race (*yet anyway. Once multiplayer is out we shall see \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) but instead to show off your building skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you win, you can have the kerbal equivalent of the grand prize (an unlimited amount of SRB\u0027s!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE RULES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, some rules are needed. As for mods, you must hover using the Kerbal Foundries mod and no OP engines/drive systems-use your common sense for what\u0027s OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA point system fits best for scoring, so here we go. You\u0027ll want a screenshot for each challenge achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re at maximum speed!-One point for each M/S top speed you can reach across the plains (WITHOUT boosting-I\u0027ll explain in a sec)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBooster drives enabled!-50 points for having some kind of booster/hyper drive system. If you haven\u0027t seen the show, the Hyper drive (and later booster drive) were an additional set of engines that could deploy to provide a massive boost to the top speed at the expense of fuel. For an example, you could use Rapier engines switching to Rocket mode to give a temporary boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStar racers aren\u0027t meant to fly!-40 points for managing to ascend to 500\u002Bmetres and come down without exploding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere goes nothing!-100 points for replicating either Maya\u0027s flying trick (from ep 11) or Molly\u0027s airbrake spin at the end of ep 13 (vid evidence please.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirbrakes-20 points for being able to bring the racer to a stop while still in mid-air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake that alien scum!-35 points for arming your racer and hitting a large target (such as a wall, rocket on the launch pad ect.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget race-50 points for hitting three small (size of a single steel plate) targets in a row with an extra five for each extra target you hit. Vid evidence is good but if you\u0027re quick on the screenshots that\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now for the bonuses based on your machine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth team standard-15 points for using the earth team layout (Single pod with short wings, two large engine pods. In other words, my ship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody can resist the strength of the Krog\u0027s!-20 points for using the Krog Trident layout (Single pod with three forward facing blades attached around it. Look it up, you\u0027ll find it) If it\u0027s red, have another 10 points and if you can get those lightning blades working that\u0027s an extra 100 for you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat guy rides a bug!-35 points for an insect or bird like setup (See G\u0027dar or Spirit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPyramid of light-40 points for building a flying pyramid of light style ship. It\u0027s a flying pyramid shape, I don\u0027t need to explain that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can something like that fly?-60 points for building a Cere\u0027s style ship (It\u0027s a little like a flying trombone and kinda hard to explain.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ram\u0027s horn is always half full!-40 points for building a ship like the Storm Crusher (Rush\u0027s mining ship. Bonus 5 points if it weights over 40 tons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinor character-10 points for a ship looking like any of the other vehicles from the cast (Ning and Skun\u0027s bikes, Flint\u0027s... train thing? And so on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnique-An extra 5 points for something unique looking. Go wild!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it would be rude not to show my first effort, along with a good example of a basic ship. So here you go, the KSR Prototype 1!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9abmA6x.png\u0022 alt=\u00229abmA6x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt fits under Booster drives enabled! and Earth team standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TztDdCJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TztDdCJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuzzing along, just thought i\u0027d show it off in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eJKa9TV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eJKa9TV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for We\u0027re at maximum speed! it earns 131 points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total, a mere 196 points. You can do far better most likely so get out there and get building! I\u0027m looking forward to the results and if I broke any challenge posting rules, let me know ASAP so I can adjust it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T13:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egoing to instal foundries for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randomness5555","CreatedById":53367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T13:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomebody interested!
