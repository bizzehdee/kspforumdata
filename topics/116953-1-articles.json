Say you have a bubble with 100 small dots on its surface. The bubble has a surface area of 1m^2, so the density of the dots is 100 dots per square meter. Now say we inflate the bubble so its twice as big. The bubble now has 4m^2 of surface area, but the number of dots stays the same. So the number of dots per square meter is now 25. Twice the radius means the dot density becomes 4 times as low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing happens in the universe. Gravity (or light) is equivalent to the dot density. The number of photons/gravitons is the same but they\u0027re smeared out over a larger area.

According to one of the most famous theories which are trying to \u0022tune up\u0022 the Newton-Gauss-Birkhoff theorems for explaining things like the rotation curves of the galaxies removing the dark matter from the equations, gravity force never weakens to zero. This theory is called MOND and it replaces the inverse-square law with a little term of acceleration. This theory says that every point in a hollow mass sphere distribution (the universe, in this case), is subject to an small force towards the center of mass. This way, any point in this universe would affect, still relative to distance, with at least the force this potential gravitational acceleration provides to it.

The difference with the photon is the nature of the force (the nature of the field) they transmit: electromagnetic for photons, gravity for gravitons.

Therefore if the wavelength falls below the wavelength the photoelectric effect could disappear entirely.

Note that the yellow green part of the Sun spectrum is the most intense, a larger more massive star would emit more blue light, none the less massive red-shifting would cause a dimming of intensity at the visible spectrum for a variety of reasons (less EM emitted at short wavelengths, gravity bends light)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T20:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry.

Gravity is a measure of warping of space time due to energy density. Since many energies smaller than that of an electron or proton have such energy the particle would have to be much smaller than these and it is far far weaker than any force, thus the particle would have to be very very small. IF you take fluid particles and make smaller and smaller spheres of them keeping the total mass the same, eventually you reach a state where the collection of particles behaves just like a wave, Gravity may be one of these, it may be so small that the only way we can detect it is in mass, where the collections of particles behave like a wave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment (thought). Create a new empty universe. Place Hydrogen molecule (Proper) in the universe, then add another hydrogen molecule to that universe with energy relative to the first of say 0.0001 Kelvin.

Without EM we cannot see any acceleration or deceleration, but if we add EM we add energy, if mass can bend light, then light can move mass.
