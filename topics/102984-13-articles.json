I got into the bus, hunched down in the seat and peered over the dashboard while the hooligan tried to shoot me. (Everyone knows the bottom of backrests are bulletproof.) After some time, the hooligan presumably ran out of bullets and decided to throw the gun at me. It seemed to be made of plastic, for some reason. After I straightened up, another hooligan (this one with a much cooler head) walked to the front of the bus and sat next to me. (Apparently my internal model of buses is somewhat lacking.) He had a gun, of course, and pulled out a phone to talk to someone, presumably an accomplice.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy this point, I was on the freeway. There was zero traffic. I decided that the bus now needed to stop. (I guess if driving the bus got me into the present situation, the cessation of driving must get me back out?) Conveniently, the freeway featured retractable spike strips\u2026 for lane enforcement, I guess? Since the hooligan was distracted by his phone (the call was not going well), I figured that the spike strips would be the best way to stop the bus. I ran over the strip once, but didn\u0027t stay on it long enough to trigger the spikes, so I ran over it again. The tires were torn to shreds, the bus screeched to a halt, and I looked at the hooligan with a smug grin. He gave an exasperated sigh\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2026and shot me directly in the head.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy vision immediately shut off, except for a text message: \u0022This incident will be reported to your superiors,\u0022 which quickly faded. My reaction was a kind of nonplussed \u0022well, crap.\u0022 I tried to figure out what the text meant, until I realized that I was trying to figure something out while I was supposed to be dead. A little after that, I noted the sensation of breathing, and shortly thereafter I woke up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile this isn\u0027t the first time I\u0027ve dreamed about dying or almost dying, it\u0027s the first time the \u0022dying\u0022 bit hasn\u0027t resulted immediately in waking up.
