I recall on the previous page that someone mentioned about the Cyborg X/Saitek drivers having issues with KSP. I have used my joystick for a bit, not realizing that the delay was indeed a driver conflict. It was my hope that this mod would solve that, but I am unable to get the mod to detect the joystick while in the flight scene. I can control the example pod I have on the pad with the normal controls and delay, but the mod apparently does not see the joystick at all. I have plugged it in a few times just to check if it will register and it apparently never does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the mod itself, select the keyboard/mouse entry, even see the values updating as I move the mouse.

This only occurs with SAS on. Throttle is unaffected by this. If I go -1 pitch (pull back), it does the same thing as the yaw, but get this.. Because my plane is tail-heavy, the engine rests on the runway if I do -1 pitch (as in it tilts back): As soon as the engine touches the runway, or any other part prevents SAS from acting or gives it resistance, it goes straight back to -1 pitch. Same with the roll and the yaw.
