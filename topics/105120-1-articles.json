While nobody outside the KSC has yet revealed the scope of this undertaking, it is widely known that the Program has massively stepped up recruitment in recent months, and speculation about what was going on behind the doors of the Vehicle Assembly Building has run rampant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo go with the announcement, the KSC released this series of images, which appears to show a space station of some type being launched into orbit. It is as yet unknown what the function of this mystery station will be, but it appears to be quite sizable and seems to be designed to produce artificial gravity through rotation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/my3F9Th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022my3F9Th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S2NULni.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S2NULni.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9PuWjRS.png\u0022 alt=\u00229PuWjRS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NcbFMb9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NcbFMb9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HVDxmWp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HVDxmWp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vkRjcMS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vkRjcMS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ET-190 days to Jool departure\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EInternal KSC briefing document\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPREAMBLE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Outpost Station design is intended to provide for long-term habitation by 88 crew members, to observe the long-term impact of space habitation in an unfamiliar setting.

Each ring houses 44 Kerbals, and is capable of completely independent operation from the other (though unwanted motion may result if one ring is removed, due to conservation of angular momentum). At each end of the station are a set of docking ports, to allow orbital and surface-orbit vessels to attach to the station and exchange crew and supplies. The station itself lacks propulsive capabilities, but is expected to be used primarily as a static installation. It carries no scientific apparatus, as its primary purpose does not include specific scientific investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew: 88\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Mass: 5936 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit Mass: ~1191 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation Mass: 216 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnit Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A14,618,105\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION CONTEXT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs one of the KSC-supplied elements of the Jool Kolonization Initiative, it is intended for the Outpost Station infrastructure to be available to all private partners to use as necessary to support their own colonization and commercial endeavours in the Jool system. To this end, numerous Outpost Stations are being outfitted and launched, with the ultimate goal of placing at least one each in orbit of Vall, Bop, and Pol, and a network of them over Laythe and Tylo. Prospective distribution profiles for Laythe and Tylo are still being studied, but the (currently) most promising options are a set of stations located in low circular orbits at inclination intervals of 30 degrees, or, with sufficient private partner buy-in, every 15 degrees. The net result of this is that a minimum of 15 such stations must be launched and brought to the Jool system, with a total population of some 1320 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: A Frantic Schedule\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ET-184 days to Jool departure\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKSC Administration Building, Jebediah Kerman\u0027s office\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well boss, you finally went and did it. You managed to sell this project of yours to the higher-ups, and I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027re the only one who\u0027s crazy enough to pull it off.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb frowned at Scott\u0027s comment. Sure, he was excited to finally have the Jool Kolonization Initiative get off the ground, but it wasn\u0027t just him responsible for it, and Scott was forgetting that. The thousands of colonists, tens of thousands of ground personnel, and numerous private contractors and agencies involved in the project had a long few years ahead of them, and it was about to get heated very quickly. To meet the lofty goals of the Initiative was going to take an incredible amount of work, perserverance, and luck, especially over the next six months. He was just glad that the first launch had gone off without a hitch, and the first 88 colonists were in orbit awaiting the still-distant transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Scott, what\u0027s the schedule looking like for the next three days?\u0022 he inquired of his second-in-command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well boss, we\u0027ve got a bunch more outpost station launches in the pipe - that was the only bit that was ready before we got the go-ahead, so it\u0027s first off the block. Besides that, the R\u0026amp;D boys finally have the science station ready, so that\u0027s got its first flight in a couple days. Plus EPSS is almost finished delivering their survey ship and wants a priority slot for the Kerbin mapping mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last item on the list lightened Jeb\u0027s frown a bit. \u0022I thought they weren\u0027t going to be ready for another three weeks,\u0022 he inquired of Scott.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They managed to step up their development a bit with some... ahem, encouragement from yours truly,\u0022 replied Scott with a smile, \u0022I don\u0027t need to tell you how important the orbital resource survey was to getting us the greenlight on this whole operation, after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb nodded silently in agreement. The KSC management had been stonewalling the colonization proposal for years, and had only very grudgingly agreed to it, with the condition that the majority of the cost burden be shouldered by private partners, and that one of those partners had to send up a resource survey ship and map Kerbin before the departure date. ExtraPlanetary Survey Services had stepped up to the plate, designing and building a long-range survey/probe carrier ship in record time, and had been one of the driving factors in making the bureaucrats listen. Now Jeb\u0027s desk was piled high with requisition orders, design documents, contracts, and what seemed like a never-ending series of forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Scott started going on about snack procurement for the upcoming launches, Jeb allowed his mind to wander a little, thinking back to his own visit to Jool so many years ago. He had marvelled at the oceans of Laythe, made a high-speed pass over the craggy terrain of Tylo, skimmed the Joolian cloud-tops, even gotten to glimpse the rock stacks of Pol. Crammed into the tiny little ship with just Bill and Bob for company, they had gone further than any Kerbal had ever gone before and lived to tell about it. And it was that mission that had inspired the Initiative in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...and that\u0027s about it. You OK there, boss? You look a little glazed over,\u0022 finished Scott, looking up from the tablet and forcing Jeb out of his reverie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m fine,\u0022 Jeb replied unconvincingly, \u0022Just not looking forward to all this paperwork.

He saw crews from KNN, FKX News, KBC, and a couple of dozen other networks, and it seemed like nine-tenths of the assembled crowd had press passes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I did. The Initiative needs publicity, or else this whole thing will never get off the ground - pun completely intended,\u0022 remarked Bob, emerging from the crowd. \u0022I know this thing is your dream, but we have to keep the public interested, or our partners will dry up and take our funding with them.\u0022 Bob might never have been completely at home in space, but here on the ground, he was adjusting to his new role as chief of operations for the Initiative extremely well. Not that Jeb saw much of him anymore - Bob was constantly on the go, courting some private agency or the media or the KSC\u0027s own administration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crackle interrupted them, as the observation room\u0027s speakers came on and the final countdown began. \u0022We are T minus 20 seconds to outpost station launch. All systems are go; repeat, all systems are go. Good luck up there.\u0022 All the reporters rushed to their positions, so they could be standing with the rocket behind them as it rose into the sky. Bob and Jeb moved off to one side, listening and watching as the last few seconds ticked off the countdown. \u00223... 2... 1... We have ignition... We have liftoff!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWell, they\u0027re certainly less dramatic than in our day\u003C/em\u003E, thought Jeb sarcastically, as the reporters chattered into their cameras and microphones and everyone\u0027s gaze followed the trail of smoke skyward. There would be another launch in a few hours, and a few hours after that, but for now he could rest. Scott was taking care of some of the paperwork, and the VAB was working flat out to keep everything running on schedule. He quietly exited the room, while Bob waded back into the throng of journalists for another round of interviews.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T01:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: On Target\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ET-182 days to Jool departure\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECafeteria, KSC personnel building\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMore forms\u003C/em\u003E, Scott thought, as he sat in a quiet corner of the cafeteria eating his dinner, \u003Cem\u003EAlways more forms.\u003C/em\u003E He had spent the few days since the project kickoff working practically nonstop, wading through piles of paperwork taller than he was.

To the rogue crewman trying to vent their air supply into space only a few weeks from home. And to Scott frantically trying to talk him down while Melman and Gerfrey searched frantically for something to restrain him with. He shuddered instinctively at the memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere had been a massive coverup, of course. The media darling of one of the most ambitious space missions in Kerbal history couldn\u0027t be seen as a raving lunatic by the general public. So Bartdard was quietly retired and placed in care, far from prying eyes, and the rest of the crew was grounded indefinitely.
