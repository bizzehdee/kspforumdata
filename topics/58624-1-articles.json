However, I have DRE installed. I came in at about 40 km, which then obviously caused me to explode violently, which I did not expect at that time because I didn\u0027t know the atmosphere was that thick/high up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what I had to do was look up online where the Jool atmosphere starts. Either that, or I could send a probe there and see when it starts exploding, but that\u0027s a waste of time. But looking it up is too cheaty for me. So i figured, why can\u0027t I send a probe there, and figure out some information about Jool, like for example how far the atmosphere reaches up to the heavens? Maybe topography (ha good joke on a gas planet) or temperature, and gravity and such things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course sending a probe out there to determine these things would be worth science, and a clear progression into a manned mission rather than crashing and dying for science. Where in space has man gone that a probe has not gone first, anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T16:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECombined with the ideas about turning a SCANsat or MAPsat-alike into a stock part, I agree. Get maps. Maps (and atmospheric data) are worth science. And could be viewable in a building at KSC, maybe an extension to the tracking station or science building?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
