I was\u00A0 coming back from Duna at frighting speed after literally days of work and I realized the inflatable heatshield I had on my craft just didn\u0027t work. Tried everything but I just couldn\u0027t slow it down no matter how many times I reloaded. I couldn\u0027t just watch those Kerbals die after so much effort. Oh look at that the shield folded around the craft when it popped and just barely shielded it during descent.
