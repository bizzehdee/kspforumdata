You will eventually have a sort of kerbal of kerbals who have all 3 perks and is at max level.

Leveling up is easy, you just have to perform some manouvers. If that would be implemented, we wouldn\u0027t need 3 crew capsules, as we could fully level up just one kerbal (jeb) and he could do all the work, and we would only need the small capsule, wich has 1/4 the mass of the big one, meaning that you would need the quarter of normal rescoures career mode would have to be re-alanced, ONCE AGAIN. Also, you could mass level out kerbals with simply one mission in later game. This current level system is bad. But with a different leveling-up system, this could work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T23:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like every kerbal to have 2 traits, just like in \u0022The Martian\u0022.
