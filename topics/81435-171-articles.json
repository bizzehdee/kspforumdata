Armor was (back when i developed this thing) purely developed to counter the popper-H, so it can usually take a few hits before being wiped out. Ive found at some angles its likely to get split apart with a very accurate hit, but so is the drek if you know where and how to hit it. Given that its ~65 tons, 270 parts and much more maneuverable then most dreks ive encountered, i would consider it a more practical ship. Weapons are similar to the standard drek, 4 capital ship torpedoes, specifically designed to fit Tripedo-S or Tripedo-M (and it fits my popper-H knockoffs too), and with modification it can even mount the Tripedo-S/H, the XL-3 wheel warhead weapon that is GUARANTEED to kill anything in 1 proper hit. Secondary weapons are 6 railguns, although this can always be refit with any 6 0.6m weapon, or replaced with 2 1.2m weapons allowing 6 heavy torpedoes to be carried when not dealing with fighters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/noSaW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The drek as you can see does survive, but if we go with logic, that is a dead ship as it cant move or do anything but be used to rearm someone else as the entire rear was obliterated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the kenji drek, the SK-CRV-I fairly balanced actually. It has less armor and is way more vulnurable to being tickled to death by fighters (engines are basically exposed and only wing covered, and weapons are completely exposed). That said, it is (from my experiences) a bit harder to wipe out with heavier weapons, due to both a lack of clipping and weakspots per say, and very small size making it hard to get your shots to connect. if you fire at low enough velocity to be accurate and guarantee a hit where you want, teh armor will usually stop the round before it hist anything critical, whereas if you fire at very high velocity to guarantee damage, you either phase through the entire craft, or miss altogether since its quite hard to hit a target of this size at 500\u002B m/s. Now there are angles where the odds of splitting it in half increase exponentially, but only shots from the front or rear at an angle stand a good chance of being particularly deadly, firing from teh side (it was originally intended to broadside targets), even the best werapons need a perfect phasing hit to connect with teh central girder, onlky then can you split it. If you think about it, the drek has better all around armor against most weapons, so it gets advantage there, but i have the edge in maneuverability and acceleration letting me get into a more favorable position and to some degree evade unguided weapons at anything but point blank range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T19:16:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
