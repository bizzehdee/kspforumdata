I\u0027ve been playing (with a rather lengthy break last year) since August of 2013.... I STILL don\u0027t know how to recognize when I hit my ship\u0027s terminal velocity. (Guess I should have had a nifty custom read out with that info..... \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETex: Is that TWR your Sea Level TWR? Or the TWR at the end of your first stage? When I launch a ship, and this is something I learned while messing around in RSS/RO, I start off with a Sea Level TWR of ~1.4 and try to have my first stage cut off TWR \u0026lt; 3. Anything higher than that and I would end up blowing my rocket up when it overheated. I\u0027ve pretty well kept this when I came back to running around in the standard Kerbal system. I still used FAR in .90 and with ~3900 m/s/s of dV I could get into a 100 km orbit with a few hundred m/s/s dV left over in case I screwed something up... *cough* That HARDLY ever happened though.... *Cough* (Incidentally, the start of my 2nd stage TWR is usually between .8 and .9 and I try to start my 2nd stage above 30 km... Now that I think of it.... I might start to put probe cores onto my 2nd stages so I can de-orbit them with the remaining fuel.) Also... I tend to look at total dV (and I use the vacuum statistic) as a measure of what I need to get to orbit. Perhaps there are more fuel efficient ways.... But I knew that I use that much dV at a minimum. I haven\u0027t quite figured out the new dV requirements with the new aero yet. Anyway, hope you find some use for this rambling passing along of experience.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t take me for a n00b.
