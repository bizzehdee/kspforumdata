I\u0027ve left a stack of cards on my desk - if I\u0027m not there just write your name on a card and leave it there. You\u0027ll have plenty of time to think it over, crew selection won\u0027t be till the end of the week.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an amused snort from the back of the group. \u201COr we could just have a show of hands right now,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie, \u201CWhether they\u0027re going or not, I don\u0027t figure anyone is going to need a week to make up their minds. So - who\u0027s for volunteering?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty three hands rose into the air. Jeb looked startled but started to count the hands. \u201COr alternatively - who doesn\u0027t want to volunteer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a single hand went up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked. \u201CI wasn\u0027t joking about bigger engines you know. I\u0027m not even sure how we\u0027re going to \u003Cem\u003Ebuild\u003C/em\u003E them yet. And you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E asking to be put in a seat on top of the biggest, most dangerous rocket we\u0027ve ever built, and fired into space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty three pairs of large round eyes stared unblinkingly back at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie coughed. \u201CThe thing is, Jeb - this is what we\u0027re all here for. We\u0027ve all seen Bill\u0027s pictures but speaking for myself, that just whet my appetite to go out and see the real thing. Besides, it may be the biggest rocket we\u0027ve built yet, it may even be just a mite experimental but if I was sitting in that capsule, I\u0027d be knowing that everything underneath me was built by people that I trust.\u0022\u00A0Ornie grinned. \u201CAlthough I might be a bit more worried about the bits that I\u0027d built.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb surveyed his team. There was a general nodding of heads and murmurs of agreement with Ornie. He came to a decision. In that case good kerbals, I think crew selection just got moved forward a few days. I\u0027ll be right back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb disappeared into his office, hurriedly returning with a wastepaper basket, a handful of pens and a stack of small white cards. He set them all down on the table beside the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 2\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight folks. Take a card, scribble your name on it , fold it in half and drop it in the basket here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a squeak from Roncott. \u201CUhh - are you telling us that pilots are going to be picked at \u003Cem\u003Erandom\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb simply. \u201CI\u0027ve been thinking about this a lot, folks and the problem is that \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E here could give me a good reason to be picked. Ornie and Richlin have some piloting experience already - but I don\u0027t think flying a spacecraft is going to be a whole lot like flying a plane. Bill, Bob, Geneney, Lucan and Wernher have already gone up, so they have some idea what to expect. Everyone else is an expert on at least part of the capsule or the launcher, which might give them that crucial bit of knowledge in an emergency. Besides, my thinking is that everyone here will have their part to play in building the Moho spacecraft, so everyone here should get their chance to fly them too. So eventually, I realised that the only fair way to do this was to get a pool of volunteers and let chance decide who gets to fly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott nodded solemnly and dropped his card into the basket. Jeb picked the basket up and gave it a thorough shake. Everyone could see the flurry of cards through the gaps in the weave. He offered it towards them, taking care to look away from the contents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyone else want to give this a shake?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody moved. Jeb closed his eyes tightly, dipped his hand into the basket and rapidly pulled out a card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the pilot for Moho 1 is...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA startled look crossed Jeb\u0027s face as he unfolded the card and read out the name printed on the inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tension in the room broke as everyone burst out laughing, amidst good-natured calls of \u201CFixed! Fixed!\u0022\u00A0Jeb grinned sheepishly and made to drop his card back into the basket, only to be greeted by a chorus of denial.\u0022\u00A0He raised his hands in mock surrender and laid the card down on the table, before reaching for a second card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pilot for Moho 2 is... Camrie!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe logistics and design team went wild. Jeb could see Roncott bouncing up and down, thumping Camrie on the back in delight. He drew out another card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pilot for Moho 3 is... Wilford!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford sat down with a thump and gaped incredulously at his friends, an enormous smile slowly spreading across his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pilot for Moho 4 is... Adelan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan\u0027s mouth dropped open. She grabbed Camrie around the waist and swung her friend around joyfully. \u201CThat\u0027s even better! We \u003Cem\u003E both \u003C/em\u003E get to go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd finally, the pilots for Moho 5 and Moho 6 are... Richlin and Joemy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie solemnly shook hands with his friend before chuckling and pulling him into a great bear hug. \u201CWell at least there\u0027s someone going up in one of these contraptions who knows a bit about flying!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy was the latest member of the capsule assembly team. Like Wilford, he just stared at Jeb in utter disbelief before being mobbed by enthusiastic kerbals.\u00A0Jeb grinned cheerfully at the milling crowd of excited kerbals. \u201COK everyone - we\u0027ve got our pilots - now we\u0027ve got some serious work to do!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe LV905 shut down in a brief spray of unburnt fuel, bouncing slightly as the sudden loss of thrust caused the test stand to pop and flex. The propulsion team removed their ear protectors and waited for the dust to settle before gathering round. Hando flipped up the restraining bar on the console and reeled back the strip chart for inspection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks good. I\u0027d say we\u0027re getting about 5% more thrust over the 902. Quicker ramp up as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmie grunted in satisfaction. \u201CTold you that the 903 chamber design was sound.\u0022\u00A0He inspected the chart critically. \u201CCombustion is nice and stable this time. Looks like Wernher\u0027s tweaks to the propellant lines were what we needed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked up. \u201CFive percent is good - better than I expected actually. We could maybe get some more if we went back to the 902 turbopumps but I\u0027m much happier working with the pressure fed design for these smaller engines.\u0022\u00A0He looked apologetically at Hando. \u201CI know you\u0027ve been working hard on the load cells, Hando but are you sure they\u0027re calibrated?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHando shrugged and reeled the chart further back. \u0022I ran both series of standard masses this morning. Data is right here if you want to look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick glance told Wernher all he needed to know. \u201CExcellent. That\u0027s going to help a lot, especially for the strap on boosters.\u0022He sighed. \u201CThe hard part starts now though I\u0027m afraid. Even an extra five percent on the 905s isn\u0027t going to make up for the lack of thrust on the LV-15. I think it might be time to revisit the LV-10.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie caught the reluctance in Wernher\u0027s voice. \u201CI take it there\u0027s a story here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u201CThe LV-10 was something I came up with back when we were building the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. It was obvious that a single LV-15 wasn\u0027t going to be enough and we never could get a cluster of them to work properly. So I figured we\u0027d go for a single bigger engine and run it hotter. To stop the whole thing melting I tried running the fuel lines around the combustion chamber walls to cool them down.\u0022\u00A0He stared into the distance. \u201CGreat idea in theory but not so great in practice. We never did work out what happened with the last test but it went very very blam indeed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, Wernher looked hopefully at Ornie. \u201CLooking back at it, I think a big part of the trouble was the fact that I just never could get the fuel lines to wrap properly around the chamber. You\u0027re a better kerbal than I am with a pipe bender though...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked thoughtful. \u201CI take it we\u0027re trying to use the hot fuel somehow and not just dumping it overboard?\u0022\u00A0Wernher retrieved a pencil from behind his ear and sketched out a quick diagram on the chart paper. \u201CCan\u0027t afford to waste the propellant. No - we use the vaporised fuel to drive the turbopumps. Engine start is a bit fiddly but once it\u0027s up and running it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E work nicely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded slowly. \u201CI think I see how that works. OK - I\u0027ll give it a go.\u0022\u00A0He scratched his head. \u201CYou\u0027re right though - that\u0027s going to be one heck of a job of pipe bending. Anyhow - reckon I\u0027m going to take a break. Maybe head over to Shed 2 and see how the sim team are doing with the Whirligig.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie let himself out of the side gate and headed across the road from the main warehouse. Now that they were building spacecraft on a larger scale, Jeb had decided that the Spaceship Parts Company needed more ship space and had leased another couple of smaller warehouses. The Spaceship Museum had been moved into it\u0027s own building, leaving the main warehouse free for vehicle development, testing and assembly. The other building - Shed 2, was for crew training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie stuck his head around the door to be greeted by a scene of organised chaos. The \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E capsule sat in the middle of the dimly lit warehouse floor surrounded by a cats cradle of steel frameworks, gas cylinders and tubes and cables of all descriptions. A large screen curved over the capsule from either side of the framework, each with a display projector mounted on a tripod behind it. Across the floor was a makeshift booth, sheltering what appeared to be a large and bewilderingly complicated control board which was connected to the rest of the equipment by a thick skein of cables. Three kerbals were seated behind the controls, peering intently at the mass of switches, dials and other other displays. All the electronics gear had a shop worn appearance and Ornie was fairly sure he\u0027d seen various bits of it gathering dust in a corner of the launch control bunker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie watched in fascination as the whole unlikely contrivance wheezed into life, lifitng the capsule off the floor and tilting it into a nose down attitude. One of the kerbals behind the control board tapped the microphone in front of him. \u201COK, Jeb, lets try the calibration again. Give me a plus oh one pitch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sharp hissing noise and the the capsule slowly tilted up towards horizontal and then, continued to tumble over and over. From the lack of flame, Ornie assumed that the noise wasn\u0027t caused by any kind of actual rocket system, which all in all was probably a good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking good,\u00A0Jeb. Negative oh one whenever you\u0027re ready.\u0022\u00A0With another hiss of high pressure gas, the capsule came to a halt, nose pointing jauntily upwards. The simulator whirred briefly and the capsule slowly swung round to its starting position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPerfect. Lets go for the rest of the calibration sequence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe staccato sound of compressed gas jets filled the air as the capsule proceeded to twist and spin in a set of increasingly elaborate maneuvers, guided all the while by a series of increasingly cryptic commands from the control booth. Finally it came to a standstill and the hatch popped open. Jeb climbed out, grinning from ear to ear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat a \u003Cem\u003E ride \u003C/em\u003E! I can\u0027t wait to take this thing out for a proper spin! Hey, Tomcas - everything felt sharp from inside the capsule - how did it look from your board?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomcas consulted one of the panels in front of him. \u201CLooked good from here too, Jeb. I think we\u0027re finally done with the calibration.\u00A0He grinned at the two kerbals sitting next to him. \u201CTime to move on to the real training.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLV-T15 article 3 - beginning test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher crossed his fingers behind his back as Hando started up the test stand. The LV-T15 roared into life behind the blast shields and for one triumphant moment, Wernher thought the propulsion team had cracked it. Then there was a ominous bloom of orange light, followed a fraction of a second later by a loud explosion and a rapidly expanding fireball billowing into the sky. Hando hastily shut off the fuel supply to the test stand and waited patiently for the tinkling sound of pieces of metal ricocheting off the metal sheets to subside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie, Wernher and Malmy gloomily surveyed the twisted and blackened wreckage. The chunk of ruptured pipe hanging off what was left of the prototype engine told a painfully clear story. Ornie threw up his hands in resignation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry guys but I don\u0027t think the coiled pipe idea is going to work. I honestly reckon that was my best piece of work yet - but it looks like my best just aint going to be good enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gripped his shoulder briefly. \u201CDon\u0027t worry about it, Ornie. I doubt anyone could have any better. We\u0027re just going to need another plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe unspoken question hung in the air, with neither kerbal willing or able to answer it. Eventually Wernher just shrugged. \u201CWe\u0027ll think of something eventually. In the meantime, as we\u0027re not doing much here, I think I\u0027ll see if the capsule folks need a hand with anything.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the propulsion team nodded slowly and followed him into the vehicle assembly area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, everyone was hard at work on the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E. Bill was seated at a bench, soldering iron prodding at what looked like a control panel. A thick bundle of cables was gradually being hauled in through the open capsule hatch, accompanied by the clattering of a power wrench and odd mumbled expletive from inside. Roncott was working at another bench by the nose assembly carefully packing a parachute canopy. Two other kerbals were working with caulking guns, filling in sections of the broad saucer shaped heat shield already in place on the base of the capsule and peering critically at the already filled areas. Occasionally one of them would pick up a drill, gouge out an entire section and patiently set to work re-filling it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other areas of the warehouse floor, the remaining sections of the spacecraft were gradually taking shape. From the clusters of reaction control nozzles and general confusion of plumbing, Wernher recognised one of them as the retrorocket and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E module. The benches nearby were full of neatly ordered components, presumably in strict assembly sequence order. Well away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E module and indeed the rest of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E, two jigs were standing next to each other, each with a slim metal ring clamped carefully to it. Even from this distance, Wernher could see the yellow and black stripes painted around the outside of each ring. Geneney was kneeling on the floor next to them, slotting decoupler bolts into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher sat down at a nearby bench feeling rather dispirited. Clearly there wasn\u0027t much he could do here and worse still, this beautiful piece of engineering wasn\u0027t going anywhere without a, so far non-existent, main engine to power it. Absently he prodded at what appeared to be a piece of corrugated copper, watching glumly as it rocked back and forth on the bench. Kerm only knew what it had been before but the level of polish suggested that it was due to be installed somewhere in the capsule and wasn\u0027t just a piece of scrap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA voice rose over the general hubbbub. \u201CHas anyone seen the primary heat exchanger baffle?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShould be on bench 4, Joemy, with the rest of the cooling system parts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy hurried over. \u201CAhh there it is. Could I just take that, Wernher? Thanks.\u0022\u00A0He stopped as he saw the look on Wernher\u0027s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHeat exchanger?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy was puzzled but happy to explain. \u201CSure - we braze a dual inlet manifold to each end of this. Primary coolant from the capsule systems runs through these channels here. We run secondary coolant in countercurrent through these channels here before sending it out to the evaporator plates.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHeat exchanger...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh-huh. We put the whole thing in a casing of course,\u0022\u00A0Joemy said nervously, \u201Cto close the channels over and keep them separate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHeat exchanger!\u0022\u00A0Wernher jumped to his feet, all despondency forgotten. \u201CJoemy - you may just have saved this program! Do we have any more of this copper in stock?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Joemy was completely baffled but pleased to have made such an impression on the chief engineer. \u201CI\u0027m not sure, Wernher. Geneney will know though, or if he\u0027s busy, Camrie could probably tell you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COrnie, ORNIE! Get over here and take a look at this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie rushed over in alarm. \u201CI\u0027m here chief - what\u0027s the problem?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTake a look at this - you think you could stick this around the LV-T15 chamber?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie picked up the heat exchanger baffle and flexed it experimentally between his hands. \u201CSeems to have enough give. Yeah, should be able to. He peered along the corrugations. \u201CNice and straight too.\u0022Then realisation dawned. \u201CA double walled chamber - is that what you\u0027re thinking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded vigorously. \u201CYes - rather than one large tube, we use a whole array of them. Assuming we can do it, it should make for an even more efficient design!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDe-orbit burn complete. Nice work, Jeb but watch that roll rate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb deftly countered the roll with a quick burst from his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. The capsule bumped and jerked around him as the air outside started to thicken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C100km and dropping. Keep it steady.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden lurch to one side. Jeb swore to himself as he fought to keep the little craft on course. Lodan\u0027s voice crackled over his headset in sudden alarm. \u201C80 km and dropping. Nose up - nose up!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gritted his teeth and bit back a pointed reply. The turbulence was smoothing out a little now as the capsule decelerated and his attitude rate indicators returned to something approaching normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C60km and dropping. Cabin temperature nominal, coming down 200km off target. 30 km and dropping... 15km and dropping - drogue chute deployed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob watched as the Whirligig capsule gradually pitched upright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd you\u0027re on the mains. Welcome home, boss.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule lowered itself to the floor and Jeb climbed out, shaking slightly , flight suit soaked in sweat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell that was intense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob gave Jeb a moment to catch his breath. \u201C200 km off target - I guess the booth crew decided to break the automatics huh?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes they did,\u0022\u00A0Jeb growled, \u201CRight in the middle of the de-orbit burn.\u0022\u00A0He ran his hands through his hair and looked wearily at Bob. \u201CStill - that\u0027s why we built this thing. Better to have this all down cold before the big day.\u0022\u00A0He raised his voice as he turned his head towards the booth. \u201COK you guys. Gimme five minutes to cool off and then we\u0027ll run through that again. And why don\u0027t you give me a \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E test this time!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob looked him solemnly. Probably not the best time to mention this but when would be a good time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust saw the news, Jeb. Looks like Rockomax have a satellite in orbit too. Pretty hefty one at that. The reporter at KBS was calling it the latest leap in the Space Race.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed. \u201CAnything to make a story I guess. In actual fact I was kinda hoping to go visit Ademone at some point. I know Wernher is still puzzled by their launcher, keeps insisting that their last flight looked all wrong for a solid booster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob was a little skeptical. \u201CC\u0027mon, Jeb. After all this effort, you\u0027re not trying to tell me that you\u0027d be happy sitting on the launch pad in a few weeks time knowing that you were just about to play second kerbal to some Rockomax pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell probably not.\u0022\u00A0Jeb conceded. \u201CAfter all the work we\u0027ve put in, it would hurt not being the first - particularly as it was our own damn satellite that got Rockomax into the race in the first place.\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CKerm\u0027s sake. It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E not \u003C/em\u003E a race. We go when we\u0027re ready and that\u0027s that! Besides, we both know that there\u0027s a big difference between lobbing a satellite around Kerbin and putting together a piloted mission. No sense in hurrying things. Don\u0027t get me wrong - I\u0027m all for being the first kerbal in space but I\u0027d prefer not to stay there permanently.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at his friend. \u201CWe\u0027d best get used to not being the first at everything though, Bob. We\u0027ve got a healthy start but Rockomax are good - and ambitious with it. Anyway - I\u0027d best climb back into that machine over there and see what the booth crew have planned for me next.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLV-T20 article 5. Beginning test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gestured to Joemy to come and join him by the test console. \u201CThis one\u0027s all yours,\u00A0Joemy. Start it up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine rumbled into life behind the screens, the rumble rapidly building up into a howling fury. Light from the rocket\u00A0fire blazed out around the test stand, which was shaking under the load. The screens began to rattle and then blew over with a resounding crash as they were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of incandescent exhaust pouring out of the engine bell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one shining moment before Wernher shut down the test, the Kerbin Interplanetary Society were treated to the sound and sight of an LV-T20 engine at full thrust. Jeb clenched his fists in triumph. He didn\u0027t need to inspect the test data. Finally they had what they needed. A successor to the LV15 and the next generation engine that could propel him and his fellow pilots out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar away at Stratus headquarters, Thomplin put down the phone and turned to face Halnie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do you feel about another trip out to Barkton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo need to answer that question\u003C/em\u003E, Thomplin thought to himself. \u201CThat was Jeb on the phone, as you probably guessed. It seems they\u0027re planning something, and I quote, \u0027rather special in three weeks time, assuming the all-up tests go to plan.\u0027 He also had the neck to let me know that he\u0027d set aside six complimentary launch tickets for Stratus.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie smiled. \u201CLooks like you, me and a couple from management then. I should also see if anyone has any contacts at KBS - I have a feeling that they\u0027re going to want to see this too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=522046\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; Chapter 9\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=571327\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 11\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-09T19:28:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2019 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ereplaced \u0026#039;lap\u0026#039; with \u0026#039;leap\u0026#039;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agent30632","CreatedById":58734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T15:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the\u0027re getting close to having the LV-T30.

The sun had barely risen over the Kerm Grove at the far end of the field and his breath steamed in the cold dawn air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tips of the large green globes were just starting to blush purple and Jonton knew that harvest time was only a week or two away. The vines weren\u0027t looking quite as healthy as he would have liked though. There were definite signs of wilt on some of them, although admittedly the weather hadn\u0027t been particularly good for breadfruit lately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stopped abruptly and bent over to peer at a cluster of leaves more closely. That wasn\u0027t right at all. The brown spotting looked like some kind of fungus and one or two of the leaves had actually died. Hard to blame that on the weather too - if anything, the unseasonable chill should have helped to kill off any odd pests that the Kerm trees couldn\u0027t handle. Jonton made a mental note to look up the brown spots in the Record Books once he got back to the village.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle hummed cheerfully to herself as she pulled on her climbing gear. Joenie watched her solemnly from the warm confines of her carry pack which Gerselle had carefully hung from a nearby branch. The tiny kerblet inspected her hands gravely and then batted at the brightly coloured plush bird suspended above her head. The bird made a playful cheeping noise as it bounced too and fro, much to her delight. Gerselle smiled as Joenie squeaked happily back at her new toy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle dipped her gloves into the adhesive, carefully letting the excess liquid drip back into the bucket. Hopping awkwardly, she dipped one boot into the viscous mixture before pressing it firmly against the trunk of the sapwood tree. She took a good grip on the smooth bark before repeating the process with the other boot. Satisfied that everything seemed to be holding properly, she rapidly clambered up the trunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe long grooves running down the trunk looked shiny and blemish free and Gerselle was pleased see translucent golden beads still forming in the channels despite the weather. Sap collecting wasn\u0027t her task for this morning though, so after a brief inspection, she climbed up further to the spray of huge green fronds at the top of the tree and the fleshy white flowers beneath them. Working with practised ease she wriggled her hand out of one glove, leaving it stuck to the leather patch on her leg. Carefully she dipped her hand into one of the pouches on her belt and sprinkled a pinch of bright yellow pollen into the centre of each flower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy mid morning, Gerselle had settled into a steady rhythm of tree climbing and flower pollinating, taking the occasional break to rock Joenie back and forth in her carry pack. The novelty of being in a swing was rapidly wearing off however and Joenie was getting increasingly irritable as the morning wore on. Gerselle finally gave in to the inevitable and sat down against a particularly large sapwood trunk as she settled Joenie in to feed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was only then that she spotted the unusual looking gourd at her feet. Shuffling carefully around so as not to disturb her daughter she examined it curiously. Whatever it was, it was certainly no sapwood pod and Gerselle couldn\u0027t remember seeing anything quite like it before. The thing definitely looked like a seed pod of some kind but it was larger than usual and covered in a dense mat of mottled yellow and brown fibres. She picked it up and shook it tentatively, raising her eyebrows slightly as it made no noise. She shrugged and dropped the gourd into a belt pouch, making a note to look it up in the Records later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Gerselle walked up the path to the village archives she was surprised to find Jonton heading in the same direction and looking worried. \u201CIs everything alright?\u0022\u00A0she asked, a note of concern creeping into her voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked at her. \u201CI\u0027m not sure,\u00A0he replied, \u201CThe breadfruit vines aren\u0027t looking too good - they seem to have caught some kind of fungus. I was just going to consult the Records.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle frowned. \u201CIt\u0027s been pretty cold for a fungus,\u0022\u00A0she said, \u201Cand its unusual for one to get past the Kerm trees. Are you sure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot really,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201Cbut it\u0027s the only thing I could think of that would explain the brown mottling on the leaves. Anyway - what takes you to the Records. Don\u0027t tell me the sapwoods have caught something too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle shook her head. \u201CNo, they\u0027re fine. They\u0027re even managing to trickle out some sap in this weather. I just found this gourd whilst I was out. I don\u0027t remember seeing anything like it before though, so I was just going to look it up.\u0022\u00A0She drew the gourd out of its belt pouch and handed it to Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton frowned. \u201CNot sure I recognise it either. That fibrous coat is pretty distinctive though - should be easy enough to find in the Records.\u0022\u00A0Absently he twisted the fibres around his fingers and then stopped in surprise, sniffing at the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COdd. Do you smell cinnamon?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton twisted another handful of the fibrous coating, rubbing it vigorously against his fingers. There was definitely a scent of cinnamon in the air. Almost like the smell of...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u00A0he whispered to himself, \u201Cno, it can\u0027t be.\u0022\u00A0He hurried into the archive house and went over to the very oldest section of the shelving. Without hesitation he reached for the first book on the shelf and took it over to the table. By the time Gerselle joined him, he had found the section he wanted. Wordlessly he pointed at the faded but carefully rendered drawings on the page in front of him. Gerselle\u0027s eyes widened as she recognised the picture of the tree and the picture of her gourd right next to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt can\u0027t be...\u0022\u00A0she said faintly,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton gripped her hand. \u201CI know, love,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut the book even mentions the smell of that bruised fibre. I\u0027m having a hard time believing it myself but think you might just have found the first Kerm seed on Kerbin for nearly five hundred years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe kept his voice deliberately casual but a small worm of unease was beginning to gnaw at him. If Gerselle\u0027s gourd really was a Kerm seed then it would need a new Keeper and he had a sinking feeling that he knew exactly who that Keeper would be. \u201CI\u0027d better read up on this, Gerselle. There looks like quite a lot to get through and... well it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E Kerm \u003C/em\u003E seed. Most of this stuff is probably important and we don\u0027t exactly have anyone else we can turn to for help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Walkers stood in a loose group at the entrance to the village. Jonton and Gerselle stood slightly apart from the rest, both clothed in grey robes belted securely around them to ward off the pre-dawn air. Gerselle\u0027s robe was so new that the wool hadn\u0027t had a chance to soften and she shifted from foot to foot, scratching herself surreptitiously. The cowl of her robe was draped down her back, weighed down by the Kerm seed inside. Joenie was fast asleep in a makeshift sling strapped across her chest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA group of six kerbals stood in a row, each with a heavy grey pack on his or her back. Each pack was full of damp earth, with six Kerm cuttings planted carefully inside. Another dozen kerbals were carrying similar packs, these dyed brown and filled with saplings of all the trees in the Grove, all carefully packed in damp sweetmoss. Others were equipped for camp, carrying bundles of food and waterskins for the whole group, along with bedding and rolls of fabric wrapped around light wooden poles. The rest of the village looked on with a mixture of sadness and joy. Most families were proud to have at least one son or daughter listed amongst the Walkers but that pride was tempered with the knowledge that they were finally leaving home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton squeezed Gerselle\u0027s hand reassuringly and then stepped into the middle of the group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy friends. We are setting out today on a journey of great joy. A journey that hasn\u0027t been seen on Kerbin for centuries.\u0022\u00A0He paused. \u201CBy sundown today we will have founded a new village and planted the seeds of a new Grove. Each and every one of you has promised to help our new Keeper with her task and for that you have my deepest thanks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled gently. \u201COf course, some of you will be making this journey many times in the days ahead. Even the stoutest group of kerbals cannot carry a whole new village on their backs and even with proper transport there will be much to carry and much work to do over the coming weeks. But for now, the seed kindles and our time grows short.\u0022\u00A0He knelt before the Walkers, arms stretched towards them in the ancient gesture of benediction, then climbed to his feet. \u201CLets make a start my friends.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun rose over the treetops as the Walkers set out. The village stream wound it\u0027s away across the grasslands in front of them, running down from the hills on the distant horizon. As far as possible, Jonton kept them on a trail along the banks but where the stream\u0027s course was looping and erratic, the Walkers kept to a far straighter path. Everyone seemed reluctant to break the peace of the early morning with chatter, although the clinking of buckles and the occasional bird call stopped the silence from becoming oppressive. The grass underfoot was coarse and springy and the kerbals were able to keep up a good pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTowards mid morning, the last of the dawn mist finally burned away and the mood of the party became less contemplative. Murmured conversations could be heard up and down the trail and some of the younger kerbals kicked a ball back and forth between them as they walked. By the time they stopped for their midday meal, everyone was in good spirits, as they retrieved packets of food from their backpacks and sat down by the stream. The youngest kerbals splashed happily in the shallows but even the oldest could be seen dangling their feet in the water to cool off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunch was a short affair though, as Jonton was keen to get moving. The afternoon walk was rather harder going, the springy grass gaving way to coarse shrubland and outcrops of rock as they moved into the foothills. The group gradually spread further and further apart as some of the walkers found it increasingly difficult to keep up. Finally the shrubland petered out altogether and Jonton looked at the rocky slopes ahead of them with increasing dismay. The stream was still keeping them company as it bubbled and foamed over the stones beside them but this was no ground for planting. Worse still, as far as he could see, they wouldn\u0027t find anywhere better before sundown. He called a halt and waited for the stragglers to catch up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know about you my friends but this doesn\u0027t look like good country for planting a new Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a general murmur of agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Records are clear - the new seed should be carried on foot from sunrise and it shall be planted at the last minute of the day. Unfortunately, it looks like the last minutes of this day will be spent climbing rocky slopes and stony scree.\u0022\u00A0Jonton took a sip from his waterskin. \u201CI need three volunteers to scout ahead, in case there is better ground before us. The rest of us will turn back. As soon as we find enough soil to plant our trees, we will stop and wait for news from the scouts.\u0022\u00A0A fleeting look of worry passed across his face. \u201CThis was not an easy choice my friends. However, I can\u0027t believe the Records would intend us to let a Kerm seed die by leaving it on bare rock. We shall turn back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was just dipping below the horizon when the three scouts appeared over the hilltop and made their way over to Jonton. They spoke to him briefly in lowered tones and Jonton nodded solemnly and called the rest of the Walkers to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo be it. We plant the new Kerm here. \u0022He knelt down and scooped out a shallow pit in the gritty soil. As the last rays of sunlight sank out of sight, Gerselle reached into the hood of her robes and took out the seed. As the others stood reverently around them, she placed it carefully into the pit and tamped the soil down over it. Finally she shook out the last drops of her waterskin out over the newly planted seed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the sapling carriers raised his hand. \u201CKeeper - where should we plant the other trees?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton scratched his head. \u201CThe Records don\u0027t tell us anything about the other trees,\u0022\u00A0he replied. \u201Cbut the Kerm cuttings should be planted no more than seventy paces from the seed and no less than forty paces apart. In the village Grove, all the Kerm trees are planted in a loose group with the rest of the trees planted outwards from there. That seems like as good a plan as anything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs twilight crept over the hill, the air was full of the sound of spades scraping against soil. Gradually the bald hilltop became covered in a thin stubble of slender saplings as the kerbals planted the thirty-six\u00A0kerm cuttings and then the dozens of other trees they had brought with them. As twilight faded into a deep starry darkness, the last of the tents was put up and all the Walkers fell into a deep and well earned sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, the new villagers kept at a respectful distance from Jonton and Gerselle as they said goodbye. Jonton drew his wife into his arms and hugged her tightly as they stood wordlessly on the hillside, the new saplings dotted around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll be alright, love. As soon as the four months are up, I\u0027ll be on my way to visit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle fought to keep the bitterness out of her voice. \u0022Four months, Jonton! Four months on my own with no father for Joenie.\u0022 Joenie heard her name and made a happy chirruping noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton swallowed a sudden lump in his throat. \u0022I know,\u0022 he said softly, \u0022I know. The Books leave no doubt though - only one Keeper in a Grove until it has properly knitted.\u0022 He took her by the shoulders and gazed tenderly into her eyes. \u0022It\u0027s a wonderful feeling you know, to wear the grey cloak. To bond with a Grove, be its guardian and sometimes even share its dreams.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked at her earnestly. \u0022The village Grove is \u003Cem\u003Eold,\u003C/em\u003E Gerselle, just like every other Grove on Kerbin. My family have been it\u0027s Keepers for generations. Even then, to be chosen as Keeper was a great privilege - and a great joy. But you get to be the mother of the first new Grove for over five hundred years! Not even the village Records go back that far.\u0022 His eyes misted over. \u0022You\u0027ll get to feel it grow, to guide it on its path from a handful of saplings to a beautiful new Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle was silent. \u0022It is only four months isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u0022So the Books say. Four months until knitting and then other Keepers can visit. Trust me - I\u0027ll be here to see you and Joenie on the very first day I can. He smiled. \u0022The village Grove will understand. After all, it has a child of its own now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=544574\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 10\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=580674\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 12\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-09T19:30:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2019 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Pseudonym","CreatedById":27614,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay!
