Running KSP on steam with mods. It was fine before the last update. I don\u0027t know what update but the latest update open to the public as of the 10th of june 2017. It never happened before and I checked my task manager and nothing was maxed out. Running windows 10 on a good gaming laptop and I have never had any problems until\u00A0now so it can\u0027t be hardware or CPU but just in case I checked anyway. What happens is that it loads like normal until \u0022Loading Asset Bundle Definitions\u0022 then it pauses and crashes.
