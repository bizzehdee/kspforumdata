You\u0027ve got kind of a lot of them, many of which are about things this forum has already discussed at one point or another. They can still be interesting, for example if new information is provided in the linked article, but forum etiquette would usually ask that you put such an update into the original thread instead of making a new one. Since constantly searching for old threads can get annoying, a \u0022latest news\u0022 collection thread may be a more comfortable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
