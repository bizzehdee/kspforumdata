Flip the cockpit upright, assemble the structure you want starting from beneath it and along its axis, and then flip the cockpit back and move the completed assembly to where you actually want it to be. Note that this is not a perfect solution. You can\u0027t alter any parts without moving the orientation back again, and the rocket will try to fly itself from the orientation of the cockpit unless you \u0022control from here\u0022 some other part before the ship leaves the Launchpad.
