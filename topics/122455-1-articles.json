It animates just fine in Blender, but when I export it and try to play the animation in Unity, the model starts doing weird things. I\u0027ve animated dozens of models in the past, and they all worked fine (well except for one, but I realized my mistake soon after).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as an FYI, here is what the hierarchy looks like in blender:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PDf8zWz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PDf8zWz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, what happens is, when I bring the .fbx file into Unity and do the usual stuff (set animation type to Legacy and all that jazz), I for some odd reason end up with 15-20 different clips instead of the 1 clip. When I try to preview the animation the model twists and contorts in all kinds of awkward ways. I am unsure as to why this is happening, but if anyone knows what the problem is (or rather what I am doing wrong), please enlighten me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T21:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T19:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re exporting the FBX there is a checkbox with an option to save the animation as a single global animation or break it up into individual bits.
