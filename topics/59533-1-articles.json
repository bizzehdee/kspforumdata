As Kerbol rose further the shadows seemed to slither and creep along the Munar surface - as if they were stealthily stalking the freshly deposited landing module. Bill and Bob were desperate to leave; Jeb however did not share their sense of trepidation and foreboding. Before they could leave there was one more thing that must be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReminding his shipmates of the perilous nature of their chosen profession Jeb raised the following question; \u0027Though we may have enough fuel to get home now - what if we didn\u0027t?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus he radioed the Great Keyboard Controller in the sky to send another mission to the Mun - a full dress-rehearsal of a rescue mission. Energised by this new goal the GKC flashed into action, sending another craft into Munar orbit within hours of the call. Now only one challenge remained - a precision manual landing, something the GKC had never attempted before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the GKC\u0027s grasp of mathematics left something to be desired, he made his best guess and made a full retro burn a couple of hundred clicks uprange of the target at an altitude of around sixty clicks. Withdrawing to the map room, he could see the orbital trajectory decay until it graced the great grey body and fell right through it. Slowly but surely the turquoise arc crept towards the target, the GKC\u0027s anticipation building. Once the ballistic arc was a couple of clicks downrange of the target the burn was halted and the \u0027rescue\u0027 craft allowed to fall under the infinite grasp of gravity. He decided to let the universe move along at it\u0027s usual pace and go prepare himself a steaming cup of Yorkshire Tea in preparation for his anticipated celebrations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon return and switching back to reality the GKC once again took manual control of the ship and could see quite clearly that his initial estimations were somewhat off - he\u0027d left it too long! Still going hell for leather at only ten clicks up! Burn burn BURN - full throttle!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity began to sharply drop off, 500m/s.....400....300; the altimeter was also reeling at speed that seemed utterly ridiculous.... The target was in sight! Only a couple of hundred metres downrange and a couple of clicks below; a rush of adrenaline and renewed optimism gripped the GKC. Pitch, roll, yaw - easy does it - keep your cool GKC! Realisation struck; this can be done! Sure enough - the craft had a high enough thrust-to-weight ratio to halt it\u0027s suicidal descent, levelling off a mere one hundred metres above the target and only a dozen metres to the side. Reining in the throttle gently, the GKC balanced the controls just so and the \u0027rescue\u0027 craft made a perfect soft-landing thirty metres or so from the intrepid trio in their Artemis lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, Bob and of course Jeb rejoiced in this shining example of manual piloting before the realisation set in that their capsule\u0027s design did not yet include a hatch. If this had been a real rescue scenario the rescue ship may as well have been still sat on the pad at KSC, eleven thousand kilometres away. The only regret the GKC had was that his tea was now cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Better not mess up the next landing eh guys?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me this is probably my greatest personal achievement in KSP - the realisation that I could manually fly over such a distance, perform the complex maneuvers necessary using just the Mk1 Eyeball and thus land within a hundred feet of my target was intoxicating. Shame that it took me three attempts - but the story wouldn\u0027t be the same if I\u0027d included that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve since repeated the same feat with every body in the Kerbol system - but I\u0027ve never quite replicated the satisfaction of that first \u0027Munar Surface Rendezvous\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease share what you feel to be your greatest personal achievement - and leave a little anecdote describing it if you feel so inclined.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Post removed in error by moderation team - reposted and fixed formatting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T15:00:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Excalibur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T15:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first rendezvous and docking in career, without MechJeb.
