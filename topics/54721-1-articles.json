What\u0027s happening is the game is detecting a collision and flinging your kerbal off. If you are using the \u0022get out and push\u0022 method you always want to set yourself a mental safety margin on fuel, and if you do get flung off toggle RCS, wait a bit, and activate it again and wait a moment for your kerbal to stabilize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T23:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, don\u0027t panic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, turn off your RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinaly, wait for your Kerman to rotate around until he\u0027s straight up and down and reactivate his RCS pack.
