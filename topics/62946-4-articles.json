My theory is that whenever the vessel physics gets loaded into the world, its spawning at the launchpad, before quickly being moved to the right place. Since the craft is moving at such high speed (and perhaps because of the warp somehow), it may be that its hitting something while in that transition. Could you test doing the warps with the orbital motion vector in different directions relative to the KSC launchpad? (such that if you imagined how the vessel is moving at the moment if you teleported it to the pad, its velocity would send it up, down, etc) If theres a relation between the velocity vector relative to the surface and when it explodes, that would prove my theory. If I have time I\u0027ll test this as well to see if this is why the explosion isn\u0027t consistently triggered when I try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether this gets results or otherwise, I think it could be helpful to include a feature to make the logs spit out all kinds of info as to the current state of warps and such, so that I can see where there might be a difference somewhere in the internals in different cases.
