I took it down to 3 tanks, still wouldn\u0027t launch, so I let it burn fuel for a few seconds and sure enough it launched at TWR 1.90. The problem is then it took off as if it had a TWR of 1.90, it was going pretty fast, rather than crawling off the launch pad (as if it had just reached 1.0).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T20:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the exact same problem.

So basically, because I upgraded the launchpad, I can\u0027t launch rockets to earn science to get what I need to avoid the launchpad bugs. Wonderful. If this were the first one, that would be one thing but I\u0027m just about to abandon 0.90.
