I turned to look and was struck with awe and fear as I saw a massive light with an even bigger tail. My brain quickly raced through the possibilities\u00A0of what it could be. Was it a returning space shuttle? No, NASA hasn\u2019t launched a shuttle in years. A meteor? No, we would have heard of it\u2019s approach. Oh god could it be a missile? My fears grew as I saw something detach from the craft. \u201COh no, it\u2019s a warhead\u201D I thought. Then after that 10 seconds of confusion and fear,\u00A0my 500\u002B hours of KSP experience kicked in. It was a rocket!!! I quickly ran through what I was seeing:\u00A0The contrail due to it reaching the colder upper atmosphere, the gap in the contrail due to throttle down, the throttle up once it had gained enough altitude to not have atmospheric resistance, the separation of the main stage, the ignition of the secondary engine, and the spinning of the main stage in space and it\u2019s eventual reentry into earths atmosphere. I called my friends and family, most of whom\u00A0were scared it was a UFO or missile themselves, and explained to them exactly what was going on, all thanks to an indie video game. Since then I have been obsessed with watching\u00A0footage on social media,\u00A0the space X stream of the launch (link below)\u00A0and KSP videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tE5C3O71Xqo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtdjCwo6d3Q?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was truly an awesome thing to see but even more awesome to scientifically understand what I was seeing.

I have a tendency to worry about things more than most. To be honest, I knew it was a rocket in my head but I hadn\u0027t seen one like that before. I\u0027ve lived in so cal my entire life and have seen maybe 2-3 launched from vandenberg AFB, but 2 things were unique for this launch: 1. The direction, most launches head out over the ocean and continue west, this one went south. 2. The size and look of this one was much different. I know its due to atmospheric conditions and the twilight effect but the contrail was massive. Its hard to tell from pictures, but this contrail was probably 100x larger than anything I have seen before. Additionally, most rocket launches I have seen stop the show once the main engine cuts off, this one the secondary engine had a contrail too. I had never seen that before. That\u0027s why it wasn\u0027t until stage 2 that my fear it was maybe something nefarious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, it was probably mostly my fear prone personality. A few of my friends were positive it was a UFO (until I explained it to them), so it probably tends to be interpreted differently based on peoples predisposed notions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002227914\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vanamonde\u003C/a\u003E I also grew up in SoCal, As i mentioned above, i have only ever seen maybe 2-3 launches. It doesn\u0027t happen as much anymore, or I am just not lucky enough to see it. The only other odd looking launch I have seen was one maybe 12 years ago. My mom swore the rocket put a hole in the atmosphere. You could see the trail and where the rocket went there was a dark hole where you could see into space. I am not scientific enough to know what caused this effect, but my guess is it was a shadow allowing you to see the dark of space. Anyway, lots of people did know about the launch but apparently I am not one of them. If I remember correctly, they did a launch a week earlier as well. The difference with this one was the atmospheric conditions. It looked like a trail of fire against the (getting darker) twilight sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-26T19:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223251629\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168828\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514091049\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 24/12/2017 at 5:50 AM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that not happen anymore?
