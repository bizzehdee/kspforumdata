You can see the nosecone sitting at around 400 Kelcius (funny joke!) and the NCS adapter at 1100. A second later the NCS adapter explodes while all the parts around it are completely fine in terms of heat. \n\n[![screenshot19.jpg](http://s24.postimg.org/g50taqh35/screenshot19.jpg)](http://postimg.org/image/g50taqh35/)\n\nEven if my design is aerodynamically poor (which I don\u0027t think it is, but who am I to judge...) it still wouldn\u0027t explain the huge difference in heat between the two most frontally mounted parts on the airplane. \n\nAnybody else who noticed this? \n\nRegards,\n\nFunguspower"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:33:36Z","Content":"doh, bigger area more heat"},{"CreatedByName":"Funguspower","CreatedById":141907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:45:36Z","Content":"Possibly, Radam, but it heats up so much faster than the rest that something seems wrong.\n\nAlso, a large part of the adapter is covered up by the nosecone. That should be heating up most in this case. Especially at supersonic speeds. The cockpit right behind it has an even bigger surface area and doesn\u0027t overheat until much later.\n\nThanks for the idea, though. \n\nRegards,\n\nFungus"},{"CreatedByName":"Basilo1146","CreatedById":69489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:55:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been noticing some parts heating very oddly as well, namely the Mk-2 cockpit(the pointed one, not sure about the inline one) seems to inevitably explode on the way up, as does the Tail Section A and the wing Strakes.

Though not the case with heat from speeding in atmosphere (attrition), heat affects parts exposed to Sun and not all.\n\nAbout attrition, heat is generated as drag is created by each part (more or less, area presented to the stream \\* air density \\* speed^3). Notice that parts upstream occlude those downstream (based on relative size), so heat is directly applied to the first, and less or none to the second. Then, heat is measured against the thermal capacity of each part to compute the temperature. Based on temperature of each part, heat is conducted, conveyed, and radiated in space. Parts with limited heat conductivity don\u0027t share much heat with others (even if directly attached), of course if heat keeps being generated for that part more than it can be radiated, conveyed or conducted away, that part temperature will finally get above the maxTemp value... and disintegrate from overheating."}]}
