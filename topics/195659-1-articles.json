The way this not complicated system could work is that the height of the bottom ring determines how much it\u0027s worth and the upper ring determines how much it\u0027s multiplied by. So, after that awful explanation here\u0027s how much this one\u0027s worth: 20 funds, yeah not much. You can tell it\u0027s 20 funds because the bottom ring is twice the height of the top one (2) and the top ring has 1 flat side (x10) so it\u0027s 20 funds. The max value of a Kerbal \u0022coin\u0022 is 50000 funds (bottom ring is 5 times the height of the top one and the top one has 4 flat sides.) So, feel free to tell me what you think of this very Kerbal idea for the currency (putting the value of the coin on the coin in number from is so lame.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-18T04:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2020 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
