I\u0027ve decided that Zenit and proton rockets (scaling to 2.5m as URM-1) are rounded to 3.25m. URM-2 (Angara 2nd stage) would be 3m in this scale. So Just going to jump to 3.25m instead and call it all URM-2. The visual difference is very slight. Any issue with this? Of course! RD-172 and RD-175 looks slightly too small for that now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily (because of the way the engines are made) with minimal changes and UV stretching I should be able to push the nozzles outward to make them fit 3.25 like they where made to fit 3m stages.
