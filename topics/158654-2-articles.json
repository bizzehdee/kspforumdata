This changes things. For example, that\u0027s why cost per kilogram isn\u0027t always the most accurate determiner. If Company A charges $10M to put up to 500 kg into LEO and Company B charges $6M to put up to 150 kg into LEO, then Company B is twice as expensive per kilogram...but if my bird is only 120 kg, I\u0027m sure as heck not spending an extra four million bucks just for the fun of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame with expendable vs reusable launchers. An RLV is only cheaper if the cost of recovery, refurbishment, and recertification, plus manufacturing costs amortized over the expected lifetime, is less than the cost of a completely new ELV. Recovery, refurbishment, and recertification costs all get passed on to the launch purchaser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn RLV must reserve payload margin for recovery (TPS and legs/gear, and either parachutes or additional landing propellant). So, if you assume the same engine performance and tankage ratio,\u00A0a single-stage RLV will be larger than a single-stage\u00A0ELV for the same net payload. This drives up vehicle cost and fixed operating costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, consider an ELV that can put 100 kg into orbit for $1M. Let\u0027s say half that ($500K) is fixed operating costs, profit margin, and fuel, while the other half is the cost of the expendable vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen consider an RLV with the same performance and structural ratios. If it needs to reserve 30% of its payload capacity for reuse, then it needs to be 50% larger. This means the manufacturing costs and operating costs also go up by 50%. So now it costs $750K to operate and $750K to construct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s estimate refurbishment, recovery, and recertification at 20% of the cost of a new LV, or $150K. Now the fixed operating costs for each launch are up to $900K. In order to beat the ELV, the $750K sticker price to construct the LV will have to be amortized over at least eight launches with no major part replacements in order to break even. However, an RLV program is more expensive to develop than an ELV program, so the launch company needs additional profit margin\u00A0to recoup its investment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s how an ELV \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E can beat out an RLV \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, ARCA seems to think that the complexity of staging drives up the costs of an ELV, and they\u0027re partly right. There are fixed manufacturing costs associated with building a stage that are more or less independent of the stage\u0027s size, up to a point, which is why it is cheaper to build a single stage with larger engines and larger tanks than it is to build two distinct stages. You only need one engine, one avionics package, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t give me any confidence in ARCA\u0027s ability to pull it off, but the configuration seems sound...if they can meet their structural mass ratios, that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T15:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223012942\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158654\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491571651\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile reusability isn\u0027t a sure thing, number of stages needed to get to orbit is known pretty well to be \u0026gt;1. \u00A0A company with a poor record of getting things done combined with a plan that ignores the rocket equation implies they are looking for gullible and uninformed businessmen. \u00A0Sanity is purely optional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEh, the rocket equation is just math, and the math checks out.

If a TSTO can deliver the same payload for a lower expense than an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E makes no sense. If not, it makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all I need to do is compare ARCA\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to a hypothetical TSTO using the same performance specs and margins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I\u0027ll verify ARCA\u0027s specs. Since we are dealing with altitude compensation I will take the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit as 9,150 m/s and just use the vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the aerospike engine (314 seconds) for the entire trip. They claim a GLOW of \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E16,290 kg\u003C/span\u003E, a payload of 100 kg, and a dry mass of 550 kg. Plugging everything into the rocket equation, we get 833 kg to orbit, so their numbers (at least) aren\u0027t unreasonable. If we use their payload numbers and solve for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, we get\u00A09,913 m/s which will be our baseline for gravity drag, aerodynamic drag, and impulse losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what can we get for a balanced TSTO delivering the same payload? We don\u0027t know the claimed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or mass of their engine, which will make our estimate a little more guessy, but we can just adopt their overall GLOW/dry-mass (29.62) and hope for the best. Let\u0027s split that 9,913 m/s up equally between the two stages:\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E4957\u00A0on the second stage and\u00A04956\u00A0on the first stage.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003ESecond stage wet to dry ratio needs to be 5:1, so if our payload is still 100 kg, then total second-stage mass at staging needs to be 601.7 kg (481.4 kg of propellant, 100 kg of payload, and 20.3 kg of dry mass). This 601.7 kg becomes the payload on the first stage.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EFirst stage wet to dry ratio also needs to be 5:1 (remember, balanced TSTO), so our GLOW needs to be 3,620 kg (2,896 kg of propellant and 122.4 kg of dry mass).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EThis is ridiculous. Propellant costs for a TSTO using the same performance and margins as ARCA\u0027s would be a scant 22% of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and dry mass would be just 26%. Even if there were substantial square-cube losses, that\u0027s not anywhere close. There\u0027s no way it would cost more to do a TSTO than it would to do an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EWhy do I get the feeling that ARCA simply set the performance numbers up and then back-calculated to get the mass ratio that they needed?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#222222\u0022\u003ETheir claimed GLOW/M\u003Csub\u003Edry\u003C/sub\u003E is just a hair under 30.
