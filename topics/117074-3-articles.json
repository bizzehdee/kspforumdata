It seems to be docked to the end of the ISRU and to the end of the C.R.A.D.L.E. So I decoupled the C.R.A.D.L.E.\u0027s docking port but it immediately re-docked and then the battery detached from the ISRU. So the battery ends up sticking with the C.R.A.D.L.E. - weird, but the ISRU seems to have plenty of power...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird problem (but I just figured it out!) is the three tubes. It was apparent that I needed to dock one of the modues to the center one and then separate it from the other two, but for the life of me I couldn\u0027t get it to dock! Then I realized that you stuck them together with the center tube docked to both other tubes and then rotated/offset them so they don\u0027t appear docked, so I put the rover and cupola module close to one of the ports on the center tube and then decoupled that tube and let the magnets take over.

Rune mentions in an earlier post that if that tube falls to the ground, it\u0027s probably useless. After that the last two big problems were the fuel dump ended up on its back and has no source of torque, so it was stuck there, and the battery that I mentioned earlier that had fallen to the ground. I actually managed to overcome both of these issues in much the same way. I pushed the tank around with the rover a bit and it ended up on its end, which was not a lot better, but the rover has so much torque I was able to push right up against the tank and turn the rover on its end and then use its rcs to lift it so it would dock. Then I used its torque to right it and the tank. Since I knew the rover had enough torque for that, I took the same approach with the battery only keeping the tank on top for a compatible dock. That rover is really something else!

So legs - no, I didn\u0027t have them out when I unloaded the CRADLE - not for the fuel dump, at least. Would have preferred to do it that way, but the solar panel was being ripped off every time that way. It looks like the panel is clipped into the floor of the cargo bay when loaded, and so the cargo bay pulls it to the extended position while deploying and if there is any horizontal movement of the cargo bay before the panel is clear then it breaks it. So the trick for me - and I don\u0027t think it will work on the Mun - was to use RCS to fly the CRADLE as straight up as possible until it is clear of the panel and then get it the heck out of the way before it crashes onto something I don\u0027t want destroyed.

Going in there\u0027s no issue, the game allows that for some reason, but then they become part of whatever they clipped into and when you separate the parts by undocking, they are still joined by the clipped part(s), so when you try to fly the CRADLE off, it pulls whatever was clipped and everything attached with it. My procedure above eliminates clipping of the gear by not extending them before the cradle is gone. B2 and B3 is a little trickier because the clipping is with the solar arrays, which are buried deep inside the cargo bay and should not be extending. I think they are getting clipped by the floor of the cargo bay due to settling. So I probably am not eliminating that clipping at all, but by lifting the CRADLE\u0027s weight slightly with the RCS, I allow the part to get unclipped before making the sudden move of removing the CRADLE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the solar array issues can be helped by making the outer edge of the solar array nearly flush with the surface you are attaching it to.

The lab module on my file was oriented with its up-righting mechanism upside down, so I fixed that with the gizmo and re-uploaded. But, I just tested, and if you do things right, all the C.R.A.D.L.E.s release their payloads without issues under kerbin gravity! I broke no panels, and in fact it went smoother than I remembered.
