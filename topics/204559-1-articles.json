When enabled, the device swaps the direction of time dilation experienced by the interior and exterior of its field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsage: Suppose you want to travel to a galaxy one million light years distant (about 10x the diameter of the Milky Way). Once you exit your starting galaxy, accelerate to 0.9999c with whatever sublight methods are available to you (shouldn\u0027t be a problem in a sufficiently crazy sci fi setting like Star Wars). Once up to speed, time dilation will mean the ship\u0027s clock will be running 70x slower than a stationary observer, and the length to travel will be\u00A0contracted to ~1.4% of its original distance. 1 million light years becomes just a paltry 14142 light years, which your ship could cover in about 14142 years of ship\u0027s time, but an external observer would see one million years pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow engage the TDI. Thanks to incredible hand-waving plot magic, you see the outer universe slow down to 1/70th of ship\u0027s time, but both your velocity and the observed length contraction are unchanged from your frame of reference. You still complete your journey in 14142 years, but the external observer experiences just 202 years! (Of course going faster helps; a TDI certified for operation at .99999c can make the trip in more like 20 years external time, so there may be\u00A0a storytelling sweet spot in there somewhere.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, you say, 14142 years is still a really long time to wait! Very true; that\u0027s why TDI units are almost never sold standalone.\u00A0After you confirm that the TDI is operating nominally, you\u0027ll want to hop into a high\u00A0reliability stasis pod\u00A0and settle in for an extremely restful intergalactic power-nap. Upon arrival, the ship revives you and you go about your adventure, and by the time you get home, your friends and family will have aged only 4 centuries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224025340\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204559\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630178739\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195602\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maximum7\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, Maximum7 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f6f6f6;color:#141414;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EThis drive I envision could ONLY be used in the intergalactic void (so it can\u2019t replace hyperdrive).
