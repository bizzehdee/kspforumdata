It is a bit easier for me, because of Procedural Wings and the B9 invisible struts. I just decrease the thickness of the wings and attach the struts then increase the thickness over them so they are hidden. One of these days I will mess around with the wing mass/strength settings in FAR, but for the most part I just reduce them down to .6 and leave them there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Threadsinger","CreatedById":100886,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T20:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much for this easy to follow tutorial; I installed FAR because I liked the idea of forcing myself to do better re-entries (I noticed I could enter atmo at full impulse and still airbrake before impact, and wanted something a little more challenging), but I\u0027ve been struggling with anything bigger than my F-14 Tomcat-inspired SSTO, which itself needs a lot of attention not to crash nose-first into the ground.
