I am looking at heading to Ike. So is it just a normal visit to Duna, and from Duna\u2019s orbit, burn to encounter Ike, hang\u00A0out there until I am done. Then return to Duna orbit and go back to Kerbin? I\u00A0assume you don\u2019t look for an Ike encounter right from the orbit of Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also know that Jool has many moons. I am not ready yet to reach them but was wondering if it is the same for them. Jool orbit, and then off to Vall or Tylo?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Rylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-26T22:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke is so big that it\u0027s actually really hard to miss it.
