For example, you might have to upgrade in order to use the larger diameter rocket parts. This could give players an incentive to get by with smaller rockets and planes to avoid paying to upgrade until more money is available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad/Runway: While the VAB and SPH may well restrict the size of vehicle that can be built, it seems likely that the pad and runway will also set limits. There might be a set limit on how much a rocket or plane is allowed to weigh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking Station: This one is open to some speculation. It seems clear from the appearance of the tier 1 tracking station that it has very limited capabilities. In principle, this should prevent you from tracking and communicating with a spacecraft beyond a certain distance from the KSC. The question is what the consequences of this might be. Causing the spacecraft to be \u0022lost\u0022 if it flies too far away seems harsh (especially for any kerbals on board). The most likely consequence is that you can still fly the spacecraft, but you can\u0027t transmit science back to the KSC beyond a certain distance. Contracts could also be affected; how does anyone know whether you planted that flag on the Mun or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmin Building: There might be a restriction on how much commitment you can choose for each policy. This creates the dilemma of whether to activate early at a low level of commitment, or wait until you can afford a higher tier admin building later on.
