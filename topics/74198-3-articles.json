The UI code (and functionality) are implemented using PartModules and I\u0027m not currently aware of another way to do it. To have a \u0022Swap XXX Kerman\u0022 function would require some sort of shared state between PartModules, which would mean another dirty hack on top a mod that is to be quite honest an ugly, if stable hack. I haven\u0027t really touched the code in about two weeks, but as it\u0027s currently implemented it uses some dirty tricks with reflection to determine how many parts are right-clicked, whether they can store crew, and if they can, it enables the \u0022Transfer XXX Kerman\u0022 actions and redraws the UIPartActionWindow, otherwise it\u0027s hidden. Unfortunately, as far as I\u0027m aware it\u0027s the only way to do it. If I recall correctly, FireSpitter uses the same trick for redrawing tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the whole point of this mod was to avoid spamming the UI as much as possible, and I\u0027d rather not add any extra windows or options that aren\u0027t entirely necessary. I\u0027m not really sure how I\u0027d fit in a \u0022Swap\u0022 button, without introducing another window, or cluttering up an already cluttered right-click menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I have another small project that I\u0027m working on (it\u0027s only in the early stages), that I suspect users of this and CLS might find interesting.
