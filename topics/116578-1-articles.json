I had a battery pack directly under the probe and it was overheating and exploding every time. I conducted a few tests and found that if I moved the battery pack further away from the probe the exploding stopped. Not sure if moving it away does actually help but in my case it did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T11:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress alt-F12-\u0026gt;Physics-\u0026gt;Thermal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower conductivity factor until the problem stops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t happen for me using Deadly Reentry, which sets conductivityFactor to 3.3, so you should be ok at least that low.

This happens the most with the short Rockomax adapter, but I\u0027ve also seen it happen with 1.25 fairing bases and cargo bays.
