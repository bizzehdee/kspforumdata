I was trying to complete them all and I\u0027ve done them all up to the docking one where I get stuck. So the part I am having issue with is I get the orbit right. Then I have to get my transfer orbit within 5km of the other ship. That\u0027s tough but I have done it before.\u00A0Now comes the real kicker. So I need to slow down so I don\u0027t miss it. It says you should start slowing down when you are under 15 km. So I have two questions 1st. How do I know when I am under 15 km. 2nd. When I do start slowing down my separation between the two they become so far apart it is impossible to catch back up to without speeding up again. I\u0027ve been looking at videos of tutorials and can\u0027t seem to find any info on helping me and I have only found 1 video of someone completing this tutorial. Please any help would be really\u00A0appreciated, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T20:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen your approaching your target, you can have your ship point towards one of the pink markers, you can use this to know where to point your screen to see if coming into view.\u00A0 With it selected as a target, its distance should be displayed automatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen in map view and focused on your own vessel, you can hover your mouse over the \u0022I\u0022 icon and itll should your max accel in m/s.\u00A0\u00A0 divide the velocity difference by that number and youll know how long your braking burn will take.

There are two \u0022views\u0022, and you can switch back and forth between them at any time. There is \u0022flight\u0022 view, and \u0022map\u0022 view. In map view, you can see all the orbits. To see a distance readout:\u00A0you click on your target, click the \u0022Set as Target\u0022 button, and then the key concept is\u00A0hovering your mouse. If you hover over the target, it shows the distance. Alternately, if you flip to flight view, it always shows the distance to any object within 30km. Within 5km or so, it also shows the name of the object -- but you have to be looking in the correct direction. You need to pan around until you spot your target. If you hover your cursor over your target, it will again show additional information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd. Once you get really really good at docking, you will be able to perform a continuous\u00A0braking in various directions all the way until you are right next to the target. As it is, as you say, you do truly want to brake all the way down to nearly 0 relative velocity. At that point, you will be farther than 5 km away (somewhere between 5 and 15km). Then you turn and point your nose at the target and accelerate towards it. Then when you get a lot closer you turn around and brake back to 0 relative velocity again. Then repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T21:56:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe docking tutorial uses a stop/start method so you\u0027re supposed to speed up again after you\u0027ve cancelled your relative speed. The idea is that you get close, kill your relative velocity by pointing at the retrograde mark in target mode (not target retrograde) ,then point to the target marker and thrust towards it (in map view you can watch the approach markers get closer in this phase). Doing this two or three times should get you a rendezvous at a relatively slow speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jacob_sword","CreatedById":174425,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T22:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221LmFsAn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1LmFsAn.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe I made things sound like I didn\u0027t know what I am doing.
