It\u0027s hard to say what the problem is without more detail, but I find there are two things that usually cause issues:\n\n(1) Piloting. Re-entry angle can make a big difference. Try either to stay slightly nose-up on a shallow descent, or right on the prograde vector with a very shallow descent. You might want to make a quicksave before you re-enter (with a hardsave on the ground, if you\u0027re playing career) and try a few different approaches.\n\n(2) Stability.

Small craft that have a lot of fuel in tanks might not be able to take off fully loaded, but once you reach distant spot, fuel will be consumed and you will be able to take off vertically too. Might not look on the first sight, but craft actually have quite low drag. Such low drag allows supersonic velocity over 1 mach with single J33 engine that was originally not even designed for supersonic flights. For that reason you can\u0027t fly long on high speeds due to overheating, but 0.80 or 0.90 mach can be sustained for longer times. Stable craft design also allow maximum time acceleration without issues. That makes this craft a good choice for science exploration early in career.
