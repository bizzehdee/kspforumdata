I\u0027m one of the members of the forum and the players of KSP 1.2.2. Before I say\u00A0about my question, I\u0027m not good at English that much..... so if I made some grammatical errors, please forgive me. Until yesterday night, I was able to enjoy KSP normally. I have had a lots of mods(almost..30...) including Space Shuttle System or Launcher Pack. But in the morning, I have gotten the problem. Well, for my numerous mods, I bought some RAM cards to increase the performance of my computer. However, just after finishing the loading, the game started to crash. I didn\u0027t edit and data file of the game so I restarted it about 5 times, but it continued to crash. So I removed all of the mods and delete KSP with Steam and I downloaded it again. But new one also started to crash, even without any mods. Then I realized that it won\u0027t be able to be fixed by myself, so I told my problem to Korean KSP Forum which a lot of Korean players have visited. I got an answer, and it said that problem must be\u00A0caused by the lack of the RAM memory. Well, those mods had been worked with 16GBs RAM memory. Even Korean forum couldn\u0027t find the solution of my problem, so I came here.
