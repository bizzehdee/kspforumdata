An external programmable driver for your joystick, or some other peripheral repeater would be required. You might be able to get away with the functions you seek by mapping the axis on repeats of certain keys and being able to use a shift button to allow a different profile...not very elegant, but may technically be doable with a great amount of patience. However, to actually map to the Axis configurations in the KSP settings, you would need the driver to do the differentiation so that Axis 0, Axis 1, and Axis 0\u002BButton are able to present themselves to KSP as Axis 0, Axis 1, and Axis 2 respectively. (for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot knowing your particular setup or joystick, etc...I can\u0027t actually say if such a beast exists. I looked into something similar to try and be able to swtich my X52 to present different axis depending on a mode setting, and eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn\u0027t worth my time to bother with it... I didn\u0027t feel like reprogramming drivers. But that\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
