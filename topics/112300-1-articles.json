I have noticed sometimes when I re-enter from planets and moons, that sometimes I don\u0027t even get the flame effect, and only get the mach effect. I dunno if that\u0027s what I want.\n\nAny help would me much appreciated.

Airbrakes are also very helpful. You basically want to get a lot of your speed off before you get below about 35km or so, as that\u0027s where things get really hot."},{"CreatedByName":"KASA Space","CreatedById":108702,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:08:41Z","Content":"So, basically do an aerobrake, then keep my angle of attack high?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:12:31Z","Content":"Yes, and airbrakes can help as they produce a lot of drag, if they are on top of your craft the drag can help keep your nose up.\n\nIf I\u0027m too high I\u0027ll sometimes roll inverted and pull up, so Kerbin is \u0022above\u0022 me, this helps push me lower into the atmosphere so I lose speed more quickly."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:20:41Z","Content":"Keeping the AoA high \\*is\\* the aerobrake.
