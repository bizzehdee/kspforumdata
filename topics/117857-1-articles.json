This works much better than just cranking up gamma."},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:12:55Z","Content":"Cranking up gamma will make your game look awful.\n\n[PlanetShine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96497-0-25-1-0-2-PlanetShine-v0-2-3-1) is what you need.

You can either turn the vacuum ambient light up so that you can easily see your vessel on the dark side of a planet, or turn it down to near-zero for more realistic space travel."}]}
