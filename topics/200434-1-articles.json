Ever since Take Two bought KSP ownership I though KSP would boom in the near future.\u00A0 Take Two is leading Kerbals to popularity. There is a huge amount of prosperity and greatness that can be accomplished with the game. It has great potential.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T20:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts already popular-ish. KSP has a large following, though the forums may be small, and the fact that KSP2 is the 7th\u00A0most wish listed game on steam, and the growing media attention, means we will most likely gain in numbers after KSP2 is released. Especially if it is as good as the devs say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-18T12:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with everything said above.
