Download count is probably the most reliable of the three to determine if it\u0027s popular so needs a good weight. \u00A0vote_count (points) should I think be a more significant value, but KX users seem to be very stingy with upvoting craft! So that\u0027s why I\u0027m bumping that value up by 4. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr the otherway I could look at it is to divide download_count by view_count and then add on vote_count, something like:\u00A0\u0022crafts.download_count\u00A0/ (crafts.view_count\u002B1)\u00A0\u002B crafts.vote_count*4\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n(the \u002B1 on view_count is just to avoid a divide by zero error). \u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, that may have been altered before reaching the production server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-23T20:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the slow reply!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there\u0027s points and popularity.\u00A0 Points are pretty straightforward and linear, popularity is a bit...squiggly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou get a point for each craft uploaded and a point for each upvote a craft gets.
