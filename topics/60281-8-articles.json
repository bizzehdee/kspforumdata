All that this means is that every time it sees the word, it just replaces it with the specific value that you gave. Additionally, unlike calling \u0022int variable = value\u0022, this value cannot be changed within the program (cannot do value = value \u002B 1 or anything). That is why the common notation for these types of variables is to put them in all caps. Arduino actually already has some of these built-in but that you never noticed.

It looks like metal but is much cheaper and lighter. It is really easy to work with, you just score throught the outer metal layers with a craft knife then bend and snap through the plastic. The only tools I use are a craft knife and a drill. For the labels I make my own water-slide transfers using transfer paper (they work like the decals you get in a model kit). The type of transfer paper I use is designed for ceramics so is meant to be baked in an oven to help fix/melt it onto the surface...
