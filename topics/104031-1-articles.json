Probably some tremors, but not such a dramatic terraforming event.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The real \u0022telegraph pole\u0022 would just bury itself deep in the ground, (...)\n\nWell, depends how you define \u0022really deep\u0022. As Isaac Newton already showed, a typical impactor can embed itself no deeper into the target than its own length, times the difference in densities.\n\nNow, tungsten has one of the highest densities recorded among the elements (but not the highest). It is about 8 times more dense then concrete, or 7 times more dense than solid rock (on average, because there are even more variants of concrete than there are of rock). So it could be argued that a \u0022rod of god\u0022 about 3 meters in length\\* would bury no deeper than maybe 22 meters. The rod is also not a completely blunt impactor, but rather tapered specifically for penetration, so it\u0027ll go deeper than the first approximation suggests... but I don\u0027t know how much deeper. Maybe 10 to 12 times its own length. So about 35 meters at most.\n\nStill makes it a useful bunker buster, but doesn\u0027t really carry it far below the surface, in absolute terms. Keep in mind: the rod is going to come down at an angle. A relatively flat angle. Certainly nowhere near vertically down. This is an object on a very fast suborbital trajectory that only juuuust grazes the surface where it is meant to hit (because that maximizes the speed and therefore the impact energy). So all that impact depth is going to go largely *sideways*. For a very good visualization - Scott Manley made a video on it where he tries to hit KSC with such an impactor. Spoiler: it\u0027s very difficult to pull off.\n\nAssuming it hits nothing but solid ground on its way down, the energy released will go largely upwards, because that\u0027s the path of least resistance. I expect that the effect would not be unlike seeing a blurry flash of light lance down from the heavens, which impacted in a brief, extremely bright event that disappeared in the blink of an eye as it burrows in. But within that same blink of an eye you\u0027d get a fountain of superheated rock getting thrown upwards - perhaps not unlike the water spray caused by a speeding object hitting the ocean at a flat angle and being suddenly slowerd down. It would be a single blast event, lasting a second at most. The resulting crater would be as \u0022deep\u0022 as the projectile burrowed, if slanted very much sideways, and fairly sharply cone-shaped. The top section would likely be missing, though, so it might be more like a trench. Though that (and the crater size) depends on the surface material and the way it breaks up under stress. The blast wave would seriously damage surrounding buildings (and shatter all windows in a fairly large radius) but not collapse them.\n\nAssuming the impactor hits something on its way down that it can release its energy into, then it will do so. For example, a bunker, if hit by such a projectile, will take a large portion of the impact energy because it\u0027s so conveniently empty (from the energy\u0027s point of view). An underground cavern system would be affected disastrously, likely leading to widespread collapse of the entire system. Such a thing could lead to the whole ground above suddenly falling a bit, or caving in in places, over an area much larger than the impact crater. This would naturally collapse most large buildings that relied on this ground for structural stability. If you assume that the ground below Westminster is sort of swiss cheese like (maye they have more catacombs than Paris? I dunno), then you could potentially get an effect somewhat similar to what is portrayed in the movie. But on the grand average, it seems like a rather contrived scenario and the single-blast, trench digging variant seems more likely. And the impact angle is wrong in every case.\n\n\\* completely made up number for illustration purposes\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T10:54:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**\n  \nTypos, typos everywhere!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T10:56:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At the speeds you are quoting, it\u0027d be closer to 70T.

Considering how fast the energy is deposited on the ground, a significant fraction must be spent creating a thermal flash, not to mention the column of superheated plasma the warhead leaves travelling at hypersonic speed in the low atmosphere. Hell, the shockwaves of the atmospheric portions of the flight will shatter some windows on the way to the target.\n\nBut on the other hand, a few kiloricks can\u0027t blow up London. These things have yields comparable with conventional explosives, after all. So we can conclude: a lot less rumble, but slightly more flashy.\n\nRune.
