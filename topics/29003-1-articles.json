Your first (and currently the only) job is to implement the President\u0027s Vision of \u0022establishing the first continuously-crewed outpost on the surface of Duna\u0022 by the end of Day 500. And on your first meeting with the Deputy Administrator for Rocketry, you have been informed that for maximum production \u0026amp; launch efficiency, all your space launches would use the exact same type of launch vehicle (of your choice). Much to your relieve, Jeb is excluded from the mission planning process this time, so you can actually design the missions while considering factors such as efficiency, scientific value, safety \u0026amp; robustness, rather than things Jeb care about, e.g., \u0022really fast\u0022, \u0022massive\u0022 \u0026amp; \u0022huge explosions\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ERationale\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike most challenges in which you build a single craft or fly a single mission, this one asks you to build multiple types of spacecrafts, design an efficient, robust and sustainable mission architecture, and (optionally) execute your own, long term mission. You\u0027ll have unlimited access to all stock parts and mods of your liking, but will be constrained by availability of launch vehicles, planetary transfer windows, support of your crew during long missions, plus a few additional rules considered by real-life crewed mission architects. The challenge is inspired by the various manned Mars mission designs I read in the last few months, e.g., NASA\u0027s Mars DRA3 \u0026amp; DRA5, Austere Human Mission to Mars, Mars Direct, Mars to Stay, Mars for Less \u0026amp; Ready for Mars, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EBasic Requirement\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo qualify as an entry, you must describe a plan to land a minimal crew of 4 Kerbals on Duna before Day 500, and that they and their replacement crews will keep your Duna outpost(s) continuously occupied. Post pictures and brief descriptions of your (single) launch vehicle, each type of your spacecrafts \u0026amp; payloads as they reach LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit), Duna transfer burn of any docked spacecrafts, Duna surface modules during their EDL (entry, descent \u0026amp; landing), and your Duna outpost at various stages of completion. You\u0027ll also post a schedule/plan of your launches \u0026amp; other mission components until day 500 (and optionally until Day 1000). Your entry should also follow the rules below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ERules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A single type of launch vehicle is used for all launches from Kerbin. We call the maximum mass of inert payload it can send to your circular Low Kerbin Parking Orbit (or 75km if you don\u0027t use Kerbin parking orbit) the launch vehicle\u0027s Nominal Capacity. Remains of your launch vehicle that got into orbit is not considered payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Rockets need time to build \u0026amp; prepare for launch, and more powerful rockets tend to take more time. Thus the the minimal interval between any two launches is the rocket\u0027s Nominal Capacity * 2 Days. For example my R140 \u0022Bob\u0022 rocket can lift 17.5 tons max to 75km LKO, so every two launches must be at least 17.5 * 2 = 35 days apart. Note that your actual payload CAN be heavier than the rockets Nominal Capacity if it has its own propulsion for the LKO circularization burn (e.g. the launch vehicle should at least be able to put the payload above 70km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ADDED 06/02]- Reusable launch vehicle bonus, as suggested by Andellmere \u0026amp; NeilC: If spent stages which can be safely recovered (e.g. no part destroyed on landing / splashdown) originally contained more than 50% of launch vehicle\u0027s lift-off weight, your launch interval will be 1.5 times (rather than 2 times) Nominal Capacity. Obviously if parts experience high re-entry heat (e.g. has visible re-entry effects) it is considered burnt in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You already have one launch vehicle built and is ready to launch on Day 10 (no matter how powerful your it is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Crew shuttle: we assume your space agency has already developed a cheap \u0026amp; reliable method to shuttle crews between KSC and LKO, for example SSTO space-plane, \u0022space cannon\u0022, etc. Thus any mission with the sole purpose of transferring crew between KSC and LKO is considered \u0022free\u0022 and are not restricted by Rule 1, 2 \u0026amp; 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELong-term Crewed Missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Any space or Duna surface mission longer than ~10 days are considered long-term missions. For example, transfers between KSC \u0026amp; LKO and betwen Duna surface \u0026amp; LDO, orbital rendezvous \u0026amp; docking, and short drives around Duna outposts are generally short, while flights between Kerbin \u0026amp; Duna, stays in Duna surface habitats \u0026amp; surface expeditions are long term missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Any long-term crewed mission must provide long-term hab space, which is modeled as twice the crew capacity of pods \u0026amp; cockpits. For example, while a Hitchhiker Pod can holds 4 Kerbals for short missions, it can only provide long-term hab space for 2; 3-man and 2-man pods can only hold 1 for long missions and the 1-man pods can\u0027t be used as long-term hab space. All long term missions must be done by at least 2 kerbals. Rescue / contingency missions may ignore this rule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. While every pod / cockpit contains enough supply for short missions, long-term crewed missions require additional life support supplies. Every Kerbal consumes 1 unit of supply each day, and with stock parts you can designate any (rocket, RCS \u0026amp; jet) fuel tank as supply storage, which carries units of supply equal to its fuel capacity. For example the 1.125 ton FL-T200 tank can carry 90 units of supply, while the 0.55 ton FL-R25 tank carries 100 units - clearly RCS \u0026amp; jet fuel tanks are better for this purpose. Tanks designated as supply storage cannot have its contents consumed as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERe-entry \u0026amp; Aerocapture\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Spacecrafts must have some form of \u0022heat shield\u0022 to survive re-entry or aerocapture that generated Re-entry Effects visuals. \u0022Heat shield\u0022 are otherwise useless parts which prevent the Re-entry Effect \u0022hot-plasma\u0022 from hitting other parts of your spacecraft. Mk1 \u0026amp; Mk1-2 pods, all cockpits, Mk2 \u0026amp; Mk3 fuselage and fuselage adapters are considered safe from re-entry heat due to their shapes or visible TPS tiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENuclear (NERVA) Engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. KSC was given greenlight to use NERVA engines under the condition that they cannot be fired in Kerbin \u0026amp; Duna atmosphere, and they cannot be disposed by burning up in Kerbin \u0026amp; Duna atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.

Quantum Struts \u0026amp; similar mods is strongly discouraged because building non-wobbly spacecrafts with smart structural designs is part of the challenge.

You\u0027ll receive an Early Missions score (Day 1 until Day 500), and Sustained Missions Score (Day 1 to Day 1000). For example if until Day 500 you had 2 kerbals each spending 300 days on Duna, your Early Missions Value will be 600.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Efficiency: this is defined as your Mission Value divided by Nominal Initial Mass to LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit), where the Nominal Initial Mass to LKO is your launch vehicle\u0027s Nominal Payload Capacity (see Rule 1) times total number of launches.

Duna outpost modules \u0026amp; supplies are docked in LKO with NERVA-powered Inter-Planetary Tugs (IPT) for Duna transfer at each Hohmann transfer window. After delivering payloads to low Duna orbit, the interplanetary tugs will return to Kerbin orbit for refuel and reuse. SSTO space-planes will shuttle the 4 Kerbals of each mission to and from Duna Transfer Habitat (DTH) in LKO, where they will stay during their trips to and from Duna. The DTH will also be refueled \u0026amp; resupplied in LKO for reuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn each of the initial two missions Kerbals dock their Transfer Habitat with the 2 Descent \u0026amp; Expedition Vehicles (DEV) in Duna orbit, and rides them for Duna descent. The DEVs would then provide long range surface mobility and the can tug other landed modules to the outpost Main Site \u0026amp; Expedition Sites. Each of 2 missions would also deliver to Duna surface 3 Mobile Surface Habitat (MSH) modules, 2 of which are long-term hab spaces and the other configured primarily as lab space. Thus the initial two missions would complete the construction of von Kerman Duna Outpost infrastructure, consisting of 4 DEVs and 6 MSH. In each subsequent crewed mission, Kerbals would instead descent in a single Descent Hab and wait for the their friends already on Duna to tug it (with DEVs) to the outpost. Each of these later missions would also deliver a Science \u0026amp; Service Payload (SSP), which will vary in content from to mission. Every mission would deliver (more than) enough supply for the 4 Kerbals during their 370 surface stay, as well as a Ascent Vehicle (AVS) in which the Kerbal would ascent to Duna orbit and dock with the DTH for their trip home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ECommon Components:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E: the R140 \u0022Bob\u0022 expandable launch vehicle is a simple rocket made up with a single 2.5m core stage and 4x1.25m strap on boosters.

It has a large pressurized crew cabin for 3 Kerbals (including long-term hab space for 1) and a large science, service, supply (max 240 units) \u0026amp; storage compartment to support long surface expeditions. When towing Mobile Surface Habitats \u0026amp; additional supplies, it permits almost unlimited range and endurance. Driving performance is excellent, with its 6 wheels in a suspended chassis providing great all-terrain performance - turning is stable at speed up to 30m/s and on steep slopes. It can tow up to 3 Mobile Surface Habitats while maintaining satisfactory speed \u0026amp; maneuverability. With thermal tiles on its underside, it is used as the Duna descent vehicle for Kerbals in the first two missions. It is both lightweight enough for 2 to bundled together for launch by one R140 (two small rocket engines on the mounting truss are used for LKO circalization burn) , and sturdy enough for for launch without payload fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PXYMNbx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PXYMNbx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PXYMNbx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDTH - Duna Transfer Habitat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals goes to Duna and return to Kerbin in Duna Transfer Habitats. It\u0027s a utilitarian design consisting of long-term hab space for 4 Kerbals, a storage compartment containing 750 units of supplies, and a propulsion section with 2 NERVA engines and a Rockmax X200-8 fuel tank. When docked with either a Duna Departure Package or a Departure \u0026amp; Descent Habitat, it will have ~2000m/s deltaV left after arriving in Duna orbit when only ~700 is needed for Kerbin return with Hohmann transfer. This redundant deltaV allows off-window, high speed emergency departures from Duna, and will usually still have enough deltaV to shed excessive speed in high energy returns, to ensure Kerbin aerocapture heat is within safe limit. 3 DTHs are built for the program which are refueled and reused after their return to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lM4CW3a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lM4CW3a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lM4CW3a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIPT - Inter-Planetary Tug\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Interplanetary Tug share the same NERVA propulsion section as the Duna Transfer Habitat.

I\u0027d be happy to hear your opinion on how I can improve these in my design or how your design does better in these aspects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The launch schedule in the first 800 days are extremely tight, thus any launch failure would need large changes in the plan to meet the basic mission requirement. And given the large number of launches in this plan, a failure is quite possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Many launched components spend a lot of time in orbit waiting for the launch window. This is really bad for fuel, because I\u0027m using Nuclear Thermal Rocket engines, and in this universe liquid hydrogen is the ideal fuel for NTR, but is really difficult to store for long periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Commonality \u0026amp; modularity is one of my design goals, but I think it could be done better. For example the Duna Departure Package is built \u0026amp; launched only once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few other things to think about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Since the challenge doesn\u0027t limit mods, it would be interesting to see if any design uses ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), such the getting fuel with the Kethane mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. An important restriction I placed on my payloads (except the DEVs) is that they must all fit in the KW Rocketry 2.5m Expanded Payload Fairing. That\u0027s not required by the challenge (there is no payload fairing in stock), but if you aim for a more \u0022realistic\u0022 entry, consider limit your payload to a \u0022reasonable\u0022 diameter, for example no wider than the diameter of 3 orange-tanks. Again that\u0027s not a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How would your design permit exploration of multiple locations? How do you provide access to both equatorial areas and polar areas? How do you explore really steep valleys, craters and mountains? In my design a capable (in terms of range \u0026amp; rough terrain capability) vehicle is used to tow mobile habs during expeditions, but what about say a \u0022hopping\u0022 capable lander / hab or other concepts? If your design can explore multiple distant locations, it\u0027s fair to award it high \u0022base mobility\u0022 / \u0022crew mobility\u0022 points even if you don\u0027t use traditional rovers concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to post your ideas or progress here even if your entry is not ready yet!

I see why you\u0027ve done that and I agree with the premise, but I think in its current form it\u0027s pretty much enforcing designs that look a lot like yours. The problem is we only have 39d before we need to go to Duna the first time - kinda unrealistically short, IMHO, but it\u0027s out of our control. To get 2 launches to Duna in the first window, the lifter payload must be 19t or less - roughly the size of your design. Going smaller you have trouble fitting in all the hab space and supplies you need for transfer in a single vehicle, and/or fitting just the nuke engines you need for IPT- I\u0027m sure you ran into this. You could build a huge 80\u002Bton lifter and launch your whole first flight in one go... but then you\u0027d have to wait half a year for your next launch, which I think is unrealistic. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Kerbin to Duna transfer window is on Day 55, so you actually have 45 days for the second launch, e.g. two 22.5 ton payloads can be launched before the first Duna transfer window. And another way to think about this is to just ignore the first window and plan according to the Day 283 window. Also, the \u0022window\u0022 is just the time for a optimal Hohmann transfer - you can launch off-window if you\u0027re willing to pay the extra deltaV. Higher energy transfers may also make the transfer time quite a bit shorter. IRL the high arrival speed from such transfers may make aerocapture / direct re-entry more violent, and you\u0027re definitely encouraged to consider propulsively shedding some speed before such aerocapture / re-entry, especially for the Kerbin return, but that\u0027s not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso earthly heavy lifters do have very low launch rate - the SLS for example has a planned launched rate of 1 per year, Saturn V launched about twice per year at the peak of Apollo program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeilC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeilC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan you maybe set this launch delay based on lifter characteristics instead of payload characteristics? Number of parts or stages or engines in the lifter, perhaps? Maybe get really advanced with it and define \u0022modules\u0022, so if you use 8 identical asparagus stages with 15 parts each, that could be 15 days (or 7.5? Need to balance) spent building those boosters - but it\u0027s in parallel! So if my central sustainer was 20 parts, it would be the longest-lead item and define my launch delay - I could add 5 parts to the asparagi without impacting launch times, and could only benefit from removing 5 from the sustainer.\u003Cp\u003EThat way we could design a particularly efficient lifter (by whatever metric) geared to quick launches, instead of having to set our single payload size based on only having 39 days from \u0022go\u0022 to duna window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that launch rate based purely on LKO capability may be somewhat arbitrary, but that one is easiest I can think of while being able to more or less correlating to launch rate of rockets in real life.

Launch, delivery, and landing of a base takes one launch, and the base can technically carry two crew while in transit (though it feels kinda cheaty to do it that way). I was actually planning on having all the crews stay on until they take off and just flying the two ships back simultaneously (or as closely as possible), so I can have up to 8 kerbals on Duna if I carry out the full Nominal plan.

The dV requirement isn\u0027t a big deal for me: the lander/ ascent vehicle has something along the lines of twice the dV needed to ascend and a Launch Escape Mechanism (I\u0027m really screwed if I need it however) and the ship should have at least 1.2x the minimal dV to get to Duna and back, even if I lug the lander/ ascent vehicle there one way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to get all the pictures and things tomorrow, most likely.
