I figured that I could get it done - only to see that it was a rover repair contract. To do these contracts, you need to bring along some rover wheels - which I did not. However, I have an abundant supply of various parts, mostly docking ports, and a lander with a docking port on the top and bottom. As I only need to move the rover, would it be possible to use my lander to pick up the wheel-less rover and haul it over to the destination zone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, how else could I use my current vessels at Minmus to get the contract done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have: 1x ITV (large modular ship, low on fuel but has enough for at least 3 landings.Lots of docking ports, but definitely not landable. 1x Cheetah. Inclined Minmus orbit.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2x Return Pod (2 seater CSM with 1.4 km/s, I need both of them to return my crew to Kerbin at the end of the mission. Dockings port on the top and bottom, possibly landable. 4x Ant. Docked to ITV.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1x Lander (docking ports on top and bottom, 3 crew science lander. Has some cargo space but more parts can be slapped on the sides. 2x Spark.
