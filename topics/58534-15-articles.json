The problem is that the model requires a set of three transforms (in addition to the ones it currently has), one for each of the docking ports that says which way each actually points. Each port actually requires two transforms for proper operation. For a docking port whose front is aligned with the model\u0027s forward vector, it is possible to get by with a single transform and the game just uses the part\u0027s forward vector. To further elaborate, each port requires a dockingNode and a controlNode. The dockingNode uses its Z axis to define the port\u0027s forward vector and the controlNode uses its Y axis to define the port\u0027s forward vector. (which is really lame because if you\u0027re not aware of it or if you forget for an instance then you can mess up your docking port model.
