I have never developed a mod for KSP before. I work in Information Technology and have some experience with programing.

However as mentioned before, Mechjeb fills the role quite well as it will create maneuver nodes without executing them, if that is what the player prefers. It would be simpler to adjust Mechjeb\u0027s functionality than the develop a separate plugin. A MM patch to limit Mechjeb\u0027s functions to only Maneuver Node calculations might be more fitting for people who prefer manual execution of maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maximillian","CreatedById":114230,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T20:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI realize that marking it as a Request may have been the incorrect thing to do.
