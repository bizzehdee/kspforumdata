Nowadays we need fairings and heatshields and they\u0027re inconveniently located in the airplane section of the tree instead of with the other rocket parts. This means you could well end up with the parts needed to make a simple airplane whether you really want them or not, perhaps even early enough in the game where Kerbin biomes are still worth doing a few of. So you can then make a wingless airplane (aka jet rover) and get alll the biomes at KSC (there are nearly 30 of them, for each building, antenna, tank farm, monument, flagpole, etc.) And maybe make a bit of money on low-altitude survey contracts close to KSC. But that\u0027s about the limit of their usefulness in the early-mid game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:27:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Yellow Dart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Yellow Dart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe can get thermometer, mystery goo, and materials study, including returning it for full value if he so chooses, for high and low space around the Mun, Minmus, and high for the Sun without even mentioning interplanetary.
