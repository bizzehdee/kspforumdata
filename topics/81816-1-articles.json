Its autowarp function will avoid you whizzing past maneuver nodes as you missed the timer. It also has loads of data to show you, the rendezvous planner tells you the precise inclination error, how far away you are etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1a: Use MechJeb as a planning tool. Its maneuver planner is a simply way of getting it to create the perfect node in the perfect place to get that intercept. You can still do the burn manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: Use all of MechJeb\u0027s tools. It can plot and pilot. This essentially removes the piloting aspects from the game so that the user can concentrate on Mission Planning and Craft Design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other questions all depend on where you want to go and what you want to do when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have not sent an unmanned mission to orbit Ike, Duna or Eve yet then these may be the right mission to start with. If you want to put a man on Tylo then it is a completely different mission profile.

You can design craft that can get there in one launch but it takes a bit of work(even more difficult if you want to go to the outer planets). Try launching a crew module followed by a drive module. A third launch may be necessary to fuel the drive module. As for mechjeb, I use it to set simple things, like circularize nodes(because lazy).

Asparagus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally depends on the size of the payload vs your so-far-unlocked rocket parts vs whether you\u0027re using FAR or NEAR vs whether you consider it an exploit of the game system.

Launching the mission payload and its transfer stage as 1 piece requires a bigger lifter than doing them separately, but doing them separately requires 2 launches, a rendezvou, a docking, and having figured out beforehand if the tug has sufficient delta-V to push the payload (and acceptable TWR to make it not painfully slow on the transfer burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. MJ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely, at least the delta-V display to make sure your rocket (and its various parts and components) all have sufficient delta-V and TWR for their intended jobs. Then at you can do the flying yourself or let MJ do some of it. If it turns out I have transfer burns longer than a couple of minutes, I let MJ do them while I got get another beer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

You can use Kerbal Alarm Clock to check when the transfer windows are coming and play with the nodes yourself. Duna and Eve aren\u0027t hard to reach, since you don\u0027t really have to worry about inclination (say, unlike Dres). And you\u0027ll begin to learn to do it. That\u0027s not to say not to use MJ - I use it a lot. But it\u0027s good to know how to do it yourself, specially for the easier transfers. If you want to keep your first attempts simpler and you aren\u0027t confident with orbital rendezvous, you can go to Eve or Duna on your upper stage. Use aerospikes, the Poodle or the KR-2L, all of which have great ISP for chemical rockets without the longer burn times of the 909.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re planning your injection burns with weeks in advance, it\u0027s also a good idea to check the manouver nodes a day or two before it\u0027s time to burn, just in case adjustments have to be made. Once you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you should check your ship\u0027s course. You will need to make small correction burns along the way - even if your maneuver node was perfectly set up, minor differences when burning (as well as the longer burn times required) mean a lot of difference at your destination. You should try to keep your periapsis inside the planet\u0027s atmosphere and avoid inclination changes when you get captured. You\u0027re still going to need to fine tune your Pe once you enter your destination SOI. And MJ\u0027s landing guidance has a very cool aerobrake calculator which will let you know at which altitude you need your Pe. At that point, you may need to make your corrections with monopropellant, since the adjustments can be below 1-2 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
