So i was wondering how to contact squad for a refund if they don\u0027t have a patch update scheduled. The reason this is in suggestions and development discussion is because I\u0027m suggesting they develop the console edition further.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-31T16:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you check out the news section and read up on the weekly updates, you\u0027d see the new console version is coming along nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Moving on\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cb\u003EKerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition\u003C/b\u003E, we are happy to share with you that\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cb\u003Ethe console builds have entered the certification process\u003C/b\u003E, which is one of the last steps for our release on consoles next month.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWe also noticed questions\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eregarding the compatibility of save files between the\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EEnhanced Edition\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eand the previous version of KSP on consoles\u003C/b\u003E, so to avoid further confusion, we want to remind you that\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EKSP Enhanced Edition\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ehas been built form the ground up - that is - a brand new version, a different developer and, naturally, new code. On the downside, this also means that the save files from the previous version will no longer be compatible with\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EEnhanced Edition, but anyone who had previously bought KSP on consoles will still be able to download and play it, despite it no longer being available to purchase in the stores.
