Dunno why, just felt like something fun to do.

I\u0027m really speaking visually. We know Orion does\u0027nt have a toilet. SO, if you want a long duration mission with it, there needs to be some kind of module docked.

It provides essential facilities for long duration Orion missions, and I do mean \u003Cem\u003Efacilities \u003C/em\u003E (toilet). You can imagine that with the asteroid grabbing part, it\u0027s a step in the right direction for asteroid exploration. Asteroid Redirect, however is not a path we will explore with Chaka. We feel that mission profile is a dead end and will get canceled in favor of something else, such as long duration stays in an \u0022exploration habitat\u0022... a deep space mini station similar to what you have there.\u003Cp\u003EI was struggling with it\u0027s mass and that led to the revised and smaller version a few pages back with the Delta K upper stage. Then, that led to adding it to a lander to create Minmus Express, which I think is the ideal mission balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again I am guilty of not providing good documentation with the craft files, and I promise to focus on that for the next update, which should be ready soon assuming we get an update for \u003Cstrong\u003Eprocedural fairings which are broken in .90\u003C/strong\u003E - if it\u0027s already been updated as I type this since I checked last night, then great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003EAnother fun idea is to assemble a two piece MTV, jus the drive section and habitat, then delete either the heatshield on the lander or the entire lander depending on your mission profile.

B9 has an \u0022info drive\u0022 thingy for having in game documentations that can be accessed at any point before or during flight.
