I forgot I still had this open. Flavor text requests haven\u0027t been responded to in a while, and this service is pretty much on hold at the moment due to my constant preoccupation with that \u0022real life\u0022 thing. December looks pretty good, though, so if you still have something you want me to look at, poke me at the end of the month. Sorry for going dark on you all. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E --\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed a number of very nice mods lately which, despite adding great content, are lacking when it comes to in-game descriptions and documentation for their new additions. This is completely understandable, of course - Maybe English is not the native language of the modder, or maybe they just don\u0027t like writing sentences nearly as much as they like writing code. As I said, I don\u0027t hold anyone in lower esteem for not writing descriptions for their mod parts, but I do think that mods with complete and in-character descriptions fit into the game a lot better than ones that do not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, I\u0027m hereby offering my services as your on-call flavor text writer. Do you have a mod full of fancy new parts, planets, and features, but not know where to start on the documentation?

I might take longer to see it, but if you want it to be public for whatever reason, that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Find me on IRC. I\u0027m on #KSPOfficial on EsperNet rather a lot these days, so you\u0027ll probably be able to find me there if you want to talk in real-time about something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn-game descriptions, particularly part descriptions, are mainly there to tell the player how to use the thing in question. In addition to that, the best descriptions are often written \u0027in-character,\u0027 or at least, \u0027in-universe,\u0027 often written in the tone of someone who lives in the Kerbal universe explaining it to you. In the case of the stock parts\u0027 descriptions written by Squad, these are usually rather humorous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can write your documentation in whatever style or character you need. I\u0027m probably best at the more humorous and in-character ones, but I can also cut to the chase and write simple, out-of-character documentation to maximize clarity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIn general, I\u0027ll need the following from you before I can write anything good\u003C/strong\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EA good idea of what I\u0027m writing about.\u003C/span\u003E If the mod is already released, great - just link me to it and tell me what you want documented, and I\u0027ll play around with it and get right back to you. If your mod is in some stage of earlier development, give me what you can - videos, screenshots, unfinished models, sketches, or even textual descriptions - I\u0027ll do my best with whatever you can give me. For tutorials, it would probably be best if you gave me a functional copy of your mod to mess with, but I can still try to make do with whatever. However, I can\u0027t guarantee that you\u0027ll get what you\u0027re looking for if you don\u0027t give me much information to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe tone you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/span\u003E If you don\u0027t specify, I\u0027ll just give your parts and planets stock-similar in-character descriptions, and tutorials in simple out-of-character terms.

Expedient delivery is not something that I can necessarily guarantee, but if business is as slow as I expect it to be, this shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFAQ:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECan I get a sample of your writing?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you can check the bottom of this post, under \u0022contributed projects,\u0022 for everything I\u0027ve written for projects so far. Content for each mod will be included in spoiler tags for your perusal. Those spoilers will be long; you\u0027ve been warned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYour writing sucks! I can totally do better!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat! I never claimed to be better at it than you or anyone else. I just happen to really like doing it, particularly in this context, which is why I\u0027m offering my services. If you think you can do better, you probably can, and you don\u0027t need me at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s this, you just want to write the descriptions for mods and not have to bother with the code/models/other hard work?

For part and planet descriptions, I\u0027ll probably be able to do as many as you can give me - they\u0027re only a few sentences each anyway. If you have a very big documentation project that needs a lot of writing - well, first of all, I\u0027d be flattered if you wanted little old \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E to handle that - then we might run into problems depending on how much time I can devote away from my real-world life to work on it. Since most mod projects involve a lot of modelling, texturing, and coding, and not a lot of flavor-text writing, I don\u0027t expect to see very many insurmountably-large goals tossed my way. Tutorials and other in-depth documentation will take the longest, since they\u0027ll necessarily involve some actual gameplay, so just be aware of that before you ask me to make you a whole MechJeb manual from the beginning. I\u0027m not saying I won\u0027t do that, just that it could take me a considerable amount of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are you currently working on?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing at the moment.

While I do appreciate contributor\u0027s credit, I don\u0027t require it. It might annoy me a little if you keep our interaction totally secret and claim to have written the stuff you got from me yourself, but I won\u0027t raise a fuss.

It features an integrated heat shield, a limited reaction control system, four seats, and plenty of cabinets for snacks - so far, our only real problem with this pod has been convincing the crew to come back out at the end of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--ESV Core Module--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: A little self-contained cargo craft for when you need to deliver fuel and supplies to your outposts in space. Engines, RCS, and other fiddly bits sold separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Space Launch System Fairing Base/Instrument Unit--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Using an old hubcap we found lying around in the parking lot, someone\u0027s phone, and some spare fairings, we managed to make a nice little rocket topper to provide shielding and control to mid-sized payloads. Warranty not included, may void warranty of other parts if used on the same vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno V Core Stage (3.75m)--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Our Health and Safety committee told us that we\u0027d reached the safe limit on fuel tank size long ago, sometime before the Jumbo-64 came into mass-production. They were pretty irate when we showed them the first production model of this tank - some called it \u0022absurd,\u0022 others said it was \u0022patently ludicrous,\u0022 and one even felt strongly enough to name it \u0022an obelisk to the flaming death gods.\u0022 Whatever you choose to call it, it can\u0027t be denied that a tank this size provides a fantastic amount of up-going juice for those big heavy launch vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Space Launch System Extender Tank--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The Space Launch System core stage is a truly colossal piece of rocketry. However, if it\u0027s still too small for you, our engineers have thoughtfully included an expandability option to make it as tall and heavy as you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Ares I--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The Ares I is a good little engine, best suited for upper stages and light booster stages. We\u0027re told it also makes a great heatshield, but the manufacturers have insisted that using it as one is not recommended or covered under warranty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Ares II--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: With a slightly heavier and more robust nozzle, the Ares II can put out a bit more thrust than its predecessor, and has thus been deemed a huge success by everyone involved. Despite the sturdier design, the manufacturer emphasizes that this engine is NOT a bell and should NOT be rung to celebrate important design or construction milestones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotes: The Ares engines don\u0027t really look finished to me (they\u0027re pretty similar in power and function, and seem like they\u0027re going to be a little weak for first-stage 3.75m engines) so their descriptions aren\u0027t as informed as I\u0027d like them to be. Feel free to come back and have me make whatever changes you require.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Auriga BPC--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: This Booster-equipped Protective Cover is an all-in-one safety kit. Not only does it provide a nice solid shield against the atmosphere on the way up, but it also comes with a great big rocket thing on top to yank a crewed Auriga pod clear of an exploding launch vehicle. Requests that this part be omitted from vehicle designs because it \u0022blocks the view\u0022 are hereby preemptively denied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Auriga Service Module--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The Auriga pod went over great with space programs everywhere, but the inevitable complaints rolled in immediately: \u0022It doesn\u0027t have engines!\u0022 they said. \u0022It\u0027s RCS isn\u0027t balanced!\u0022 \u0022How are we supposed to power it?\u0022 Accordingly, the manufacturer quickly released this Service Module expansion to address those problems, converting the Auriga capsule into a full-featured and capable mini-spacecraft. Now everyone\u0027s complaining that they split the Auriga\u0027s command and service modules into two separate products just to make more money, but you can\u0027t please everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Circe Upper Stage--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: A nifty self-contained insertion stage designed to finish moving payloads into the target orbit. Crews are warned that although this engine may appear shiny and glowy right after use, direct contact with its metal surfaces is likely to burn through spacesuit gloves very quickly and is to be avoided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hephaestus Upper Stage--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: All-in-one stages are all the rage these days, so we made sure to get lots of variety to choose from in the latest shipment. The Hephaestus stage is a great choice for tossing payloads towards geostationary orbit, but the manufacturer warns that this part is pretty small and you\u0027ll probably want something bulkier if you\u0027re shifting something really big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hyacinthus IX--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Intended as the bottom stage for the acclaimed Hestia launch vehicle, the Hyacinthus IX has been described as a \u0022very solid booster\u0022 by our engineers. We aren\u0027t sure if they were talking about the fuel or the reliability characteristics, but the manufacturer says that statement can be applied to both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hyacinthus X--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: \u0022Not enough thrust\u0022 is the most commonly-cited problem with new launch vehicles. Fortunately, the folks in the Juno Project saw that coming, and provided us with this excellent radial-attachable booster to augment the central stack. The Hyacinthus X has been well liked among our engineering staff - not just because it\u0027s powerful, but also because it\u0027s cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hyacinthus XX--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: After much deliberation, it was decided that a slightly smaller version of the Hyacinthus IX was in order for the Hestia launch vehicle\u0027s second stage. It makes the first stage a little less sluggish getting off the pad, and also, according to one interviewed engineer, \u0022makes it look spiffier.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Interrim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Big rockets are great and all, but when it comes to the largest ones available, one starts to expect a little more than just \u0022more thrust\u0022 and \u0022more fuel.\u0022 This self-contained cryogenic rocket stage provides the rare and highly prized \u0022more specific impulse\u0022 aspect of bigger rockets, at the slight disadvantage of burning the infamously lightweight hydrogen fuel. In spite of this, it manages to be a very capable upper stage, particularly well-suited for boosting the Auriga command and service modules to wherever they\u0027re needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno V SRB--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Dwarfing even the most aggressive and dangerous SRBs previously on the market, the Juno V pushes the limits in size, power, and cheapness of the solid rocket booster world. Some flight crews have started to object to the use of this booster after learning that it can\u0027t be shut down once lit; we\u0027ve found that the simplest solution is just not to tell them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno VI Core Stage (Solid)--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: This solid booster is a bit of an oddity in that, despite its colossal size, it doesn\u0027t really put out all that much thrust. We\u0027re told that this is intended to maximize its burn time and make it more controllable, but nobody can resist strapping some Juno Vs to it whenever it\u0027s used on a rocket - life is too short for low thrust-to-weight ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno VI Core Stage (Liquid)--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: This booster\u0027s introduction into the stockpiles stirred up considerable friction between the solid- and liquid-fuel enthusiasts at the space center. The solid fuel folks argue that they\u0027ve been sidelined for too long and making a liquid version of every booster that comes along just isn\u0027t fair, while the liquid proponents are making their same old cases about \u0022controllability\u0022 and \u0022improved vacuum performance,\u0022 whatever that means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--ORANGE--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The only liquid-fueled part of the Hestia launch vehicle, the committee responsible for ORANGE has seen a bit of heckling from the other teams on the project. No one likes a tiny engine, but ORANGE\u0027s development team is adamant that a controllable, lightweight, and low-cost propulsion system is absolutely essential for the final insertion burn on any orbital ascent, and that ORANGE provides all of that. Whatever you choose to do with it, we recommend not using this engine where thrust-to-weight ratio is a major concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Space Launch System Lower Stage--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: A truly thunderous piece of overengineering, the SLS Lower Stage is absolutely the biggest and best booster anyone has ever seen. Allegations that it is actually a farming silo that we stole and attached engines to are totally unfounded - those events definitely did not happen in that order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Space Launch System SRB--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The team behind the Juno V SRB was very angry indeed when this booster first hit the market. Not only does it totally smash all previously-held records for largest solid booster, but it even looks like it might be more cost-effective for its size. Fortunately for the Juno team, the price is still prohibitive, and most saner payloads won\u0027t need boosters this big to get off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Z-50--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Designed as a highly-capable third stage for the Hestia launch vehicle, the Z-50 manages to pack a huge amount of oomph into a small package. Its relatively high thrust and inability to be deactivated or throttled once lit can make it difficult to control at times, but almost all pilots to use this booster have survived the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Auriga Service Adapter--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Bridges the difference in sizes between a shrouded Auriga service module and a cryogenic upper stage. Decoupler sold separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Auriga Service Shroud and Adapter--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The Auriga service module is notorious for its unsightly and un-aerodynamic fiddly bits. This shroud provides welcome concealment for them during ascent, and with the help of an adapter, it connects smoothly to a cryogenic upper stage. Explosive bolts are included to separate the shrouds and adapter once the stage below it finishes burning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hestia Decoadapter--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Bridges the size difference between the Hyacinthus IX and XX booster stages, and contains an explosive decoupling mechanism to separate the lower one once spent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hestia Decoupler--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Unlike the other decouplers this size, this part neatly matches the exterior diameter and appearance of the Hestia Hyacinthus XX and Z-50 boosters. We\u0027re told this makes the rocket more aerodynamic, but we rather suspect the project engineers of caring about aesthetics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Hestia Fairing Base--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The Hestia launch vehicle has some nice sleek lines, but the same cannot be said for most payloads. To keep the rocket\u0027s nose pointy, the project has delivered this attachment base for custom-buildable fairings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno V Decoupler--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Developed after complaints that there weren\u0027t enough large decouplers available, this decoupler is best suited to the larger bits of the Juno V launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno V Fairing Base--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: A large base for custom fairings. Can be somewhat heavy when surrounding a large payload, but everyone agrees that fairings pull their own weight with their superior aerodynamic properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno VI Decoupler--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: A specialized decoupler for the 3.125-meter Juno VI rocket stacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Juno VI Fairing Base--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Our engineers were initially skeptical of whether or not we actually needed yet another fairing base. However, it was quickly shown that fairings don\u0027t work very well when they don\u0027t match the rocket stack they\u0027re attached to. Accordingly, a base for custom fairings was quickly commissioned for the 3.125-meter Juno VI launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--5-Segment SRB Nose Cone--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: The idea of combining the Sepratron motor with a nose cone seemed obvious enough, and we were impressed by how well it worked. Although it\u0027s designed mainly for the unusual 2.25-meter boosters, it does a great job in preventing separating radial boosters from striking the center stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Bacon Docking System--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: After many complaints about the Clamp-O-Tron series docking ports, we came up with this innovative new device. Its connections are slightly stronger than the older ports, and it has a much lower profile. Better yet, it\u0027s backwards-compatible with Clamp-O-Trons of similar size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Bacon Docking System (Parachute)--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescription: Nobody is sure how the Bacon Docking System\u0027s designers managed to cram three whole parachutes into a docking port while leaving the crew hatch unobstructed, but that\u0027s exactly what they\u0027ve done - no longer will you need to worry about all those silly radial chutes for your docking craft!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T15:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI swear to you, I was JUST thinking about this.
