I use these ships for manned travel to other planets. At least I want to. Although they seem to work ok for a while, at some point I switch to them and the game will seem to load slowly. The interface will display, but the ship graphic will never load with the screen staying black. I switch to the map view and the screen remains black. Occasionally, the ship (I believe it is one or more Rockomax tanks) will spontaneously explode instead. If I head back to the main KSP screen, the space center will not load but the screen will remain black. At this point I need to exit the game for it to load properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Even if I reload the game, and reload a previous quicksave, the ship will not load and the save game seems to be corrupted. The previously selected ship could vanish from the roster and the crew listed as missing. Once all ships which were equipped with the Rockomax Jumbo64 tank vanished. Sometimes this happens as soon as I leave Kerbin orbit, other times it will last as long as to reach Jool. Usually, when the screen remains black, the altimeter remains blank, the delta-V indicator and node times read NA, as do other MechJeb windows. Once MechJeb indicated my altitude was about 5 Gigameters with an orbital period of over 5 years which seems to indicate it was teleported from Jool orbit to interstellar space.

Anyway, I managed to launch the ship and everything was going roughly OK but then I needed to quickload on of my quicksaves and then it all happened again. This issue happen to me a couple of times before and it was when jumping to some previous quicksave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the before pic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bVklTm8.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022bVklTm8.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the after pic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pz7Hzf6.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022pz7Hzf6.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see this is rather sad and frustrating as it seems to happen every time I try to make something more complex and entertaining.

On exiting to Space center again a black screen though the overlay appears and sounds can be heard in the background. Game has to be fully exited and re-loaded for space center to appear. The ship that was being swapped to no longer appears in the game and crew (if any) are missing. This can be any ship both large and small, with or without a kerbal on board. Usually when in space between planets. A work around of saving the game before swapping ships, then after the bug return to space center and load save game, quit game fully and reload. Ship still available.
