However, thanks to some brilliant tutorials out there, I have made a few successful rockets, have put some in orbit and brought them safely back, and even put a lander on Minmus which I also managed to bring back. Currently having a look at how to dock whilst in parked orbit, as I am sure this manoeuvre will be the key to future successful missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t even looked at space planes, or maybe a simpler type of atmospheric craft simply to explore some of the land masses of Kerbal. I understand there is a runway on the island just offshore from the space centre, so will definitely have a look over there at some point. And I love experimenting, so hoping to create some wacky, but functional designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScarecrow\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T22:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Scarecrow88 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanes are a lot of fun so give them a go!
