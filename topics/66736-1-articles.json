I came here to see what was coming up for the game and figured I probably should register since I\u0027ve put in about 200 hours into the game and can\u0027t seem to stop playing it when I have time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of my monstrosities: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/id/alymon/screenshots/?appid=220200\u0026amp;sort=score\u0026amp;browsefilter=myfiles\u0026amp;view=imagewall\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of my favorites... with my dog Einstein as the flag: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3332967914510087004/39479690E2C79C3CF5FBBDAE44F4C2FC71FBC706/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my first Mun landing after the science update. I hadn\u0027t played for a while. I had grown used to MechJeb guiding me on my efforts. I\u0027ve been playing with no mods now so every flight is a bit of an adventure for me. I\u0027m getting much better at it and am starting to get better at interplanetary flights (which I was terrible at before). My next flight is a probe to land on Eve. It\u0027s on a collison course right now, but I won\u0027t get to finish the flight til tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to focus on building planes and getting better at docking now. I am terrible at both. Actually, I am terrible at everything in the game, but more terrible at those two things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T17:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you\u0027ve been enjoying the game.
