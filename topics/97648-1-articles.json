Due to the SAS disengaging when going into EVA, my craft sometimes rotates rather quickly and has actually flung my poor Kerbal off before. It was not too fast and I could get back on, but extremely annoying. I was considering adding a probe to keep the SAS on while in EVA, but I was hoping there was a another answer that I have overlooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else been experiencing this annoyance, and how have you resolved it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T13:57:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steelsunoa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T12:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut a probe core on it to keep it stable.
