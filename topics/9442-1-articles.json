Does anyone have a kerbin or mun radius, or mu values for any bodies. I am trying to amass as much data as possible for making more accurate orbits. There are several aerospace engineering students all enjoying this game, and have interest in trying to make use of what we have learned. If anyone knows, the help would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T05:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Wiki\u003C/a\u003E.
