You may not use SAS during any point. All reaction wheels must be switched off. All rcs thrusters must be switched off. Your only attitude control can come from the gimballing of your main engines (all of which must be pointed in the same direction). Piloting aids such as Mechjeb are also obviously not allowed.\n\nEntrants should preferably show their skills through an uploaded video, but an image album with plenty of pictures can also work.\n\nIf there are multiple entries and people feel the need to be ranked and outdo each other, I suggest using fewer engines, more complicated craft, or a lower TWR. Maybe someone can even show us a landing without any gimballed engines!"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T17:34:43Z","Content":"Would also be good if the OP showed an example of their attempt."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:09:11Z","Content":"are engines pointing in different directions allowed? if so, a player could set up a manual action-group controlled RCS-system."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:02:51Z","Content":"I did this challenge but I did it in career first and then I came up with the challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:08:30Z","Content":"Did this in career mode 1.0.2.

(which makes the MK55 a very interesting choice because of its high gimbal value).\n\none more quite important thing: timewarp stops rotation. I\u0027d suggest the mod persistent rotation. the spacecraft remembers its own rotation-speed during timewarp ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
