The idea was to later build a big rocket with three slots where to place three copies of the satellite, and launch.\n\nNow, trying to blend all things together I\u0027ve having all sort of troubles.\n\nFor once, if I import (merge) the satellites into an existing rocket design, even if I prepare a slot for it (no matter if I use a decoupler, no matter the size, and no matter if I use a docking module), there is really no way to attach the imported satellite (or any piece for that matter) on the current rocket.\n\nOther approaches failed as well. After a couple of hours trying finding a way to attach parts, I gave up. I know I\u0027m not totally stupid (usually ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png)), so what\u0027s going on? What do I not get here?\n\nWould you mind showing me some of your design where you had to solve a similar issue, or telling me where I\u0027m likely doing it wrong?\n\nAny help will be much appreciated.

The root part is basically the part that you attach from. e.g. the probe core, or the decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T23:36:51Z","Content":"Yup. Go back to the satellite craft and set the root node to be the thing you want to attach it by. It needs to either have an open attachment node or to be \u0022surface attachable\u0022... ie something like a fuel tank that you can just attach radially.\n\nIt can take a bit of fiddling to get right sometimes."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T00:04:45Z","Content":"You can only have one root part and when importing/merging something only the root part has slots. Usually this means you only have one attachment point (unless using something like those not-rockomax-cube-thingies). You also can\u0027t radially attach merged parts.\n\nSo if you want to stack the satellites imo the best way is to load up the satellite file, then change the name, e.g. to 3 sats, then Alt\u002BClick parts of the sattelite to copy sections and stack those sections on top of each other (with decouplers; can\u0027t copy the root part). Also strut it up! Then change the root part to the attachment point with the rocket, save it and you\u0027re ready.\n\nExample: [http://imgur.com/4CQbPV1](http://imgur.com/4CQbPV1)\n\nThe decoupler at the bottom is the root part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T00:09:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:24:58Z","Content":"What I usually do: Always work in the big rocket. First don\u0027t build the big rocket itself, but just place a root part, and build sub-assemblies for each of the satellite below the big rocket root part. It would become really easy if you want multiple identical satellites for the same orbit - just by doing a symmetry. After sub-assemblies designed, I just start building the actual big rocket using those just-built sub-assemblies.\n\nOne example:\n\n![iFVkwRs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iFVkwRs.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:24:43Z","Content":"Whenever I do a multiple launch, It\u0027s usually the same satellite design. So, I start out by building the satellite as its own craft first to make sure it\u0027s going to have the desired results and performance. Then, I go and build a \u0022space tug\u0022 with multiple attachment points to carry them to a particular target orbit, then build the satellites onto the tug. Dispersal is usually to carry them to the target orbit, then drop the PeA to a point that will evenly space the satellites out over the orbit. Then, the \u0022tug\u0022 cuts loose the payload and heads down to Kerbin for either disposal or retrieval. I then use onboard engines to circularize the orbits, one satellite each time around."},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:40:20Z","Content":"I don\u0027t merge rockets. I create a big rocket and attach several copies of the same parts radially.

This allows me to later attach other stuff vertically\n\nImage2, I attach 4 docking ports. I have to use the key W twice, as I have to rotate it 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. Also, I had to rotate a bit the view in order to attach the docking ports.\n\nImage3, I attach 4 more docking ports, this time without rotation\n\nImage4, I begin attaching the other required parts, such as batteries and the actual probe.\n\nImage5: the last picture is an example of my final rocket with 4 sats. If I need one of them, I just disconnect the node and that\u0027s all.

In order to do so I had to flip the decoupler upside down (literally). Then it worked. It was that simple, but it doesn\u0027t make much of a sense either.\n\nAlso, I finally managed to create a template for the satellite, and to add it to the library or partials in the left panel. When I tried to select a different root part I failed to understand how to actually do it. So I went for a different approach. And in the end I preferred using the docking port than the decoupler.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s see if I can manage to publish few pictures of what I\u0027ve achieved. The satellites are already in orbit, and that also was quite an interesting task. I parked the mothership in a temporary orbit that touched 700k at Apoapsis with 2/3 of the final desired orbital period. I then proceed to launch one satellite after the other, at any passage to the apoapsis. Each satellite did position itself using its own propulsion system. To do so I\u0027ve used the flight assistant provided with RemoteTech. Quite brilliant tool, I\u0027d say. You setup a node, and press exec on the panel. And voila!
