The skybox texture around the equatorial plane is a brighter color because of the \u0022milky way\u0022 texture, and most planets in KSP do not deviate very far from it; planets such as Eve and Jool are in a bright part of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe personally, I use Rareden\u0027s skybox with Texture Replacer: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87311-Rareden-s-Real-8k-Skybox-for-Texture-Replacer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87311-Rareden-s-Real-8k-Skybox-for-Texture-Replacer\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ralathon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ralathon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s because the skybox is just a large image instead of something more refined. The stars and galaxy are just pixels instead of points. Also, the galaxy on the skybox has the same inclination as all the planets. So whenever you try to take a snapshot of a planet there\u0027s always a giant grey pixel in the background.\u003Cp\u003EA simple solution is to use Texture replacer to get a different skybox (One with more black). A more elegant solution (on the side of the mod) would be to use the code from Distant Object Enhancement that blacks out the skybox and use that to hide the skybox when zooming the telescope.
