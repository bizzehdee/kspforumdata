However when i try to do this it start over compensating and oscilating and eventually stalls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is probably because my plane isn\u0027t as balanced as i think it is.

Take a look at what your elevators do when you try to roll. One elevator splits and goes the other way, to help with the roll command. This split elevator messes up the pitch trim.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T20:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve managed extremely stable ASAS flight at all altitudes, but only on craft where the elevators/flaps are at almost the back end of the craft, and very close in to the main body. Everything else seems to produce the oscillations that make the ASAS module practically worthless. I\u0027ve also got a bit of an idea that the number of moving control surfaces causes the ASAS PID controls to overcompensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an addendum to what ZK posted above, I try to move things with constant weight forward, to move the CoM up and keep it as steady as possible.
