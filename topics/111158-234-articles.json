We asked this to be added for all forum members. It is simply the forum recording your response to reading the rules so that if the need ever should arise where you, in the generic and collective sense, ever need to be moderated, it cannot be claimed \u0022I didn\u0027t know that was in the rules?!\u0022 And yes, even us moderators had to click the button showing we had read the rules.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\npeople could still claim not to know these specific parts of the rules."},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T15:50:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 57 minutes ago, 4x4cheesecake said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another thing [...] rule 2.2l and 5.1 contain a forum link which cannot be opened unless you agree to the rules [...]\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 57 minutes ago, 4x4cheesecake said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E PS: yes, I know most people wont read them anyway\n\u003E \n\nI came along to make a similar point, so while [@4x4cheesecake](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187982-4x4cheesecake/) may be right in that most won\u0027t read the rules, I am evidence that others will and have noted the same problem.  I think that there are enough detail-oriented people here that making the full rules visible in the \u0027Read Before Proceeding\u0027 page is worth consideration.\n\nAdditionally, I\u0027m not certain about how much flexibility the forum offers to put such things outside the wall and make them visible, but I think that there\u0027s merit in including some specific threads and posts out there, as well, such as [the Good Conduct Guide](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/13107-the-good-conduct-guide/) and others.\n\nThat said, I get the distinct impression that this was more of an administrator decision rather than a moderator one, so you have my apologies if I am directing this to the wrong people."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T18:36:21Z","Content":"Error 404 \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-08T20:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2021 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Kerbal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T18:40:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Dr. Kerbal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Has a moderator ever been demoted to a member besides just quitting?\n\u003E \n\nIf they had, it would be mean to talk about them, wouldn\u0027t it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T20:47:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Deddly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If they had, it would be mean to talk about them, wouldn\u0027t it?\n\u003E \n\nTrue.
