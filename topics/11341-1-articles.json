In theory it might be possible now, someone would just have to develop a plugin which adds functions described below.\n\n**Let\\\u0027s say a plane** carrying important cargo(Jeb\\\u0027s cat it might be) crashed in a terrain that\\\u0027s difficult to reach by land rovers OR crashing a rocket into an area next to our plane is not an option. This is when these little friends called unmanned vehicles(or drones) come into action.\n\nA plane is launched from KSP, carrying two of these. Rescue mission is about to begin.\n\n\u003E ![tripa.png](http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6730/tripa.png)\n\nWhen the time comes, our robots are deployed into action.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot11ro.png](http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8183/screenshot11ro.png)\n\nNext step is fairly simple. After touchdown, onboard computers start and drones collect our target of great importance and then head to extraction area, where a transporter is waiting.\n\n\u003E ![deployed.png](http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1829/deployed.png)\n\nKSP is really going to be an outstanding game, I\\\u0027m sure of that! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:46:08Z","Content":"I was thinking about making something like a C-130 that drops stuff out the back of a cargo hold made from the rectangular wing sections."},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:50:40Z","Content":"I desperately hope that programmable autonomous vehicles are added in the future.

Not to mention accounting for unreliability and inaccuracy.\n\nYou could do some pretty powerful things with very basic instructions when you can guarantee reliability and consistency."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T17:11:43Z","Content":"Ultimately, your idea could enable us to do something like the White Knight / Spaceship One combination. After separation, both craft need to be piloted simultaneously. But if the carrier could glide down on autopilot, the investors would be much happier. Something tells me this scenario asks a lot."}]}
