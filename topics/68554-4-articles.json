With fewer, more powerful, parts I am also no longer using asparagus staging as a matter of course, which again makes builds simpler and reduces build-count. The new launch vehicles are also cheaper, in as much as cost has any relevance at the moment. Maintaining a launch TWR of 1.6 - 2 and deltaV of 4,600 - 4,800m/s the only downside is their reduced payload ratio; in this specific case down from 16.49% for a somewhat optimised asparagus build to 11.34%. As 10% rocket payload ratio is to be expected as a rule of thumb that\u0027s \u0022acceptable\u0022, if not inspiring. Launchers for heavier payloads have better ratios.\u003Cp\u003EBefore the introduction of ARM parts I found \u0027simple\u0027 builds - such as just sticking a mainsail under everything - were so inadequate that parts had to be multiplied and supplemented (moar boosters!) just to get decent performance, obviating any benefits. Broadly, the \u0027practice\u0027, which has changed and which I am addressing, is that \u0027simple\u0027 is now, often, also right, thus I have shunned more complex builds that I would have adopted before. You are right, of course, in that I am still interested in efficiency and performance and, to that extent, my play style has not changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of this is a complaint about anything.
