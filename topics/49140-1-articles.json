Now, a bunch of folks have responded \u0022This the Kerbal Space Program, not the Human one, Jeb must be first\u0022 or words to that effect. Which is fine, but for those of us who want a closer-to-real-life progression of the tech tree...I made this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, unlike part mods which can be dropped in ad-hoc, it\u0027s very hard to coordinate one\u0027s mods with one\u0027s tech tree. I thus suggest that we hash out a community real-life-inspired tech tree, so that we can have a common basis, and so we don\u0027t, each of us, have to manually adjust everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, we still have to adjust everything, but at least we can cooperate and not duplicate effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, this would give mod authors the chance to determine where they want their part on the tech tree, and give plugin authors a common set of nodes and their positions to query, if such authors are interested in supporting a more real-life-based tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.

Separatrons, a heavy simple probe core, and the basic jet / cockpit / wings / jet fuel should be available at the start, along with size 0 LF parts (large solid rockets took much longer to develop than LF rockets; planes, however, beat even Goddard.)

I\u0027m not so certain that L0 on the tree should include airplane parts per se, but they should be within easy reach with a bit of research. I don\u0027t think that uncontrollable probes are necessary if instead you stick with uncontrollable engines as the simple tech.

But I\u0027ve seen somewhere (I don\u0027t remember where) that Squad wanted us to use a different method. But changing the location of the parts on the tech tree involves changing the cfg file of every effected part. JSGME manages all that, but is there a more preferred way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to get a couple more people involved in this mod. You should also understand that the node layout is hard coded in the EXE. So I\u0027m not going to be changing that.
