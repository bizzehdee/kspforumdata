We spend time together as father and son bonding in the hope that exposing him to science will excite him and in turn he will enjoy learning and have fun whilst we practice reading the prompts on the screen and learn new words etc etc.\n\nHe has successful so far managed to orbit kerbin and execute a maneuver to a polar orbit. \n\nin his words since 1.0 - \u0022No im playing minecraft\u0022\n\nHe then went on to explain how he struggles to get ships up even once I have shown him new methods for launch. He\u0027s over it.\n\nNow one could argue that I be paitent and teach him about whats going on, but I think thats asking too much of a 6yo. The boy is smart but we grasp concepts and different stages and this lads stage just ran out of fuel.\n\nSo I politely ask Squad this.\n\n*\u0022Do you plan on implementing features to customize the learning curve experienced by the player or releasing something for Kerbal EDU that will assit young players in understanding and working with the imposed changes brought with Aerodynamics?\u0022* \n\nKind regards,\n\nThe Easte family\n\n**-32.3040000,115.7442960**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T06:11:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal007**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:20:53Z","Content":"I can appreciate your plight. I would love give a quick and emphatic \u0022Yes!\u0022 But EDU is built and maintained by a separate group of people. It isn\u0027t a squad product, so the actual next round of EDU may or may not suit your request.\n\nI would say that planes are probably a bit easier, but rockets are harder. It\u0027s not quite a \u0022launch and forget\u0022 maneuver anymore. Although one of the first big steps is to learn to actually throttle the engines down. The new aero lets you go a lot faster, but when you go faster at low altitude, things can be harder to control.\n\nI don\u0027t know if any of that will help you, but I can sympathize.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:33:40Z","Content":"Claw, Thanks for your response, straight up and informative.
