R would still toggle RCS helping with rotation. Since some of us have enough reaction wheel torque to make our rotations, it\u0027s really annoying to be constantly tapping R on before every translation, then R off again before all our monoprop fuel gets blown away on simple rotations that we didn\u0027t need any help with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T09:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with this suggestion.
