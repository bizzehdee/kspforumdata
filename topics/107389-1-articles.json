I couldn\u0027t bear the idea of Mechjeb or hyperedit. Once upon a time I calculated my dV \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eby hand\u003C/span\u003E with my trusty TI-30xs. But eventually I discovered KER, and learned that it did that for me. Cool, no more browsing for part mass, fuel mass, blah blah... jus gimme my dV already... moar building and flying, less calculating! Throughout the versions, I continually improved my skills. I mean... I really play KSP like a boss... I can land/RV from IVA without any issues, eyeball most of my intercept/encounter burns, know most of the dV requirements by heart. I\u0027ve done wonderful things, and insane things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings us to today. I\u0027ve been playing a new career mode playthrough, and I\u0027ve been using sandbox as my \u0022simulator\u0022... testing ideas before fielding them in the \u0022real\u0022 Kerbin... where consequences can be tragic. I found that constantly having to launch things into orbit just so I can test out new reentry profiles, deceleration methods, shielding methods, etc... got old fast. I didn\u0027t care about the launch, it was mundane now... just something I had to do before I could get to the interesting part. Enter Hyperedit... I figured it might be helpful while testing in sandbox mode. I\u0027d never taint my main career save with such a... cheaty abomination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I went back into career mode, and began working on building my station... which will fulfill a contract and also act as a staging area for my upcoming Duna expedition that is leaving in about 40 days (got a lotta work to do). I\u0027ve painstakingly constructed several fully recoverable launch platforms... a matching set if you will. I have a 2t, 5t, 10t, 15t, 20t, 30t, and 40t so far. Each has been tested and certified. Guaranteed to get rated payload to maximum orbit of 300km x 300km, then deorbit itself for recovery. I\u0027ve been using 20t modules exclusively for my station, and after launching about 3 20t station modules in succession without incident (quite boring launches honestly)... I started to wonder... why not use hyperedit? I mean, anything I put up fits within one of my launchers... they are fully recoverable (aside from fuel obviously... but at several million funds, who cares about a bit of fuel... amirite?... plus, mining!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I put up a module with hyperedit, it felt so wrong... and yet, somehow felt right. I got to skip straight to the fun part... building my station and playing around with new parts in space. Meanwhile, Jeb and Bob are careening toward minmus with a satellite escort (launched separately... b/c, you know, contracts require that) that RV\u0027d with them on the far side of the Mun (after a gravity assist). They\u0027re gonna bring back some of that sweet sweet data for my new station. I\u0027ll still launch things manually if I\u0027m testing new designs, or doing something else different or unique... but the mundane routine launch has lost its appeal. Don\u0027t you judge me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more serious note... play the game how you want to and let others play how they want to. Just have fun. Thanks, and goodnight!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3Dave","CreatedById":102832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the dark side. Enjoy the cookies!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, you hit on the key issue there. mundane launches and maneuvers. its fun to fly rockets maybe the first 10-20 times. but once you figure out how to fly the correct launch profile, you get bored pretty quick and would rather just get to the good part. Mechjeb is there with its ascent guidance computer. Its entertaining to play with nodes and get that perfect \u0026lt; 100m separation rendezvous a few times. but then that gets old. Mechjeb rendezvous autopilot. lets you skip straight to the actual building part. which has to be done manually still, at least i always do, the docking autopilot has always been extremely wasteful of RCS fuel and very slow, unless its been fixed lately. I dont care though, i enjoy docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t really messed with hyperedit much. i enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to get impossible payloads into orbit. and i enjoy building massive 5 meter saturn v style launchers to do it. lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I\u0027m considering is building a station in parts, docking all parts together, and then deleting it and replacing it with the station without the jelly docking ports (and moar struts). It\u0027s not like you\u0027re cheating by putting the thing in orbit with hyperedit, it\u0027s just that (aside from using quantum struts) right now it seems like the only way to get a mechanically cohesive station in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are various tools to take care of the mundane launches though. I use kRPC with Python, allowing me to write my own launch scripts (I never warmed up for the klunky KERBAL LOLZ KOS language), I know there\u0027s some kind of routine mission manager, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@3Dave: Try several thousand launches... it gets old once you feel like you\u0027ve mastered it.

Just last night I was doing a rendezvous with my station, and I was on final approach... had several kilometers to go, and figured that was a good time to get something to drink. I was walking back to me seat to see my new station module careening toward my station at somewhere around 150m/s relative velocity... it\u0027s easy to forget exactly how fast that is in the vast emptiness of space... until an approaching station reminds you. I didn\u0027t get to my seat in time, I had to watch as a hitchhiker container flew off into space.
