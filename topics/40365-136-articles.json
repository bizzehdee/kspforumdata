(for nuclear reactors that are at idle, this is understandable). Solar panels that are not producing power do not produce waste heat in real life physics.

The photon either hits the solar panel and creates a useful electrical current or it hits the solar panel and creates heat. In the case of zero applied load, you effectively just have a black body with some albedo receiving power radiated by the sun. If you do have a load, some of that energy instead goes on promoting electrons from the valance band into the conduction band and later doing useful work, only the left over energy above this band gap and the energy from photons of inappropriate frequency is wasted as heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is easier to think of the devices you carry on your spacecraft not as sources of WasteHeat but instead as a way of getting rid of it, the Plasma Engine is a good example. The plasma engine is 72% efficient at turning electricity into kinetic energy for your spacecraft, that 72% therefore becomes something useful (hurray!), the overwhelming majority of the remaining 28% does become heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany devices aren\u0027t anything like this efficient and ultimately turn much of the electrical power they use into heat anyway but you\u0027re still better off than you would with that little bit of useful work done than you are with your solar panels pointed at the sun and doing absolutely nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you don\u0027t want heat production, fold the solar panels away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaMichel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaMichel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHence i guess the heat loss without radiators could be increased a little. Real space probes don\u0027t have big radiators either.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe passive dissipation is actually fairly generous, it\u0027s modelled by making some generic assumption about spacecraft surface area based on its mass. Regardless, predictably structural parts not designed for it are far inferior as radiators than parts that are designed specifically for that purpose, all but the tiniest of low power output probes have specialised radiator components, all you need is one tiny radiator for a small solar powered probe and it isn\u0027t a problem anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality things are quite a bit more complicated and you may need to use stored energy to heat the spaceprobe when its in shadow to keep equipment within a certain range of operating temperatures in addition to dissipating heat when in sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eadrom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eadrom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wasn\u0027t able to quickly find it, but the discussion on using antimatter to power lab making antimatter has happened before in this thread.

So it is 0.5% efficient at the production of antimatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, unless you can collect it in orbit, using an antimatter factory is a way of using a huge amount of energy to store a moderate amount of energy into an extremely high density energy storage medium which you can use to get far more power for a given mass than any other alternative.

This is advantageous because Methane is cheap and easy to handle compared to traditional rocket fuels, it also offers slightly improved specific impulse compared to most lower stage engines but the fuel tanks do take a bit of a hit in terms of overall capacity. The real reason that a Methane engine is really interesting though is because of the Sabatier reaction:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 4 H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00E2\u20AC\u2122 CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 2 H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt describes a mechanism by which we can use a small amount of hydrogen, mixed with some carbon dioxide to generate methane and water. This is of great interest because the atmosphere of Mars (and presumably by analogy Duna) have atmospheres rich in carbon dioxide. This means that by taking a small amount of Hydrogen with you, you can react it with ambient CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E to generate Methane and Water. The water can then be electrolysed to give you Oxygen and 2/3 of the amount of Hydrogen you started with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can thus repeat the process until all the hydrogen is sequestered way in the methane and you have only methane and oxygen. In this way, you can carry with you to Duna a small amount of Hydrogen mass, source the carbon dioxide locally and produce rocket fuel equivalent to 20x the mass of hydrogen you brought along with you.

It doesn\u0027t matter whether your computer chip or your solar panel is producing the heat because heat conduction is going to dominate the heat transfer process within your spacecraft, in other words, if your solar panels becomes warm enough to cause harm to your vulnerable components, so do the vulnerable components themselves, whether the solar panels themselves get damaged is irrelevant - if the solar panels are hot enough heat to cook your satellite\u0027s CPU, your CPU will be more or the less temperature - at which point goodbye space probe!
