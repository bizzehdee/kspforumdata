I\u0027m not sure exactly how much time I\u0027ve put into this project, the greatest difficulty was figuring out how to make the warp drive work in a way that is compatible with large ships. It\u0027s really easy to do with small, compact ships just by using a simple function in the KSP API but that method tended to break any large ships I tried to build.

They use a tiny bit of a special fuel and send it into a reactor that generates another resource that runs the engines and generates electrical power for the vessel. I can get all over the Kerbol system using them, and they have a nifty custom sound effect thanks to Firespitter\u0027s module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the closest thing I had to a true \u0022Warp Drive\u0022 was the Hyperjump Mod which doesn\u0027t really work anymore, and never really worked so well to begin with. But this? I never really wanted a loading screen to pop up between things, and I didn\u0027t want to use HyperEdit to simulate a warp or hyperjump or what have you. I wanted a Warp Drive that I could use to point, click, activate, and then travel very quickly in a straight line to somewhere close to my destination, then use my own mod or whatnot as Impulse Engines to align my orbit and things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mod is the closest thing I\u0027ve seen to what I always wanted in a Warp Drive mod. I do, however, have a question. Is the Warp Drive/plugin set up so, if one were so inclined, they could change the resource that the drive drains when active without breaking the mod/plugin combo? For example, I don\u0027t know if your plugin requires it to use your resource in order to function. If all the plugin does is say \u0022the ship goes fast now in this direction\u0022 and the part config for the drive says \u0022I drain THIS fuel at THIS rate\u0022, that means I could edit the drive to use my \u0022M/AM-Capacity\u0022 fuel that I\u0027ve already created for use with my own engines without having to worry about breaking the connection between the config files and the plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is indeed the case, that also means I would be able to finally, finally, have the closest thing to a true \u0022Star Trekky\u0022 experience in KSP (without actually downloading the Trek model mods) and really start enjoying my little sandbox in ways I\u0027ve only dreamed about doing before. Any clarification you could give on this would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E On the note of \u0022OP CFG Edits\u0022 my personal mods are probably something like that, but I didn\u0027t start out with the intention to make an engine to \u0022win KSP\u0022. If I wanted to do that, I could have just turned on infinite fuel, but that\u0027s no fun. My idea was to have the capacity fuel be drained slowly with use of the engines, and over time, the tanks would run out and need to be refilled somehow. Though, that would be after several missions to observe the system. Honestly I kinda wanted to put a refueling station in orbit to refuel drained vessels to keep the fleet moving, though collector parts would lessen the burden on refueling. But with the possibility of your mod being added to the combination, I could have a part that drains a proportionally greater deal of capacity fuel and make refuelling trips and collector parts more necessary than if I simply stuck to my Impulse Engines. That presents a choice between using Impulse, which is slower but far more sustainable, or using Warp which is faster, but less sustainable. That choice, I think, helps with balance concerns. Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went through a lot of trial and error to get the numbers right, learn my way around the CFG language, and what modules did what etc. I can\u0027t list the number of times I tore a ship apart from going to full throttle, or overheating, or not having lines of code correct in the CFG and pulling hair out over \u0022fuel deprived\u0022 messages and drain rates. I even had a fun problem where I\u0027d get to a destination and my fuel would be completely drained because the reactor coding was wrong. So, yes, my personal edits do not follow the mold of the standard game, and they make the game easier because I don\u0027t need multiple stages or big part counts to enjoy much of the game (my system is also very low-end). However, I don\u0027t tote my edits as being amazing, and everyone plays the game in their own way.
