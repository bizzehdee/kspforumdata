Right now you receive a small amount of starting credits, enough to build your first rocket, but you must use funding from contracts to progress any further. This seems to me to be a bit unrealistic, especially if you consider the Kerbal Space Program to be a government-affiliated agency a la NASA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder alternate career mode rules, you would actually receive a \u0022budget\u0022 from, say Kongress (or whatever \u0022government\u0022 the Kerbals live under), at the start of the game, as well as periodically throughout the game on a \u0022yearly\u0022 basis. This budget would be something along the lines of several million funding credits. However, that would be all the funding you would get for that year. Furthermore, the amount you receive each year differs depending on what all you accomplished during that time period. The reputation system would essentially reflect your standing with both the public and with the government on how \u0022useful\u0022 they think the Kerbal Space Program actually is. Successful missions and scientific research would increase reputation, whereas failed launches and KIA Kerbonauts would decrease it. In addition, your reputation decreases at a fixed rate, but having active missions decreases the rate at which you lose reputation due to inactivity not unlike the \u0022Punish the Lazy\u0022 career mode mod. Your reputation at the end of the year would determine your budget for next year - a high reputation nets you more funds to work with, while a low reputation means less funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would basically make managing career mode a bit similar to an actual state-sponsored space program - sure the government gives you money but how much they\u0027re willing to part with depends on how your actions at KSP will advance Kerbal society. If you have a track record of launching uber-expensive rockets with nothing to show for it, your budget gets slashed - too many failures and they may just eliminate the space program entirely creating a career mode \u0022game over\u0022. If anyone has ever played the X-COM games, this is basically similar to how it worked in X-COM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts, of course, would have to be modified in such a way as to make it very difficult to make a profit from a launch if you used a brand-new spacecraft to do it, while still allowing you to recuperate funds. This would make SSTO\u0027s and other reusable spacecraft much more important as they can be used for multiple missions. Building one may cost the equivalent of 3 satellite launch missions but if you can use it for 5 you can profit. See? It may also give resource extraction a use other than keeping your fuel tanks full - after all space is full of plenty of rare minerals and materials that can be of use terrestrially, and if you can bring it back to Kerbin I\u0027m sure someone would be willing to shell out extra cash for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, rather than starting with a measly few hundred credits and having to find ways to make a profit, you would start out with several million but have to plan carefully to manage and make the most of it. This would make things easier starting out, but make things challenging later in the game. Science and tech research would work the same way it does now, with the exception that building upgrades now actually cost science AND funding (to make it so you can\u0027t fully upgrade everything right away.) And of course, gaining science and researching tech tree nodes would increase your reputation. However, remember the shiny parts on the right side of the tech tree cost a lot more than the rusty but reliable parts on the left, and cramming a single-use rocket with the shiniest new gear may not be the most economical decision - nor will it necessarily endear you to Kongress, some of whom are just looking for a reason to slash your budget (kind of like how it works IRL with politics the way it is)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would like to see this more as a mod or optional setting as opposed to a total changeover - the current career mode has its merits and I can see pros and cons of both career mechanics. But this would be a nice way to mix things up and make repeated playthroughs more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: An honest apology, someone actually already had this idea and incorporated it into a mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131233\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131233\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T04:08:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Auriga_Nexus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ayylmao","CreatedById":153476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T17:49:01Z","Content":"\nThis is what I\u0026#39;ve been thinking of for a while and would love to see it happen\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T22:54:29Z","Content":"\nI love this idea. I am a fan of the original Microprose X-COM games and they had a very good career system. For those who haven\u0026#39;t played X-COM, it worked like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExtraterrestrial aliens are invading Earth and X-COM is a counter-alien military unit. Every month you get funding from several nations, but they adjust how much they are willing to pay based on how well you are countering the aliens. Basically, any alien activity reduces the funding the country will give you, ranging from a small penalty for a simple UFO flyover, to a huge penalty if aliens abduct people or terrorize a city. Any mission successes by X-COM in that country increases your funding, so you can actually come out ahead if you shoot down UFOs, and intercept and stop alien terror missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are a couple of challenges with implementing a system like this in KSP, mainly because the game doesn\u0026#39;t have an adversary. In X-COM, you will quickly lose the game if you don\u0026#39;t do anything, as aliens conduct activity unopposed and your funding gets cut. But in KSP, you\u0026#39;d need a system to punish you for failing to keep up with something, because otherwise you could simply warp ahead 50 game years to get a billion funds and then go do whatever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI haven\u0026#39;t tried the StateFunding mod, but it sounds like the game could get too easy after a certain point. You get income from just having stuff in orbit. In KSP stock, there\u0026#39;s no life support, so you could just put a bunch of stuff in LKO until your net income is positive, and then time warp for infinite funds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps a leaky-bucket approach could work. Your income could be based on reputation, but your reputation declines on a monthly basis in a logarithmic manner -- higher losses when your rep is high, so it is hard to maintain high rep but easy to maintain low rep. Bringing in science points raises your reputation, plus you get to spend it on unlocking tree nodes. At some point your income declines to 0, and when that happens, you had better have enough in the bank to get some science points somewhere or you\u0026#39;ll lose the game when your rep reaches the lower bar. This would add a sense of urgency to career mode, I think. There would be an actual threat to losing the game, so you\u0026#39;d have to perform or else.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T22:56:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xavven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Cloud","CreatedById":117808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T12:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I think they should tie this idea to the idea of research over time.

Perhaps you should get a small stream of income from archiving Milestones, a flag on Mun might give you an additional 2.000 funds every 100 days, the usual multpliers could work for this - the same could be done for kerbalnaut levels, making them even more valuable - there\u00A0should be the possibility of retiring a kerbalnauts (giving you double the funds) of level 3 or above.

As the name implies, building spacecraft now takes time. But that\u0027s the least of what it does. R\u0026amp;D takes time. Rolling out spacecraft once constructed takes time. Refurbishing the launch pad after a launch takes time. Best of all it implements a points system whereby you can upgrade your VAB and/or SPH to speed up construction or run multiple builds in parallel. You get a similar feature for research - you can upgrade the number of research points you earn per day or, crucially, the number of research points you get from building spacecraft.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ERoll KCT and Life Support together and there\u0027s the core game. Time now matters. That affects logistics and it adds much more urgency and tension to events. It also makes for a more integrated feeling space program, with more stuff happening in parallel. Finally, it adds a much more solid, and much more granular, set of building upgrades. When all the steps of building a spacecraft and prepping it for launch take time, then suddenly there are a load of\u00A0reasons for upgrading your facilities to make those steps faster which can either supplement or replace the current upgrades.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ENow that missions are time critical, we need decent planning tools, hence KER or Mechjeb.

Reputation (by boldly going where no kerbal has gone before) provides a second. Building infrastructure and renting it out provides a third. Tourism provides a fourth and plays well with Infrastructure. This is KSP so launch costs are cheap and labour costs are negligible, so we can go absolutely nuts with Infrastructure. Space hotels, orbital fuel depots, comsat networks, asteroid mining, powersats in kerbosynchronous orbits. All perfectly possible with existing game mechanics. How you make your money is entirely up to you - your program can do a bit of everything or you can focus on one aspect and tweak your building upgrades and research priorities accordingly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ESomething else to bear in mind - you build the infrastructure, do the science etc. and then try to sell it, rather than the current \u0027accept contract to do x\u0027 model.

Simple system - missions need a certain number of training points to be accrued before you launch. This takes time. Kerbonauts earn training points faster, the more experienced they are.
