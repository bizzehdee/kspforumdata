It strikes me that running KSP in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit system could potentially be the root cause of all these issues. I wanted to ask you all how I might fix that, but I also wanted to let people know about this because if it turns out this really is what\u0027s causing my issues, it\u0027s probably responsible for a few other people\u0027s issues as well. Hopefully someone can tell me how to make KSP run in 64-bit mode, and then we\u0027ll know for sure whether 32-bit KSP is to blame for all these problems in Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T08:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, \u0022no hardware support\u0022 will only show in the settings.cfg when trying to enable PPFX edge highlighting, which needs to have anti-aliasing enabled in the KSP settings as well, even if it doesn\u0027t actually work in-game, so turn on AA and you\u0027ll be able to turn on PPFX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP.x86_64 should have started on a 64bit Linux install unless something is missing, the Player.log will say what happened so please upload that, and also check that KSP has the libraries it needs by using the ldd command in the terminal, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eldd KSP.x86_64 | grep \u0022not found\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore info is\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread!#linuxthread05\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E here.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have orbit line rendering and no fairing flicker in both 32bit and 64bit KSP on 64bit Ubuntu by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Onieronaut","CreatedById":151188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T20:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, \u0022no hardware support\u0022 will only show in the settings.cfg when trying to enable PPFX edge highlighting, which needs to have anti-aliasing enabled in the KSP settings as well, even if it doesn\u0027t actually work in-game, so turn on AA and you\u0027ll be able to turn on PPFX.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThanks!

To my continuing bafflement, it would appear that installs that were under the memory limit before and stable for weeks can decide at whatever time that they need even more memory than that on startup, and become impossible to start. Maybe it\u0027s the save file growing, maybe I\u0027m just flying too close to the sun and this is breaking things in creative ways, but it\u0027s going from innocent crashes to major gamebreaking glitches, like the atmosphere permanently disappearing, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to ask people to troubleshoot an install that I\u0027ve not only modded to hell and back, but modded the mods in (nor do I think I want to put in even more hours to troubleshoot much further along these lines when the memory cap is always a threat). Either way, much as I like to tinker, I don\u0027t like to play guessing games about whether I will get to play KSP today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to me seems pretty obvious: switch to Linux x64 client and enjoy the luxury of practically unlimited memory. Obviously I have google, I can see instructions on how to install Ubuntu written for people with even less knowledge than myself; but I\u0027ve seen several players mention they switched to Linux for KSP, and I\u0027d like to know how that worked out and what was the best/simplest approach when your goal, in the short term at least, is just to play KSP in peace and use the hardware you paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Seems common knowledge that Ubuntu is the most popular distro. Any reason to choose something else, or anything I should know about distros relevant to KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have an SSD and HDD. The SSD runs Windows and games that benefit from an SSD; I\u0027d prefer to install Linux to the HDD for now so I don\u0027t have to worry about competition for disk space and KSP doesn\u0027t seem to benefit from an SSD anyway. Is it difficult to run both Windows and Linux on the same PC for this purpose?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once I get Linux installed and KSP installed for Linux, is modding it and playing it going to be pretty much the same as on Windows? It\u0027s not that I\u0027m a Windows fan so much as I\u0027m getting kind of old and don\u0027t like surprises. Given that I never see Linux or Mac versions of mods, I guess it must be the case that KSP\u0027s internal file structure is the same regardless of OS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this comes across as gripy, I don\u0027t mean it. I don\u0027t actually blame Squad or anyone else for a heavily modded install getting clunky, just exhausted from reinstalling dozens of mods from scratch only to keep bumping into the same problem, so I figure why not solve the problem the most direct way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
