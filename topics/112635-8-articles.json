I shall investigate further bow thrusters. But, they can\u0027t be heavy... at all unless I kinda bend the laws of physics. Any amount of mass, like the blisters and the rudder, that gets placed underwater causes massive drag in stock physics. Like MASSIVE drag. If you\u0027ve ever seen guys try to build a stock submarine, you\u0027ll know. I\u0027ve seen them with 6 jet engines pointing straight down and they still descend like they\u0027re flying in molasses.

They picked me up on the beach (yea, it was a ride just for me if you can believe it) and took me out and we boarded their LHA (I\u0027m pretty sure it was a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarawa-class_amphibious_assault_ship\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETarawa\u003C/a\u003E class) via the well dock. And yes, it was pretty cool. They even demonstrated, and I can\u0027t remember the exact words, but the pop-up effect hovercraft have. Basically, they cranked their hovering engines to max while sitting still and the craft shot upward and a huge blast of air shot out from under the skirt. It was a pretty cool ride and made for some great video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, implementing that in KSP... wow. You\u0027re talking multiple engines... forward and upward. Next, balancing issues, just like a VTOL and finally, throttle issues. The hover engines are completely independent of the horizontal engines. So ummmm... yea.

Yes, I know that\u0027s backwards from stock physics. Everyone can surface but diving is an issue. I\u0027m having the opposite problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed is not an issue. I have surmounted that. Here\u0027s a screenshot showing me goofing off with some stock parts. This one is moving rather slow because I\u0027ve only tweaked about half the parts on here.

There are mods that allow you to mount external cameras and there\u0027s the one I use, Kerbcam. Being able to move the camera angle isn\u0027t a big deal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big issue with submarines is Squad. They do not consider underwater to be a place where you should go. This is a game about rockets and aviation. Not about aquatics and maritime activities. Oceans are merely a consequence of making realistic planets. They\u0027re not a place for exploration. Therefore, they have put no real effort into making water a physically attractive place. There\u0027s a VERY good reason why stock cameras are locked in the vertical down position when underwater. It\u0027s because the oceans have no surface when viewed from below. If you were able to rotate the stock camera upward, you\u0027d see that. Rather than fix the view from underwater, Squad simply locks the stock camera so you can\u0027t point it upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same view, a minute or so later with the camera tilted more toward horizontal. You\u0027ll note I\u0027m now 815m...

In full sunlight, half the screen is nearly black while the other half is a blinding white. Without a surface the visual contrast is... horrible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next reason, you can easily verify yourself with the bathysphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin at the long/lat of -28.9 / -83.1, you will find the lowest geographical point. The depth there is around 1300m. Take a bathysphere to that location and dive it. It\u0027ll take a moment to reach that depth. But, at around 1,000 meters, you\u0027ll see the next reason why submarines aren\u0027t really... expected to be in the game. I won\u0027t keep spoiling this and tell you what happens but suffice it to say that no surface reflection is a minor physical anomaly in comparison. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus far, Squad had shown no real desire to change the seascape. Now that being said... if I DO make submarines work then perhaps Squad would have a reason to fix these issues. I\u0027m afraid it would take a lot of opinions to change that and I don\u0027t think there are enough submariners in the game for them to really care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI included the bathysphere knowing these things in hope that people like you would want to use it, see these problems, and start making some noise about getting them fixed. And I\u0027m planning the IVA for the bathysphere in the hopes this happens. I\u0027d love to see subs. But Squad would need to make the oceans friendly before they become visually appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some ways, making mods sucks.
