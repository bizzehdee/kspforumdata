Some resources are more \u0027spikey\u0027 than others, so SCANSat helps in that regard. This is kinda why I needed all of the new biome data in 0.90 to make this work well.

Just think of how KSC is supposed to be in a shores biome that is bordered by ocean and grasslands, but in actuality there\u0027s a tiny ring of tundra showing up when you do flyovers that\u0027s not even supposed to be there. Mun craters are similarly wonky, allowing you to find northwest crater surface areas down in the twin craters and other tomfoolery. And back on Kerbin, the badlands are not a uniform zone but rather haphazardly splattered across the area like some pretentious piece of modern art, creating a veritable jungle of jagged biome borders.
