Almost everybody uses it, we all know that you can set a bunch of mods before making it, but not so many as I want.  \n\u003E Here I played the most time, and I\u0027m somewhat unsatisfied. Almost every mod worked, but I just want more of them.\n- Windows 64\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Buggy and unstable, Squad itself canceled it (at least in the short time). Anything else to discuss?\n- Linux 32\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why?, really, I mean why? If you are using a Linux you should go 64 bits\n- Linux 64\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ah!, what really is worth to discuss. I read a lot about and I found absolutely different impressions. Ones who stand that is the Holy Grail, and people who says thats is even more unstable than Win32.  \n\u003E The only thing I get for sure is that you can\u0027t play without a nVdia properly configured with proprietary drivers.  \n\u003E The issue: setting up things in Linux requires tremendous amount of time and terminal, but when I get my tower back, I will give it a try even if I have to spend a couple days setting it.  \n\u003E Also, can\u0027t say if there is a distro is better or worst than others (yes, we know you can set up whatever you want in Linux, but also it requieres time and I don\u0027t have so many free time)\n- Mac OS Mavericks\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Only 32 bits.  \n\u003E Again mixed impressions. I read people to standing that it works great, and people who saying it doesn\u0027t work.   \n\u003E My impressions after a couple months with a MbP retina 2013 is that is worst than in Windows.  \n\u003E You can install less mods than window sand even so, if don\u0027t set up textures to half resolution it will crash constantly.  \n\u003E Also, if you have a retina screen, you have to set the resolution (trough terminal, edit config files or 3rd party programs) to a non retina one in order to tun it smoothly.  \n\u003E Is just barely better than not being able to play\n\n- Hackintosh\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh Gosh, WHY? we\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re talking about run a GAME without CRASHES\n\nWell, thats what It comes to my mind in order to improve the use of more simultaneous mods, but please, feel free to share anything that can improve it.\n\nHappy Kerbaling"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:22:00Z","Content":"I installed Linux Mint for KSP. I allocated 200 GB partition from one of my data HDDs. I had some problems with partitions (false detection of corrupted GPT) and I had to ask help from Linux forum. I fixed that, installed Linux, and loaded and istalled Nvidia graphics drivers and KSP with several mods. In spite of problems and my low level Linux knowhow it took just couple of hours to set everything up and start to play KSP. When I turn on my computer, Grub ask if I want to use Windows 7 or Linux Mint. Very simple and problem free. Visual enhancing modes and best possible textures make KSP incredible fine. \n\nI do not know is Linux Mint best possible Linux. And I do not even want to use time to find it out. It works fine enough with 64 bit KSP (better than 32 bit almost stock KSP in Windows 7) and takes minimum effort for set up and maintenance."},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:27:11Z","Content":"Linux, you get stable 64 bit.
