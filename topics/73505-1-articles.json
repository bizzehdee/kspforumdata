Launch was the most difficult portion as the third stage didn\u0027t quite have enough DV to get me out of the atmosphere. I ended up having to pump about 3/4ths of the third stage\u0027s fuel into the second stage to get the altitude I needed. After that everything went pretty smooth, despite one of my injection engines overheating and blowing up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Mods used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SXT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RLA stockalike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Procedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-HGR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Gz4TH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Don\u0027t think I\u0027ve done a full moon mission with the N1 yet, normally end up doing something slightly stupid like turning it into a plane. Never could get the dV balance for it to quite to my liking; so it does have a slight tendency to run out fuel too early, or still have tonnes left depending on payload, FAR, etc. Been playing with the HGR myself recently as well, they\u0027re great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, did you happen to lose an engine on the munar injection stage?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T17:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm yea, during my injection burn it overheated and exploded.
