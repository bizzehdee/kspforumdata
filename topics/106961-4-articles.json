I tried using two Nervas but I end up spending more fuel than I should, so this won\u0027t be visiting Mun anytime soon. But with a little tweaking I think I can. Yes, I also added turbojets, if only to get to altitude faster. I like the fact that I keep experimenting on engine combinations a lot now. ![yay4WlA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yay4WlA.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T04:03:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\\_herrera**"}]}
