I\\\u0027ve been playing around with KSP for about a week now. I feel like a 6 year old again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a kid my parents took me to the Science Museum in london. As part of their space exhibition they had a very simple rocket simulator. All monochrome green and black, you could set number of stages, fuel load etc and try to get into orbit! Since then I\\\u0027ve been wishing for something similar and KSP seems to fit the bill pretty well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just managed a successful Mun landing, assisted by mechjeb since Im a little bit rubbish at killing my speed accross the surface. Hopefully I\\\u0027ll be able to get the hang of manual landing before long! Then just work out how to get back to Kerbin reliably!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T07:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmiral Sordid\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T15:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T23:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStowaway Elven_sword\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T01:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewbie GoodGuy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T02:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of these silly imitators of the Cap\\\u0027n\\\u0027s signature greeting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\\\u0027d like to welcome you to the forums, which, as you can see, are pretty friendly and occasionally somewhat silly.
