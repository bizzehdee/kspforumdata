It\u0027s basically a really big crossbow. Except ours is really small, so it\u0027s basically a stationary crossbow. But made out of K\u0027nex because we couldn\u0027t get ahold of anything super high quality that would bend enough in the limited build size we had, and K\u0027nex is easily modifiable.\u00A0Skipping all of the fluff, the goal of the experiment was to see whether mounting it on wheels would have any effect on the range (duh, they reduce the range, it should be a no brainier, but apparently it isn\u0027t). So we did that experiment, recording launch angle and range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the problem. Our teacher wants us to calculate maximum height reached by the projectile, as well as launch velocity and stuff. So I plugged the range and angle into an equation to get the maximum height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it came out really low. I triple checked myself, and I\u0027m absolutely sure it went more than 1.5 feet upwards... I\u0027d say more than 4 feet.\u00A0But I think I found out why. The launch actually happens 9 inches above the ground, which throws off our equations because the launch and landing altitudes are different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the data I have, I don\u0027t think I can calculate the launch velocity.

But they aren\u0027t, and I don\u0027t know the range\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eat that elevation\u003C/em\u003E, only the range at altitude 0. And I can\u0027t find that, because I don\u0027t know the impact angle, which is steeper than 33 degrees because the projectile had more time to fall. But how much time? I don\u0027t know. I could approximate it to 33 or 40 degrees but that wouldn\u0027t be accurate. The only way I can think of doing this would be to draw this on something that can do graphs and then manipulate the parabola to to start and end at that point while having a 33 degree angle, and then I\u0027d have the final angle and the maximum height,\u00A0which I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I can use to find the initial launch velocity, but I don\u0027t know how to express that mathematically, which is something that is strongly encouraged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? If this is an impossible problem then I\u0027ll alter our paper so that it displays the values assuming the same altitude, but with a disclaimer saying that it\u0027s just for a comparison and isn\u0027t really accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I could do several more trials with the ballista and record average time or max height, or even set up a slow motion camera, ruler, and stopwatch to find the launch velocity, but I most likely won\u0027t have the time to do that before the project is due.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-09T04:12:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2019 04:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ultimate Steve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-09T05:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223518878\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221547006882\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the data I have, I don\u0027t think I can calculate the launch velocity.

Calculus can determine the slope of a graph at any point. This is done by finding the derivative of a function, which is another function that returns a line with the slope for any point on a function. The derivative of ax^2 \u002B bx \u002B c is ax \u002B b.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, we know two things about your trajectory (working from the stationary one here) it passes through (-4.68, 0.75) and (4.68, 0), these being the launch and landing points. Alone, these are not enough to find a specific parabola. However, we also have the launch angle. We convert angle into slope with tan(theta), so\u00A0tan(33) (make sure to use degrees, not radians)\u00A0is ~0.65. We know that f(x) = ax^2 \u002B bx \u002B c, and the derivative, f\u0027(x) = ax \u002B b. We know that at x = -4.68,\u00A0the function has a slope ~0.65. Therefore f\u0027(-4.68) = 0.65 \u002B b. We don\u0027t care about b, so we just go for the fact that ax = 0.65, or a(-4.68) = 0.65. We solve to get a ~ -0.14.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we have a foot in the door, and with two other points we can find b and c.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nf(-4.68) = 0.75\u003Cbr\u003E\nf(4.68) = 0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a system of linear equations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na(-4.68)^2 \u002B b(-4.68) \u002B c = 0.75\u003Cbr\u003E\na(4.68)^2 \u002B b(4.68) \u002B c =0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis wouldn\u0027t be enough to solve, but for the fact that we already know a!
