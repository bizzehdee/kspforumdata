It\u0027s not critical since it\u0027s not game braking but those involved in aviation will understand this since it\u0027s not a game immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen at the launchpad we can see the flag at the flagpole of KSC waving and the flag is pointing east, that is at 90 degrees heading. According to the wind, pilots place the plane against the wind in order to have an easy and safe take-off/landing. So according to the flag\u0027s direction which is 90 degrees, the wind always blows from that direction, the planes at the runway should be placed against the wind at runway 27 and not 09. So my suggestion for better immersion is either place the planes at runway 27 and not 09 or make the flag waving at west which would mean a wind coming form 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain i mention this is not game braking and the devs can fix this if they want to. (I won\u0027t loose my sleep over it if they won\u0027t)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T16:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there are two flags and each of them goes in different direction if I\u0027m not mistaken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kookoo_gr","CreatedById":57720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T16:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell in that case they need to fix both the flagpoles \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

So at the west end of the runway, the wind goes east, yes - but at the east end, where you\u0027re likely to be actually taking off after having built up speed, it blows west.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T21:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe flagpoles are robotic, obvisouly\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
