If you want to drop the part count further, replace the arrays of solar panels with 4 of the large models. This particular model is designed to leave its final launch stage in Kerbin orbit as a rendezvous-capable refill station.

Choosing a Kethane mining target can be deceptive since the scanner reports the size of the last known Kethane deposit regardless of whether your current position happens to be where that deposit is or not.

The first and most important one is, keep your ISP as high as possible! Atomic engines may be massive, but they give you the best resulting delta-V in the game and are ideal for any body that is not Kerbin, Tylo, or Laythe. The other big one is to not bring any Kethane up from the surface if you can possibly avoid it. Even optimal conversion conditions result in a 1% loss when converting, meaning you\u0027re trucking extra weight up to orbit that won\u0027t pay for itself as efficiently as a minimalist LV-N-powered fuel tug will get you. That\u0027s only made worse when you consider all of the extremely heavy equipment that Kethane mining requires by proxy (drills, a converter, extra power generation, and so on). The side-effect of this is that you only ever need absolutely minimal Kethane storage on a mining rig. Of course, if you\u0027ve decided you won\u0027t be using Quantum Fuel Transfer or Merlin\u0027s Resource Transfer System, that can lead to some interesting (but very possible to deal with!) problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-16T23:45:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2013 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KWall24","CreatedById":58403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T01:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif I make a mobile mining rig, with a kethane tank and drills and a converter on one \u0027cart\u0027, and then dock that to a fuel tank/rcs \u0027cart\u0027, will it function properly?

You just have to get the tug properly over the top of the mining rig, and let magnetism do its thing!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T04:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
