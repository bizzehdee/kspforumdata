If I was doing an impulse burn (full deltaV change in 0 time), the MechJeb prediction would be true.

In a low gravity field, or with high TWR, this is negligible.

Thanks for putting that together. Based on my vision for the mod though, the Supernova is the best engine offered. The next engine I do will offer performance in between the Supernova and the NERVA (what we knew as the LV-N, which now burns liquid fuel only, apparently). The Trinity NSWR motor would be too overpowered, so the Triton, with its high-thrust mode that\u0027s a step behind the Mainsail and consumes LFO, and its low-thrust mode that is liquid fuel only but is still more thrust than the Nerva, should fit the bill. I also want to make a 0.625m mini-nuke that can be stacked or radially attached. Hm... that might be a reason to redo the nuclear aerospike...

You still have to worry about overheating, but for the time being it won\u0027t be tied to part temperature (at least until I see how 1.0 affects temperature). Oh, and the mod now gives you a custom part category, and the ArcJet RCS thrusters are fixed, and the Supernova and fusion reactor remember their last state. So pretty much the mod is ready for 1.0, and just needs an update to ModuleManager and InfernalRobotics. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T05:38:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T05:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I have removed all the mega-overpowered late-game engines, so now it is easier to see my (and my friends\u0027) other suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Trinity NSWR motor would be too overpowered, so the Triton, with its high-thrust mode that\u0027s a step behind the Mainsail and consumes LFO, and its low-thrust mode that is liquid fuel only but is still more thrust than the Nerva, should fit the bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat?

In the NASA paper, the engine is designed to run continuously. The ship flips around mid way to slow down. Since KSP doesn\u0027t let you do that very well (it would require many hours of boredom) I chose to increase the thrust and decrease the ISP in the interests of gameplay. My test craft, with four 3.75m liquid hydrogen tanks from NFT, gets something like 56k delta-v. You can go anywhere in the kerbol system and back with that much delta-v.
