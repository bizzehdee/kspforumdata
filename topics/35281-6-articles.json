Basically, it has to do with how to organize the parts from the computer\u0027s point of view. A tree is a very simple to implement and well understood data structure, but it\u0027s strictly a one-to-many data organization. To allow many-to-many, which is what would be necessary to get around this, you\u0027d have to use something more complex than a tree, which could seriously complicate part traversal and a few other things. For example, with a tree, if you have one part failure in a craft, you now have two craft, unless nothing was attached to the part that failed. With a many-to-many structure, you may or may not have two craft, and separating the two craft into two separate data structures may be harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if the restriction comes from Unity, there\u0027s not much they can do about it beyond special-case stuff like struts, and if the restriction comes from their own code, they can change it, but it\u0027s probably not as easy a change as you\u0027d think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheUndeadFish","CreatedById":67157,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T23:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eanybody know why the decision was made to use the old PluginData folder instead of making the whole thing all-inclusive in GameData instead?

If you turn it into a loop system, those calculations become a lot more convoluted and intricate (and could also result in a lot more errors, think Return of the Kraken). It\u0027s a lot less complicated to figure out how physical forces interact on something that is represented by a linear chain.

Yeah, those transfer lines are a bit troublesome because of the way they\u0027re represented.
