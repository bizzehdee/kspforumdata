I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always been interested in astronomy, space travels etc and I also have a tendency to get addicted to simulation games.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m currently trying to make Apollo-style interplanetary travels. Not sure if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an efficient way but it feels good to travel in style \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sadly while performing some early tests, Bob, Bill and Jebediah lost their lives due to parachute failure/bug).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lZgHM4w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lZgHM4w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is Melvin Kerman landed at Dres (terrible destination if you ask me), ready to take off and dock with the CM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really use mods except MechJeb for the additional information and also some visual enhancement stuffs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it pretty much.
