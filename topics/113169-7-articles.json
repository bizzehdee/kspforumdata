Squad has officially reached the fanbase dissonance event horizon, where no hope for a proper handling of the post-release strategy for this game can ever possibly escape. Here we have a once promising game bursting with potential now hobbling along as a disparate hodge-podge of incomplete features, imbalanced gameplay, and inconsistent styling that is (mercifully) completely fixable by third party modification, and yet due to the limited vision of what can only reasonably be described as an exhausted and impatient corporate structure none of these highly sought after improvements and rebalances have or will ever likely be remarked upon with any commitment or ambition. I am now fully convinced that the future of KSP lays solely in your hands, modding community. As somebody who does not nor plans to ever own a Playstation 4, X-Bone, WiiWiggle or whatever they\u0027re calling it now, I honestly (and forgive me for my bluntness) could not give two flying ****s about KSP being on PS4. Why anybody thought this would be a good idea is likely to elude me for many months, before I inevitably give up the good crusade of hoping Squad will ever again release a bit of news that is even remotely in line with the general concensus of the community it was made for and just download 42 gigabytes of realism mods.\u003Cp\u003EI give up, guys.
