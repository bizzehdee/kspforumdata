With the power of current generation PS4 and the flexibility and ease of use of the Unity engine, bringing KSP over to the PS4 is simply a no brainer. Space is for everyone, regardless of how you prefer to play.\n\u003E \n\u003E How will the game work on PS4?\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another thing we had asked ourselves for quite a while and simply had to make a goal: We could simply not compromise on players\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 experience. Thankfully, the PS4 controller has systems that make building and flying rockets just as easy and intuitive as the PC version.\n\u003E \n\u003E How are you bringing Kerbal Space Program to PS4?\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve teamed up with Flying Tiger Entertainment to bring the game to PS4. They have experience and have shown us time and time again that they were simply the right choice to make sure that the players receive a quality game on their PS4, and not a lazy port.\n\u003E \n\u003E Will this have a negative effect on the development of the PC version?\n\u003E \n\u003E Absolutely not. If anything, working in collaboration with Flying Tiger has helped us speed up processes like the Unity 5 upgrade, but in general the two will remain separate versions of the game, much like the educational version TeacherGaming works on!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/344-Kerbal-Space-Program-is-coming-to-PlayStation-4-What-does-that-mean-for-you)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T10:37:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Blondai","CreatedById":80004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:38:11Z","Content":"Am I the only one pleased by this (I have crap laptop)....

Squad has officially reached the fanbase dissonance event horizon, where no hope for a proper handling of the post-release strategy for this game can ever possibly escape. Here we have a once promising game bursting with potential now hobbling along as a disparate hodge-podge of incomplete features, imbalanced gameplay, and inconsistent styling that is (mercifully) completely fixable by third party modification, and yet due to the limited vision of what can only reasonably be described as an exhausted and impatient corporate structure none of these highly sought after improvements and rebalances have or will ever likely be remarked upon with any commitment or ambition. I am now fully convinced that the future of KSP lays solely in your hands, modding community. As somebody who does not nor plans to ever own a Playstation 4, X-Bone, WiiWiggle or whatever they\u0027re calling it now, I honestly (and forgive me for my bluntness) could not give two flying \\*\\*\\*\\*s about KSP being on PS4. Why anybody thought this would be a good idea is likely to elude me for many months, before I inevitably give up the good crusade of hoping Squad will ever again release a bit of news that is even remotely in line with the general concensus of the community it was made for and just download 42 gigabytes of realism mods.\n\u003E I give up, guys.
