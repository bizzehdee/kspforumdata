Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface EVA. Unlike the Command/Service Module (CSM), which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by silver-zinc batteries, so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until re-entry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible. In particular, the LM\u0027s Abort Guidance System was used for most of the coast back to Earth instead of the primary guidance system, as it used less power and water.[4]pp. III\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u02DC17,33,40\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdodders","CreatedById":85280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T20:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick Q does the Big G have enough delta-V to return from minimus?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmikesecrist3","CreatedById":99603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T20:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou might have to dock in orbet with a trans stage... there was some talk of useing an agena for that for a perposed gemi luner fly by\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T21:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuick Q does the Big G have enough delta-V to return from minimus?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig G was designed for maneuvering and orbital operations, and not really return trips from minimus.
