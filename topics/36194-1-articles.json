The \u0022trick\u0022 is called the Kepler\u0027s 3rd Law. T\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = ka\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 for some constant k, where T is the period of time required to complete the orbit and a is semi-major axis. You can compute the later by taking planet\u0027s radius \u002B (periapsis \u002B apoapsis)/2. For the synchronous orbit, T = sidereal day, which is 6 hours for Kerbin. So say you have second satellite too close behind the first one. They both complete a full rotation in 6 hours. That\u0027s 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 around Kerbin. In 6 hours and 1 minute the first satellite will move 361\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. So if you make the second satellite\u0027s period 6 hours and 1 minute, you will increase the separation between them by 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 for one revolution. If you keep your periapsis at synchronous altitude of 2,868.7 km and raise apoapsis to 2,881.6 km, the period will be exactly 1 minute longer. Feel free to check that with the Kepler\u0027s 3rd above. Now, if you only need to move by 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, you raise apoapsis to that altitude, wait for 1 full revolution, and bring apoapsis back down to circularize back at synchronous. If you need to move 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, you can wait for five revolutions. Or you can re-compute the new altitude to go 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in one turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, you can also catch up by lowering the periapsis. In either case, a few maneuvers like that, and you should have all your sats aligned.

Does sound like this could help you out a bit though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a nuclear-powered probe carrier into orbit that was carrying five ion-powered probes. I raised the carrier\u0027s periapsis to geosynchronous altitude (2868.4km) and then moved it\u0027s apoapsis to 1225km.

I repeated this twice more, creating a network of three satellites each 120 degrees apart. I fine tuned the orbits to make sure that they stayed in roughly the same place for the next few months of in-game time.

Make sure it has plenty of fuel. Achieve your desired orbit, release satellite 1. Then, say you want to space the rest out 90 degrees, i.e. a quarter of an orbit: burn retrograde until your orbital period (as shown by the Flight Engineer) is 3/4ths of the orbital period of your desired orbit. (So if you want the satellites in geosychronous orbit, which means an orbital period of 6 hours, you burn retrograde until your orbital period is 6 * 0.75 = 4.5 hours.) Time-warp until you complete a full orbit, and then burn prograde again until you\u0027re in the proper orbit. Release satellite 2, which should be a quarter of an orbit away from the previous satellite. Rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuel savings and greater accuracy, you can make smaller retrograde burns and complete more orbits. For example, if you wanted to space the probes out 90 degrees as in the previous example, you can burn retrograde until your orbital period is 7/8ths, then wait two full orbits before burning prograde again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of this method is that the satellites don\u0027t need any propulsion mechanism of their own, saving weight.

The disadvantage is that it takes more time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike SRV Ron said, though, rounding errors will tend to make every satellite constellation drift apart eventually. It\u0027s usually not possible to reliably get a margin of error for your orbital period of less than 0.3 seconds. You can use HyperEdit to put your satellites into a truly perfect orbit they\u0027ll never drift out of (so long as you don\u0027t select the satellites, their orbits won\u0027t change due to rounding), if you don\u0027t mind cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-07T16:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the not so fancy math on how to calculate the time required for transfer \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24623-Tutorial-Video-Krash-Test-Kerbals-How-to-science%21?p=303586\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post303586\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, late in the video, I think it\u0027s the last 10 minutes or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also don\u0027t need mods.
