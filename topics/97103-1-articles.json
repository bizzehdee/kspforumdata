The top of the ship was tipping over at its weak point, the docking port just under the orange tank (you can see a small space there in the first picture). I rectified the issue by attaching some bars from the side tanks to the adapter to help hold it together. This worked perfectly, and the bars came off without any issues when it came time to disconnect the Kerbodyne engine/fuel tanks. I also moved the boosters a bit lower down the rocket because they were having issues with colliding with the Kerbodyne tanks when jettisoned.
