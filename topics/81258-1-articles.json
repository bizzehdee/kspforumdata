In 0.24 what\u0026#039;s the difference between First Contract and Career Mode?","CreatedByName":"TimKerbin","CreatedById":83805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T17:36:29Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"TimKerbin","CreatedById":83805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T17:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was playing 0.23.5. in Career Mode. Then I upgraded to 0.24.2. I transferred all my \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eships, Career Mode, sub-assemblies, saves over and launched the game. Everything was as I \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexpected; I could launch my ships in the VAB regardless of the cost, because I was \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplaying in Career Mode, and had unlocked everything. Only now, it won\u0027t let me launch \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANY of my ships; it keeps telling me \u0022Not enough funds to launch\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s changed? One minute I could launch any vessel I had created prior to upgrade, now \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit won\u0027t let me. I need to be clear on this: Does First Contract change Career Mode in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esuch a way that it still requires funds? If so, then I still don\u0027t understand why it let me \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch these vessels before. I was playing 0.24.2 in Career Mode. I selected \u0022Tim-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer\u0022 in the menu screen. I loaded a ship, and launched it. Now it won\u0027t let me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the only way to get funds is through Mission Control, First Contract, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut that\u0027s not what I selected. I was playing Career Mode! Unless of course Mission Control is now part of Career Mode? Grr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have dozens of vessels in the VAB; I earned everything in Career Mode; I have over 20000 science points, I unlocked everything in R\u0026amp;D. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027ll have to stick to 0.23.5 unless I want to do it all over again. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T17:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s three modes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Sandbox (No science, unlimited money, no R\u0026amp;D)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Science (Science, unlimited money, R\u0026amp;D)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Career (Science, limited money, R\u0026amp;D)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the 0.23.5 career mode got divided into two, One with money and one without it.
