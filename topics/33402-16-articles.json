I would do (and have done) exactly the same. We will just have to wait patiently like the good Kerbals we are - we certainly don\u0027t have any means of payment to persuade planet builders to divulge their secrets - all we have is this rather pungent and flammable Kethane, and you probably have enough of that yourself. You will also have to ignore the angry self-righteous persons among us. They have yet to realise that you have no obligation to them whatsoever other than the forum rules. Speaking of which, there should be one requiring all mod makers to stay in character as the head of the \u0022organisation\u0022 producing the mod at least some of the time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat to hear about the easter eggs.

That\u0027s just absurd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it would be pretty neat if, upon first entering Jool\u0027s SOI, a bunch of tiny new moons appeared in addition to the big ones you already knew about, simulating all the new tiny moons discovered by probes like Voyager. This sort of \u0022fog of war\u0022 is realistic... as long as certain things are kept in mind, such as distance as well as size. Gilly in orbit of Saturn might not have been discovered until space probe era, but Gilly in orbit around Venus would have probably been discovered by Galileo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-18T21:06:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2013 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T01:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEris (which is bigger and more massive than Pluto) was discovered in 2005.
