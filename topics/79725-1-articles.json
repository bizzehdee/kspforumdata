If you want to put a barn on the end of a pancake of boosters you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Aerodynamic failures, Back when you used FAR it was far from done. You should try it now, that there is a more complete model. While it does, if you design a rocket with some form of aerodynamic thought behind it, will cost less delta Velocity to achieve orbit.
