Using chimps would\u0027ve have lead to only one of the two achievements, tests relating to OUTSIDE the spacecraft. However there are a few ways that using a chimp WOULD\u0027VE been better than a person, such as Scott Carpenter\u0027s mission. He had used up too much RCS and he had to hope (or in other words ASSUME) he had the capsule in the right direction, because he had no propellant ANYWHERE on the spacecraft.
