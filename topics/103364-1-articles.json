This would be the first steps i\u0027d take at making a more capable SSTO. Switched the rapier engine to a jet/atomic combo (use action groups 1 and 2). Did heavy work on the back end to accommodate the new engine configuration. seeing as its heavier the center of lift needed to be shifted back and decided to cluster the intakes in the back while i was at it. Left the front mostly untouched but that would be the next area i\u0027d work on. Just did this rather quickly for fun.
