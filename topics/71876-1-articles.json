Side note: I\u0027ve rarely ever used this mod for anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a low burning engine (See below) and a tank full of Kethane (8k). It took the entire 8k tank of Kethane just to encounter Eeloo. Is that correct or am I not using this properly? I had MechJeb do the encounter just to see how well 8k of Kethane could do. I used the large converter and it had a cooling efficiency of around 83%. I was converting while in flight and my electrical charge was sufficient. The flight started at 850km of Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to improve upon this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T23:42:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jas1126\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T07:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first advice?

Also, I advise you try to and send the tank to Eeloo without Kethane, and mine it when you get there. Also, it will benefit you to set up a fuel depot, with kethane storage, and conversion units, and just dock and refuel from it. Fact is, while kethane itself is just as efficient as LF/O before and after conversion, you are also having to carry the conversion equipment, along with what you need to power it. That means a lot of extra dead weight, and that really cuts into your DV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas1126","CreatedById":99760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T09:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy first advice?
