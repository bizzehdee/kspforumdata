I have fixed them (I hope) and sent you a PR:\n\nPlease note: I have only tested they validate. Not play tested. I\u0027m still getting alot of warnings in the log (in particular the SCan Mission), you may wish to look into that.\n\nAll (most) contracts\n\nFixed reward multipliers (will now scale using stock multipliers depending on the body the base is landed on). That one is my bad, as I left it out of KSS and I know you borrowed heavily.\n\nOutpostCreate\n\nFixed CC\u0027s bad handling of notes\n\nOutpost Abandon\n\nFixed broken target vessel indentifiers\n\nFixed invalid identifier in synopsis\n\nFixed invalid identifier in description\n\nHeld CC\u0027s hand so it could parse the correct Celestial Body\n\nOutpost Crew\n\nFixed bad CC handling in title.\n\nCleaned up the english to make it clearer as to what the player has to do.\n\nI\u0027ve also reported a couple of things to nightingale, as I\u0027m not sure it was actually wrong, just CC was handling it badly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T13:01:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T22:47:51Z","Content":"severedsolo,\n\nWondering if you have an eta on the release of the merged packs?"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmoBro","CreatedById":142301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-27T20:24:00Z","Content":"Hello everyone, I was offline due to lack of available time.
