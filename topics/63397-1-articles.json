As to landing on Tylo, it seems the main difficulty lies in doing it with a reusable SSTO lander, especially if you put a capsule on it. Like if for some twisted reason you wanted to establish a base there and required regular traffic between ground and orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T06:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell done!

I thought my Tylo lander was good back when I did it, but I think I could do it with a smaller ship now. But I\u0027d want a minimal capsule and more habitat space/rover for surface exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
