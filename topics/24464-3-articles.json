Almost. The trouble occurs in the final stage when the launcher is down to the core rockets, and due to the CoM being slightly towards the top of the ring, the entire structure tries, and succeeds, to snap in half, right above the large decoupler (which I don\u0027t intend to use, I just left it on because it houses the probe parts and propellant). Also by itself the Longbow doesn\u0027t fly straight, pulling up with the engines on. Or down, can\u0027t remember. Not straight anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CMnFh21.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CMnFh21.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?fdmpbml2db970oi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?fdmpbml2db970oi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027m out of ideas to fix it, apart from scrapping the whole thing and starting again from scratch. Also, it seems to think it\u0027s a spaceplane, as whenever I end the flight to reset, it gives me the button for the spaceplane hanger instead of the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also made a few more tweaks to the Dragunov design, switching out the poodles for 45s and the front most rocket tank for plain jet fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FuIQ2uq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FuIQ2uq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2P8efci.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222P8efci.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?xt3zz7oim6doove\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?xt3zz7oim6doove\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies fine, till about 18km when the fuel drain changes the CoM too much and the ASAS starts foaming at the mouth.
