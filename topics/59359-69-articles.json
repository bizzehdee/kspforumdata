Robo Struts can still be placed in the VAB/SPH but can\u0027t be interacted with in flight. It\u0027s kind of a big deal since I rely heavily on Robo Struts when docking ships together with smaller docking ports. In fact I never used the Clamp-o-tron Jr. until I got Robo Struts. Now, I\u0027m afraid to Focus view on half my ships cause the struts aren\u0027t working and I\u0027m afraid they will fly apart. \u003Cp\u003E Zodius, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you get time to look into this one issue that would be super duper awesome squassom of you.

And Robostruts is now under the umbrella of IR. The dependencies for Robostruts have not been officially updated and Zodious has been on a bit of a much needed break.
