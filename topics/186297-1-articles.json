superconductor at or before that point.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say our initial power supply was\u00A050 kV and our system is at 25 kV when we quench it.\u00A0 The quench multiplies the voltage across the device by thousands of times.\u00A0 Giving us 25 MV across the device and 2.5 MV across a hundred layers of capacitors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion

fusion rates, but losses are really bad and\u00A0prevent them from being breakeven. its why im a huge polywell proponent because you take the fusor, and replace the grids (which both contaminate plasma and provide conduction of energy away from the fusion reaction), with a virtual\u00A0cathode (created by injecting electrons into a magnetic grid, or magrid) which should give you all the benefits of a fusor without the disadvantages. one thing they seem to be doing that nobody else seems to be doing is to design the machine entirely with computer models so that they can really optimize their demo machine before its built. but the next machine they will build will likely be a demo machine that can reach scientific breakeven. bussard just wanted to skip ahead and build a big reactor, and that was what he was trying to fund with his google talk before he died. park is taking a more conservative approach, but the plan is to still have a demo in the early

proton-boron you can just let the neutrons go as they are only a tenth of a percent of the fusion products anyway. the alpha particles can be direct converted to electricity, which for a spacecraft really reduces the radiator requirements and eliminates the need for a thermodynamic engine to recover the energy. direct conversion should also be more efficient than a brayton cycle. alternately you
