Just started the game, loaded my save and when in the KSC screen, pressed my screenshot key (set to p). This resulted in a shot with supersampling of 1. Then I did it once more, again a shot with ss 1. Then I from the toolbar opened the gui (it said ss 3) and closed it without changing anything. Then I pressed the sc key again, which resulted in a shot with ss 3. It seems that the setting is only loaded when the gui is opened up. Can you reproduce this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"synik4l","CreatedById":76492,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T19:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022papics\u0022 data-cite=\u0022papics\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, did a test today.

Also if it does happen. open your config.xml at that point. and paste it in here. I\u0027m thinking maybe over the updates. possibly something got screwed up in that file. As its been sorta changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: actually I did get it to happen. Your right for some reason when the UI is opened. Upon scene change it isnt loaded. But thats odd cus, I load the settings on awake(). That\u0027s like immediately upon load. It actually says it loads in the debug window. But then when I take a shot it takes it at 1 till I open the window. So i\u0027ll look into why the values are getting set unless the windows exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother edit: Just figured out why. I\u0027ll have a fix out for it by tomorrow or monday(its alil tricky). As i\u0027m also making it so when you set a key. Its more like binding a key. Than typing the keycode in a field. So i\u0027m changing the text fields to buttons. and once you hit the corresponding button you can set either showUI or the ss key.
