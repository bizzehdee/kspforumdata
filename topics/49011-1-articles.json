Before the new career mode I mostly made heavy lift rockets to build stations, using the KW pack. MechJeb made the many many launches less much better \u0026amp; more efficient, and to be honest I don\u0027t like flying/landing manually. I want to know if my creations can fly, I know that with me controlling them most of them fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the engine, no it was poor design.
