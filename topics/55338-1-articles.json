It\u0027s made up of organic polymers that are all tangled up with each other (i.e. it\u0027s not a crystalline solid). When you heat it up, rather than untangling the polymers, you\u0027ll sooner break the intra-molecular chemical bonds and your \u0022melt\u0022 would actually be a vapor chemically very different from the initial notebook. This is very much unlike simpler compounds which when heated first break their crystal structure, but each molecule in a melt and further on in a vapor retains the original chemical composition. You can also heat up some thermoplastic plastics and see, that they don\u0027t really have a fixed melting point, they just gradually get softer as they warm up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T10:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would happen with some materials in an anoxic environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike plastics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T10:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on how you stop the combustion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombustion is a chemical reaction.

However, your notebook is a mixture of different kinds of molecules, so different parts will melt at different points. Furthermore, your notebook is technically already liquid since it is made of organic polymers. This means it consists of a bunch of long chains that are so tangled with one another that they appear solid. polymers have a whole host of interesting states depending on temperature and pressure. I suspect a text book would become rubbery before it melts and then get an ever lower viscosity as it heats up. It would also outgas a lot of the lighter molecules, so if you cool it later on it\u0027ll probably feel a lot more like hard plastic (those small molecules act as lubricants so the material remains supple).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf chemical reactions are still possible and you\u0027re just heating stuff in a oxygen free environment the molecules will fall apart long before you even get close to the melting point.
