Open it up and click through the pictures, and you can notice that the shadow lines move from left to right (and repeat, and repeat, and repeat...).

Either run in OpenGL to reduce the jaggedness of the shadows by a good amount, or change the setting for Render Quality to simple or fast to simply just get rid of the building shadows / all shadows, respectively. Works good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still weird though. If I zoomed in, the shadows would look totally normal and smooth. But if I zoom out, any shadows outside a certain view radius would be horribly jagged and flicker with any slight camera movement. There\u0027s a very clear border between the smooth shadows and jagged shadows, based on how close you\u0027re zoomed in on something.
