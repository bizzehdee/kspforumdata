Now, is isn\u0027t using the Saturn V parts pack or anything like that. No, it\u0027s simply meant to resemble the essence of the Saturn V/Apollo Spacecraft Assembly. Sure the first stage only has 4 engines instead of 5, and the MEM sits on top of the command module to start, rather than waiting until orbit (not until we get docking, folks!). However, it resembles the Saturn V in so many ways, that I think I did it a great service. At launch, you can feel the power, the weight, the car alarms going off and windows breaking miles away.

After my previous concept, I found the KW LEM, and worked on getting that to the Mun, but I felt like it needed something more, and so I built (as close as possible) the Saturn V assembly below it. Turns out, if you make a rocket that is similar to a real life rocket, it\u0027ll actually function in a very similar way!
