However, I feel kind of \u0027eh\u0027 about the new wings. Yes, it\u0027s nice to finally have a few large parts, but I just don\u0027t really understand why we have these. Because of their thicker profile, they don\u0027t really mesh well with the other wings. Furthermore, since there aren\u0027t any square-ish parts, they basically only work if those wings are exactly what you need, or add multiple of them after each other, which works, but is somewhat aesthetically unpleasing.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:20:54Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think planes need to be aesthetically pleasing to work properly, but it would help to have large square wings.

The airliner wings would work fine for MK3... If they were about two or three times bigger. The shuttle-inspired ones need to be about a third bigger just to look right on the MK3 (though I haven\u0027t studied the shuttle too closely, so maybe they\u0027re the right size, but they need a little more lift to be feasible), and we really need more large-square-wing pieces.\n\nAlso, anyone else feel that with the new landing gear, we need some plane parts that allow the construction of small, light-duty passenger planes? While I\u0027m not complaining about the MK1 Inline\u0027s new IVA (best cockpit ever, now that you don\u0027t need mods to see out of it), it is a little underwhelming when you realize that either you\u0027ve got to have multiple blister seats (Inlines) for each crewmember/VIP, or you need to step into MK2 parts, which, while they look very good, can be a pain in the bum to work with. Would be nice to have, say, a 1.8m sized 4 Kerbal cockpit, in pilot/copilot \u002B 2 passenger style.
