change focus back and forth between the active vessel and the target body, allowing you to adjust the node position when focused on the vessel and allowing you to see the result when focused on the target body.\u00A0 The backspace key returns focus to the active vessel, but the only ways to focus on a celestial body are to click on it and choose \u0027Set Focus\u0027 or to use the Tab key and go through the bodies in the system until you get to the one you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re not averse to using mods, you can use Precise Node or MechJeb\u0027s built-in
