Hope You all enjoy\n\nI present the Razor \n\nA SSTO able to lift a small comm sat in LKO. \n\nI like very much how it glides when empty. \n\nI guess on Reflection I do use mods..None that change game play. Aviation Lights,.Kerp Paint Brings Life to the Skins of the planes and Chattter helps with the ambiance. Mods feel free to move post to proper fourms.\n\nThis plane should run fine without them..but...sooooo boring ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)!\n\nSo action group 1 =Fire Engines\n\n2 =Toggle engine Mode\n\n3= lights\n\n4= more lights!\n\nTake off at about 125 m/s\n\nUse a 20 to 30 degree angle of lift till about 10,000, when she will try to flatten out. Press 2 and burn some oxy and Lift the nose till about 15,000 Ft and 15 degree angle. Then toggle mode back to air breathers to about 20,000. I like to push out my apoasis to around 65 or 70 then coast to apo and burn to Orbit. You should have around 150 pounds of oxy left to do your retro burn, and plenty of fuel for the airbreather to correct course or find a safe landing!\n\nPeace out!\n\nLemme know your thoughts:cool:\n\n![AF81E98D9409E9AAB8405D3B22D4B9BA2C13CCA6](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846639091/AF81E98D9409E9AAB8405D3B22D4B9BA2C13CCA6/)\n\nrunway\n\n![9C26F2001FF13D1F2D857DCE85CD9051D1F471FE](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846640312/9C26F2001FF13D1F2D857DCE85CD9051D1F471FE/)\n\nTakeoff\n\n![C124515CBFBAD6DC5C75CEBF12AE3299AABB1C02](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846641924/C124515CBFBAD6DC5C75CEBF12AE3299AABB1C02/)\n\nAlmost to orbit\n\n![B78194184E2C0A30E87D5CB92179AAB8CE5951D6](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846643003/B78194184E2C0A30E87D5CB92179AAB8CE5951D6/)\n\nOrbit\n\n![EBDD9DE25A133833D1B6D29B4AD3E61D401E8BFA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846643520/EBDD9DE25A133833D1B6D29B4AD3E61D401E8BFA/)\n\nComm Sat Release\n\n![5BE539A4A89822E43621474D241576A28A68AF12](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846645079/5BE539A4A89822E43621474D241576A28A68AF12/)\n\nTurn to Retro and Burn to Location\n\n![93BDCEE0BC5AA43EDC095E12FBB3C49B80CB29A9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846646897/93BDCEE0BC5AA43EDC095E12FBB3C49B80CB29A9/)\n\nTheres KSC!\n\n![573D6A8F2085934D39A160F8E118EE916F0F25AF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846649229/573D6A8F2085934D39A160F8E118EE916F0F25AF/)\n\nSmall chutes to help slow down. dont really need them here..but sometimes you cant make KSC and may need to land in a short space.\n\n![D84373B20A60E07D0AB785991FB391F07E6FAAFF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447329129846653574/D84373B20A60E07D0AB785991FB391F07E6FAAFF/)\n\nRAZOR Craft File :[https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mninibn5rpvf2c/Razor.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mninibn5rpvf2c/Razor.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T06:18:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 06:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GraviTykillz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T02:54:09Z","Content":"Nice!
