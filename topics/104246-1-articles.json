This annoys me when landing aircraft, so I made a mod to \u0022fix\u0022 it! All it does is add another keybind, which is not in the actual keybinding menu (all the people whom I asked said it\u0027s not possible ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). So how do you change the keybinds, you ask? Well, if you right click the on-screen break button, a small GUI will show up assisting you to do this! It works nearly like the keybind menu, so it should be self explanatory. You can toggle it off by right clicking the break button again. So yeah, enjoy! I\u0027ve certainly liked the small thing it does so far!\n\nAnd if you have ANY bugs, PLEASE TELL ME!

Handy, if you need to check the map, you can just hold and press M, and know that your craft is braking... brake-ed... broken? Although, it makes me nervous, and I end up going back to check the brake light, anyway. The pause menu is nice, because you can just pop back out of it, and the brakes stay on, but ESC is more out of the way, than M is.
