Often I will flub a mission due to losing electricity and thus control by careless actions such as picking a wrong orientation for solar panels or similar. What I wanted was an \u0022oops battery,\u0022 a source of electricity that would buy me a few seconds or minutes of control in order to correct my mistake and continue the mission. And accidentally I\u0027ve found it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe requirement is two locations where electric change can be stored, let\u0027s say a battery and a pod. Set the battery to the reserve by deselecting its resource from use (green triangle to red circle-slash). Now any electrical draw will reduce the charge stored in the pod and not the battery. When the accessible charge depleted the craft is unresponsive. It is not possible to resume use on the battery part (red circle to green triangle). This is where I thought this technique reached a dead end. However I discovered that while I couldn\u0027t unlock the part resources for use, I was able to transfer resources despite having no control over the craft. It\u0027s then a simple matter to shuffle electric charge from the inaccessible battery to the accessible pod and control is resumed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus it is possible to run out of power (intentionally or not) and recover provided one has some charge stored on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T01:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you can still transfer electricity? shhhh... don\u0027t tell the devs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T01:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

They provide a bit of an electrical charge and the mass is light enough that four of them is almost the same as one solar panel.

It\u0027s entirely possible to force an electric charge from one battery into another using the right setup, however there would be entropy in the system due to heat losses which this game fails to take into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever even if one were to assume the potential energy of the electrons in the material must remain even across all connected units, it would still be possible to balance them out. In essence; if the pod\u0027s completely dead, but the reserve has juice, then you would still be able to move 50% of the power to the pod so they each have half a charge (although the batteries usually have more juice than the pods, so it would actually be like 75% or something since the meter for the pod would move up faster than the meter for the battery would move down)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rarity","CreatedById":2214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T15:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you right click fuel tanks and batteries and other resource containers and \u0022disable\u0022 them, so they do not drain? You could do that to one single battery somewhere on a ship, just in case you forget to deploy panels or you leave too many things on while warping or something. I require emergency RTGs on all craft though, with some exceptions. On more than a few occasions, I\u0027ve loaded up a ship with tons of batteries and sometimes solar panels but sometimes without solar panels.
