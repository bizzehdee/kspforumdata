My Idea is to see how many planets/moons one can get science from using only light rocket parts (no heavy rocket parts, No Mods) in career mode.

I have been having fun seeing how far and how many science point I can reach/get with the limited tech tree. I have been liking the ships/rockets I have designed to get to various places.
