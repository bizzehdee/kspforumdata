This makes the control surfaces i used on the first stage reappear in the relativ position to the command pod they were in on launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alrecenk","CreatedById":226968,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T21:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this happen to me, but it was with landing gear from a few stages back. Just one leg floating in space, drifting away, pops back on time warp and then starts drifting again, taking the camera with it. It also causes the trajectory in the map view to drift and be useless. I tried to keep going despite all this, but eventually I just exploded in empty space while not even applying thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
