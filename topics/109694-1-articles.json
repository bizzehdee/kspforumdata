I have the Medium Gear on a Mk 3 plane and when I brake, I will turn and my gear will catch on the ground, bend(for example, if I swerve to the left, my gear bends to the left), then skip off and catch again to the right, and bend again. It just skips to the side, kinda frustrating. Any ideas on what I could do? I can\u0027t strut the gear assembly... Also, if it makes any difference, My nose gear is the KAX heavy gear assembly. \n\nThanks for the help! \n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:00:47Z","Content":"Several factors can contribute to this problem:\n\nIf the rear landing gear is not perpendicular to the body of the plane, it may wobble, shake and crash. Use the rotation tool and/or shift\u002Brotation keys.\n\nIf the gears are supporting too much weight they will buckle and will have the same problems and this^; add more gears.\n\nOtherwise you should reconsider the location of the gears. Pictures would help."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:12:00Z","Content":"Thanks! I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a matter of misaligned gear, and I apologize for not having pictures, I didn\u0027t expect to need them. I\u0027ll try adding an extra set of gear, but I\u0027m a bit restricted on the placement of them for CoM reasons. I\u0027m working on a different craft now, but when I get back to it, I\u0027ll try adding more. If it doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027ll post pics and see if we can figure anything else out. \n\nThank you!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:51:02Z","Content":"you should provide a screen shot, but one reason could be as you lift your wings are flexing causing the gear to become misaligned and bouncing from one side to the other, one way to fix this is through the magic of struts, strut your main wing parts to body or the wheel housing to body usually fixes this issue. if that still doesn\u0027t solve it, its either uneven thrust but you would notice that or the gear is still misaligned."}]}
