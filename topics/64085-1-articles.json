Okay, I built half a ship, and I\u0027m not sure how I want to do the other half, so I seek inspiration. Here is what I got:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7322/12726940974_40a6de7ccf_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212726940974_40a6de7ccf_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the unfueled drive stage for my first Sentari class tour ship, christened the Nebulon. She\u0027s got 7 rockomax jumbos which, under the old design, gave her about 9000 dV without the landers and SSTOs. With them, that comes down to about 6500, but that\u0027s still enough to go pretty much anywhere, save from Jool straight to Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly uncertain about the rest of the design. I\u0027ve got a pretty good layout for the kethane refinery but I\u0027m not sure how to mount two kethane tanker landers and two Lathe (and hopefully Duna) rated SSTOs without putting them in such a way where they wobble like crazy under thrust and aerobraking. I first thought of reducing the kethane landers to 1 so I could mount it inside Porkjet\u0027s giant 5m girder bay. That would work nicely as long as I fit the SSTOs behind it, but it still leaves them untethered. The hard part is the SSTOs are docking via a dorsal port right behind the cockpit. Last option is to make it two so a multidock setup can work. This would require some interesting work and maybe modified parts to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how to deal with the docking bay situation here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khobai","CreatedById":83366,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T19:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny ideas on how to deal with the docking bay situation here? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecopious amounts of struts. thats how I keep my sstos from falling off my ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T19:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got 99 problem and a strut aint one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T19:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Khobai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Khobai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecopious amounts of struts. thats how I keep my sstos from falling off my ships.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got no quantum struts and no KAS.

So far, what I have is the girder bay sectioned off into two distinct sections, one holding the keth lander and the command runabout vehicle, and the other for the upper stage of the Tylo lander. The spaceplane docks are behind the bay. My first attempt at a multidocking SSTO was an epic fail. It ended up looking bad, performing bad, and failing to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
