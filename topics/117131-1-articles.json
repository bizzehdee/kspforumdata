It\u0027s close to 1300 range if your ship has a reasonable aero and TWR.\n\nGeneral tip:\n\n1. Don\u0027t be too afraid. If you have landed on Mun multiple times, then the gap is smaller than you thought.\n\n2. Use airbrakes (I mean the part, not the general technique of aerobrake). Otherwise you\u0027ll almost for sure need to burn to land, and that costs fuel.\n\n3. Return transfer may cost more dV if you want to return right away. Take that into account.\n\nOtherwise it isn\u0027t too much different from what you already learned to land on Kerbin moons."},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T07:03:08Z","Content":"I\u0027ll recommend a dv of 2000-2200 if you\u0027re going to do something useful on Duna. The ascent will cost around 1500, but you need to deorbit as well, and a bit if maneuvering, plane changes and such will also cost a bit. \n\nPut airbrakes for the initial entry, and plenty of chutes for the descent. Also don\u0027t count on chutes alone for the actual landing, you\u0027ll probably need a \\*very\\* short burn to slow you those last few m/s before touchdown. Just a 2-5 second burn should do, but it will also take a little from your dv budget. \n\nAnd: better safe than sorry. \n\nI\u0027ve just rebuilt my lander to have ~2500 dv. That allows for a short hop or two to make a couple of science measurements before I have to return to the mothership in orbit and refuel. \n\nGood luck."},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T09:52:54Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found that by using parachutes, most of my Mun landers can be used on Duna, as virtually all of the fuel you would use just for landing on Mun is available for the ascent on Duna."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T01:19:30Z","Content":"My solution for a Duna landing: nuclear engines. 720 fuel and two nuclear engines did it (nuclear drives lose some ISP in Duna\u0027s atmosphere, but the fuel savings are still substantial). The lander was pretty clunky, because LV-N\u0027s don\u0027t like to mount radially, but the fuel saved was worth the work in the VAB.\n\nMy big gripe with Duna right now is that the game updated one night while my ship was en route--and the sensory computing nose cone turned into a fly-by-wire avionics hub. Thereby depriving me of atmospheric scans.
