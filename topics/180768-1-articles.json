I tried to do a quick search but the posts seemed random.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a simple contract where I have to test a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E at specific conditions (example in the Imgur album). I get to those conditions, all of the ticks are green and then whatever I do, it just doesn\u0027t approve the test. I tried doing the test by staging, by pressing the \u0022run test\u0022 in the context menu. I\u0027ve tried to run the test with no fuel, partial fuel, full fuel. It just doesn\u0027t care\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible that this is because of the mods even though this happens with the vanilla parts.
