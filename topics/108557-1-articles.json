Squad made it so easy that it gave me modding disease. I modded Skyrim to the hilt, Nexus made it nearly as easy as KSP. I modded GTA IV to the max as well, even to creating signs for the trucks and billboards. Just simple texture replacements, including a Boxville with a KSP logo after Spark IV showed me what was actually in the files. KSP was the catalyst for me to begin trying these things, and introduced me to the concept of improving the games I play. Modders I love you guys! \n\nI also learned many mods together can lead to instabilities, crashes and sometimes data corruption.\n\nSo it taught me a lesson and I always, always, kept a back up vanilla after my first game corrupting mod forced me to re-download the entire game.\n\nWhat did I do? \n\nI modded my only copy of GTA V.\n\nI killed it.\n\nDead.\n\nNow I have a 60 Gig download rolling, again.\n\nI have plenty of HDD space, plenty of time, and no excuses for not making a back up.\n\nI forgot the prime directive. Mod it till it crashes, but always keep a clean vanilla copy in reserve. And now I am paying for my sins.![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:18:01Z","Content":"Well, steam has a verify files function which checks all files and only redownloads Modifed, deleted or corrupted files."},{"CreatedByName":"pslytely psycho","CreatedById":62775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:21:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, steam has a verify files function which checks all files and only redownloads Modifed, deleted or corrupted files.\n\nYeah, it still didn\u0027t work. The first time it downloaded 4 files, the second time it said all files were good. Still crashes on launch. I know I left a piece of something laying about that is causing it. A few beers and I didn\u0027t keep very good track of what I modified, nor did I keep incremental copies like I do for KSP, Skyrim and GTA IV. I got sloppy and now I pay for it.\n\nI have 9 copies of KSP, Life Support on 6, different part mods for different play styles on those six, the others are 15 minute crashers that I keep hoping will someday work together, 11 of GTA IV including one for each season, brighter colors in spring, darker greens and such for summer, autumn leaves and the Snow Mod for winter. Those eight (GTA IV and EFLC, so eight total seasonal ones) are stable and modded differently to the limits of the game. I have 6 Skyrims that are incrementals up to the civil war mod, that and 106 other mods seems to be my limit for stability.\n\nAnd of course, one copy of each of them is an unmodified vanilla file so I don\u0027t have to do this when I inevitably crash the game beyond all rescue. \n\nSo, I know better, it\u0027s my own fault!\n\n[edit] What I did was scripthooked it to accept asi mods, added that native trainer, that all worked. I borked it trying to get it to work with both a nice steering wheel setup and an Xbox One controller simultaneously with a recently reworked emulator. I thought I removed everything and reset all the config files, but I must of missed something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T11:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pslytely psycho**"},{"CreatedByName":"teepee2345","CreatedById":98846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T16:45:10Z","Content":"might be that you have modded GTA V so much that it cant handle the memory usage and it crashes"},{"CreatedByName":"pslytely psycho","CreatedById":62775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:40:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E might be that you have modded GTA V so much that it cant handle the memory usage and it crashes\n\nNo, it\u0027s a 64bit application, memory wasn\u0027t the problem.\n\nIn fact it turned out that there was nothing wrong with my modded install. The re-download version didn\u0027t work either. Turns out I ran into a bug. \n\nI had just purchased a new Canon printer/scanner. It was two days after I installed it before I got to play GTA V again. There is a known bug (wish I had read the forums BEFORE I re-downloaded it.) GTA V tries to connect and communicate with every device hooked up to the USB bus upon startup. Some devices cause it to crash on startup. \n\nSo disconnecting my printer from the USB bus fixed it. I swapped the new install with my \u0027crashed\u0027 version and viola, it works too.\n\nI assumed I crashed it, turned out it wasn\u0027t the case at all.\n\nI am so used to killing games with mods that it never occurred to me that maybe, just maybe I didn\u0027t do it. \n\nLive and learn.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[edit] In the GTA V log file (in the Rockstar folder in documents on Windows) the error to look for is called \u0027Device Lost,\u0027 the lost device is whatever it can\u0027t connect with.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T18:24:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pslytely psycho**\n  \nadded the error"}]}
