Squad made it so easy that it gave me modding disease. I modded Skyrim to the hilt, Nexus made it nearly as easy as KSP. I modded GTA IV to the max as well, even to creating signs for the trucks and billboards. Just simple texture replacements, including a Boxville with a KSP logo after Spark IV showed me what was actually in the files. KSP was the catalyst for me to begin trying these things, and introduced me to the concept of improving the games I play. Modders I love you guys! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also learned many mods together can lead to instabilities, crashes and sometimes data corruption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it taught me a lesson and I always, always, kept a back up vanilla after my first game corrupting mod forced me to re-download the entire game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did I do? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modded my only copy of GTA V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI killed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have a 60 Gig download rolling, again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have plenty of HDD space, plenty of time, and no excuses for not making a back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot the prime directive. Mod it till it crashes, but always keep a clean vanilla copy in reserve.

The first time it downloaded 4 files, the second time it said all files were good. Still crashes on launch. I know I left a piece of something laying about that is causing it. A few beers and I didn\u0027t keep very good track of what I modified, nor did I keep incremental copies like I do for KSP, Skyrim and GTA IV. I got sloppy and now I pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 9 copies of KSP, Life Support on 6, different part mods for different play styles on those six, the others are 15 minute crashers that I keep hoping will someday work together, 11 of GTA IV including one for each season, brighter colors in spring, darker greens and such for summer, autumn leaves and the Snow Mod for winter. Those eight (GTA IV and EFLC, so eight total seasonal ones) are stable and modded differently to the limits of the game. I have 6 Skyrims that are incrementals up to the civil war mod, that and 106 other mods seems to be my limit for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, one copy of each of them is an unmodified vanilla file so I don\u0027t have to do this when I inevitably crash the game beyond all rescue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I know better, it\u0027s my own fault!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] What I did was scripthooked it to accept asi mods, added that native trainer, that all worked. I borked it trying to get it to work with both a nice steering wheel setup and an Xbox One controller simultaneously with a recently reworked emulator.

It was two days after I installed it before I got to play GTA V again. There is a known bug (wish I had read the forums BEFORE I re-downloaded it.)
