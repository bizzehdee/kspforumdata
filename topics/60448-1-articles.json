Kethane integration should be as easy as getting Kethane to know your planets. If I understand it correctly, it will automatically procedurally generate the deposits on save file creation for every planet it\u0027s told to. I THINK yours can be added in a config file somewhere and that it might be doable with modulemanager. I\u0027ve never gone looking for that so don\u0027t quote me on the last bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here are my opinions on the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper Eve looks interesting. I think more variation would be nice on it but that\u0027s must me. I think there needs to be more normalization in the inclination of the moons so that transfers between them don\u0027t require stupidly high amounts of dV for inclination changes. As a general rule of thumb, I\u0027d keep the inclinations to no more than \u002B/- 20-25* maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoon terrain thoughts going down the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETuolea: Looks too mountainous. While I like the concept, I think the mountains need shrinking. Regular planet factory adds worlds that are stupidly hard to get to and land on. To me, trying to find a landing spot that isn\u0027t at a 40* angle doesn\u0027t sound like a pleasant kethane scouting trip. While the flat side that was blown off (the mountains, not mantle) look flat, the way KSP handles gravity mean you\u0027d need to manually offset the center postion to something more remeniscent of the center of mass, otherwise, landing there, which should theoretically work, would be like landing on a wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELopoer: I like the concept, but if you know how and feel like exploring it, I think the planet would benefit from getting some wavy terrain and voronoi microcratering. Perfectly smooth isn\u0027t really a challenge, but not too hilly or rocky makes for great kethane bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEros:This planet, and also Tuolea, may not be possible realistically. Solids don\u0027t necessarily behave like solids at the planetary scale. Gravity and rotation would conspire and round out both of these worlds. While I like the idea of a craggy canyon world, the perfectly north-south ridges look too artificial. I would suggest adding a few plateaus, some near bottomless pits,and making the ridgelines and canyons seem more eratic. \u0022God does not build in straight lines\u0022. Devout christian or not, the universe does not make things naturally that straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoal: I think the north pole (haha, I see what you did there) is cool, but I think it would be more interesting to have an Olympus Mons size volcano there, as well as possibly a nice craggy canyon or two in the highlands, and add some dormant volcanos in the lowlands. They got flat for a reason, probably massive laval flows. It might also sell it better if it wasn\u0027t \u0027perfectly\u0027 flat but seemed close enough and appeared formed by lava coming from fissures, volcanos, whichever you decide to go with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgoa: This one looks almost perfectly done. The lines on it look mildly unnatural, as it\u0027s rare that such coherent features would ever form in the universe, but that aside, I like this one a lot as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGhoa: This one also looks good. I think there needs to be some more variety as to the cratering size, perhaps some defining feature (single large impact crater maybe), and some more height and texture variation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, /rant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat spew of information was a lot.

Those are my first impressions looking at everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you have 5 orbits (the equatorial and polar ones have two moons in the same orbit, rare, but not impossible; also makes Hohmann transfer between them impossible), 7 moons, and only 6 pictures.
