It\u0027s definitely possible and even cost-efficient, especially if you don\u0027t have to hit a specific altitude. Because of the way your ascent profile - and thus your individual piloting - affects dV cost to orbit, creating a SRB launcher that puts you precisely into a 75x75 km orbit is impractical - the slightest piloting mistake will make you miss orbit insertion. No, you build one that deposits you into a 75x125 orbit or so, and thus even with a crass piloting mistake during ascent, you can still limp into a lower orbit. And ideally your payload is something that wants to go higher than 125 anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one thing stock KSP lacks for the purposes of all solid launchers is the lack of a suitable solid upper stage. You\u0027d want something small with a limited TWR and better-than-normal vacuum Isp (even SRBs can use vacuum nozzles, you know). But the only appropriately sized SRB stock KSP has - the Flea - has absurd amounts of thrust and the worst Isp of all SRBs.
