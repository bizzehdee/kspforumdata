I wanted to achieve this with rockets and possibly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTo\u003C/abbr\u003E type. So far today I tried with 7 different itterations, mostly with heaviest engines arround and largest tanks, but all of them failed. be it in fuel, thrust or lack of control in space. Now i got kinda puzzled. So what I would need nice idea how could new guy land main base module to mun. I admit I am not good in math, so I went hard way.

The equation looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne^[6k/(320*9.81)] = e^ (1.91) = 6.76:1 wet to dry mass ratio. This is getting perilously close to the absolute maximum of 9:1 wet- to- dry ratio of infinitely large tanks, so it\u0027s probably not worth pursuing. Digging deeper...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A06.76:1 wet/dry ratio translates to (6.76-1)/6.76 = 85.2% of your launch mass is fuel. .852* 9/8 = 95.9% of your launch mass is fuel and tanks. This leaves only 4.1% of your launch mass to engines and payload; not gonna happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can reduce engine mass and cheat the Isp by going with a spaceplane. It *can* be done this way. But since that would involve flying a giant airplane to the Mun, the \u003Cem\u003Esensible \u003C/em\u003Esolution is to stage. 2000-ish m/sec per stage. 2 stages to orbit, last stage to the Munar surface. Or alternatively, 2 stages to Munar intercept and last stage to circ and landing.
