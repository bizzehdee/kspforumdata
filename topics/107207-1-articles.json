It never experienced ANY reentry effects, and had periapsis below ground level by around 50,000 meters in altitude. This is ridiculous.\n\nSo a suggestion: Add a drag curve to parts, that changes their drag (and lift!) with altitude and speed. Especially for the MK3 parts, for the reason stated above."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:21:59Z","Content":"Can you find his VOD and a timestamp?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:45:14Z","Content":"There is already a drag curve in KSP.\n\nOpen the debug tools, click Physics, click DragProfile, edit.\n\n![GZSAH3w.png](http://i.imgur.com/GZSAH3w.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T18:38:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:51:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There is already a drag curve in KSP.\n\u003E Open the debug tools, click Physics, click DragProfile, edit.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/GZSAH3w.png](http://i.imgur.com/GZSAH3w.png)\n\nOh.\n\nWell, then perhaps it needs a bit of tweaking..."}]}
