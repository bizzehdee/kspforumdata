If I could give you another rep point I would. Ascents are tricky and even more so with shock cones. Good acceleration is a rather narrow window between fatal heating and loss of thrust. In my experience, between about 9000 and 16000m altitude, reaching speeds more than tenth of the altitude (forgive the unit mismatch) seems to promote rapid disassembly but getting past 16000 without being up to about 1300 means it\u0027ll take far longer to reach 1700, maybe even requiring a dive. If your plane is able to hold 1700\u002B, it\u0027s probably able to beat 40. My top time involved quite a few reversions to launch until I was in cruise within about T\u002B2min."},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:06:40Z","Content":"xannari, be careful with take command. it broke my game :/"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:49:29Z","Content":"Okay fellas, I\u0027m halfway around.
