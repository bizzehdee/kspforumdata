The game would start, maybe, and make it through varying stages of the loading process and then crash, requiring a hard reset of the computer. This happened both starting through Steam and through the command line via KSP.x86_64.\u00A0I have pulseaudio installed and am running 64-bit Debian linux. Setting LC_ALL=C did not solve the problem, nor did starting with the command line option -force-glcore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0solved the problem\u00A0by manually editing two config files. My issue\u00A0appeared to be caused by the screen resolution being improperly set in these config files. The key indication of this was the file ~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log: there\u0027s a line there that read something to the effect of the screen resolution being set to some insane value like 0x4096 or something equally crazy, and complaining that this was improper (yeah, I\u0027ll say!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI solved the problem as follows using a text editor:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFind your machine\u0027s actual native resolution.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet this resolution in the width and height lines in the following file, along with Fullscreen to \u00221\u0022:\u00A0~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/prefs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet this resolution in the width and height lines\u00A0in the following file, along with Fullscreen=True:\u00A0~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program/settings.cfg\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNo more bad crashes after this. I hope this helps someone else - I did quite a bit of google searching before figuring out this fix...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
