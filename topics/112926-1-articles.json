Anyone have any suggestions, I\u0027m doing it mostly with stock parts, apart from KIS, UKS,MKS and KW rocketry.\n\nIt\u0027s weight is 18 tonnes, and I want to be able to deploy it onto it\u0027s wheels without thrusters on the vehicle, is it possible? I need some ideas.\n\n![mun%20truck%20v2.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/673200/mun%20truck%20v2.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T11:44:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceSniper**\n  \nCompleted, video added, enjoy! and thanks all."},{"CreatedByName":"Rfmeijboom","CreatedById":91078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:42:29Z","Content":"You can build a sky crane to land it.\n\nOr if you can fit it in a MK3 cargo bay you could land a ship with the cargo bay pointing down and drop from there."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:47:22Z","Content":"I only see one evident attachment point, that being the nose of the pod.

You should probably bring an engineer along since I don\u0027t see anywhere to mount legs on the other end to absorb the shock of falling over, but if it\u0027s the Mun it probably won\u0027t be too bad anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:47:54Z","Content":"Skycrane and big rocket. OR, Skycrane and several launches.\n\nIn order to deploy that to the Mun without giving it thrusters of its own (and without relying on having it tip over from vertical or a very complicated lander) you\u0027ll need to rig it to a detachable skycrane. For something that size it\u0027ll likely have to be very very large and powerful. The crane will need to be able to support the weight of the rover and have the dV to land it onto the surface.\n\nTo make it simpler, I would redesign it slightly so you can get an attachment point over the rover\u0027s center of mass without disrupting the vehicles use. That way, building the crane for the rover becomes less complicated.\n\nThere are other options, but they\u0027re either absurdly complicated or involve the use of F9 many, many times."},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:53:02Z","Content":"you could land it the scary but fast way. Attach a booster onto the back of the rover for the final decent (make sure it intersects the COM). Put plane landing gear on the bottom of the Chassis and.... well.... land on the Mun. Put on the brakes and hope for the best. I\u0027ve done this numerous times. Some of them cost funds and lives though. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSniper","CreatedById":142182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T10:29:19Z","Content":"Ok cool, some interesting ideas all. I did a few adjustments and removed the kerbal command pod and just have the remote guidance command with a dock on the front, and I placed a girder coming out the back so if it lands on the rear it falls forward onto the wheels.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can build a sky crane to land it.\n\u003E Or if you can fit it in a MK3 cargo bay you could land a ship with the cargo bay pointing down and drop from there.\n\n Yeah I tried the MK3 cargo bay but the wheels are sticking out and it wont attach. I\u0027m thinking I may build this rover as a rocket, with side thrusters to push over onto the wheels like the picture above. Another option is to do a really big rocket around it and having it suspended in the middle to drop down once landed.\nWill post pics once I get something built. Will try the rover as a rocket option first."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T10:56:54Z","Content":"Attach the capsule\u0027s nose with a decoupler to a rocket, add some struts.
