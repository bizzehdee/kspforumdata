You are making cuts in odd places, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etextures need to be totally re-done etc (because you are slicing the model up into several pieces..) and really, what fun is it in using someone elses model? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, some time ago I set about modelling my own YT-1300, and even then I found it hard to keep the poly count low. This is my 3rd revision, so it still needs to be lowered, but I just wanted to show it to you so you can understand the effort that goes into some mods, and why we can\u0027t just go and pick random models from free 3d mesh websites and import them into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my mesh, and although still a tad high and needing to be cut down, making it from scratch is easy. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThis was an easy ship to make\u003C/span\u003E. 1 squashed sphere, 2 extruded triangles and lots of little cylinders, I have not applied edge splitting or smoothing to this yet, you want the YT to look a little rough around the edges, it cant be too glossy and shiny.
