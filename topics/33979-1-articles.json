Just run a couple of struts between the two. Maybe also between the adapter and that tank it connects to on the booster. If it still fails, try to launch at 2/3 throttle and see if that has any effect; the payload on my heavy TSTO lifter will come off if I run the third stage engine much faster than 1/3 during orbital insertion, so too much booster could also be the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity, what are your stage TWRs?
