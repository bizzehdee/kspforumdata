I have succesfully orbited Kerbin with just one pilot, but i am running very low on cash so i accepted a mission to orbit a tourist around Kerbin. I have tried to launch him with my \u0027normal\u0027 orbit-ship, but i can\u0027t fly it without SAS. So i need to design a rocket with 2 command pods. I have tried this now for the last 3 hours, but always failed miserably. So how should my spacecraft look like? Any help is highly appreciated.\n\nfurthermore i was not able to launch an aircraft - my jetengine does not start at all... i have connected it with a liquid fuel tank and air intake, but nothing happens:("},{"CreatedByName":"miceliux","CreatedById":72239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:59:36Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI just stack one pod over the other.

SAS is different and mostly serves to stabilize your ship\u0027s heading, that is, pointing where you want to go instead of constantly drifting off to one side or the other. The Stayputnik can be used if you\u0027re willing to take control. I won\u0027t pretend this will be easy to fly into orbit, but it does make for good practice. And if you mean \u0022I can\u0027t fly without SAS\u0022 literally, well, *back in my day...*"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:22:33Z","Content":"Alternative :\n\n- Stack 4 command pods \n\n- Build a rocket to make every thing to orbit\n\ngo to missions\n\n- Select rescue kerbonauts (one or 2 depending of seats)\n\n- Select orbiting tournism missions (on or 2)\n\nIn VAB, add tourist, keep rescue seat clear, add un experienced pilot (he\u0027ll get bas level 1)\n\nLaunch, rendez-vous with stranded ships. get money.\n\nImproovement : unlock hitchhicker\u0027s can (lighter) an fit a prob core (when no pilots need 2 XP)."},{"CreatedByName":"imperialus","CreatedById":102038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:39:26Z","Content":"I\u0027ll post a picture of it when I get home but I built a rocket I called \u0022The Tourist Trap\u0022 It\u0027s got a mk2 inline cockpit, a Mk1 command pod an octo probe, and a pair of batteries.
