Nate wouldn\u0027t come right out and say that, obviously, but it was all over the subtext.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EWe\u0027re not going to have any of those problems because we\u0027re bringing in a fresh team to redo the core architecture from scratch. And because we\u0027re using proper \u003Cstrong\u003Eprofessionals\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ewe should have a faster, slicker, all-singing-all-dancing version of the game ready to ship in about, oh, six months?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that proved to be rubbish. The reason KSP still has issues is because it is (ok, was) utterly unique and therefore presents a unique set of challenges. Ok, so the original devs may not have known one end of a GPU from the other, but in all other respects they clearly knew exactly what they were doing thank you very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat false premise, that KSP1 was coded in a fundamentally inefficient and amateurish way, shaped everything that followed. Harvester was side-lined. A new team was brought in. They started the whole painful process of trying to simulate an entire solar system from scratch... and found out that it was really, really hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith just a touch more hubris, they might have had a good long conversation with the KSP1 team upfront and done things differently. I loved For Science, for all its faults, but there\u0027s nothing obvious here that couldn\u0027t have been done quicker/cheaper/better by simply building onto the existing KSP1 framework. Using the original team, supplemented with some fresh eyes to take a good hard look at what could be improved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing on the roadmap that obviously demands a redo-from-start approach is multiplayer, and (with the benefit of hindsight) that clearly wasn\u0027t worth everything that followed. Even if some optimist did decide that it warranted all the extra work of making a brand new game, the KSP1 team would still have been the logical choice to spearhead the project. They could have designed the new architecture to be as compatible as possible with the old, for example, so that chunks of code could be imported wholesale with minimal effort. As it is, it very much looks from the outside as if they designed the new system to be completely different, then were forced to start cannibalising KSP1 code anyway because nothing was working right, and spent years trying to force square pegs into round holes as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne false assumption at the start.
