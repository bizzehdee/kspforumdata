I\u0027ve decided to try a rescue mission and it was great until my ship was close enough about 4-5km away from the mk1 pod. So I got the kerbal out in space and got closer to the pod but I missed it by what 200m and after a few retries I still don\u0027t understand how to not miss your target when spacewalking. Any help ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-06T10:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith rescue missions you want to get your ship close so that you only have to spacewalk\u00A0 a hundred metres or so. If you\u0027ve got to about 4-5km you can switch to target mode on the navball and rendezvous as though you were going to dock. The trick is to align your prograde marker on the navball with the target prograde marker. This can be done with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or by thrusting off axis with you engine to push the prograde marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple method to start with is the stop / start method. In target mode point retrograde and zero out your velocity with respect to the target. Then point to the purple \u0022target prograde\u0022 marker and thrust towards it at about 20m/s. When the prograde and target prograde markers start to drift apart zero out your speed again and repeat. It\u0027s not very fuel efficient but it will get you there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re close you can EVA your rescuee and they can select your rescue ship as\u00A0 target (by clicking on it) and move towards it using the same method, keeping the prograde and target prograde markers on top of each other using small lateral puffs from the backpack thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-06T10:47:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2020 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Reactordrone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
