At about 20 m/s rolling speed, the wheels start bouncing up an down in a self-reinforcing feedback loop. This inevitably ends up in an explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225jChX43.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5jChX43.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EFig. 1: The plane involved\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the career hasn\u0027t progressed enough to use the retractable wheels, I\u0027d like to know if there is any way to prevent kraken attacks. I found out that overriding the friction control (setting it to 0) reduces the bounce enough to take off, but doesn\u0027t remove it entirely...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T17:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWheel bounciness is a bug in the PhysX package that is used by Unity, which is used by KSP. The bug has existed for many KSP versions, but the devs have hope that it will be fixed at some point. However, the overall issue is unfixable at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs provided some adjustable friction, spring, and damper settings so that you can reduce the bounce somewhat. Everyone understands that it\u0027s a kludge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, it can be helpful to stay near the middle of the weight tolerances for the wheels. For the wheel arrangement on your plane above, the max weight limit is about 7 to 7.5 tonnes. If you are near that number, consider removing half the fuel in the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the wings you happen to be using are a cruel trick. They weigh twice as much as any other wing for the lift they provide. It might not be as pretty, but the Type B structural wings will dramatically outperform the wings you are using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T18:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the tip.
