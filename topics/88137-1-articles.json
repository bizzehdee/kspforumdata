I know: I\u0027ve tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe usual issue at least for me though is that the part is very touchy about whether it will or won\u0027t let you place parts on it. For instance: It will take the 3x symitry for SRBs, but not for some fuel tanks, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the space plane hanger in particular: it simply won\u0027t allow you to use the 2x symitry to place the bottom 2 tanks as symmetrical parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both, I\u0027ve had issues with engines clipping into each other with the result being at best overheating, and at worst fiery kerbal death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne fix I could think of would be to very slightly increase the distance between the attachment points on the bottom of the part, but not sure how that would effect the problem of balancing this out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experiencing these issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
