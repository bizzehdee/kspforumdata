It uses asparagus staging and perigee kicks to get the mass down. Asparagus staging you\u0027re probably familiar with - multiple crossfed stages, if you don\u0027t - but perigee kicks are a new trick, I think, for people here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENERVA stages are heavy. Putting tons of them on the vehicle forces you to lift them, which makes lower stages bigger, which tends to quickly make the rocket balloon in size. This uses a single NERVA engine to do the TDI burns, despite the low thrust-to-weight ratio. The bottom stages are capable of putting the trans-Duna injection stage in orbit. Now, to make an efficient boost out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, do the following: when the craft is near the 6PM terminator - sunset - in its orbit, burn. Once it gets away, stop and coast. This will put the perigee of the orbit around the terminator line. Each time you burn, gain more energy than if you did one big long burn due to the Oberth effect. After a few (I think three) orbits, you should be able to burn into Kerbin escape and be on the way to Duna. In fact, done correctly, you\u0027ll still have plenty of fuel - enough that you can use this stage to insert into Duna orbit and deorbit. The lander has parachutes to assist its landing, and the nuclear engines have enough gas to get you home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Trebuchet, I don\u0027t want to learn about perigee kicks!\u0022 Fine, fine. In that case, bring the vehicle into the VAB and run fuel lines from the TDI stage to the two lander NERVAs. That should give you enough thrust to boost directly, if you want to be a bit wasteful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T06:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Trebuchet-Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDumb Oversight Fixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trebuchet-Launch","CreatedById":29863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T05:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few shots in action:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchieving orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nsqGy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nsqGy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded on Duna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/plnrm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022plnrm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHomeward bound:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mo2Yx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mo2Yx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: The Eve-grazing return orbit was an accident - I had decided to sundive on the way back, and got an accidental intercept.

I\u0027ve got a great inter-planetary vehicle that can send you anywhere in the solar system. It\u0027s big but does not lag.
