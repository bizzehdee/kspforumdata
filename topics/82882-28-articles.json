Which was a minor issue. Swapping to a pattern where we have to pick one kinda ruins Karbonite as it has atmospheric considerations at odds with KSPI - is what it is.\u003Cp\u003EThe issue was duplicate crustal resource keys. We fixed this. I sent you a pull request on day zero. And it was promptly disregarded when 0.1.3 broke stuff. Then 0.1.4 broke other things we depended on.

ORS resources are not loaded at startup, they are loaded when a part that needs to know about resource values is activated.
