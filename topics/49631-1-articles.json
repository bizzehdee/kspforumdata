The kerbals did the same. The swedish named the planet Kerbin, and the kerbals named the new plante Eert. But Earth sounds better, so they changed that. They established contact, and talked to Jeb for several hours, about his girl problems. After that, they was working hard on making a logo of their organization. The swedish made this: (I can\u0027t get the pic into this place, but as soon as I get it, I will put it there), and the kerbals made a picture of a panda on a bus. I know, wierd. They chose the swedish one... And as soon as that was done, they started working on their first rocket... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all I have currently, because I haven\u0027t decided sandbox or career yet. But, yeah! Maybe I\u0027ll do both!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(There\u0027s nothing here yet, but as soon as I get started, this will be filled up, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1.
