The only thing that has changed and could affect the results slightly are some tweaks to the atmospheric limit code, which prevents flameouts. The nuclear reactors are fairly hampered by atmosphere, their specific impulse using atmospheric propellant is very low - the advantage of that is it gives you more thrust, the downside is it makes flameouts occur quicker than is ideal. Anyway, on the launch pad, my testing shows 16.3kN from a clamped thermal turbojet and a basic uranium MSR and an 85.5% atmospheric limit - that means with more airflow I could get up to 19.1kN, exactly the same value as you recorded in the previous version.\u003Cp\u003EThis change was neccessary in order to prevent twin-jet engined aircraft from yawing unpleasantly due to the two engines producing different thrusts, something that often happens when intake propellant is available but in short supply (but before a flameout).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, intakes are quite velocity dependent and stationary on the launchpad is not their ideal operating regime. Under actual flight conditions, you shouldn\u0027t see such a big difference between this version and the last - once you get off the ground, you\u0027ll start to see the benefits of increased specific impulse due to more ideal atmospheric conditions as well as higher intake values due to aircraft velocity. You can also add more intakes to your plane in order to make sure you get access to all the atmospheric propellant you need and try and push that atmospheric limit close to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED\u0027OH! That probably should have been the first thing I thought of- maybe it was a vehicle-based difference! The testing vehicles weren\u0027t proper planes, but just fuselages with engines attached, but the testing vehicle in 0.7.4 *DID* in fact feature a MUCH larger intake (a 2.5 meter Atmospheric Intake- as opposed to a couple mall radial supersonic intakes from B9 Aerospace). I tried turning off the TWR limiter, however (setting it to \u00223\u0022 instead of \u0022Prevent Flameouts\u0022) however that didn\u0027t really seem to do much- and the resource screen showed it had plenty of IntakeAtm to work with... So, my guess is that it\u0027s more a problem with the TWR Limiter code being too conservative in dense atmospheres like at Kerbin Seal Level- where plenty of atmospheric propellent is available- rather than an issue with the reactors themselves...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Thermal Turbojet description *DOES* say its ISP is related to core temperature, though, and I did also record a significant drop in engine ISP (to about 58, from 78 before) at sea level- and THAT shouldn\u0027t be adversely affected by propellant availability- so it does look like you (or the other mod devs) did reduce the effective altitude ceiling of the Thermal Turbojets when powered by fission reactors nonetheless... (a lower ISP means more IntakeAtmosphere is necessary to keep the thing running at threshold thrust- so the plane can\u0027t operate in as thin an atmosphere...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, switching over to thorium fuel can be an asset for an aircraft you plan to make regular use of. By doing so, you will see a 27% increase in thrust as well as an 8% increase in specific impulse. By doing both this and adding a couple more intakes, you should actually see a big improvement in un-upgraded nuclear flight compared to version 0.7.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for the fusion reactors - it\u0027s hard to say whether they are overpowered yet because they are a new addition. That said, the unupgraded fusion reactor is available on the same tech as the upgraded fission reactors and they are a moderate improvement - 175MW thermal power compared to 120MW but the fusion reactor requires an ongoing 7MW of electrical power to continue operation, which can cut off somewhere between 14MW and 45MW from the thermal power depending on operating temperature conditions and whether you have upgraded generators. Unupgraded, they therefore offer a very modest increase in power output compared to the upgraded fission reactors at the expensive of drastically increased fuel consumption. A fusion reactor burns through it\u0027s fuel way more rapidly than the fission reactors.\u003Cp\u003EOnce upgraded, they are a lot better but are by that point competing with the first generation of antimatter reactors, which give you a whole new set of capabilities again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope some of that rundown helps you get your aircraft working smoothly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah- seeing the much better performance of the fusion reactors- and the fact that I normally greatly reduce the fuel-loading before takeoff of the fission reactors for better performance anyways (using TAC Fuel Balancer)- I\u0027ll probably switch the designs to fusion reactors once those become available. I\u0027m really not sure I understand exactly what you\u0027re saying about the energy requirements though- do they need a continued outside power source after startup, or would it be enough just to hook the plane up to powerful fission generator to \u0022jumpstart\u0022 the reactor right before flight? Either way, I guess I\u0027ll have to figure it out- because I\u0027ve got a lucky son-of-a-gun with a much more powerful computer than mine to beat, who could afford the CPU drain of strapping 20 Command Chairs to his design for extra Challenge points- so my points will have to lie in maximum Dunar altitude ceiling, or cargo-capacity on Duna instead...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neutrino#1","CreatedById":35027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T21:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have run into a bug: the poweroutput and heat production of solar panels seems to be inverted.
