KSP 2 has been publicly released for 1 year and the game is still no different to KSP 1. What a joke. At some point, we need to accept, the devs are not equipped to make this game. Ive just been playing a game yesterday, called Manor Lords, made by 1 dev..... and its polished, its beautiful and looks like AAA. Im not trying to sell that game, im just trying to say, we have a team of devs here who are unfortunately in over their heads. To see nothing implemented after 1 year.... which was after like 5 years... is embarassing. Its all well and good with their updates, \u0027working on this... these bugs are complex\u0027... yh ok but we DGAF? thats your job to fix bugs. Dont be distracted by the projection they have a hard task. Point is, the game was released, and sold at \u00A350 or whatever it was. Manor Lords is \u00A325. Been playing KSP1 for like a decade, waited 6 months for KSP 2 to be playable, actually enjoyed science update aswell, but the pace is not REMOTELY close to respectable. I\u0027m sure im one of many, but ive given up. Good luck in the future\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-27T16:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you joined to say that you\u0027re leaving\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Icegrx","CreatedById":232176,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-28T02:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I\u2019m also unhappy about KSP2 progression this post does absolutely nothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou gave no finer details besides \u201C\u003Cspan\u003Ethe game is still no different to KSP 1.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0You provided zero insight, didn\u2019t mention any features that you feel are lacking or any ideas to improve upon, fix or implement.
