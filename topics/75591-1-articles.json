The use of the fourth build number means they have split windows into 32 and 64 bit versions. Hopefully squad is also working on making the current 64-bit linux executable functional (it cannot use more than 4gb of memory due to various errors). Given squad\u0027s failure to address minor errors in the linux build for pretty much the last year (see the linux support thread) I doubt their capability to issue a working 64bit linux build. I would hate for linux users to be left behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut sad to say, as with the multiplayer announcement, it seems the community again ahead of the developer on this (see the win64 patch thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other good news is that, after a month or so of nothing, Squad has been pushing new scratchpad builds in \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ethrees (win/mac/linux)\u003C/span\u003E fours (win32/win64/mac/linux) rather than focusing on just the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ewindows\u003C/span\u003Ewin32 build.
