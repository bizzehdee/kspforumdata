It describes how to first set up Celestial Body Science Editor with Stock values, then how to set Kerbin Landed and Splashed to (very close to) zero science.\n\nFirst, you need to install Celestial Body Science Editor. Then, start a new save and click CBSE\u0027s icon before doing anything else in the game. For every body, click \u0022stock values\u0022 because the mod actually gives you more science by default. Once done with that, \u0022Apply Values\u0022 and \u0022Save to config.\u0022 Exit that save.\n\nThe good news is, you only have to do all that once. Now your config file is set to Stock, and your new save is also set to stock. Any new saves will also use stock values.\n\nNow to get the Landed/Splashed values low, every time you start a new save you need to start it, then exit out immediately. Then edit the persistent.sfs file for that save and look for \u0022scienceModifierScenario\u0022. Go down to\n\n    BodyName = Kerbin \n\nand the line below that, change the next line to:\n\n    ParamValues = 0.001,0.001,0.700,0.900,1.000,1.500,1.000,18000.0,250000.0\n\nThose two 0.001\u0027s are surface and splashed.\n\nYou can NOT change them in the gui, and you can NOT change them in the config. It won\u0027t work. Only setting them in the save file will do it. And as a bonus, if you EVER load that gui again it may reset them. Also, you can NOT set them to 0. It causes problems. I don\u0027t know what problems, just \u0022problems.\u0022 ![:)](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-24T14:17:55Z","Content":"I did not expect EVA transfer to work in 1.11 but apparently it does.

Wish I was that talented.\n\nI quoted the above to show that I did go through the posts to see if my issue was resolved, but i don\u0027t see anything.\n\nI\u0027m reinstalling all of my favorite mods after switching to KSP 1.12.4 and I\u0027m on Flexible Docking Mod.  This mod threw out the following errors when installed:\n\n    Line  8247: [ERR 09:13:05.850] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model000\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPort/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\n    Line  8251: [ERR 09:13:05.898] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model000\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPort/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\n    Line  8253: [ERR 09:13:05.899] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model000\\_1\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPortJr/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\n    Line  8256: [ERR 09:13:05.906] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model000\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPort/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\n    Line  8258: [ERR 09:13:05.906] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model000\\_1\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPortSr/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\n    Line  8260: [ERR 09:13:05.906] PartCompiler: Cannot replace texture \u0027model001\u0027 as cannot find texture \u0027Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPortSr/model000\u0027 to replace with  \n\nI did see [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/)\u0027s post where it provides a link to a dropbox file that is no longer available.  The Github link on the subject talks about textures being in the xDeprecated folder, but doesn\u0027t really (in my mind) explain how to use this to copy or bring those textures out to where this mod is (or any mod) is looking for them to fix the issue.  Is this just a matter of Copying and renaming the DDS files to model000 or model001 for example to fix these?\n\n**UPDATE:  I found that if I copied model000.dds into each of the 3 dockingport folders for squad it fixes the issue.  Since that dds isn\u0027t already in those folders for 1.12.4, doing this caused no issues and resolved the above texture issue.**\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.   If I missed a post somewhere in my research... I apologize for that, going through 300 different mods and their associated forums for each is a long process and I\u0027m old, so I do miss things at times.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-15T15:34:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2022 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Xtra**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-24T16:47:26Z","Content":"Getting a nullref sometimes with this mod:\n\n    27383 NullReferenceException\n    27384   at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Transform.SetParent(UnityEngine.Transform,UnityEngine.Transform,bool)\n    27385   at UnityEngine.Transform.SetParent (UnityEngine.Transform p) [0x00001] in \u003C12e76cd50cc64cf19e759e981cb725af\u003E:0 \n    27386   at OneWindow.OneWindow_Rect\u002Bd__8.MoveNext () [0x000b6] in \u003C45cdc62073a5427d9aab186cdffe0b6b\u003E:0 \n    27387   at UnityEngine.SetupCoroutine.InvokeMoveNext (System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator, System.IntPtr returnValueAddress) [0x00026] in \u003C12e76cd50cc64cf19e759e981cb725af\u003E:0 \n\nFull log here:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/stsqag4kw74o4kq/AAAMznffUPeJ8-ytDlfc60sea?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/stsqag4kw74o4kq/AAAMznffUPeJ8-ytDlfc60sea?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"dan1ell1ma","CreatedById":141352,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-04T20:07:22Z","Content":"any updates planned?"},{"CreatedByName":"Salnonax","CreatedById":9240,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T17:02:45Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been a huge fan of these mods for ages.\n\nWould it be a huge effort to have at least One Window use the Blizzy toolbar?
