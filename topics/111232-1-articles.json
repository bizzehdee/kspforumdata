[instead of 2 tails]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- while you don\u0027t want control surfaces (elevons, winglets) anywhere near the mid/front of the plane, you may get away with using some strakes or small wings. Just wings, no control surfaces. They are displayed in a neutral state in the SPH but they can violently alter your CoL during actual flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- don\u0027t be too keen to eliminate drag by using fewer wings. They are not that draggy and you do need lift. Try using swept wings because they can move the CoL further back. Maybe try using 2 pairs, one attached higher and the other lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- try a cockpit \u002B 1 passenger module first, then if you\u0027re succesful, try adding room for 4 more kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you\u0027re not using the rearmost node. Consider 2 TurboJets \u002B 1 Aerospike as it provides serious thrust and good Isp with all three engines firing. The extra speed might give you a higher initial Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- keep the cargo bay and put it where it least interferes with CoM moving about as fuel is burned. You might want to try placing it next to the cockpit and stuff it full of heatsink-like parts because re-entry heat will be an issue for long, thin planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ramjet intakes have a slightly higher heat tolerance, though i haven\u0027t used the shock ones so idk. Ramjets are good though. And you won\u0027t get any extra mileage out of airhogging so don\u0027t bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue is to check where you CoM is when the plane is fully loaded and empty then aim for a build that keeps the damn thing almost in place or moving slightly forward as fuel is spent. In my experience an empty plane copes easily with a difference between CoM and CoL pictured above, though take off would be difficult. Once you\u0027re happy with the CoM, Find a good spot for wings then worry about elevons. An SSTO during ascent should fly more like a rocket than a plane, hence keeping control surfaces further back is usefull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be frank, i don\u0027t know how usefull this advice is, i will say i have had dozens of failures with the Mk2 spaceplanes and am seriously hating almost all of them.

You could try swapping out fuel tanks in the Mk2 center for additional fuel tanks in your outriggers - remember to strut them back to the center or else you\u0027ll have problems during liftoff with bouncing. Also, try putting all your crew cabins right behind your cockpit, and your fuel tanks towards the rear. That way as they empty the CoM should pull ahead of your CoL more, making your plane more stable for reentry.
