Then the male singer comes in. Through the video he acts as three different people. The first is a DJ with large headphones and a T-shirt with \\\u0027Vamos\\\u0027 printed on it. At first she likes him because he\\\u0027s funny, be then she thinks he\\\u0027s too loud when she sees him DJing at a club, so he goes. The second person is a man in a buisness suit. She likes him because he\\\u0027s charming, but halfway through the date his phone rings and its a buisness call that drags out. So he goes. Third person is the singer acting as himself, and he is supposed to be both funny and charming and the woman likes him. This is followed by some dancing in a room with walls made of blue light panels, and then it ends. The woman is blonde. I think in the dance scenes she\\\u0027s wearing a black outfit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T01:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is as close as I can get\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/djV11Xbc914?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T01:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can assure you, it is not Take On Me by A-Ha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T02:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat genre is the song?
