Id love to see contracts similar to what exist now, or put something into orbit or land at a place but add in restrictions that the mission be accomplished under a certain weight limit or within a certain budget or with a predefined fuel limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGames are all about accomplishing objectives within a given ruleset or restraints. Adding on a few extra constraints to the mission would require the rockets are built with more efficiency and solving that type of puzzle would make us all better at playing the rest of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T01:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr meaningful time limits.
