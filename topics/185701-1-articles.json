The next thing I wanted to do with it was to display telemetry in my computer\u0027s terminal. I first wanted to test integrating it with\u00A0my automated sub-orbital launch program. I followed the example telemetry program at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://krpc.github.io/krpc/tutorials/docking-guidance.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://krpc.github.io/krpc/tutorials/docking-guidance.html\u003C/a\u003E. The terminal from which I ran the python shell cleared,\u00A0but all it showed was the little grey key icon (the one that it puts up if it needs your password). I entered my password and hit\u00A0return, but nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres a picture of my python shell, terminal after running the script, and the script itself:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/f9dwiZ2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/f9dwiZ2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve searched the internet for anyone having this issue when using curses, but to no avail.\u00A0Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T20:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd some code to confirm that the kRPC connections works - chnage the throttle, print a \u201Cconnected\u201D statement.
