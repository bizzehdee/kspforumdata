In testing that case I often found that joining and separating craft triggered this. A workaround is to leave the scene and come back to it, forcing KSP to destroy and recreate the kOS parts into memory. In my case, subassemblies were not involved at all. It\u0027s the act of separating craft in flight that did it, and it was intermittent. Sometimes it happend and sometimes it didn\u0027t. I think it depends on which part of the vessel is considered the \u0022root\u0022 part, which keeps changing when you dock and undock. (You\u0027ve all seen the effect where you dock a vessel to a station and the game decides to rename the station to the name of your vessel you docked to it - when you see that it means the game decided your new vessel was to become the new root part of the joined together ship, rather than the station\u0027s previous core part.) I have no clue what criteria the game uses for this, but the point is that I think which part of the vessel contains the root part when you split the vessel apart affects which half of the vessel experiences the bug and which half doesn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you split a vessel into two halves, either through staging or undocking, it seems that it breaks off at the splitting point such that the next part further out from the split point becomes the root of a new parts tree for a new vessel, that follows the same branching structure from there. Meanwhile the original vessel is still there, but with one of its branches truncated at the split point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bug seems to only affect which of the two vessels is the newly invoked one. The vessel that consists of the original old one with a truncated branch still operates correctly. The vessel that was newly built starting with its new root at the branch point is the one that gets the bug. I strongly *suspected*, but haven\u0027t gone through the effort to actually prove, that the bug is because the new vessels\u0027 kOS CPU still has a variable in memory that tells it \u0022I am part of vessel A\u0022, when it is actually part of vessel B now. This would lead to a whole host of confusion in the steering algorithm as it tries to read rotation, position, and velocity of the vessel and is getting back answers referring to the OTHER ship rather than its own ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason it is intermittent is that it\u0027s hard to predict which half of the split is going to become the \u0022new\u0022 vessel, and it\u0027s almost as if KSP is picking that at random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just occurred to me how you could prove once and for all that this is the problem. When you experience this problem next, and one of the two parts is unable to lock steering properly, then do this while the problem is still in effect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terminal 1, PRINT SHIP:MASS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terminal 2, PRINT SHIP:MASS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they\u0027re on two different vessels that have different parts, they should return two different numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they both return the SAME number despite being on different vessels, that\u0027s proof that both CPU\u0027s still think they\u0027re part of the same ship as each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trewor007","CreatedById":101021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T09:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s14.postimg.org/5mwm1grsh/Untitled.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal in the top right corner is from the root vessel, it shows corect mass of 24t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal on the bottom left is from the left lander can, unmanned, points correctly to prograde. corect mass of 1.2t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal on the bottom right is from the right lander can, manned, SPINS (it can be seen in the left corner). corect mass of 1.2t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eleaving the scene does not help, and in some cases is impossible (different bug)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/7nd6km5w7/Untitled.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas an observation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem was effecting all the vessel both manned and unmanned, but now when I uninstalled TTNeverUnload mod the problem only with the manned craft separated from the root vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T09:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trewor007\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trewor007\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal in the top right corner is from the root vessel, it shows corect mass of 24t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal on the bottom left is from the left lander can, unmanned, points correctly to prograde. corect mass of 1.2t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe terminal on the bottom right is from the right lander can, manned, SPINS (it can be seen in the left corner). corect mass of 1.2t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s14.postimg.org/5mwm1grsh/Untitled.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://s14.postimg.org/5mwm1grsh/Untitled.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately that\u0027s inconclusive, as I didn\u0027t realize you\u0027d have multiple vessels with the exact same parts list on them.
