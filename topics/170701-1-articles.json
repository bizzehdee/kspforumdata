General guidelines to avoid this problem is to avoid building rockets that are too tall or that have too many stages (tank-decoupler-engine-tank junctions tend to be very wobbly), reduce the gimbal of your rocket engines as too much can cause wobble, improve the rigidity of your rocket by using longer parts if possible, reducing the number of junctions\u00A0or using struts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T02:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing struts or autostruts is the typical first solution to noodly rockets.

If your rocket is properly powered (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E around 1.4 to 1.6), you shouldn\u0027t need to turn forcefully. Adjust you turning angle using THRUST instead of directions, It\u0027ll create much less wobble and be more efficient. Reducing gimbal to 30% is also a solution. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will make direction change smoother.

A lot of stacked parts in short succession. This is particularly obvious between stages, since you\u0027re usually going tank-engine-decoupler-tank. A pair or trio of struts running from the lower decoupler to as high up the tank above the engine as is feasible will make it far more rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Boosters, especially as they burn out, and lots of other things mounted radially, like to twist in various ways. Struts on the nose and tail hooking it into the main stack will usually stop, or at least strongly mitigate, this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Complicated payloads, particularly spindly satellites and so on, will flop on their connection points under manouvering stresses. A couple of struts to widen the connection or attach it to fairing/cargo-bay walls can solve a lot of headaches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Multisegment wings usually need some spacetape to make them move as a unit, not warp ridiculously, or not tear off from the fuselage. Exactly where to hook them together depends an awful lot on the wing layout and isn\u0027t as simple as the other three cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso wise is avoiding, as much as feasible, really long, spindly things and excess nodes.
