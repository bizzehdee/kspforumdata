All GSO satellites have a 5 Mm dipole antenna.

I have placed a microsat (8Mm antennae) in a 9Mm orbit to try to cover the mun\u0027s orbit (I will eventually place a whole bunch of them) but even though the distance between my microsat and one of my geostationary sattellites is less than 8Mm, it is still out of contact. So when there is a connection between two different (specifically these two) antennae, is the maximum range between them the range of the shortest (5Mm) or the longest (8Mm)? The antenna on the microsat are extended and have power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T00:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeffective range will be the shortest range of the two antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
