I thought the devs might want to see this video because it includes many very valid criticisms of the game that many on this forum appear to also express.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lPd8zszrUYw?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP 2 MOON BASE FROM HELL\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-29T19:55:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2024 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 29\u0022\u003EJanuary 29\u003C/time\u003E by Squaremantis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-29T20:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thing to note \u0022KSP2 is supposed to be better than KSP1 with mods\u0022. Not true. It\u0027s supposed to be as good as KSP1 (which in a lot of aspects, already is) and be further built on top of it with stuff we haven\u0027t seen in KSP1 (which is also already happening).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond thing to note, while obviously with current tool set, building a \u0022base\u0022 like this is the only way to do so (even though there\u0027s completely no reason to have one) I have a feeling it will become completely obsolete in a few(?) months when the proper parts finally arrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, talking for the hundredth time about the same \u003Cu\u003Eknown\u003C/u\u003E bugs as every single content creator does these days, ain\u0027t gonna help them be fixed faster.
