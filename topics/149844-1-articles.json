What can I do to keep and transfert them to a new 1.2 career? Is\u00A0copy/paste the crew datas in the persistent.sfs file just be enough and will not breed conflicts in the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"omelaw","CreatedById":156483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T05:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will bring everyone to kerbin because crew in nonexist vehicle will be deleted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T06:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCopy/pasting crew between saves is a bad idea, as there are many other places in the save where those crew are referenced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you CAN do (I\u0027ve done it in the past) is just copy the name, gender, and profession (all that\u0027s really important) out of one save for each Kerbal, and paste it in over the information in the new save on BRAND NEW KERBALS.

Make a BACKUP copy of your 1.0.5 save file, in case something goes wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. As omelaw stated, probably simplest to bring your entire roster back to Kerbin. \u00A0Not sure if this is completely necessary, as you are editing the save file anyway, but will make things easier to diagnose if you run into problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The Astronaut Complex is limited in how many Kerbals you can have, until you upgrade it. \u00A0So dumping a large roster of Kerbals into a new career could potentially have issues. \u00A0The Kerbal \u0027limit\u0027 in the AC can be exceeded in certain situations, and you may be able to edit your roster into a new career with no issues. \u00A0Having your original game backed up would be wise however, just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. In a previous version, there was an issue when a Kerbal was fired or otherwise removed from the roster, but had completed a milestone before being fired or killed. \u00A0I think that issue was cleared up, but another reason to have a backup of your original save file in case issues arise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent question! Please report back with information regarding how your transfer turned out, it will certainly be helpful to other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T07:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.2 allows you (in the debug menu) to create specific Kerbals. You could pretend that you are \u0022moving\u0022 them. You can move them a few at a time, as you upgrade your Astronaut Complex. The tool allows you to go over any limits, though -- so you can copy the entire list right from the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XB-70A","CreatedById":144985,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T14:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try a manual re-writing of a persistent file just as a\u00A0test then will report the results.
