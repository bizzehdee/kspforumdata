Because I\u0027m utterly sick and tired of grinding out the tech tree, I decided this time to take advantage of 2 key new features of 0.25--difficulty settings and strategies--to make this all a lot less painful and repetitive. So, I chose Easy Mode, which gives 200% funds and science, although I did make it so buildings are destructable and Kerbals have permadeath (gotta have those \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). Then, once I had enough in the bank to cover the set-up costs, I picked 2 strategies to further me along. One of them converted 30% of my Rep to Science!, the other converted 20% of my rep to cash. The idea was to avoid having to totally pillage Mun and Minmus for the umpteenth time, and to avoid repetition, while still having fun. And IMHO the above settings succeeded brilliantly. This so far has been the most enjoyable career I\u0027ve played in a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fun was mosly provided by using the Fine Print and DMagic Orbital Science mods that both provide all sorts of very interesting contracts. These work out quite well IMHO, being well-suited to your current tech and financial positions. As a result, most of this game so far has been just doing contracts without me haivng to think up stuff do. I\u0027m glad to see this because I hear Fine Print will become stock in the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides the above mods, I also have SXT as my main \u0022parts\u0022 mod, plus of course Karbonite and most of the other USI mods. I\u0027m not using NEAR or FAR this time because, after much consideration, I\u0027ve decided that imposing Earth-like atmospheres on KSP planets is absolutley the LEAST realistic option of all those available, physically impossible in that universe. However, I still build rockets like the atmosphere matters to some extent. I also toyed with the idea of using TAC Life Support just so I coiuld have self-sufficient MKS bases, but after some experimentation with the current incarnations, I decided that mod has gone off the rails and is way more trouble than it\u0027s worth. That being the case, I\u0027ve reverted to my original headcannon of asserting that Kerbals hibernate most of the time so don\u0027t really need much life support (human-based systems also being absolutely the LEAST realistic option). And I\u0027m using Antenna Range, plus various types of instrumentation (MJ, KAC, TAC Fuel Balancer, RCS Build Aid, Trajectories, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on with the show....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the game set up to speed the progress of Science! and to get rich quick, I still started with nothing. So there were the usual early missions of reaching LKO. But after that, I had the 1st 2 or 3 rows of the tech tree open, the contracts kicked in, and things started getting more interesting. The 1st noteworthy mission was to do an aerial survey of 5 points on the map near the southern cape of KSC\u0027s continent. At this point, I just barely had any airplane tech at all. And it looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oMidBN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/14952450564_2a75f8ba88_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214952450564_2a75f8ba88_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane was mostly built with SXT parts (engine, 0.625m fuel tank, and cockpit). I hadn\u0027t yet invented the wheel but I did have some inflatable airbags from the USI Survivability Pack so I used them as landing gear, also with the idea they might be useful if the plane had to ditch for lack of fuel. It was a struggle to get this off the ground but it did manage it in about 1/2 the runway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pG4beJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3932/15549485276_acfc4395a1_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215549485276_acfc4395a1_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this was the route. There were actually 2 contracts involved here, each with 3 points, although they shared 1 point so there were only 5 in total. In the pic above, the plane has already hit the 1st waypoint (red circle) and is right over the 2nd. The plane returned home with about 1/8 fuel remaining and landed safely, although the batteries and lights on the bottom got scraped off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, I did several contracts to put probes into specific orbits at Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. This actually started to clutter up the system but they paid well in cash and science. Here\u0027s a typical example (I forget where it was going):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oMidzy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5609/14952450434_de7b6c3e26_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214952450434_de7b6c3e26_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had a contract to put a simple station in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, I had the contract to Explore Mun and with the 2.5m rocket parts already unlocked, I decided I\u0027d send 3 Kerbals to do it right. My theory was that rep only seems to accumulate when you have Kerbals involved, so I figured 3 Kerbals would bring more rep than just 1. At least they\u0027d all get experience, which I\u0027ve heard is supposed to increase rep somehow. Not that I cared about my rep for itself, but because I had the strategies converting it to cash and Science! So here\u0027s my 1st Mun Lander in this game, a much more sophisticated and cool vehicle than what I\u0027ve sent in the past in more grindy games \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/prEcT8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3941/15386572289_4147cc632c_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215386572289_4147cc632c_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it got to Mun and back no problems, carrying Jeb, Bill, and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pHV4kn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15570534151_f682c5a064_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215570534151_f682c5a064_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has, so far, turned out to be my ONLY crewed Mun mission.

I picked 2 such contracts, 1 for 3 points out to sea west of the KSC continent and the other with 3 points in the vicinity of Airbase Island. And I built a turobjet-powered spy plane for the job:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oMidv5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3953/14952450174_ebb5ce2346_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214952450174_ebb5ce2346_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHavne\u0027t done any more of that type of contract since. Instead, I was already working on Duna and Ike. In fact, my 1st Duna contract was to do a survey of Ike\u0027s magnetic field using DMagic instruments. And this had to be done VERY quickly. Fortunately, the current version of MJ now has a porkchop plot so you can easily go interplanetary whenever you want and pick your travel time, provided you\u0027re willing to spend the delta-V. Which I was because it was a fat contract, so the simple little probe screamed out heading that way. But then I realized I needed to be able to talk to it, so I had to create a Deep Space Satellite Relay Network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Antenna Range, this can be a pretty simple affair. What I did was put up 2 identical satellites in polar molniya orbits. They have Aps at 82Mm, just inside the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and Pes of 125km, so they spend most of their time far off Kerbin\u0027s orbtial plane. One goes nearly straight up, the other nearly straight down, and they\u0027re nearly 180^ out of phase so when one is at Ap, the other is at Pe. However, most of the time, both are far away. The probes have 2 dish antennae each and look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pHV4hr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3937/15570533981_554720f908_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215570533981_554720f908_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe network itself looks like this (also showing 2 probes bound for the Duna system. The SCANsat is something I\u0027m doing on my own initiative so has no deadline. Thus, it waited for the normal transfer window instead of leaving at the same time as the mag survey probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/prZZH7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3951/15390433580_e80b9248c3_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215390433580_e80b9248c3_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout this time, I decided I\u0027d better get on with the Explore Minmus contract that had been gathering dust on my desk for a while. This involved sending the same ship that had done the MUn landing, modified only by replacing the solar panels with the RTGs I now had available. Again, Jeb, Bill, and Bob all made the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/prGBVb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15387043368_f47c6f7a22_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215387043368_f47c6f7a22_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out, I ended up sending a 2nd crewed lander to Minmus. While Jeb, Bill, and Bob were still en route, an interesting contract came up to investigate an anomaly on Minmus with various DMagic instruments under various conditions, so I recruited a new Kerbal with maximum bravery and stupidity both (name of Shelbry) to give it a try. He had very simplified lander with just the instruments needed for the mission, not bothering with pillaging the new biome he\u0027d land in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pJe1Vh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15574038042_a1acf73295_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215574038042_a1acf73295_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission turned out to be much trickier in practice than it seemed on paper. Certain of the instruments had to be used in flight over the target area, others on the ground right at it. And while most of the instruments just had to be in the general vicinity, the Anomaly Scan instrument had to be dead-nuts on. Plus it had to be on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this was complicated by the Minmus Monolith being about 1.5km up in space the last few versions. Plus, it was on the dark side of Minmus at the time, plus the ground there is the Slopes biome. Thus, doing very short hops and trying to VTOL along to get the Anomaly Scanner close enough to make it happy nearly led to disaster several times. The incredibly brave, increadibly stupid Kerbal would have kept at it, however, until he either died in the attempt or ran out of fuel, had not Mission Control suddenly remembered that, thanks to KAS technology, the instrument could be backpacked around. So after 1 last hop that go within 1km of the spot directly under the hovering monolity, Mission Control ordered a halt and Shelbry dismounted the instrument and started hiking the hills with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis looked rather comical, partly due to the typical low-gravity antics, but mostly because the Anomaly Scanner has a small, spinning dish on it. This was right between Shelbry\u0027s shoulder blades so made him look like a clockwork Kerbal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

Shortly thereafter, I got a contract to survey the magnetic field of Minmus, same sort of deal as the probe already en route to Duna. This contract requires getting into a very eccentric, very inclined orbit, using a couple of DMagic instruments at both Ap and Pe, and maintaining that orbit for a long time (in this case, 30 days). You can get the instrument science all on the 1st orbit but the contract won\u0027t complete for however long it takes. This required a fairly simple problem that looks like this. The Ike probe looks pretty much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pHV4ea\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15570533791_c621a8efc1_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215570533791_c621a8efc1_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there was a contract to build a base on Minmus. This needed a docking port, an antenna, a source of power, a science lab, and housing for 8 Kerbals. Not a technical issue by this point (only the last row of the tree and a few less-important lower nodes remained). But it paid big in cash and science so naturally I did it. Who knows? I might end up using it myself at some point, so I gave it a few extra features out of my own pocket just in case \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pJ9DYt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3942/15573187135_89efbd07ca_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215573187135_89efbd07ca_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETune in very shortly for another episode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-10T02:00:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2014 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T03:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPISODE 2: Finishing the Tech Tree\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, I told you it wouldn\u0027t be long before another episode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now there were 2 probes en route to Duna and the magnetic survey probe doing its time at Minmus.

So the KTC built a small rocket, stuck one of these on top, and went after the stranded Kerbal. The idea was to get the Kerbal in the lifeboat and send him down that way, while the rest of the rocket landed under probe control to save money.

This made the whole process a LOT less hectic. While keeping the same transfer delta-V plus or minus less than 5m/s, picking slightly different spots on the porkchop allows spacing the burns out by a few hours or even a day or 2. Thus, no more overlapping KAC alarms, in either doing the burns or when the flotilla leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI. However, this will naturally increase the spacing of arrivals at the target. However, so far this hasn\u0027t been by so much as to cause inconvenience waiting on arrivals. Also, in the case of Eve, flotillas launched the old way, as close together as possible, arrived almost too close together. While I\u0027ve never had 2 ships need to aerobrake there simultaneously, it\u0027s always been a near-run thing so some increased arrival spacing is welcome there.

All sorts of wild theories about the properties of this new material, called Karborundum, had been going around the labs and the only way to settle the arguments once and for all was to find some and do tests on it.

And they discovered another mystery. The line of sight took them through the ridge to the right of the rover, and on its other side they saw many more such disembodied boulder shadows. The shadow by the rover seemed to be coming from a boulder on the flank of a peak in the ridge behind the right-hand ridge (as viewed from the rover), sparkling in the sunlight and circled in the pick below. This shadow was being projected through a gap in the right-hand ridge, allowing it to reach the ground at the rover.

I\u0027ve used it tbat way myself, plus on guitar necks and ash baseball bats, and also to add fake age to replica wooden objects like copies of Indian war clubs.

Those mountains look pretty dramatic, I\u0027ll have to schedule a landing somewhere near there myself some time. Though that is weird with the shadows. I recall seeing a similar thing near the Mun\u0027s south pole, though most of those ones were floating.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go to Duna\u0027s north pole, land between about 45^ and 90^ west of the longitude of Ike\u0027s average position because that\u0027s by far the best approach to Orthanc. As in traversable by rovers and giving you the highest cliff to jump off. I lucked into that by picking my spot from the map view zoomed in as much as I could, looking for a reasonably flat area close to the pole. But the map view doesn\u0027t begin to show the complexity of the terrain there (at least with high detail) so I had no idea of what I was getting into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shadows are quite weird up there. The terrain itself casts no shadows except on itself at short distances, but not at long. Scatter and ships cast shadows however far it takes onto the 1st piece of terrain encountered by the line of sight, even if that terrain itself casts no distant shadow. With high terrain detail, I saw no floating boulders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T02:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHah!
