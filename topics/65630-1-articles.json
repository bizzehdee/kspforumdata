Firstly, perhaps the extremophiles begin thriving in their new environment and begin to evolve to make better use of the more-than-likely worse-than-Earth conditions. After a few million years (eh, maybe a billion or so (assuming nothing\u0027s destroyed the Earth yet (\u0027cuz that\u0027d be kinda nice to know we\u0027d still be around for a while))), maybe this world could have an establishing ecosystem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, perhaps the likelier outcome would be the slow and sad starvation of these extremophiles, or their inability to adapt eventually kills them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

People would probably remind you of rabbits and cane toads that were introduced to Australia and how people thought that was a good idea at the time. I tend to agree with them in the sense that you can hardly undo your work, which makes it perilous at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I would not mind sending life to a few distant corners of our solar system/galaxy/universe.
