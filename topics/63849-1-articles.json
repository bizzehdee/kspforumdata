The Oberth effect will help if you started out below 1000 km but from Gilly\u0027s orbital height you\u0027ll actually spend less then what it would take from low Eve orbit, even without considering the cost of lowering your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real cost though will be the transfer window - I think it comes around every 130 days or so. You should be able to get back to Kerbin from Gilly for about 1400 m/s if you transfer at the right time, but miss it and the cost skyrockets. Since you aren\u0027t using the Oberth effect it\u0027s probably easiest to push yourself out of Eve\u0027s orbit entirely (into an orbit slightly higher then Eve), then use a maneuver node to find the optimum transfer time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChecking my past flights if you flew to Eve at the ideal transfer point then unless you spent weeks orbiting Eve or Gilly you should be in position to make a passable transfer back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a copy of my return flights (Dust 1 and LanfieldTwo).
