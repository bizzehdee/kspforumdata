Basically I need something like a RAID 1 setup but two of them. I want to have two mirrored 4tb disks and two mirrored 2tb disks. So the question is can I accomplish this with a 4 bay hardware RAID enclosure, or do I need two dual enclosures side by side? Or would it be easier (and cheaper) to just get a regular SATA -\u0026gt; eSATA / USB3 enclosure with no RAID controller and use software (what software?) to mirror on the fly, and hopefully only show 2 disks instead of 4 under My Computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if that\u0027s a little confusing, I\u0027m just trying to figure out the easiest and most cost effective way to make sure my important data is crash proof.

There are many data loss scenarios and it only protects you against one, hardware failure. Rather, RAID (ignoring RAID 0) is about availability - being able to keep the system running despite the hardware failure. Important for a server, maybe useful for a desktop especially if you rely on it for business, but no substitute for real backups.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T23:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell hardware failure is my biggest concern. In my scenario it won\u0027t be running an OS or anything and if the data does become corrupted it probably happened before it made its way to this setup in the first place, and even if it did happen after I might not catch it before I update a backup manually. Once the data goes to this setup it probably won\u0027t be modified. I was hoping to have this all pretty much hands free until a disk fails which I could promptly replace.

If I set up 4 identical computers. Each has 6x 3Tb HDD in a RAID 6, a 60Gb SSD for the OS and another 60Gb SSD for cache. Each kit has 2 1GbE ports in a teem, running an iscsi link to a managing computer. Now, on the managing computer, would it be possible to use a software RAID, and make the 4 iscsi links in a single RAID 5? This would be to increase overall uptime, because there would be the hardware RAID on the kits managing the RAID 6 on the individual kits. Then the software RAID on the management computer RAIDing the 4 iscsi links into a single RAID 5, so in the case more than two HDDs fail on a kit before they can be replaced, a hot spare kit kicks in, until you replace the two (or more) HDDs on the failed system. Than that system you just repaired would become the hot-spare in the iscsi link.
