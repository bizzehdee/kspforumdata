The tape is a bit too obvious but you\u0027re correct that KSP is the actual standard and you have to work to the results you see there.\n\nA thin layer of inconsistent dust is a good idea on everything, I\u0027m sure that\u0027s exactly what it had when it flew, and about 10 seconds after it started flying the nice white CM cover was probably coated in smashed bugs.\n\nAnd yes, if you really start understanding the capabilities of SP and SD in combination with all of the baked maps, filters/materials, blending modes, and masking methods it can be an exceptionally elegant suite of tools that let you do things very quickly that can\u0027t be done at all in any other tool. The problem is that is a sea of dynamically interacting variables and most people have to settle with learning a few workflows to do what they need. The ones that really get it can become a force multiplier for a floor full of SP artists and are highly valued. I can see and you should be able to see that you\u0027re going to be closing in on that state in a year or two, you should keep in mind the possibility of a change in careers to doing something you really enjoy.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the people who are really good at SD make a nice supplementary income selling regular and smart materials and filters/etc. to those of us who can\u0027t follow you down the rabbit hole. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nConfused about the text comment though, as I remember putting arbitrary text on my SP models and I didn\u0027t bring in any special filters, there are fonts in the alphas part of the shelf. I might have had to do it letter by letter, that what you mean?\n\nAlso I was wondering why I don\u0027t see more people using [GMAX](https://www.turbosquid.com/gmax), it\u0027s 10 years old now but you know how much has changed in the core modeling functions of MAX in the last 10 years? Very little and zero in mesh editing. I downloaded and installed it and yep, it\u0027s nearly identical to the modeling studio I have in MAX 2018. It has poor rendering and material support by today\u0027s standards, but if I were going free I would use GMAX for all modeling and Blender or something else for rendering."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T02:51:46Z","Content":"![txmxgVQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/txmxgVQ.png)\n\nAnd how to grin like an idiot:\n\n![se17hLN.png](https://i.imgur.com/se17hLN.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T02:58:49Z","Content":"[@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) I think if you hold your face close enough to your monitor you will see your own reflection!"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T06:25:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Nightside said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) I think if you hold your face close enough to your monitor you will see your own reflection!\n\u003E \n\nHe already did.\n\nI don\u0027t know if KSP will be the one to go there since they started intentionally on the non-realism end of the spectrum, but some day there will be a KSP merged with Elite Dangerous or something, 4 or 8k hyper-realistic graphics, procedural galaxies and solar systems and tectonic/weather/biological systems wed to physics much better than we have in KSP,  that\u0027s something to look forward to.\n\nThat feeling you get on a breakthrough game reminds me of playing DOOM for the first time a couple days after it came out, I was sneaking upstairs and around a corner to a room... and I realized I was leaning way the hell over in my chair, trying to see around the corner of the room on my CRT screen.
