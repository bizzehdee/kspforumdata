If I use a couple of mods on their own - especially the smaller ones - everything is fine. But KWRocketry, Near Future and Umbra don\u0027t seem to mix very well (which is a shame, since I really like to build self-sustaining ships, stations and bases). Usually with all these mods installed the game loads, I can build and launch rockets, but returning to the Space Center usually crashes the game back to desktop and the corresponding logfile shows \u0022out of memory\u0022 error messages (which I guess concerns the 32 bit address space, since I got 8 GB of physical memory and KSP is using around 3 GB of that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a similar note, if I install EVE/Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack together with all the mods mentioned above, the game will either crash back to desktop directly after the loading screen is finished, or the game will stop on the loading screen (it won\u0027t crash though, it just stops loading the remaining mods/files). I know that EVE is not yet (?) available for KSP 0.25, but if I use EVE without any of the other mods, the game loads and runs fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo try and fix this, I deleted all local game content in Steam, deleted the KSP folder in \u0027common games\u0027 manually, redownloaded KSP, redownloaded every mod, reinstalled every mod one by one and checked if they all worked (they did). But putting them all together makes the game crash constantly. Am I missing something? Or is this just the way it is and some Mods don\u0027t mix? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027ve got more than 400 hours of playtime in KSP and I\u0027m looking to make the end-game more difficult and more interesting by adding the need for life support (oxygen, food \u0026amp; water consumption, CO2 recycling and so on), therefore making the construction of (self sustaining) space stations and colonies somewhat more challenging. Also the addition of near future (theoretical) propulsions allows the construction of some interesting space craft. Anyway, while I found lots of mods that do parts of what I want there doesn\u0027t seem to be a single mod that offers the kind of mix I\u0027m looking for (except for Kerbal Interstellar maybe, but the last time I tested that it was unstable all on its own without any additional mods). And when I\u0027m putting all the mods together the game becomes highly unstable. I know there is probably nobody to blame for this, but it\u0027s somewhat frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nlight","CreatedById":123442,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T13:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like an issue with your install.

Apart from that I\u0027m running an overclocked i7 (prime \u0026amp; IBT stable, OC\u0027ed for over two years without issues) and two overclocked GTX 780 together with three screens, giving a total resolution of 6048x1200. Everything is watercooled and \u0022battle tested\u0022 with lots of applications and games. Bottom line: my system runs fine everywhere else, it\u0027s been ages since I\u0027ve seen my last Win7 bluescreen or error message, the system is even buffered with an external UPS and I\u0027ve installed as little software as possible (meaning my windows installation is basically \u0027naked\u0027, there are no \u0027optimization tools\u0027 or whatever, it more or less comes down to: Windows \u002B latest patches \u002B latest drivers (no betas, always stable versions) \u002B Steam \u002B Games).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding any issues with my installation of KSP: I redownloaded the game after deleting all local files in steam \u0026amp; manually removing the folder from steam common apps, and then I redownloaded each mod. But again while each mod individually works fine the game starts to misbehave when I want to for instance load \u0027Interstellar\u0027 and \u0027Astronomers Visual Pack\u0027 (crash right after game finishes loading all parts-files). I think Active Texture Management comes with one of the mods anyway (Interstellar, I think), but I will give it a go and install that mod manually. I should also mention that in Astronomers Visual Pack I only use \u0027reasonable\u0027 texture resolutions (512x512), nothing extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, when running KSP 32 bit the game is limited to 30 fps no matter which value I set the ingame framelimiter to). When running the 64 bit version it runs at 60 fps. Is this intentional or is this 30 fps limit already a sympton?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T14:28:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk the benefit of my limited experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 32-bit version is capped at 4Gb RAM usage but realistically will probably top out and crash somewhere between 3.2 and 3.6, having lots of mods can push you over the limit and some are more resource hungry than others, KAS and Interstellar are both quite hungry but none of the others you\u0027ve listed are especially at least of the ones I\u0027ve tried . . . however ALL the USI ones might be a bit of a drain, I only use Karbonite myself.

Also currently neither Interstellar or its Lite version work properly on 0.25 due to their dependence on an updated 3rd party mod (Treeloader).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience however as KSP tends to load up ALL its assets as the game loads so a \u0022too many mods\u0022 problem usually results in a crash before you even get to the title screen, which is kind what you describe. Memory usage does not increase dramatically during play so if you get crashes after you start playing for this reason you must be running it pretty close to the 4Gb wire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I run with quite a lot of mods (probably more than you list, although many of mine are pretty light!) on 32-bit with no issues, memory usage pretty stable around 3.2Gb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t personally tried it but the 64-bit version is notoriously unstable and you\u0027ll probably be getting crashes here that aren\u0027t anything to do with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T14:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bishop149\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T14:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E8GB RAM, used around 75% when crashing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry but the above may mean nothing, or all. You should tell how much memory KSP is using, not the whole memory used system-wide. If you are using KSP 32bit, you can\u0027t go beyond 4GB virtual addressable memory (more or less, 3.4 GB physical RAM assigned to the KSP process). If you are instead using the Win x64 version, you may use all memory the system allows (that means, much more than the physical RAM you have, 8GB). But, KSP 0.25 x64 is extremely unstable, and many add-ons have not been designed to be run for that version. There is almost no possibility to provide help with add-ons not meant to work for that version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T14:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E32 bit runs at 60fps for me.

You could have 800GB of ram and KSP would still only use 4. Most mod devs have given up trying to support x64 version, so if your using that there is no telling what\u0027s wrong. Truth is the x64 version often won\u0027t load beyond 4GB of ram either. Your system stability isn\u0027t in question here. It\u0027s a symptom of the way textures are handled in the game and the limits of RAM of a 32bit application.
