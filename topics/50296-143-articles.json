I see a lot of posts saying they come in very shallow approaches and are still burning up. I had the same misconception about reentry, thinking that shallow reentry = safe reentry (until I googled it). Using DRE (and in real life), if reentry is too shallow you will run out of ablative shielding and burn up. If reentry is too steep, G forces will kill the crew*. So the trick is to have your approach in the window between running out of shielding (too shallow) and G force death (too steep). From LKO (~75k Ap), the lower your Pe is the safer it is because your reentry speed is not enough for a G force death*. After a certain Ap height/reentry speed, G force death becomes possible and you have to find the safe window. And the window gets smaller the faster your reentry is, until at a certain speed there is no possible angle where your crew will survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Probably also worth mentioning that heavier craft will need shallower approaches to reach safe parachute speeds, which is why the wider shields have more shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Depending on your drag.

I see a lot of posts saying they come in very shallow approaches and are still burning up. I had the same misconception about reentry, thinking that shallow reentry = safe reentry (until I googled it). Using DRE (and in real life), if reentry is too shallow you will run out of ablative shielding and burn up. If reentry is too steep, G forces will kill the crew*. So the trick is to have your approach in the window between running out of shielding (too shallow) and G force death (too steep). From LKO (~75k Ap), the lower your Pe is the safer it is because your reentry speed is not enough for a G force death*. After a certain Ap height/reentry speed, G force death becomes possible and you have to find the safe window. And the window gets smaller the faster your reentry is, until at a certain speed there is no possible angle where your crew will survive.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Probably also worth mentioning that heavier craft will need shallower approaches to reach safe parachute speeds, which is why the wider shields have more shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Depending on your drag.

You can get away with steeper reentries over Kerbin than you would over Earth IRL. I think in part that is because Kerbin has had to be made more dangerous than it would be IRL.

Not sure how much realism will ever enter into it though since as Nathan has pointed out, a realistic Kerbin reentry isn\u0027t nearly as deadly as one over Earth. That said though, the stock system dissipates a LOT of heat even for a default DRE Kerbin reentry.

A lot of the shields that the mod comes with (and a few 3rd party shields like SDHI are modified by DRE) to have a value of 0.01 so they\u0027re only transferring about 1% of what they take in. That can prove to be a double edged sword though since it means that shields can take in heat from external, non-reentry sources that can destroy them.
