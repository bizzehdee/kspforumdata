But if you get all the science you need, or forget to activate 100% conversion once you\u0027ve unlocked the entire tree, you might get stuck with 5000-odd science points that can\u0027t be turned into something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a way to convert X Science to Y Funds, or back again (With tax, of course!
