Then I found out that MechJeb could supposedly dock stuff automatically for you so I downloaded it. All I got is the pod with the rather annoying \u0022eye\u0022. So, in order to use mech jeb you have to have the pod attached to the vessel, or is there some other way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I also have TAC fuel balancer and FlightEngineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T15:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a part called AR202, which is a small box that you can stick to the side of your craft.

Yes, it does work but you can dock manually with just a fraction MechJeb uses. Best solution is to use MechJeb as an aid and perform the maneuver yourself. Select the ports as control and target, open smart A.S.S, select target and click Par-. This will hold both craft nicely aligned and facing each other.
