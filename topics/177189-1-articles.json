I\u0027m proposing a middle option in which these facilities are initially unavailable, but then become unlocked after they are first visited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be a pretty effective way to motivate gameplay for several reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou get the challenge of starting without these facilities without having to close yourself off from them forever\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s a gameplay objective on Kerbin, rather than far out in the system where fewer players end up reaching\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMultiple strategies to take advantage of this: You could tech into planes first to go and find these, or build a relay network so you can search for them with probes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be presented simply as anomalies to land at or there could be a career mission pointing them out.
