A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E makes perfectly clear, that \u0022estimated burn time\u0022 on the impact tracker is telling you, in

\u0022your current trajectory would have you slam into the surface at a speed that\u0027s equal to 45 seconds of continuous thrust.\u0022\u00A0 Which means if you burn, you should see that number go down (because you should be reducing your speed, which means the how-many-seconds-of-thrust-will-my-impact-speed-be should be going down, too).\u00A0 If you\u0027re burning and the number isn\u0027t

patterns are vague, and fuzzy, and human brains are very good at interpreting them, and computers absolutely suck at it.\u00A0 The numbers can fluctuate all over the place.\u00A0 Your brain needs to be looking at a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epattern\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of rate of change of the numbers that is different from \u0022normal\u0022 or \u0022usual\u0022 or \u0022expected\u0022-- on the general principle of \u0022anything different is bad\u0022.\u00A0 And it\u0027s easy to do this, for a human; we\u0027re wired for it.\u00A0 Anybody who plays with BBT and makes a few vacuum landings with it is going to fairly quickly start to see patterns there-- \u0022when I burn like this, the numbers change like that, and here\u0027s the situation that results.\u0022\u00A0 You may say, \u0022But \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI\u0027m\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E having trouble interpreting those patterns,\u0022 in which case I\u0027m sorry-- just means some more practice is needed.\u00A0 However, consider that if \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyou\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (with your enormously powerful pattern-matching supercomputer in your head) have trouble with this, why do you think a pinheaded \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emod\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E developed by one guy in his spare time is going to be able to do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a whole set of complicated variables going on during a vacuum landing.\u00A0 Some of these are easily accessible to the mod; others aren\u0027t.\u00A0 You may be approaching the ground steeply or shallowly; you may have high or low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E; the terrain may be flat, or sloping up, or sloping down, or alternating between up/down slopes; you may be intending to switch on other engines later, or you may not; you may have ballast you can drop, or you may not.\u00A0 Just the terrain fluctuation alone can cause all kind of distortions in the pattern-- if I tried to program BBT to sound an alert because \u0022the pattern of the number dropping isn\u0027t good\u0022, how the heck do I define \u0022good\u0022?\u00A0 I can\u0027t just pick a number and choose \u0022above or below this number\u0022-- it would be giving false negatives and false positives all the time when the terrain fluctuates, and would therefore be worse than useless to the user by \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elying\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not going to write a mod that lies.\u00A0 If I\u0027d like to provide a number... but it\u0027s not a reliable one and is wrong in unpredictable ways.... then \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI\u0027m not gonna provide that number\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Do not want.\u00A0 I\u0027d be doing my users a disservice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in short:\u00A0 In your situation, you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edid\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E get an alarm; you simply hadn\u0027t learned how to interpret it.\u00A0 The alarm was \u0022hey, my estimated burn time isn\u0027t dropping the way it should\u0022, as displayed in those two numbers.\u00A0 The solution isn\u0027t for me to write a bunch of code, taking a huge amount of my time to generate results that will often be wrong and kill kerbals.\u00A0 The solution is to learn how to interpret the numbers, e.g. \u0022I want my time to impact to be about 60-70% of the estimated burn time.\u0022\u00A0 That rule of thumb will tell you when to start the burn, and how to adjust the throttle during the burn, if necessary.\u00A0 Just takes a little practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

investment of effort for me, in return for solving a problem that I don\u0027t have and that isn\u0027t a blocker for anyone who practices vacuum landings a bit... well, that doesn\u0027t mean that I won\u0027t do it, but it does tend to lower the priority of the feature-- I\u0027ve got other mods to work on with things that I want more urgently than this.\u00A0 When I\u0027ve got more

\u003Cstrong\u003Ethere is no way to make the impact tracker any better without making it more terrain-aware.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, BetterBurnTime is completely ignorant of topography.\u00A0 It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E projecting your impact point, at all.\u00A0 When it\u0027s doing its time-to-impact and estimated burn time calculations, it\u0027s just taking the almost embarrassingly simple-minded approach of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u0027s the elevation of the ground directly under the ship right at this moment\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (because that number is easily, cheaply, and instantly available to the code), and then making the extremely-simplified assumption that the ground is flat and level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works great if you\u0027re landing somewhere that actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E flat and level, like Minmus\u0027 flats... but usually the ground isn\u0027t.\u00A0 Sometimes spectacularly so.\u00A0 And when the ground\u0027s not level, that\u0027s going to throw off the estimate.\u00A0 If the ground is sloping down away from you as you descend, then your impact time is going to be farther into the future than it\u0027s telling you.\u00A0 And if the ground is sloping \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eup\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to meet you... well then, impact will be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esooner\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than it\u0027s telling you, so you\u0027d better watch out!\u00A0 That\u0027s how ships go splat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t mean the tool is useless.\u00A0 It does continuously update its estimate, so if you\u0027re flying over sloping ground, it will continuously update the estimated impact and burn times.\u00A0 But this means that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe player has to pay attention to the terrain and keep an eye on how the ground is sloping\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 If you see that you\u0027re flying over upward-sloping ground, you know you\u0027d better start your burn earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... there\u0027s a way to make that better.\u00A0 I could alter BetterBurnTime so that it actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E project your trajectory ahead of you, and figures out where the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E impact site would be, and uses the terrain elevation \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 This would make it more accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it would also be a substantial programming job, because there\u0027s no simple algebraic formula to code here-- basically the code would have to numerically brute force it by sampling the elevation at multiple points along the projected suborbital path, then recursively zeroing in to find a good candidate.\u00A0 That\u0027s not only a fair amount of code to write, but it\u0027s also computationally expensive and not something that I can do on every frame without slowing the player\u0027s CPU to a crawl, which means I\u0027d need to write \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E code to make it update the calculations only at intervals and cache the results and so forth, so it\u0027s a chunk of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... that\u0027s \u0022level 1\u0022 of the improvement.\u00A0 It would make the impact tracker better and more accurate, and would be absolutely required before further work can be done-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebut it would not, by itself, be enough to give you an accurate suicide-burn countdown\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 That\u0027s because it would only be giving an accurate impact prediction \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eif you leave your engines off and coast to your doom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which of course is generally not what the player wants to do.\u00A0 You want to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eland\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not just proceed to a highly-accurately-predicted lithobraking.\u00A0 \u003Cimg

you\u0027re going to be turning on your engines.\u00A0 And the moment you start your burn, you\u0027re going to be altering your speed/direction profile, a lot, so that the projection of your future trajectory \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eunder thrust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E will be completely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means that to enable the \u0022accurate suicide burn countdown\u0022 feature, what I\u0027d have to do is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efirst\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E implement \u0022level 1\u0022 as described above... and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do an even bigger chunk of work to implement level 2, which would be this:\u00A0 as the ship descends, repeatedly do calculations where it says \u0022okay, suppose I start a \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/retrograde2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022\u003E burn right now, let\u0027s simulate the physics and predict where the ship will go by doing a highly iterative, very computationally expensive set of calculations to simulate the descent.\u00A0 And then re-do that calculation frequently during the entire descent phase to correct for any errors that accumulate along the way.\u00A0 And somehow do all of that without utterly hosing the player\u0027s CPU.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is probably reasonably doable, to at least a reasonably close degree of fidelity.\u00A0 It would allow me to add a set of \u0022countdown timer\u0022 dots to the impact tracker, the same as it currently has for the maneuver-node tracker and target-rendezvous tracker, so that ideally all you\u0027d have to do is basically exactly what you want:\u00A0 wait until the dots count down to zero, and then hit the gas.\u00A0 (And if its projection shows that there\u0027s no way for you to land because you\u0027re underpowered or whatever... that would, of necessity, pop out of the calculations, and I could just show an \u0022N/A\u0022 instead of a set of dots for the countdown timer, or something.\u00A0 Which would give you exactly the warning you want.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, such a feature would be kinda neat.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebig\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E programming job.\u00A0 And also a very tedious testing job.\u00A0 And also there\u0027s a significant chance I could put in a few weeks of work, and get it implemented, and only \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E discover that I just can\u0027t get the CPU usage low enough to make the feature both accurate and usable, in which case I\u0027d have to just scrap it and would have spent all those weeks of work for nothing.\u00A0 And it\u0027s all to solve a \u0022problem\u0022 that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI, myself, don\u0027t actually have in my own gameplay\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, since I find that I can land just fine in the current implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... hopefully

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E projecting your impact point, at all.\u00A0 When it\u0027s doing its time-to-impact and estimated burn time calculations, it\u0027s just taking the almost embarrassingly simple-minded approach of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u0027s the elevation of the ground directly under the ship right at this moment\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (because that number is easily, cheaply, and instantly available to the code), and then making the extremely-simplified assumption that the ground is flat and level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works great if you\u0027re landing somewhere that actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E flat and level, like Minmus\u0027 flats... but usually the ground isn\u0027t.\u00A0 Sometimes spectacularly so.\u00A0 And when the ground\u0027s not level, that\u0027s going to throw off the estimate.\u00A0 If the ground is sloping down away from you as you descend, then your impact time is going to be farther into the future than it\u0027s telling you.\u00A0 And if the ground is sloping \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eup\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to meet you... well then, impact will be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esooner\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than it\u0027s telling you, so you\u0027d better watch out!\u00A0 That\u0027s how ships go splat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t mean the tool is useless.\u00A0 It does continuously update its estimate, so if you\u0027re flying over sloping ground, it will continuously update the estimated impact and burn times.\u00A0 But this means that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe player has to pay attention to the terrain and keep an eye on how the ground is sloping\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 If you see that you\u0027re flying over upward-sloping ground, you know you\u0027d better start your burn earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... there\u0027s a way to make that better.\u00A0 I could alter BetterBurnTime so that it actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E project your trajectory ahead of you, and figures out where the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E impact site would be, and uses the terrain elevation \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 This would make it more accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it would also be a substantial programming job, because there\u0027s no simple algebraic formula to code here-- basically the code would have to numerically brute force it by sampling the elevation at multiple points along the projected suborbital path, then recursively zeroing in to find a good candidate.\u00A0 That\u0027s not only a fair amount of code to write, but it\u0027s also computationally expensive and not something that I can do on every frame without slowing the player\u0027s CPU to a crawl, which means I\u0027d need to write \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E code to make it update the calculations only at intervals and cache the results and so forth, so it\u0027s a chunk of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... that\u0027s \u0022level 1\u0022 of the improvement.\u00A0 It would make the impact tracker better and more accurate, and would be absolutely required before further work can be done-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebut it would not, by itself, be enough to give you an accurate suicide-burn countdown\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 That\u0027s because it would only be giving an accurate impact prediction \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eif you leave your engines off and coast to your doom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which of course is generally not what the player wants to do.\u00A0 You want to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eland\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not just proceed to a highly-accurately-predicted lithobraking.\u00A0 \u003Cimg

you\u0027re going to be turning on your engines.\u00A0 And the moment you start your burn, you\u0027re going to be altering your speed/direction profile, a lot, so that the projection of your future trajectory \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eunder thrust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E will be completely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means that to enable the \u0022accurate suicide burn

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do an even bigger chunk of work to implement level 2, which would be this:\u00A0 as the ship descends, repeatedly do calculations where it

title=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022\u003E burn right now, let\u0027s simulate the physics and predict where the ship will go by doing a highly iterative, very computationally expensive set of calculations

without utterly hosing the player\u0027s CPU.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is probably reasonably doable, to at least a reasonably close degree of fidelity.\u00A0 It would allow me to add a set of \u0022countdown timer\u0022 dots to the impact tracker, the same as it currently has for the maneuver-node tracker and target-rendezvous tracker, so that ideally all you\u0027d have to do is basically exactly what you want:\u00A0 wait until the dots count down to zero, and then hit the gas.\u00A0 (And if its projection shows that there\u0027s no way for you to land because you\u0027re underpowered or whatever... that would, of necessity, pop out of the calculations, and I could just show an \u0022N/A\u0022 instead of a set of dots for the countdown timer, or something.\u00A0 Which would give you exactly the warning you want.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, such a feature would be kinda neat.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

work, and get it implemented, and only \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E discover that I just can\u0027t get the CPU usage low enough to make the feature both accurate and usable, in which case I\u0027d have to just scrap it and would have spent all those weeks of work for nothing.\u00A0 And it\u0027s all to solve a \u0022problem\u0022 that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI,

If your engines can\u0027t bring you to a stop in the time it\u0027s saying you need it was saying\u00A0 less time than you actually needed.\u00A0 The only way I can see this happening is if BBT
