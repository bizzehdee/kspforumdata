Also, when trying to add in a hangar, there is no message and the gui doesn\u0027t update, but a buggy copy of the ship appears in the VAB. It renders as if it was attached, but it\u0027s floating and you can select each part separately.\u003Cp\u003ECrash: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6jOUuzqqfjEUkdYUU1HWFdyUVU/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6jOUuzqqfjEUkdYUU1HWFdyUVU/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think this may be partially incompatible with Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. I think the joint stiffening that it does on vessel loading is causing my ships to explode when I pre-load them from the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was unable to reproduce either of the bugs on my side. Both Joint Reinforcement and Procedural Parts (batteries included) work nicely with hangars. Still, in the logs you provided I\u0027ve found an exception responcible for the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022buggy copy of the ship appears in the VAB\u0022\u003C/em\u003E. As I understand it, the exception occurred when you tried to load a ship that either contained some missing parts or some of the parts\u0027 modules were unable to initialize properly. I added some additional checks before vessel loading into a hangar, so (I hope) this should not happen again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBut.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Unity\u003Cstrong\u003Elog weights 121Mb\u003C/strong\u003E.

One is the color scheme. I hate to rag on it because I know it is hard work, but I would love to see a more stock alike look. Maybe just a grey/white texture. It\u0027s just that the colors as they are really clash with almost everything I pair them with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond thing is two fold. One is it\u0027d be really nice to have attachment nodes on the sides of the hanger. That way I could mount it side ways and have a short fat hanger if wanted. Second part is that the ends just kind of fit awkwardly. For instance let\u0027s say you take the inline hanger at its default size and attach a mk1 to the top. It looks kind of odd. But if you attached a larger command pod it also looks a bit off. Just like it doesn\u0027t really fit. Not really sure how that could be fixed since the hanger resizes on the go. Maybe if the ends could have selectable sizes like in procedural parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow this doesn\u0027t come off as critical or anything.
