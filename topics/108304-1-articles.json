When I\u0027d finished my EVA I went to get back in my lander, misjudged the jump and got knocked off it. Upon being hit off it everything, and I really do mean everything (planets, kerbals, ships etc) vanished. The GUI in the top corner remains though. I\u0027ve tried restarting the game but this didn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve also tried re-installing it but again, no luck. I\u0027ve seen some threads stating that I can edit the savegame but none that actually state how to edit it in order to fix the issue. If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated as having to restart career mode again would make it the 12th time due to bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running the game on Steam with no mods.
