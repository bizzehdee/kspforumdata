You still need to pay science, in fact research time is based on it. If you give yourself a bucketload of science (by contract advancement, for example), I think it might work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElaborating, you could set yourself up so experiments themselves give minimal - if any - science. Make plenty of contracts based on running experiments on different situations and biomes, and have the contracts give you science instead, both in advance and by milestone / completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetup time as resource by other means (life support, for instance), and KCT to have nodes unlock by time. Have it so you must pay to unlock parts, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
