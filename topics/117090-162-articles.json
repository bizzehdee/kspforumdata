I don\u0027t tend to use the small one, but that\u0027s what\u0027s on the Apollo, so it seems like it would make sense from a \u00A0completeness POV (even though the LC is more Constellation like).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DOS-LAB solar arrays clip the OMS thrusters (dunno what to call them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the landing tanks, while the solar and gear stuff is no longer there, perhaps the \u0022fill-in\u0022 part that appears when those tanks had one of those could be added back just to make the gears not look like they are floating stuck on the outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAirlocks... how/where are you going to add hatches to various parts (like the station parts)? \u00A0Would you instead make a modular airlock part? Ie: a reasonable sized airlock (room for a few kerbal helmets at the smallest size) with an adaptor part to allow attachment to various sizes (and/or docking ports as either station parts have). Do the default station parts include a docking port? ( I will take every single rescue contract in a career and see if your parts appear and check that). If that\u0027s how they spawn in rescue, then any rescue of your parts can be completed via docking (works with the pods right now), and hatches are not required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about the orbital construction facility idea again, and it seems like a simple manipulator arm part could be made. No need for it to actually function, it\u0027s just an arm (1 part with a joint (fixed, but a slight bend for looks, or a grabber length and an arm part, and players can rotate them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E as they like)\u00A0with a mini grabber part at the end.

You\u0027d arm the thing, then just bump the cargo into it. Could the grabber be a part, and then have the arm length be adjustable? Use a 0 or short length arm to make a small construction pod (\u0022open the pod bay doors, Hal\u0022), then a longer one for something like ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022remote_grabber.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/remote_grabber.jpg\u0022\u003ESince the welding works so well, perhaps there could be parts like the truss that the large solar array is on, but that have built-in welding ports?

Design for effect,\u00A0the actual utility\u00A0is more important here.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe real problem I\u0027ve had in designing plausible vehicles is the problem with hab multipliers, which make little sense to me. The idea is that working space (e.g., labs) give you some available space, hab modules give more more room to move (bonus kerbalmonths) and multipliers are supposed to be parts which give benefits throughout the whole ship. To give a far-future (slightly\u00A0silly) example, a cinema or pub would give you a bonus throughout, not just for that module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a less far-future example, I think the toruses are more than reasonable to use as hab modifiers. Crews can rotate through the ship, so having work time\u00A0spent in-gravity during transit is of great overall benefit to the crew. What values are given here are something quite different though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThinking in terms of actual game effect, I don\u0027t think you should *need* artificial gravity for a Duna mission. It would be nice, and might be a really good idea, but I think you should be able to get by\u00A0without. This is also a good reason to have torus parts above hab parts on the CTT, so you can slum it in a low tech manner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuna transit is less than\u00A0300 days, so that\u0027s a reasonable figure to aim at for a Deep Space Habitat-like vehicle (i.e., ISS Lab module, ISS docking nod, ISS hab/MPLM module \u002B propulsion bus, Orion and MMSEV). Architecture of this manner could keep a transit vehicle in-orbit and land the crew to an unmanned and previously deployed surface hab.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnything beyond Duna should probably require artificial gravity. Checking out the Outer Planets mod, the extremes of the solar system (Neidon and Plock) are something like 23 and 35\u002B years to transit for a minimum energy transfer one way. Clearly then, a long term space habitat needs to end up with hab time approaching 50-100 years. That might be with a minimum crew (probably 4 or 6, since 2x Scientists, 1x Pilot, 1x Engineer seems sensible as crew minimum in most cases in KSP, but there are arguments for more\u00A0especially with mission involving ISRU or other base parts. If I recall correctly,\u00A0UKS does model \u0022unhappiness\u0022 in the form of inefficiency\u00A0for fewer than five kerbals at a Kolony, which may or may not be a consideration).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, just throwing some arbitrary\u00A0numbers out for the extreme end of things:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30 man torus for a 6 crew long (really long) duration mission would have:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(30 \u002B Bonus Kerbal months) * Multiplier / Crew\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout bonuses, hab time is 150 days per crew member.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssuming a bonus of 200 kerbal months (one KM per seat means this is \u002B170) and a crew of six, that\u0027s:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30 \u002B 170 * Multiplier / 6\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing a \u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplier of 30 and bonus of\u00A0200 Kerbalmonths\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0here would allow for the largest torus to support hab time for six crew for about\u00A070 years. That seems reasonable to me as a top-end \u0022permanent\u0022\u00A0habitat, and is within reason for an\u00A0interstellar flight (therefore a decent\u00A0practical endgame\u00A0limit for KSP).
