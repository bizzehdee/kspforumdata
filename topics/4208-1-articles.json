That would be the only way to do what you want. Even then I am thinking that they may not even act independently if they are all controlled by the ASAS anyway. It might just be a wash. I do know for certain that they are much more effective at attitude control when you make them small and light with a much higher range of gimbal. They don\\\u0027t require much thrust at all and the consumption should be low. This would be much preferred to using RCS for atmospheric work.
