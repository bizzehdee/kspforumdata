If any part of it changes you have to download the pack again, license resolution is a pain, it\u0027s pretty much only a snapshot of how one person plays, and in the end it just feels like someone trying to ride the coat-tails of a bunch of different mod authors, regardless of their actual intentions. The funny thing is that if you get a mod pack and you intend to maintain it yourself, you might as well have just downloaded all the pieces individually in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of building a mod pack, one of the better things you could do for the community is to provide a categorized list of mods that link to their respective release posts.

Its very easy to maintain mod installations in KSP, so much of the convenience of the packs you see from Minecraft is lost (especially since in game you might get a bunch of new windows at once if you install more than one plugin, and it would actually be harder to learn than if you installed and learned them one by one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can maintain a thread with links to a bunch of mods you think work well together and let people pick them up that way That also solves the licensing concern as well as the hassle of having to maintain a large download and update it when each member mod is release (and you WOULD need to keep it updated, or your pack is being harmful)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I am just not sure there is much demand for these.

Unlike minecraft mods can only conflict with eachother in code, and that\u0027s not something you can fix or as a modpack should fix. There are not unique conflictable IDs, except for PART{name} which is a text string. The only thing a mod pack does is reduce the number of downloads which is pretty insignificant, and reduce overall stability because users will wait for you to put the updated version of a mod in your pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a fanbase that would like to play the same set as you or disseminated crafts/persistance it makes a little sense, but other modpacks serve no purpose in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T23:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most useful thing I\u0027d think someone could do if they wanted to do a Let\u0027s Play is to do what Direwolf20 does for Minecraft: Make a post with links to the mods you\u0027re using, and an annotated video that shows how to install them properly.
