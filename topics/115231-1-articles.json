The game is meant to get more and more Intense as we construct our empires.. No limits to how you can play! Create armies! Destroy the universe! make peace! Do ANYTHING!\n\nThe story so far:\n\nA galactic war began. The dominant powers are, Junior, Sampa, Xannari, Trainengie, and Vinster.\n\nThey each claimed a portion of the galaxy. They started with petty attacks, bacon feasts, and gravity messing-around-with. The first major event occurred at the center of the galaxy, where Vinster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s colony, located inside an asteroid, went critical. After much effort, Vinster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s people scattered around the blast radius and resettled in the void in the middle of the galaxy.\n\nSampa and Xannari made a truce, and the galaxy was at peace as they settled into an era of no conflict. It ended as soon as Sampa began raiding small enemy targets that had settled. Then Xannari became suspicious. Xannari stole blueprints for a massive ship. Xannari nearly arrested by Sampa after Xannari responded with a threat to destroy the flagship of Sampa\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fleet. Xannari escaped. Xannari surrendered and rejoined Sampa.\n\nJunior joined Sampa, and they traded techs, becoming an alliance. Xannari began to show odd symptoms, such as Xannari speaking of the Great attractor, the most powerful gravitational force known to man, where Xannari made a colony.\n\nStrange things happened: The great attractor showed signs of meeting the same fate as the center of the galaxy; Junior completed his signature particle shield.\n\nXannari accuses Vinster of causing the near collapse. From then on, Xannari became a warmonger. The center of the galaxy nearly exploded again, but Junior saved everyone. Junior, while investigating the disturbance, which Sampa identified as a wormhole later, is ambushed. Junior and the ship barely survive the attack. Xannari snaps at this point and threatens everyone with missiles.\n\nJunior recovers and Sampa and Xannari break their alliance. Sampa takes aggressive action against Xannari, who armed his missiles. Xannari attempted to assassinate Junior and his planet with an irradiates space ship.\n\nA massive battle breaks out after Junior recovers and saves the fleet from radiation death. The combined forces of Sampa and Junior fought against and eventually imprisoned. At this point, Junior and Sampa found the Galactic Alliance and create a central Station: the Citadel. This heavily defended station is created and promptly destroyed by an unknown 3rd faction.\n\nJunior nearly dies when shot in the back, spending a week recovering. Sampa confronts Xannari a final time. Sampa hand-to-hand fights with Xannari, ending with Sampa shooting himself in the head so he wouldn\u0027t be court-marshalled for his crime. (If Fallout New Vegas taught us anything, you can survive a bullet in the brain.) He recovered with the help of Xannari and faced his fate. Xannari disappeared and is presumed dead. Sampa was let away scot-free. After, the fleet constructs Citadel 2, a replacement. The Alliance welcome this era of peace.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe next poster gets the first move!\n\nUPDATE 1:\n\nI got rid of sides.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T04:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dark Junior**"},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T20:50:39Z","Content":"I declare that the Milky Way is my property.\n\np.s.\n\nAlso I claim my place as the leading authority figure of the 1st side.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T21:02:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overfloater**"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T01:36:42Z","Content":"I claim Andromeda, and I have also built an ultra efficient army with spaceships on one of the best planets for life."},{"CreatedByName":"Djslime6764","CreatedById":140412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T01:45:12Z","Content":"I claim the Kerbol System.......
