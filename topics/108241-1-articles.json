As the DAV weighs 40 tons fully fueled, nothing in my launch vehicle fleet can lift it straight to Duna. I am RPing that it uses the Mars Direct plan of launching to Duna nearly unfueled, and making its fuel there, but no KSP mod can do that. This leaves me with a choice: I can either launch to Duna unfueled, and use Hyperedit magic to help me, or I can launch to Duna fully fueled, and have a gigantic lifter or a Nerva transfer stage.

The KRV is launched to Duna on a chemical booster, but enters orbit using its engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch 4 happens at the same time as Launch 3. This launch has a copy of the Hab Module, but this time, its manned by a crew of 2 Kerbonauts.(This time, its Jeb and Val) The Hab II lands near the other 2 spacecraft, and the crew is unloaded onto the surface, where they stay for 7 months before departing into LDO. The crew use the DAV\u0027s command module to dock with the KRV, before taking a 3-month-long burn to reach Kerbin. The crew then enter the DAV\u0027s command module where they re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets just hope this works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VASMIR","CreatedById":143455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelete this thread, as Dunashot will now be hosted on We Are the Explorers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
