Manually calculating the steps for\u00A0a Hohmann Transfer, good luck with that. It\u0027s technically feasible, you can save and try to nail the correct burn points a few dozen times before you get close enough. But that isn\u0027t fun once, it\u0027s sure as hell not fun when you\u0027re on your 20th rendezvous as you build your space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA has never once done an orbital rendezvous without having multiple computers calculate the burns and timing with all of their results agreeing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo strongly recommended you get it and install it at least for the maneuver planner\u0027s match planes/Hohmann Transfer/Match Velocities maneuvers.

It doesn\u0027t really matter whether you start above or below the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should have the MechJeb button at the top of your screen, click on it, it will drop down and give you lots of choices. Click on Maneuver Planner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen go to the map view, select the vehicle with which you are trying to rendezvous and click on Set Target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the Maneuver Planner there is a drop-down of various maneuver types it can execute. Select Match Planes with Target, click on the Create Node button and then on the Execute Next Node button and it will perfectly execute the maneuver node which will make your orbital plane match the target\u0027s. Remember to click on the Auto-Warp radio button so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E will time warp to the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext select Bi-Impulsive Hohmann Transfer from the maneuver drop down. Again, click on Create Node and then Execute Next Node. Depending on your position relative to the target, this can mean several hours and several orbits before the correct phasing relationship is achieved. Very important to have auto-warp on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat maneuver will either be dropping the periapsis to match the target orbit, or raising the apopapsis, depending on whether you started above or below the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that maneuver is complete, select the Match Velocity maneuver type, and make sure At Closest Approach is selected. Again tell it to create and execute the next node. The end result should be your vehicle parked within a couple hundred meters of the target. You can take over with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, MechJeb features aren\u0027t all enabled at the start of the game, you have to progress through the tech tree.
