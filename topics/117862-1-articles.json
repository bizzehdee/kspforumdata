It was discovered after researchers identified a ring of nine gamma ray bursts (GRBs) that appeared to be at very similar distances from us, each around 7 billion light years away.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the possibilities here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first an most obvious is maybe these were at the center of expansion, the problem is that at 7 billion light years away they are two close, nor could they be at the edge of the universe since they would form a partially sphere covering a large part of the sky. Basically these cannot be true and the universe be 13 billion years old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conflict here is that based on our view of the universe, perfect euclidian flatness and uniform density of matter that the universe inflated for the tiniest fraction of a second before matter existed and expansion took place, as a consequence when the universe cool sufficiently space was expanding so rapidly outward that its momentum prevents matter from clumping nonuniformly. Of course now there are large structural webs in the universe some have described as the gravitation dance between matter and dark matter, but the scale of these structures is relatively small and extends betweens the modest galactic structures that we we see. Nothing so big as billions of light years across. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as I started this thread I get to throw in my conjecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese objects are closer to the original center of inflation but they are still relatively close to us. Since they were closer to the center their rate of inflation was marked slower, and because of this these objects are considerably older (they would have formed dense stars sooner, then 2nd and 3rd generations stars) and represent larger condensations of clusters, GRBs however represent the condensation of matter, and beyond them so much matter may have already condense that the GRBs are far less frequent and thus we don\u0027t see them. So I would predict that these represent an isoquant but because of expansion we can only see a part of it, the rest is traveling to fast away for us to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Ca href=\u0022http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/452/3/2236.abstract\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA giant ring-like structure at 0.78 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.86 displayed by GRBs\u003C/a\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, L.

Also I should point out that previous efforts to show spin in CMBR were later refuted indicating that the CMBR is largely uniform. But this is light from the opaque period, and these GRS are emmitting younger light which means they have formed macro structures shortly after the universe formed. So there is an ancient uniformity to the Universe even if it not uniform now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I should also point out that when I refer to Universe I am not handwaving arguments about infinite expanding space and all that blabber, see a scientist would admit there are other viable contending theories out there like multiverse and non-uniform osscilating universe. Since we are making assumptions about the universe based on the small percentage that we can see, even smaller if we factor in that this shell of visible light that reaches us is basically a time slice through that, we have to accept that the data may not be representative of the whole). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond I consider the data flawed to begin with, the argument that inflation has made the universe completely uniform has the cart before the horse. Inflation was added to explain the uniformity that is seen, particularly in the CMBR, but its not the otherway around, if there is macroscalar structures that were beyond the visible range there is a problem. To understand what happens to matter after CMBR you need complex modeling and one key ingredient, symmetry, is missing (for example what if anti-matter exists within domains of the universe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I posit to you, if these macro structures exist, why would they form in only one direction relative to ourselves, If the inflation was completely circumspect then we should see the pattern arranged around us and of no particular age. I think the one good obvious answer is that inflation was not perfect, and that material density from the centermost part was higher than that on the outside. One good explanation is that EM concentrated at the center and diffused at the boundaries lower or that there was better conversion to matter. It could be something even more insidious, like the conversion to take matter versus dark energy was better at the center. According to recent models with large galaxies merge star formation falls off, and you see red shifting and basically a stellar old folks home. This could explain the faintness of stars in these major clusters that render them hard to see, so now they are places to look in the near infra red spectrum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe papers conclusion, albeit tentative does not just say these come from just one part of the sky, but they are also about 7 billion light years from us, meaning that they originated from the same area and about the same time. Given that so many GRBS have occur, however this is not all possible arrangements of many, these are since intense observation began recently and so a 1/200 Bonnferroni correction need not be applied to alpha. If this particular pattern appearred for 2 years out of a 400 year study that would be a different story. In any case I think the four sigma used is 1/31540 so they still may have not reach criteria used for Higgs. Anyway it may represents new data that contradicts your hypothesis regarding the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFUN\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NFUN\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn many fields of science the standard of certainty is five sigma, a one of 3.5 million chance of the data being a fluke. You might be right.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingle publication alpha is 0.05, in many fields now (not 20 to 30 years ago) it needs to be corrected with bonnferoni\u0027s correction. 0.05/CF depending on classification. For example in the field of genome genetics the alpha may be 10\u003Csup\u003E-9\u003C/sup\u003E since they may use millions of markers at a time. And there has now run in the literature a critique of overcorrection, the correction may not take into consideration linked elements or such. Multiple studies have been done on marginal probabilities (0.05 to the corrected probability threshold) and found that a sizable number in the low end of the probabilities were later shown to have association with more data provided, and many more were not-independent of associated values. The problem in most statistics is that type II errors are neither known or investigated unless they are highly suspected to begin with, and in many cases the power is not defined for rooting out sources of type II errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can give a clean example of this, if your are collecting Energies of something from atom smashing and you collect energies in bins of say 0.1% along the 100% scale but by and large your assay for energy is say \u002B/-3% and particles themselves have extensive variation, then you might be overassaying. If you divide your particles into 1000 bins then your correction threshold is 0.05/1000 but the problem is that if the there should have optimally been 20 bins, you set the criteria too low, and it should have been 0.05/20 or 1/400. You probably wont make a type I error, but if you are looking for new phenomena, there is a good chance you will leave alot on the table with type II errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIOW alpha needs to be set depending on criteria of the type of investigation, a sigma of 5 might be fine in one set of research and overkill in another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T09:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe argument that inflation has made the universe completely uniform has the cart before the horse.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe argument is just the opposite.
