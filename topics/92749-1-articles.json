In other words, the backsides are linked, too; we simply can\u0027t see it in normal use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we can define what they do: they change spacetime. So what does this mean exactly\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF For the following ignore everything in round brackets unless you want the formal mathematical definition; and even for that I will now ignore the time component because this makes it really ugly, but will come back to it at the end:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we create portals, we actually choose two two-dimensional shapes of the same size and form (formaly: they are two 2-dim. smooth submanifolds which are closed subsets, come with a fixed smooth isometry and a fixed orientation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we glue the points on the boundary together, so for each pair of points that \u0022are the same\u0022 we now have a single point in spacetime. After that, we \u0022fill in the insides\u0022 which is essentially how you would imagine it: a point close to portal A is now very close to the corresponding point at the other side of portal B, while the points that were once close to portal A\u0027s other side are now far away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormaly, we change the topology as follows. Let f be the isometry from portal A to B. Let the orientation give us a notion of \u0022above\u0022 and \u0022below\u0022, at least close to the portal. And let \u0022eps-n\u0022 be a shortcut for epsilon-neighbourhood, i.e. balls of radius epsilon around a point. A basis of open sets, i.e. a system that tells us what is close and what is not, is now given as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For a point disjoint from the portals, just take all eps-n small enough to not intersect any portal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For a point x on the inside of portal A we let an eps-n of x be the union of {y| y in eps-n of x and on the positive side of A} and {z| z in eps-n of f(x) and on the negative side of B}. Note that this is only well-defined if epsilon is small enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Similiar for points f(x) on portal B, with positive and negative interchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Points on the boundary of portal A get identified with the point f(x) on B\u0027s boundary, and we let an eps-n of x=f(x) be the union of the original eps-n of x and the original eps-n of f(x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see, this is quite a mouthful.

Actually, we necessarily get them as soon as we allow moving portals relative to each other or consider sources of gravity. By time dilation, one of them will then age slower than the other and the only way to consistently fix this will be to allow them to not go to the same time period. So just stop thinking of portals purely as between the same place, but let them be between two points in spacetime instead. We should probably assume some resolution of all the time-traveling paradoxes that could come with this, e.g. by having a deterministic paradox-free universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Formaly, we would need to change the above construction to consider the portals\u0027 movement through spacetime and then would need to add some more cases on what happens with the topology at the moment the portal is formed or closed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr: Formalizing portals is lengthy, but gives you time-travel and therefore neat tricks: e.g. doing the infinite falling trick, but traveling backwards in time on portal-crossing; it ends when a portal \u0022vanishes\u0022, i.e. when we travelled back far enough to reach a point where the next portal to go through doesn\u0027t exist yet.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gpisic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gpisic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWarping spacetime they do.

For obvious reasons, this structure would likely be impossible to produce in this universe; it could simply not be generated, with any attempt yielding a \u0022standard\u0022 black hole (more on this topic later in this post). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Generally, the reason such an object would have an appearance like that of an \u0022unfurled\u0022 black hole is that neither light nor matter, once \u0022in\u0022 the portal, would be able to get out again. This is more easily understood with light, and thus I shall use it as an example: As light in our three-dimensional world is transverse, with a magnetic component perpendicular to an electric component both perpendicular to the direction of motion, such a wave attempting to pass through a two-dimensional boundary region should get \u0022stuck\u0022 and not be able to re-emerge, analogous to the behavior of a true event horizon. As matter also possesses wave-like characteristics, it, too, could get lodged in the two-ball as well. Likewise, this phenomenon would give rise to Hawking radiation emanating from the portal, and the description of this structure as a whole seems to demonstrate the holographic principle, wherein an object\u0027s surface (in this case the unfurled event horizon) should have characteristics indistinguishable from the actual object (in this case the black hole itself), which seems to emerge naturally from this hypothesis. As all of the above principles may be generalized to any number of dimensions, one can draw similar conclusions for these objects for any value of \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I now consider the case of a mapped set of \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-balls in \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-dimensional space. This is equivalent to \u0022rolling up\u0022 the object from the previous paragraph back into what we would think of as a \u0022normal\u0022 (if that can really be applied to such an extreme structure) black hole: An \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-ball with an \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-sphere event horizon that swallows light and matter alike (due to gravitational forces this time, but this is essentially equivalent to the catastrophic tear in space-time that the portal displayed), more specifically a Schwarzschild (or perhaps the other types as well, depending on their parameters) black hole (to use an example from our universe). Like the mapped balls here, Schwarzchild black holes are considered to have two \u0022ends,\u0022 but the other side can never be reached; this is likely a generalization of the non-traversability of mapped balls in any number of dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Finally, I come to true wormholes, as in their classic formulation as Einstein-Rosen bridges. These are, like in the paragraph immediately preceding this one, \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-balls in \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-dimensional space, but they are connected by an \u003Cem\u003En\u002B1\u003C/em\u003E dimensional \u0022tunnel\u0022 traversing each mouth.

These are, like in the paragraph immediately preceding this one, \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-balls in \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-dimensional space, but they are connected by an \u003Cem\u003En\u002B1\u003C/em\u003E dimensional \u0022tunnel\u0022 traversing each mouth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, they are n-dimensional tunnels in n-dimensional spacetime. The (probably ill-defined) boundary would be (n-1)-dimensional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry of the above sounds harsh.
