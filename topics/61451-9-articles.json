I could write at length about the fundamental problems here, like how some mods are distributed as RAR files, and some as zip files. Or how everyone seems to have a different way of hosting their mods (dropbox? mediafire? self-hosting? spaceport? something else entirely, potentially impossible to automate?) Or like how some mods archive their own subdirectory structure, while others bundle their GameData contents, and yet others start their distribution at the KSP root directory. Or how there is no way, currently, for mod authors to specify their dependencies in an easily-automatable way. Or how SpacePort doesn\u0027t let you download older versions of mods, which means the entire modding universe needs to upgrade in lock-step with every other mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said.

Trying to build a mod installer without that infrastructure means that the installer must do like my bundler did and encode all that logic in the manifest files. This results in a lot (A LOT) of work for whoever maintains the manifest files, because things change constantly, and with no prior notice. Breakage is the normal way of things, because it is impossible for one maintainer to constantly be testing every permutation of mod combinations as things get updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if someone really wants to take over maintenance of the bundler, please feel free to fork the GitHub project and go for it, with my blessing (and condolences \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).
