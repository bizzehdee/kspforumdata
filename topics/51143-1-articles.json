It essentially pulls no lateral g\u0027s from then on-- only forward acceleration from the engines. Gravity does the rest-- it slowly pulls the velocity vector down towards the surface, so you are pointed more and more towards the horizon as you climb and accelerate.

Instead, since every force that acts on the astronauts also acts on the ISS, the astronauts fall along the same path the ISS is taking. Since there\u0027s no difference in the path taken by the ISS and the astronaut, the ISS exerts no force on the astronaut to keep the astronaut confined within the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the force of the wheels of a car was brought up for why you felt the turn is because that force is applied to the car, not to the passenger, causing the paths to diverge, which means that some force has to pull the passenger back into a path matching that of the car. This force is what you\u0027re feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of a rocket launch, there are only two forces that will act on the rocket but not the astronaut. The rocket\u0027s thrust, and atmospheric resistance. Since both of these forces are parallel to the movement of the craft, the net force is parallel to the movement as well. Hence the only force the astronauts feel is being pushed towards the direction of acceleration, which is to say, forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity and intertia both affect both the rocket and the astronaut, any affect they have would have the same result on the rocket and the astronaut, meaning that their paths don\u0027t diverge, meaning that the astronaut won\u0027t feel anything from those forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if the rocket were turning because the rocket was thrusting in a direction other than the one that it were moving in, then yes, the astronauts would feel some side to side force because atmospheric drag and thrust aren\u0027t parallel, resulting in some force not directly in line with the rocket.
