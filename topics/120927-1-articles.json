J-33 Wheelsy, J-X4 Whiplash, and CR-7 RAPIER (in air-breathing mode only) are your available choices. Rockets and ion thrusters are not allowed. Vernor engines are not allowed. RCS is allowed, as long as it is not intentionally used to produce forward thrust, only to maintain directional control. \u003Cem\u003EUpdated- Both engines must be the same model.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Engines must be mounted laterally, or one on each side of the aircraft. In other words, not mounted with one above the other one. The asymmetric thrust must produce a yaw moment, not a pitch moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The horizontal distance between the engines is up to you. Mounting two engines right next to each other on a bi-coupler at the back of the plane is perfectly fine. Mounting them on pylons on the side of the fuselage or under wings is fine. Clipping so that the engines overlap is not allowed. \u003Cem\u003EUpdated- Engines must be mounted symmetrically, same lateral distance from centerline, and same fore/aft location.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. One engine must be shut down at liftoff, and may not be used again for the duration of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You must set \u003Cstrong\u003Efull (100%) throttle\u003C/strong\u003E during the takeoff, and the remaining engine MUST remain at \u003Cstrong\u003EFULL THROTTLE\u003C/strong\u003E until your reach an altitude of 1,000m. After reaching 1,000m you may use any throttle setting you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The aircraft must take off horizontally from the KSC runway.

However, you may use other methods to accomplish this as well, such as right-clicking the engine and shutting down from the info-pane. It is acceptable to close the intake with the same action group button, but not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen to fail the engine:\u003C/strong\u003E Engine should be failed after the nose begins to rise, but before reaching an altitude of 100m. Ideally the failure should occur before the main wheels leave the ground, but as long as you fail the engine before reaching 100m you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re good.

The use of information mods such as MechJeb or Engineer is allowed. The use of any mods which alter stock parts, or add non-stock parts, or alter stock physics, is not allowed. With that said, if you would like to post your attempt using non-stock parts, feel free to do so, with a note that your aircraft uses non-stock parts.

So, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect to see anyone reaching orbit or heading off to Moho in air-breathing mode. However, it is probably possible to reach orbit with a RAPIER switched to closed cycle. The failed RAPIER should remain failed throughout the flight of course. Switching a RAPIER to Closed-Cycle for any period of time makes you ineligible for the atmospheric records. If you choose this route, you need to leave the remaining RAPIER at full throttle, in air-breathing mode, until you reach 1,000m. After 1,000m you may throttle down and/or switch to closed-cycle as you wish. Not sure how to set up this leaderboard yet, I might just list entries and their accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EV1 Cut concept:\u003C/strong\u003E Commercial aircraft are designed to be able to continue to operate safely in the event of an engine failure during any phase of flight. The most challenging phase to lose an engine is during takeoff. The plane must be able continue the takeoff, and maintain sufficient climb to clear terrain or obstacles. During takeoff, the aircraft is going slow and close to the ground, so there is not much room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne challenge to losing an engine during takeoff is the significant yaw moment produced as a result of the asymmetric thrust. Commercial aircraft are designed so that it is possible to overcome the asymmetric thrust through the use of rudder and possibly banking slightly into the good engine. While reducing thrust on the good engine would reduce the asymmetric thrust, this is not an option for an aircraft which is trying to clear terrain. You already lost half your thrust when the other engine failed, now you need every ounce of thrust the good engine can produce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153V1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 is sometimes referred to as Takeoff Decision Speed. At speeds below V1, the aircraft is capable of aborting the takeoff and stopping on the runway in the event of an engine failure (or other problem). At speeds above V1, the aircraft is capable of continuing the takeoff safely even if an engine failure occurs. Generally, once an aircraft has reached V1 speed during the takeoff roll, the takeoff will be continued regardless of what components fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn engine failure right at V1 produces the biggest challenge during takeoff. This is the slowest speed an aircraft could be going and still continue the takeoff. The slow speed results in poor climb performance. Additionally, the slow speed means the rudder is not very effective at counteracting the adverse yaw from asymmetrical thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial pilots are trained on a recurring basis to address various abnormal conditions, including engine failures. As the most challenging time to have an engine fail is right at V1 during takeoff, engine failures at V1 are practiced regularly (usually in a simulator). These are referred to as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153V1 Cuts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T18:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RexKramer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T04:13:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, as soon as I saw this, I was laughing like a madman.
