To have vastly different numbers for each LS resource (and some being in the thousands while others are in the tens) was, for me at the time, confusing and just unnecessary. I followed updates on TACLS for a bit and it seemed like there was a need for separate waste containers as well as the initial supply containers which was again, to my eyes, unnecessary part count bloat. Add to that that a fully closed system with greenhouses etc plain didn\u0027t exist without modding the mod just made it feel incomplete. A greenhouse part had been in the works since December 2013 last time I looked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, attach part X to A to do N is essentially the core of KSP. But when I have to add part X to A to do N and end up no differently than if I\u0027d had just part A in the first place, I have to ask myself \u0027is it worth spending some of my part count budget on this?\u0027. I had kerbals on a space station that needed LS resupply and for a while, it was fun to have resupply missions or bring them back etc, but after a while, it just became tedious. I suppose that\u0027s not a fault of TACLS in itself - organisms need sustenance, after all - it was more a fault of KSP that I had to micromanage simple resupply missions while I was off landing on Laythe or whatever. I dunno, maybe with 1.0 and the various contract packs and other mods, TACLS would be fun again. But when I last played it, it was like \u0027oh no, Neilbert will on Minmus for days and will die! Oh wait, I\u0027ll just add a LS part and that can fulfill him for like 80 days - plenty long enough to ignore him at first, think about rescuing him second, then getting on with progress and not really needing him nor his science third\u0027. The challenge of keeping a kerbal alive while away from home, had been easily overcome with the addition of one part. Yes, I understand that I seem to be saying that TACLS is both simple and complex and I guess that I am - it\u0027s a simple method that is marred in complexity. It\u0027s too complex for what is a simple gameplay mechanic, you know? That gameplay mechanic is \u0027keep a kerbal supplied with LS\u0027 and TACLS says \u0027yep, he\u0027ll have 1000 O2, 10 food and 32 water and here\u0027s some waste containers so the fresh supplies don\u0027t get contaminated!\u0027 when it all really boils down to is \u0027yep, here\u0027s the LS\u0027. There\u0027s really not much more than that, which is why it\u0027s simple and easy. But, as I said, it digs itself in with frankly unnecessary complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, it\u0027s a great mod, don\u0027t get me wrong.
