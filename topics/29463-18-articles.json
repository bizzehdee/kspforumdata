At least at first. So I burned up 80% of the EVA propellant and was nowhere near the rescue ship, WHEN THE ROVER RANDOMLY EXPLODED. I wasn\u0027t watching when it happened, but I heard it go, and when I looked there was nothing but bits of debris and a few wheels. Goodbye Kerbal #2. I went to bed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the morning I figured out maneuver nodes and EVA controls, and it only took an hour or so to pick that guy up and ending his 5 day EVA adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no idea I would get so involved with not leaving a kerbalnaut stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dshuck","CreatedById":77023,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T05:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried to set up an Extraplanetary Launchpad on Laythe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9541787/Stuff/screenshot163.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot163.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.R.L.","CreatedById":66199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T06:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmmmmm........
