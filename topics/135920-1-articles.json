This design IMHO may tend to flip towards the forward-right or forward-left direction on every little nose wheel turn or side-slip while applying brakes, so I always try to stay around the Golden ratio: the distance from the nose wheel to any of the rear wheels should be approx. 2 times the distance between rear wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as I\u0027ve personally found, the landing gear are often not the root of the takeoff/landing issues. The most of my troubles were from center of lift stability issues: having CoL too far back from CoM causes your plane not to be able to hold the nose up while landing, forcing you to approach on higher speed and thus have wobble/jumps/flips on the runway. The same is true for takeoffs. Having your CoL in the correct position providing you the sufficient maneuverability allows you to takeoff/land without having too much excessive velocity on the ground that renders your aircraft uncontrollable on the run. So you should be able to slightly pitch up while descending on final thus your plane won\u0027t tend to jump back into space after touchdown. If your plane tends to pitch down while decelerating at low speed and you cannot hold the nose up then your CoL is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
