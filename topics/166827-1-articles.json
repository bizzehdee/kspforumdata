Corvan shouldered his instrument and led the rest of his pipers, all of them bedecked in formal Spierkan funeral garb, in a stiff-legged march to the sweetblossom pole.

Richlin followed them, dressed in a black poncho and carrying a pair of small spades crossed over his chest. At the front of the crowds, the officiant waited by a stele of dark grey stone. Two small kerm wood plaques were affixed to one corner with brass screws, each bearing a name written in finely inlaid gold script. For a moment, the officiant wondered who Enley Kerman was but then the casket bearers came to a halt in front of her. She cleared her throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals.

Slowly, she stood up, withdrew a carved wooden figurine from inside her robes and held it up to the crowd. \u201CLike us all, Ornie was a child of the Kerm. And though his body is not with us today, this poor marker shall stand in its stead. For it too is of the Kerm, and also of Ornie\u0027s Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb and Wernher put down their tools. The officiant stepped forward, knelt, and gently placed the figurine into the trench. The casket lid tipped open and a cascade of soil tumbled out over the grave marker.\u00A0 All three casket bearers stepped back and bowed. The rhythmic thudding of spade against earth punctuated the silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COrnie meant many things to each of us.

Blinking hard, he turned towards the sea of faces. \u0022Good afternoon,\u0022 he said haltingly, \u0022My name is Richlin Kerman and Ornie was my best friend.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnconsciously, Richlin straightened his poncho. \u0022Before I met Ornie, I was just a greasebucket on the circuit;\u00A0fixing up planes at the local aerodrome. I met him on the day before our airshow - he asked if I could help take a look at his plane engine which was making \u2018a mighty lot of noise but not goin\u2019 nowhere fast.\u2019 We managed to get it working in the end, in time for Ornie to compete the next day. The afternoon after the show, he offered to take me up myself, by way of a thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We went out for a drink that evening. We got to talking and by the end of the night I was going with him to the next show on the circuit. Ornie showed me the world, taught me to fly, became the best friend I ever had.\u00A0When I got to fly in space before him it just didn\u2019t seem \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E. Not that he ever seemed to mind. He helped me with all the training, drove me out to the launch pad that day, helped Bob strap me into the capsule. Gene told me afterwards that he was watching over me for the whole flight - didn\u2019t leave his console until I was safely home. I just wish I\u2026 wish I could have done the same for him.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin hid his face in his hands, small, choked noises coming from the microphone. Blindly, he unclipped it from his collar and thrust it towards the officiant. Jeb hurried over and put his arm round his shoulders, murmuring something too faint for the watching crowd to hear. As Jeb led Richlin away, Wernher stepped forward and solemnly accepted the microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good afternoon. My name is Wernher Kerman and Ornie was one of my dearest colleagues.\u0022 Wernher took a deep breath. \u0022One of my lasting memories of Ornie was his calm good humour under pressure. He\u2019d always laugh with you - but never, ever at you. I remember once losing a prototype engine on the test stand. This was back in the early days you understand, we didn\u2019t have many spare engines left to use and I was not in a good mood.\u00A0Ornie came out to see what was wrong, let me blow off some steam - and then took me out for lunch. \u0027I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do, Wernher,\u0027 he said, \u0027We\u0027re going to take a walk, we\u0027re going to grab a bite to eat and then we\u0027re going to come back, check the data and figure out what went wrong.\u0027 \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And we did. But it was something else that Ornie said that day has stayed with me ever since. \u0027Better that they blow up now,\u0027 he told me, \u0027than on the launch pad.\u0027 He lived by that philosophy and, to our deep and lasting sorrow, he died for it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So this is what we\u2019re going to do. Learn. Move on. Never give up. Find out what went wrong and make sure it never happens again. Ornie would expect nothing less. And to do anything less would dishonour the memory of a brave kerbonaut and one of the finest kerbals that I ever knew.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher bowed and passed the microphone to the waiting and shiny-eyed Jeb before walking over to stand by Richlin. The crowd silently watched Kerbin\u0027s first Munwalker fumble nervously with his collar before beginning to speak.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good afternoon. My name is Jebediah Kerman and Ornie was my mentor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin looked up in surprise as Jeb continued.\u00A0\u0022The very first time I met Ornie, I was trying to sell him some old engine parts. Bill, Bob and I were only just back on dry land after Kerbal 1. Ornie was one of the first to see Bill\u2019s photos once they were done and we literally wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without him and Richlin. And as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E bloomed beyond our wildest dreams, Ornie was always there for \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E, with a kind word or sound advice. Smoothing the way, getting the very best out of people - and teaching me everything I needed to know about that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe was the beating heart of the space program. He built the LVT-20 that put the first kerbals into space. He played a vital role in building the LVT-30 and LV909 engines that took us to the M\u00FCn and helped to test them both as the copilot and flight engineer for Eve 2. And that\u2019s how I\u2019d like everyone here today to remember him. Ornie Kerman: mentor, engineer, explorer, and above all else, a beloved and irreplaceable friend.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne person after another came forward to share their memories and stories. As the last of them returned to their places, the officiant coughed discreetly. \u0022Good kerbals, I thank you all for sharing your Ornie Kerman with us. Today we have honoured him in the traditional way, with music, stories, seeds and pole. Now, I beg you to join me in observing a new tradition for a new age of explorers.\u201D She clicked a switch on her microphone and a familiar, but restrained, litany washed over the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guidance?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Booster?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Spacecraft?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden choked sob. \u0022Spacecraft...spacecraft is Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T-minus two minutes.
