(I\u0027m an Apollo nut)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you think about staging, you can see that you can either break the stage off such that the \u0022lip\u0022 or shroud stays with the first stage such that the second stage engines are \u0022exposed.\u0022 The problem with that is if the first stage comes off at any small angle the \u0022lip\u0022 or shroud could impact one of the second stage engines. So it would be safer to break off the 1st stage so the shroud stays on the second stage. But the problem with that is for some reason that I don\u0027t know having the engine bells shrouded like that reduces efficiency. It also adds weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they decided to have it both ways. First they stage off and left the shroud on the second stage so they didn\u0027t have to worry about damaging the engines. Then after about 30 seconds the shroud (actually called interstage ring) stages off. Since it\u0027s only a small ring the chance of an impact with engine bell is much much lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey did put the ullage motors on it also for additional weight savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly on one mission (I think one of the unmanned) the interstage ring never sepearated and they still made orbit just fine, so like so many other things in Apollo it turned out to be overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA great awesome super book on all this is called \u0022How Apollo Flew to the Moon.\u0022 I give it my very highest recommendation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that famous video you can see the interstage ring look like it catches fire. This is because the second and third stage engines burned hydrogen and the flames were invisible. Although it doesn\u0027t look like it the second stage is thrusting in that video. The flaming appears when the interstage ring enters the flame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso do you know what sophisticated method they used to separate the stages? It was basically a line of plastic explosive. They stages were welded together then literally blown apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roastduck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roastduck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re thinking of Apollo 13, which I think is an accurate portrayal of many Mun missions in KSP \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the footage is from one of the early unmanned Saturn V launches.
