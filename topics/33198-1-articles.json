A single airlock allows egress (more on this later). Comms would be established via a small ruggedized plastic balloon that would carry a wire aloft beyond the worst of the atmosphere.

It would reach Venus 4 months later. The Venus lander and the Venus orbit return rocket would separate and enter Venus\u0027 atmosphere right away. After ditching the 30 ton heat shield, the Venus lander would land on the surface. After ditching its 30 ton heat shield, the Venus return rocket would inflate its balloon to stay at 50 km altitude. The rest of the 150 ton stack would use propulsion to break into low Venus orbit, using 45 tons of fuel, leaving 105 tons in Venus orbit (with 1 crew). The Venus lander crew (2 people) could probably only stay on the surface a relatively short time, since they would need a high power source to cool their surface habitat. So let\u0027s say they stay 20 days on the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get back up, they use the lander\u0027s flotation device to ascend to an altitude of 50 km and meet up with the return rocket. They transfer to the return capsule along with ~100 kg of Venus rocks. The 80-ton Venus orbital return rocket is a 2-staged liquid hydrogen/oxygen fueled rocket (Isp ~ 400s). The 5 ton minimal Venus return capsule would enter low Venus orbit and rendezvous with the orbiting habitat. The crew and the Venus sample then transfer to the deep space habitat and ditch the Venus return capsule. Then they would use 40 tons of fuel to get on an Earth return trajectory. The Earth transfer would take about 10 months (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://trajbrowser.arc.nasa.gov/traj_browser.php?NEAs=on\u0026amp;NECs=on\u0026amp;chk_maxMag=on\u0026amp;maxMag=25\u0026amp;chk_maxOCC=on\u0026amp;maxOCC=4\u0026amp;chk_target_list=on\u0026amp;target_list=Venus\u0026amp;mission_class=roundtrip\u0026amp;mission_type=rendezvous\u0026amp;LD1=2010\u0026amp;LD2=2040\u0026amp;maxDT=1.3\u0026amp;DTunit=yrs\u0026amp;maxDV=7.0\u0026amp;min=DT\u0026amp;wdw_width=-1\u0026amp;submit=Search#a_load_results\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eusing one of these trajectories\u003C/a\u003E). A couple of days before arriving at Earth, they would get in the 10 ton Earth Return Vehicle and separate from the rest of the spacecraft.
