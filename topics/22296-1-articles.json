The Z-Pinch design allows massive amounts of current to be run through the plasma creating a strong magnetic field that confines the plasma and compresses it into the conditions necessary for deuterium-tritium fusion to occur, this would be the \u0022pinch\u0022. The engine is a combination of magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion. Inertial confinement fusion doesn\u0027t require a doughnut shaped container, but most terrestrial magnetic confinement fusion reactors are doughnut shaped, though it\u0027s not necessary for fusion to occur.
