When\u0027s the last time anybody put a 10\u002B ton payload into LEO?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery often with dual-satellite launches. See ariane 5 for example : it pretty much never launches single satellites, but regularly some medium sized satellites, 2 in 1 launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes you do see really huge satellites like terrestar1 or so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that only few payloads are 10\u002B tons is precisely due to the limitations of the launchers... If (should i say \u0022when\u0022 ? ) launchers big enough to launch 40t payloads in orbit were(will be?) common, you would(will?) see loads of those around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
