Maybe I have missed a mod or so, but I think apart from SSTU, which is quite WIP still and the Talisar upper stage, which is part of CMES, there is no independent (and recent) heavy upper stage model out there, isn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards and thanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSebastian\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarStreak2109","CreatedById":118557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T12:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have taken the upper stage from Talisar from Chaka Monkey Exploration systems and rescaled it to the 3.75 m form factor. I further mated it to the AK10 engines from Aerojet Kerbodyne and attempted a slight rebalance to have it fit to the Aerojet Kerbodyne ICPS upper stage.
