I\u0027m having a bit of trouble EVAing my Kerbals. When I EVA in space, my Kerbal just floats of far away and I have to use a load of EVA fuel to get back. But I\u0027ve been watching videos and some people go at speeds at 2000m/s and their Kerbals just stick to the door of the ship.

It\u0027s a known issue- actually two separate issues, which have popped up in recent versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is that Kerbals are sometimes ejected from certain command pods, they normally should stick to the command pod when you EVA them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is that Kerbals sometimes slide off ladders and pods, even though you are not commanding them to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome consider those two issues to be a single issue. Regardless, the issue is known, and likely to be fixed in a future release. Meanwhile, the link posted above by ExavierMacbeth should help you out. Otherwise- you get to practice your EVA skills!

This is a bug that I experienced the other day. My kerbal was on EVA and every time I had him grab the ladder to get back inside the capsule, he went flying backwards and away from the ship. He was 3/4 through his fuel by the time I was able to finally get him back inside. It was about 15 minutes of pure frustration. Give the fix mentioned above, and also attaching more ladders can help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T21:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone, my problem is solved! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
