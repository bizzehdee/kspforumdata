With the Apollo docking gear, it\u0027s the same--attempting to automatically dock the probe-equipped vehicle to the drogue (cone)-equipped one will end with an attempt to dock at 90 degrees to the docking axis; however, having the drogue-equipped vehicle automatically dock with the probe-equipped one will work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a bug report (it\u0027s long been known that the funky collision models needed screw up MechJeb when it comes to auto-docking), just informing people. There\u0027s also another workaround using MechJeb, so long as both spacecraft can be controlled at the time (meaning that you need a probe core in the unmanned craft). First, switch to the drogue-equipped vehicle, control from the drogue, set the docking probe as your target, and activate Smart A.S.S. in the \u0022\u002BTGT\u0022 mode, so it aims the docking port directly at the other one. Switch back to your probe-equipped vehicle, control from the probe, target the drogue, activate \u002BTGT, roll to whatever roll attitude you want relative to the target, and then manually close in and dock with the RCS; this makes the alignment automatic and only requires the manual approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
