I tried a lot of complete new installations. I installed RO (via CKAN) with the recommend mods. I installed it without the recommend mods, pure as possible.

Mods with dependencies seem to be the cause most of the time. Also if you read the instructions CKAN is listed as an option, not that it has to be used.
