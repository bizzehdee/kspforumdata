What I came up with is that Kerbin is experiencing an oil shortage and fuel would be limited.\n\nAt the start of the game you would have a limited amount of stored fuel including LFO, Mono, xenon, and solid fuel. This could be modifiable depending on the level of difficulty you want. All ore would need to be removed from the KSC and surrounding area but could be found in areas of Kerbin. Fuel and ore recovered gets added to the reserve. Stored ore can be converted to any type as KSC would have a built in ISRU.\n\nOptionally I am wondering if there should be a weekly or monthly allowance of fuel granted from some organization that would be based on your achievements and would degrade over time if you didnt do any missions to prevent time warping infinite fuel. Missions would have diminishing affects as well so you couldnt just keep doing mun missions and keep getting fuel grants.\n\nThis would give purpose to establishing mining and refueling stations around kerbin and other bodies to reduce the amount of fuel used launching new rockets.\n\nTL;DR - Limited fuel to start the game. Puts importance on mining and refueling stations around the solar system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T06:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roguelycan**"},{"CreatedByName":"WintericeUK","CreatedById":115721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:37:49Z","Content":"This would be an awesome feature!"},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:36:13Z","Content":"This could probably use some of the tankage seen around the KSC. Imagine having to buy more fuel if you\u0027ve run out of your current supply. Maybe Fuel supplies should be dependent on your reputation? There needs to be more things affected by that. Combine that with some sort of reputation decay (I think there\u0027s a mod for that) And boom. No timewarp fuel exploit. Maybe contracts should also be modified to grant fuel allotments when accepted with heavier reputation burns if canceled to make it painful to exploit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:53:08Z","Content":"I\u0027m surprised this wasn\u0027t added into stock already.

One thing is I don\u0027t want this to be just another mod for career mode, the contracts and economy are fine but I am looking for something outside of the money based career mode. I want fuel to be the only real limiting factor in this mode. I dont want to deal with tourist and satelite contracts but I do like the idea of maybe an occasional special mission that comes up that would reward the player with a gift of fuel. \n\nNot that this idea wouldnt work in career or science mode, but I am more interested in something closer to the sandbox mode but with a vague objective."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:31:38Z","Content":"Excellent idea."},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:43:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One thing is I don\u0027t want this to be just another mod for career mode\u0022\n\nI didn\u0027t realize that, but I imagine that using a slightly higher fuel allotment for other modes without disabling the mod for said modes would make it all inclusive.
