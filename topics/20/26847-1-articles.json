It\u0027s all tools, you use to achieve what you want. I\u0027m an engineer, not a pilot. I like the challenge of \u0022Get to jool, with a ship that has a lander, and orbital probe for every moon, and 1 manned lander for laythe, with the capacity for the mothership to return home.\u0022 I like the challenge of building the launch vehicles, but the flying is tedious for me, and I am prone to making mistakes that MechJeb wont. \u003Cp\u003EI do find it odd that this bothers you so much though.

I almost always use it for docking (my first manual docking was a terrible, terrible ordeal), and sometimes use it for landing and orbital maneuvers. My guideline has always been \u0022what would be more fun?\u0022 KSP is a game; I\u0027m not about to sit in front of a computer tapping WASD for four hours because I designed a cool-looking ship that handles like crap and I can\u0027t get it in the right position to dock, but it\u0027s not really any more entertaining just clicking \u0022autopilot enable\u0022 and sitting down with a cup of coffee to watch the game do everything for you. Tedious or annoyingly difficult stuff, I\u0027m more than happy to use MechJeb for, as long as I\u0027ve shown that I can do it first, but it just feels boring to sit back and let the game play itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatisthisidonteven","CreatedById":41660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T21:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure you can tell it to go to Eeloo and it will go to Eeloo without any user interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-14T21:34:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2013 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by whatisthisidonteven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
