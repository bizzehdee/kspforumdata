A quick search indicated that Texture Replacer is the way to go. I have now gotten and installed the mod in the same way I\u0027ve installed the couple other mods I\u0027ve picked up in the past. That much appears to have succeeded, as I now have the appropriate new icon on the UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have no idea what to do next. Clicking the icon pops up a window with my various crewmembers\u0027 names and \u0027generic\u0027 options for the various specialties, with what I assume are the default \u0027textures\u0027 for male/female orange/grey-suit faces, EVA, IVA suits as appropriate. But nothing appears to be selectable. After attempting to follow the Green Skull instructions (which are a year and a half old, and reference a many-versions-obsolete release of TR), I mostly learned two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Apparently I have to do some sort of manual manipulation of some kind of config file(s) in order to get new textures ... installed? activated? (...or something)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Being a professional aerospace engineer in real life does not allow me to evade the fact that KSP\u0027s learning \u0022curve\u0022 is more like a learning \u0022wall\u0022. I just get slammed up against it over different things than most of the rest of the user base. (Okay, so in fact I already knew this. But this is yet another example.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. Is there some sort of REALLY BASIC REMEDIAL set of instructions out there to get me started? I am aware of the Green Skull instructions which are advertised as the \u0022simpler\u0022 (!!) instructions. But everything in the Green Skull instructions after the \u0022put the Texture Replacer folder into GameData\u0022 may as well have been written in Swahili. I need something for people who are confused and intimidated even by THOSE. Something for the sort of person who throws scare quotes around the word \u0027texture\u0027 because I know full well that I\u0027m just blindly repeating a nonsense-word that seems to be linked to the thing I want, but have no idea what I\u0027m actually saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no plans to CREATE textures. I don\u0027t need to know how they work. What I want is a set of step-by-step instructions that will let me (for instance) give my Engineers the stereotyped Red Shirt, where by \u0022step-by-step\u0022 I mean \u0022so simple and clear and COMPLETE that they could be used unmodified by a trained monkey or NASA astronaut\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anything like that exist? Or am I doomed to spending several weeks of time (which I could otherwise spend PLAYING the game) on giving myself a remedial education on texture maps and config files? (Or, more likely, throwing my hands up in frustration while continuing to be impotently jealous of people with screenshots featuring actual individualized Kerbals...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torgo","CreatedById":149873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you downloaded a uniform texture pack and installed it?
