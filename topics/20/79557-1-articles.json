This doesn\u0027t need to be a whole new resource. Just let it be a sum of all the EC/s being generated by active gens/alternators. When a device needs EC, it can look at the buffer and subtract EC/s depending on it\u0027s consumption. If it doesn\u0027t have enough power, or there is no active gens (and therefore no EC/s in the buffer), then look to EC storage. If neither has sufficient EC, then it doesn\u0027t run (Or turns on/off rapidly, runs slower, as some things do now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all in all...

ElectricCharge is a \u0022fluid\u0022 resource -- it can be sloshed around between components, and routed in the same was as fuel or any other resource. It\u0027s a lot simpler to treat ElectricCharge in a way similar to all other resources than it would be to make two different systems in the code. This is the same reason Kethane refineries actually \u0022draw\u0022 negative-amounts of Kethane, which makes for some counterintuitive piping schematics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone explained previously in this thread, ModuleAlternator has to have a \u0022repository\u0022 that will \u0022accept\u0022 the ElectricCharge within the same part.cfg BEFORE it can be routed elsewhere (such as to a battery) as any other resource / fuel overflow would. The opposite also happens -- whenever an engine (or a light) draws a resource, the default fuel routing calls for the resource to be pulled from the most-distant part first (as defined by the .craft file\u0027s listing of the daisy chain of parts). This means that resources are drawn across crossfeed-enabled docking nodes, but not across dead-end nodes such as non-crossfeed panels and / or decouplers (even though resources can be manually pumped between them by rightclicks.) Resource GENERATION works the exact same way but in reverse -- it first goes to the NEAREST part, then so on as they fill. If the engine partfile has a ModuleAlternator, the ElectricCharge will be generated, but without a {RESOURCE} parameter, there\u0027s a dead end and the logic will \u0022burn\u0022 (discard unused) that quantity of ElectricCharge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DesTroy","CreatedById":116547,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T02:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EElectricCharge, like Monopropellant and XenonGas is available everywhere on a vessel.
