There must be a solution! That solution has to be a plugin. Ideally it would affect all thrust vectored parts, but having it only work with high-gimbal parts would be fine as well. You would have a tweakable to adjust the default pitch gimbal angle, and this can be tweaked in flight. Further, controlling the gimbal takes time, it doesn\u0027t instantly change. It might take a second to change the gimbal from 0 to 30. And only the pitch gimbal would have this freedom, the yaw and roll would only deviate by 3 degrees. I guess I don\u0027t really have to go into this much detail, I\u0027m sure you modders are smart enough to make a great plugin to handle this that is simple to use and easy to control. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and while we\u0027re at it, a stockalike vernier thruster!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERV-Wernier Gimbal Motor\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EManufacturer: STEADLER Engineering Corps\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription: While using a glorified Linear RCS port seems fine and dandy for most, it was soon decided that a proper yaw-and-roll controlling engine must be invented to take care of those situations where the sideways thrust of a Vernor engine just didn\u0027t cut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1502\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.09 (Negligible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImpact Tolerance: 15 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch Node: Advanced Flight Control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlock Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum Thrust: 20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp: 320 seconds (Vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 295 seconds (At Sea Level)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust Vectoring: 30 degrees (Yaw and Roll)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(it would be able to pitch as well, but only by yawing on a surface 90 degrees from yaw.
