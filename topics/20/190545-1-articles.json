This sort of addon is very popular in the MMO community for stat comparisons between items/equipment, so I thought maybe it\u0027d be easier to find than it seems to be! Does anyone know of any such mod I might\u0027ve missed (or even a stock option, if I\u0027ve missed it?)?\u00A0I envision something like when you right-click on a part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it stays on-screen even when you move the mouse away, it would go a step further and stay on-screen even when you mouseover other parts (I don\u0027t really care for the specifics of how it functions if it just makes it easier to view stats side-by-side than my current snipping tool method \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-22T01:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know - none such beast exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
