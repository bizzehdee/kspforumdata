Recently I installed BD Armory and then PEW(Promethium Experimental Weaponry). The problem is, after install PEW, some missiles(maybe all of them, not sure), are also in the utility section, in addition to being in the BDA weapons section. How can I remove them from there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T14:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi the problem you are referring to affects every player regardless of install\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBY default a lot of weapons are still registered with the Utility section, this is because in older versions of BDA that\u0027s where all the weapons went.
