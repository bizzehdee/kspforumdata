In terms of mass, mind you, not in terms of volume units. But while the volume units are completely arbitrary in KSP (they\u0027re not even liters or anything comparable, they\u0027re just made up randomly), mass does matter, because that part goes into the rocket equation. Ultimately, you changed your ion engine to draw a different amount of mass from tanks that contain a different amount of mass. If you tested it, you\u0027d find that the thruster will run the exact same time on one tank\u0027s worth of fuel in both cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo change your xenon usage, you need to change the engine\u0027s Isp or thrust, or both. Xenon mass flow rate is a direct result of the amount of thrust that is produced, and the the efficiency at which said thrust is produced (Isp) - it\u0027s a fixed physical relationship, which is why you cannot edit it. If you want to keep the thrust fixed but want more (or less) xenon to be used, then Isp must go down (or up). Similarly, if you want to keep Isp static but change the mass flow rate, then thrust must go up or down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were you, I\u0027d restore your stock numbers and then go into the ModuleManager thread, where you can ask how to achieve your goal using this neat little tool that lets you modify all paramters without touching any stock files at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-15T07:14:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2014 07:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas1126","CreatedById":99760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T08:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI changed the Xenon weight, the amount in the tank as well as the electrical usage and the Ion engine\u0027s thrust about an hour after this post.
