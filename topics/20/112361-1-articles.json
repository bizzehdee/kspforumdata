A version with movable guiding fins.\n\nBobCat has made one for his MIR / ISS mod. It was very good modeled, but it had the problem, that the docking alignment was 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 sideways. That meant, it was impossible to use any kind of docking help like the docking port alignment indicator by NavyFish.\n\nRaidernick had made one too in his 1.4 version of his wonderful Salyut Stations \u0026 Soyuz mod. It looks very nice, but he published it May 27th and locked the thread June 6th. I missed the possibility to get a copy. That is very sad.\n\nOther versions with movable guiding fins I don\u0027t know. So I would like to ask for help. Is any modder would be able to make one working APAS-75 docking module, I would be very greatful.\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\n\n- Isabelle"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T13:37:24Z","Content":"If you look at the KOSMOS mod, there is an APAS-75 (it\u0027s called the APAS-69, but that\u0027s just a rename) with movable guiding fins.

And I\u0027ve noticed that I\u0027ve made a mistake. It was not BobCats APAS, which I described in my first post but exactly this APAS-69 of Kosmos. It is precisely this APAS, which has the 90-degree error.\n\nThis means, unfortunately, that is not so helpful. Therefore my request is still pending.
