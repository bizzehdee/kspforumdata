Now you might ask; \u0022How would you get the money when there are no contracts?\u0022. Well i have been thinking about it and this is my solution:\n\n- You would have to set some goals for yourself before launching like:\n\n\\* Orbit Altitiude (with margins)\n\n\\* Landing Site\n\n\\* Docking with a certain spacecraft\n\n\\* Going into a certain SOI\n\n\\* The list can go on and on\n\n- The amount of funds you get are defined by how hard it is to reach the goals you set and if you reach your goals, there should obviously be made a chart that says what goal is worth how much money.\n\n- I see this mod working in both the science mode and the sandbox mode.\n\nWhat do you think, and let me know if such mod already exists?"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T22:56:36Z","Content":"Hello, there\u0027s a mod which does something like this: [Science Funding](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102911)"},{"CreatedByName":"EVDE","CreatedById":107276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:05:59Z","Content":"Awesome!!! thanks, by the way; i am a belgian 14 year old kid, i don\u0027t mind bad english! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
