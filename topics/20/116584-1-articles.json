I tried installing it different ways, but it never appeared so I gave up on it. Perhaps I\u0027ll give it another attempt.\n\n////Installed it again and managed to get it to show up. For some reason when I try to put it on a ship it wants to attach upside down, which isn\u0027t a big deal just weird. When I turn it on though, after setting for the appropriate planet, I get a green light but I\u0027m still stuck on the ground like a rock. Even with vertical thrust I just fall right back to the planet ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T16:39:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kalzuron**\n  \nUpdate"}]}
