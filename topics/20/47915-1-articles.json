I\u0027ve never seen fuel automatically being carried through docking ports, so there\u0027s that. Then there\u0027s the complex design with engines up top; there is a good chance that MJ simply is not able to guess your intentions, especially since the staging tree (again, those docking ports!) doesn\u0027t give it any clues where you want to utilize that fuel.

I\u0027ve successfully made a backwards rocket before, and the fuel flowed up the body just fine, but I didn\u0027t check the dV with mechjeb while in the lab with those ones. I guess mechjeb must work out where fuel goes it\u0027s own way, I always just assumed it got that info from the game engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t add fuel lines past the docking ports because this is actually going to to be broken into sections to launch it. I guess I\u0027ll just have to work it out the proper way, I was just wondering if mechjeb knew something i didn\u0027t and one of those parts would really block the fuel flow.
