I\u0027ve got a few parts in mind to make proper amphibious vehicles a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Hovercraft Balloon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple canvas balloon with a built-in propeller designed for ground-effect hovering. It would consume electricity at a relatively high rate. Integrated propellers could gimbal, allowing decent movement without the need for other engines. Unlike wheels, the hovercraft balloons would allow a vehicle to drift side to side (similar to RCS thrusters), giving it excellent maneuverability over both land and sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Electric Propeller\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested many times, and would have many useful applications, especially for hovercrafts and airships. While the hovercraft balloons could gimbal, propellers would provide some extra speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Turbine Generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA device that uses movement through atmosphere to generate electricity. Its energy production would vary depending on the vehicle\u0027s speed. The faster the vehicle moves, the more electricity the turbine produces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Emergency Inflatable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your hovercraft balloons run out of power or you have a bit of a wreck at sea, you can deploy these devices to make sure you remain floating upright until you can recharge or until help arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHovercrafts, along with airships, would make missions to planets with extensive oceans much easier and much more interesting. What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T05:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey could just fix the water.

Unfortunately the processing power to do a proper sim would probably bring the game to a halt.

However, now that my fuel cells are released I\u0027m going to get back to working on my hovercraft stuff, though not quite as you described. I tried the realistic \u0022skirt\u0022 style hovercraft, but I honestly don\u0027t feel like that style belongs in a game that is renown for the uniqueness of user creations. So, I\u0027ll be doing things a little differently but I hope they\u0027ll be more fun and flexible to use as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin itself is actually mostly done, just the complicated stabilization is left (and this is non-trivial to do correctly). The models themselves I haven\u0027t started yet, but hopefully they won\u0027t take too long now that I\u0027m getting familiar with blender.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T19:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second wasml\u0027s suggestion of the Kerbal Foundries anti-grav repulsors.
