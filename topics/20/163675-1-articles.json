Which is: mistaking the amount of fuel or the tank size as being the significant factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation does not care how large your tanks are, or how many unnamed units of a resource are stored within them. The rocket equation cares about one thing only: your mass fraction. That is the mass of the stage with fuel divided by the mass of the stage without fuel. In other words, the only thing that mattters is how much \u003Cem\u003Epropellant mass\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027re packing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, hydrogen naturally has a very low density. That means that any given mass of it will fill out a much larger volume than other materials. Or, in reverse: any given tank can store less hydrogen than other fuels. While KSP itself doesn\u0027t simulate volume at all, mods sometimes do; and even those who don\u0027t will usually fudge things by simply putting less of a resource into a tank to give the appearance as if there was volume and density involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich leads to the following situation: a player puts up a capsule, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank and an engine in the editor. He notes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E provided. He then switches the tank to LH2/O2, and replaces the engine with a hydrogen-burning engine that has like 30% more Isp. He notes that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is now a lot less.

For example, a hydrogen tank could have less dry mass than a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank of the same physical dimensions because it needs to be less sturdy because it needs to contain less propellant mass. All in all, you have a tradeoff where the higher engine Isp stands against the worse mass fraction of the tanks. Which side wins, and by how much, is usually decided by the mod author who stats up the parts. Sometimes mod authors choose numbers you may disagree with. (As I mentioned, I have no experience with KSPI, so I can\u0027t speak about its balance choices.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, keep in mind that it is entirely expected that one specific fuel is particularly good in onespecific use case.

If you examine only one use case, you may come to the false conclusion that the fuel which is best in this use case is always best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, hydrogen has hidden advantages when used in upper stages. If you can build two different stages with the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, it might not matter to you which one you pick for a first stage; but if one of the two has less total mass, then it makes a better upper stage because you can then downsize and save money and bulk on your first stage (or on all stages below, in case there\u0027s more than one). Or, make the upper stage have the same total mass but increased capabilities.\u00A0This compounds with the fact that hydrogen engine\u0027s lighter exhaust, which gives them their superior Isp, also doesn\u0027t work as well in an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe famous Saturn V moon rocket had a RP-1/O2 first stage,\u00A0LH2/O2 second and third stages, and hypergolic service modules and landers.\u00A0It chose to employ three different fuels on the same rocket instead of standardizing on one, because each fuel was the best choice for its particular application then.
