There are 20 nodes at 1k each and more beyond that! You must be taking a tonne of science points from each planet! It might be as easy as tweaking the numbers in the CTT config? I would start there. Or turn down the science gain from contracts etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Look at\u00A0CommunityTechTree.cfg in the CommunityTechTree/Tree folder. Each node has a \u0022cost = xxx\u0022 line. You can do a simple find and replace for all those nodes and increase the cost. For example find and replace \u0022cost = 500\u0022 with \u0022cost = 2000\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-17T13:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2019 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by madindehead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T08:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022165182\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6261334037\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172400-140-171-kerbalism-v302/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-23T07:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also hit alt-F12 after every mission, click on the cheats menu item, and subtract whatever science you don\u0027t want. That\u0027s more flexible than a hard setting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind there isn\u0027t even a score you are keeping, much less are you competing against anyone. So if you want the challenge of a fixed barrier you must contend with, set science or money returns or both to whatever level you want. Or you can just set mission goals for yourself, and give yourself whatever money and/or science you need to complete that mission in the way you want, there are no Gods of Kerbal who will come down and smite you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example the game I\u0027m playing now, I\u0027ve decided that money will be no object. Designing the biggest baddest thing you can build for every flight has a challenge all its own, for example you\u0027re certain to set new highs for heaviest launches- I just did one recently that was 40,000t at takeoff. The point being that even when you remove limits on money or science, the challenge doesn\u0027t go away, it just changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
