E.g., you can take the doors off, either singly or in pairs to \u0022stack\u0022 cargo bays horizontally, like a double-wide HL-size bay or something like that. There have been a couple of situations I can think of where, stylistically, it would look way better to cobble together a couple of cargo bays, but then the doors collide, and we can\u0027t have that. Any ideas, direction, discussion (even if it\u0027s \u0022it can\u0027t be done), are awesome.
