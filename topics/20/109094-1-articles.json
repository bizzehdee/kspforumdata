But as the Mk2 Drone Core has modelled torque wheels and stuff, I\u0027d like to have an \u0022empty\u0022 one (maybe even with some arrows on the sides) to work as decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T21:33:02Z","Content":"[A bit of googling and....](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99661-Mk2-Essentials-New-Mk2-Jet-Engine)"},{"CreatedByName":"cy-one","CreatedById":74874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:08:22Z","Content":"Goddamnit, how did I miss that?
