This leads to lots of questions and not sure where to post questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Aircraft Autopilot under PID, what are those settings? What is \u0022Kp\u0022, what is \u0022i\u0022 and \u0022d\u0022. How does the \u0022VertSpeed\u0022 fields under PID effect \u0022Vertical Speed Hold\u0022 if it effects that at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have one aircraft where vertical speed hold fails completely and results in dratic and fata pitching ocillation. No idea why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are settings on the Assent Guidence window that have no informations.

I think... since I bought the game a few years ago.\u00A0 Reading through the Mechjeb release or development threads are a good start... though of course they\u0027re miles long by this point, so sometimes you just have to post your questions there even if they might have been hashed out 20 pages earlier already.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve been out of the game a while - so this may be inaccurate - but atmospheric flight has not been a priority for the Mechjeb dev team most of the time...\u00A0 so I always expect the air plane bits to fail some.\u00A0 \u00A0That said, when I reloaded the game the other day, I tried the autoland and it DID work for me on my unscientific single point of data test.\u00A0 \u00A0The aircraft autopilot sure didn\u0027t used to do anything...\u00A0 if it does something now, that\u0027s an improvement.\u00A0 The Mechjeb thread is where I\u0027d ask about what does work and for some tips on getting started with it.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour other specific questions...\u00A0 Mechjeb... and a lot of \u0027machine controlling values based on measurements\u0027 systems uses a \u0022PID\u0022 controller - where those stand for proportional, integral and derivative.\u00A0 \u00A0To super simplify - let\u0027s pretend we\u0027re talking about throttle for a mun lander.\u00A0 \u00A0We\u0027d measure\u00A0 descent speed and control the throttle to get it where we want it right?\u00A0 \u00A0 A PID controller makes three pretty good assumptions about the behavior.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 The more wrong the speed is, the harder we should correct\u00A0the throttle.\u00A0 \u00A0That\u0027s the P\u00A0 = proportional.\u00A0 \u00A0When you set kP you\u0027re telling Mechjeb how hard you want it to adjust for instantaneous errors.\u00A0 The higher the value the more Mechjeb tries to correct for these instantaneous wrong values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 \u00A0The LONGER we\u0027ve BEEN WRONG... the harder we should correct the throttle.\u00A0 \u00A0That\u0027s what the I term does.\u00A0 \u00A0setting kI is telling Mechjeb how much weight you want to give to this function.\u00A0 \u00A0The higher the value, the harder it will try to correct for errors that have existed a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 If we\u0027re getting closer to correct, ease back on the correction.\u00A0 \u00A0That\u0027s the D or derivative term.\u00A0 This keeps us from overshooting because it softens the correction if the values are already getting closer to right.\u00A0 \u00A0So when the P and I start to get results, the D term weakens the correction so that hopefully everything evens out around zero instead of oscillating wildly.\u00A0 \u00A0So the higher you set the D term, the stronger this resistance to over correction is.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are whole BOOKS on how to tune a PID system, but what I just explained is enough to start playing with it!\u00A0 \u00A0If it takes to long to start correcting, increase the P.\u00A0 \u00A0If it gets CLOSE... but never gets right on the money...\u00A0 increase the I...\u00A0 if it over corrects...\u00A0 increase the D.\u00A0 \u00A0If it is behaving really weird...\u00A0 turn them all down and start back at the P.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ is short hand for \u0027dynamic pressure.\u0027\u00A0 \u00A0Think of it as the force of the atmosphere trying to slow or break your rocket.\u00A0 \u00A0The faster you\u0027re going and the lower you are in the atmosphere, the higher Q is.\u00A0 \u00A0If your Q is too high, you\u0027re wasting delta-v fighting your way through the soupy lower atmosphere.\u00A0 \u00A0So you limit Q during ascent so that Mechjeb will throttle back at a certain speed and keep throttle low until you\u0027re high enough that the air resistance losses are acceptable.\u00A0 When you watch real rocket launches you\u0027ll hear them call out Max-Q as they pass that point... and then shortly after they\u0027ll call a \u0022Throttle Up\u0022 Where they ramp back to maximum power.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Force roll bits have two numbers - one for the vertical ascent and one for the pitchover of the gravity turn... and they do what they sound like they should do - set the roll angle of the rocket.\u00A0 \u00A0This is handy for situations like the space shuttle where it needed to roll a certain way for gravity to counteract the off center thrust....\u00A0 but in game...\u00A0 it\u0027s more useful for things like making sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are perpendicular to the ground before you separate them...\u00A0 which decreases the chance of one falling back into your main engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
