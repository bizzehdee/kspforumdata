I know switching over to a new version can be tedious work, especially if you have more mods than you do fingers to keep up with. I know plenty of other people feel the same way, but are too busy using your mods in game to say thanks, so I will say thanks for them. Thank you Modders! You make our KSP experience something we can build from our childhood imaginations come true. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T03:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.
