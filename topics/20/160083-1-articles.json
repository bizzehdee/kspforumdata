In other words, if your satellite is in low orbit, and as a player you already have relay satellites in line of sight anywhere, you\u0027ll already have signal, not just when it\u0027s over a PARTICULAR ground station. And it would be rather weird to have it not work like that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps you could have a mod that introduces a concept of civilian contractors in general, who have their own private radio frequencies, to justify why it isn\u0027t normally connected.

Not as explicit as stated, but close enough given KSP\u0027s capabilities and the current availability of plug-in\u00A0mods. RT (mainly, its computer) would replicate the instruction transmission. SCANsat, as noted, would replicate the ground surveying. Something like CactEye could handle snapshot imagery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I think even getting the assets into KSP might be a job. You\u0027d need to import the original files (I\u0027m guessing CAD rather than actual 3D models, though I\u0027m sure converters exist) and\u00A0probably add colliders at a minimum.
