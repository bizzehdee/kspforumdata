So I would like a mod that replaces all the sliders in the editor with input fields so that I can just type in what I want. I have done some searching for this for the past 3 days, and have had no luck, so I figured it would be best to ask here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
