If you have no idea how a plane flies, use GOOGLE it will tell you. If you suck at reading, look it up on Youtube. I don\u0027t understand how is it that difficult to look up something or ask a question instead of making a 5000 word post about how it is broken or is to hard because you can\u0027t wrap your head around the concept of high dynamic pressure, even when there is BIG BOLD YELLOW WORDS that say \u0022HIGH DYNAMIC PRESSURE!\u0022 And there is even a visual indicator in game without the FAR window up, the vapor affect that encompasses the craft as you approach the sound barrier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I admit using FAR is completely different than the stock KSP soup, but it is easier to understand then the stock game. Why because you deal with it every day! You can look around outside, online or in a book, to find the answers to your problems. FAR doesn\u0027t make things easier or harder, it just makes them different then stock. Again, I have nothing but love for those who choose to play stock or stock aerodynamic model, but I do have an issue with those who do nothing but complain about FAR and continue to use it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn closing, if you choose to use FAR understand that it does change things quite a bit. But if you have the common sense of Bob Kermin you can figure it out without to much heartache. If you don\u0027t use FAR, don\u0027t think you are better than those who do, expecially if you have never tried it. And for those of us who do use FAR, we are no better then those who don\u0027t. If you are having problems with FAR and aerodynamic failures, I suggest Kerbal Joint Reinforcement and or hiding your struts in the wings of the craft. Real aircraft the wing roots are some of the strongest structures on an aircraft, so if yours isn\u0027t one of the strongest on your aircraft then that is your design issue, not a flaw in the plugin/mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/14ZxxN5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214ZxxN5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe flying!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T18:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want this to die because I agree, but I just want to say that FAR isn\u0027t perfect, although when compared to stock aeros it\u0027s basically God.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamic failures especially are unique in KSP though... in real life, an aircraft is made on one frame, and aerodynamic failures entail the breaking of the parts, whereas in our system it entails parts falling apart from each other. And currently that makes sense, because that\u0027s how crafts are built in KSP - as a bunch of parts thrown together. So I guess I wish that there was a way for FAR to act upon an aircraft as a whole rather than than on individual parts, because it seriously hinders G-tolerances and performance. In real aircraft, there isn\u0027t really a critical point, but when you gradually contribute to the stress by pushing the edges of the safe and tested flight envelope, you might then get a failure. So like I mentioned on the FAR thread at one point, it\u0027s really frustrating when my wings fall off pulling 2.5 G\u0027s for only an instant just because FAR didn\u0027t realize that the wing/body connection won\u0027t ever break, but maybe the wing itself will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany aircraft that are tested for 7-9 G\u0027s can sustain 4-6 indefinitely, and aerodynamic failures will NOT occur from hitting only 9 Gs, but instead aircraft stress will occur. THEN on future flights or future times you hit 7-9 Gs, your aircraft is more likely to have a stress failure, and will certainly at least contribute to stress at an accelerated rate too (maybe even my stress).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter-thought Edit: But seriously though, I am continually peeved by people complaining about add-ons being difficult or not perfect. 1.

But I have found a \u0022work around\u0022 for this problem. The aircraft pictured in the first post can actually hold a 9G sustained turn in high dynamic pressure situations without its wings coming off. I have placed a few dozen B9 strut connectors inside the wings acting as wing root structure to reinforce the wing attachment to the airframe. It increases the parts count but it gives me a much stronger wing structure then normal. I was inspired by someone elses idea where they did the samething with Procedural Wings and then expanded the wing over the strut. I just move my POV into the wing and build the strut bracing that way. I also looked at how real wings are attached to most aircraft, and they are often attached by more than 1 or 2 points, there are in some cases hundreds of load bearing points along the fuselage and the wing root. Between these design improvements and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, my aircraft are now far more like real aircraft in structural soundness, granted it doesn\u0027t mean sometimes things go HORRIBLY wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T20:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, yeah things can always go horribly wrong no matter what you do.

I\u0027m starting to get better at it, but the problem is while it may be realistic, it\u0027s too difficult to be a game. KSP has simulator elements but it\u0027s more of a game than a simulator, at least in my opinion. Though it is possible to do something, if it gets too complicated for some people that stops being fun and becomes a chore rather than entertainment. The fact that moving the wings a micrometer can mean ocean or space is part of the issue, and probably the biggest one. The stock aerodynamics you do have to put the wings right but they don\u0027t have to be n\u0027th level precision to function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong and the short of it is, I\u0027m starting to do well with FAR, but I don\u0027t think it should replace stock because it would likely chase player away from a great game. We all know where Microsoft Flight Simulator is right now, niche games just have trouble surviving. The arrangement we have now seems best. Those who like it, use it, those who don\u0027t like it... don\u0027t use it.
