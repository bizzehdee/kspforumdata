Now it takes me about 5 minutes and most of that is reducing the rerlative motion of the craft before the actual docking procedure. I get the craft in the same plane with one in a higher orbit. Make a maneuver node that burns the higher craft retrograde until it has a Pe at the same height as the lower craft. Move the node time until the craft are within about 10km at closest approach. Match velocity at closest approach then burn toward the other craft at about 10m/s for every Km. match velocity, burn again. rinse, repeat until you are within 100m of the other craft and your relative motion is 0. face your docking port toward the other craft, switch to the other craft and do the same and switch back. select the docking port as your target and select control from your docking port. Using RCS thrust toward the target then adjust your trajectory (with IKJL) so the yellow bit stays inside the purple bit (getting technical now) keep speed below 0.5m/s. wait. dock. simples. Of course I learned docking before I knew about RCS so when I found out you could have RCS it all seemed very easy from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
