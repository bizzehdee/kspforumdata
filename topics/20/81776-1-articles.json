We feel that we can use the base landing leg part module that comes with the game. However we are confused about how some of the settings look in Maya (or blender). I was wondering if you would be kind enough to help me with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe .cfg I\u0027m looking at is Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility\\LandingLeg\\part.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the settings are generic self explanatory settings however some of the module settings throw me off. For instance, wheel collider. How is this supposed to look in maya? What does it relate to? The foot seems obvious, this is just another model for the round part that rotates at the bottom correct? Lastly the suspension settings. I\u0027m straight up lost as to how this is supposed to look in the modeling program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe eventually would like to create a plugin that would allow for legs to move in a spider like fashion after landing using EC. Allowing movement of the entire command module without rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you might be able to provide. If anyone can explain how these module settings relate to the actual model itself that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGauge\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T05:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis will help clear things up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77991-Tutorial-Animated-Landing-Leg-w-Suspension\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77991-Tutorial-Animated-Landing-Leg-w-Suspension\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaugeforever","CreatedById":110684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T06:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my gosh that is perfect, thank you so much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
