So basically still have Earth, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, RSSVE\u00A0 etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe would still have to leave Earth and go there, but at your destination there would be livable planets with earth like atmosphere. So in whole, it would be just adding a solar system like Constellations, which by the way is my favorite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will contribute by building assets for the addon. currently I have two flyable crafts, TIE/IN and T-65 XWing. The TIE has both options of Interceptor or Fighter solar wings, Hatch opens , You can get inside thru hatch and add containers or whatever you like including the command chair. But it has the Capolola Internals so yes it has a cockpit view,\u00A0 TIE guns with actual sound including the scream of Twin ION Engines! The X-Wing has all the parts as well including working S-Foils, blaster canons etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if anyone is interested, please drop me a line or reply here. Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andi K.","CreatedById":156312,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T13:07:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure that I like the idea of doing this with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
