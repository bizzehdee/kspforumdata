It\\\u0027s a really awsome project and I am asking myself if it\\\u0027s possible to mod a remake of my favourite strategy game: Buzz Aldrins Race into space. All we need is a small strategy part around KSP. You can earn money by completing missions, buy and research new parts, improve them, train astronauts,... Is it possible to mod something like this? Or maybe it\\\u0027s already planned as a feature in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T17:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, all of those are planned features of KSP going forward - it may not be as much of a \u0027campaign\u0027 with beginning and end goalsm but rather remain a \\\u0027sandbox\\\u0027 game with the missions and advancement systems being much more \u0027freeform\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sunshadow","CreatedById":21958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T18:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds great! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a little goal could be funny in multiplayer mode. 2 or more players start a race to the next planet.
