Just a simple question regarding radiators and reactors, and dissipating the heat. Mostly to do with the thermal mechanics helper. Im honestly struggling to figure out exactly whats worth keeping an eye on, but my best guess is the parts that turned blue? Ive launched multiple rockets with reactors before that run pretty much perfectly fine but these thermal mechanics are still kinda hard to understand for me. Little help? this mod can honestly be a bit confusing at times (only today did I just finally realize that 1MJ = 1000EC when converted between using the Supercapacitors, which finally gave me some understanding on that part)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, asking with my own thread cause, quite frankly, the KSPIE thread seems kinda dead right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nimage of my current rocket under construction, fitted with an Antimatter reactor that feeds into a thermal nozzle, and a thermal generator (ignore the charged particle generator, I swapped it with a thermal generator after realizing the particular reactor doesnt feed into charged particle gens, a while after taking this image), as well as info on the radiator I plan to utilize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick EDIT: the Antimatter reactor is a beam core reactor added by Interstellar Technologies, hence its ability to work with thermal nozzles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pPRtxzq.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pPRtxzq.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-05T05:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2022 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by FusionNexus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FusionNexus","CreatedById":222641,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-10T17:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeyo, about 1 week later without a response, So just wondering if anyone is able to help me understand this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s effectively no info i can find that actually explains in good detain how the thermal mechanics with KSPIE work, and the thermal helper in the image above, while informative, somewhat confuses me. Ive seen 4 colors on it (red, yellow, blue, green) and, while i could make a guess that the colors represent better heat management, i would like some actual explanation on how the thermal mechanics actually work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
