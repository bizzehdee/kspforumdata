Contract Mission to \u0022Explore Kerbin\u0022 but was actually a rendezvous mission over Kerbin. But that\u0027s not the weird part:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: both ships had a boot file designated on their scriptable modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch a satellite with a docking port and a scriptable module so that I can use my kOS script for launch/circularization. Launch goes as planned and once firmly established in a 120km circularized orbit, the kOS prints its little \u0022script complete\u0022 message and I close the kOS terminal. I put the satellite in a retrograde attitude and...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI jump back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and put together a second vehicle - manned this time - but also with a docking port and a scriptable module. Again launch perfectly follows the script (90km orbit this time) and I close the kOS terminal after the \u0022script complete\u0022 message appears. Over what seemed like 100 hours later, I finally wrestle my active ship to within sight of the satellite, but the satellite\u0027s kOS terminal comes within range of my ship, pops up its terminal on my ship and tries to run its script on my vessel,\u00A0 and that\u0027s when things went to hell in a handbasket. When I approached the satellite to within 1km, the supposedly dormant satellite suddenly performs a full power retrograde burn, making me shoot so far past that by the time I realized what was happening the target was at 50km and opening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that the satellite kOS reactivated the launch/circularize script when it detected my ship was in range. This would explain the full power retro burn. Was there some setting I missed that allowed the satellite kOS to rise from the dead and run again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
