Since you\u0027re stationary on the pad you can use full-speed time warp; simply stop the warp roughly an orbit before the slated transfer window (say 40 minutes). You can then launch to orbit and you\u0027re practically at the transfer time point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just make sure you delete the old node and re-calculate the transfer. All should be well and no lengthy warps in low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T17:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut when i put spacecraft on parking orbit 100 km around Kerbin i can\u0027t use full warp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a satellite into orbit at 1000km around Kerbin.
