Thank you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly think a lot of the problems KSP has performance wise have to do with how poorly Mono/Unity handles memory allocation and garbage collection. For instance, one of the things I noticed was that running KSP with no command line switches, thus using DirectX 9, none of my GPU memory was being used. Once I figured out the right command line switches, I got KSP running using DirectX 11, and suddenly my GPU memory is being used correctly; KSP is no longer acting like I have onboard graphics utilizing shared system memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Windows itself sometimes gets in the way. Like I mentioned, I only have 2GB of system memory and even with ATM Aggressive I couldn\u0027t get KSP to run for more than an hour before crashing. After that it wouldn\u0027t run at all, crashing on load with a \u0022too many heap sections\u0022 error. Eventually I discovered that Windows automatically takes half of allocatable memory for itself but this can be overridden. Once I did that I was able to get KSP 0.90 plus all those mostly non-parts mods I consider essential working with pretty good performance, although I still have to run at half-res.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T17:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWings placement affect each other unlike stock ksp (understand that spamming 30 winglet in 1 spot, won\u0027t linearly improve lift, it will get less and less useful)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand yes, it is better for building aircraft simply because it is better for flying them with a pad / joystick, but some extremely cheaty stock planes are also fun to fly xD like my UMI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut you never never reach the complexity in behaviour and handling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it\u0027s not all FAR does, FAR also simulate wind forces on parts that lift or drag \u0026gt; aeroviz ( that can break those if tolerance exceeded ) what it means really is that suspension on a plane now make sense, which is great for building and hard yes especially since you have to see how the mod works between the lines, all parts have a \u0022front\u0022 and a \u0022rear\u0022 with different lift / drag depending on how you place it..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T17:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"notsorightstuph","CreatedById":82399,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T03:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used FAR for a while.
