The thing I don\u0027t want is for it to make stuff too easy. In the 1960s, achieving a parking orbit with a specific AP, PA, inclination, etc. was not easy. In Star Trek, it is so easy, they just press a couple of buttons and it happens. I don\u0027t want to turn the former into the latter. But the base game doesn\u0027t give enough info to even play 1960 style. If I want to WORK, I can make the base game WORK 1960s style, but I don\u0027t want to work. I want to play.

While it can give you more info than you might want, the default settings only give a small amount of info. You have to manually edit the display if you want a ton of stuff.

The amount of information displayed when desired is too valuable. I also set it to that its always on and not requiring a part.\n\nFor landings on planets for example, I can see exactly how much lateral movement I have.\n\nWhen building a rocket I can see exactly how much dV and TWR and more I have on each stage. So no more guessing whether I\u0027ve got enough to get to orbit, or to Mun, or if one stage is strong enough to even accelerate after separation.\n\nWhen putting satellites into orbit I can see precise readings for orbit duration, inclination, etc etc.\n\nMost important of all, I can see how much dV I have left in each stage as I fly. So I can see just how much I have to spare once a manoeuvre is complete. Rather than starting the burn and finding I\u0027m 10m/s short.\n\nIt\u0027s an essential.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t do anything for you apart from sums (and since I\u0027m not a rocket scientist I\u0027m ok with that), just provides the information for you to use."},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:59:15Z","Content":"I just got it (as per DarkGravity\u0027s advice). It is absolutely brilliant. But in my opinion, you shouldn\u0027t really use it all. Knowing more than they do in real life makes it way too easy. Knowing velocity components makes it too easy, knowing things like time to impact and time to 0m/s or acceleration makes it too easy. Knowing things like biomes are ok, but for me a little too much, you should have one of the scanners for that. Knowing reasonable stats like mass, thrust, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v are brilliant. Most of all KER is about building rockets knowing the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v values. I knew how to work them out, but it was getting tedious.\n\nPut simply: MechJeb is too much, and KER is almost MechJeb where you push the buttons if you\u0027re not careful.\n\nThe best thing is that you really can just choose. Any complaints about overpoweredness are killed by the choice. The only question is: do you have the self restraint? I\u0027m being overly tempted by certain numbers. I may just turn it off in flight. I recommend partless and if you care, don\u0027t let yourself use it without an RGU or similar. more parts is not what my rockets need.\n\nBuilding rockets is now glorious, thank you to all responsible.\n\nOn another similar note, does anyone think that the new SAS retrograde button makes landing too easy?"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T00:00:04Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t used KER in flight yet. But I do like the dV values in the VAB. I certainly don\u0027t want to have things like suicide burn time displayed in flight. Maybe to review data like that before the flight is one thing, but I like the game to have quite a lot of \u0022seat of the pants\u0022 flying. As more and more of these mods take more and more of the guesswork out, I am seeing the need for a mod that introduces random explosions or other malfunctions. Maybe something like 0.01% per rocket the first time it ignites (defined to mean that you can have many rockets on one vehicle) on Normal difficulty, 0.02% on Moderate... during descent maybe one of your lander\u0027s engine\u0027s decides to only operate at 75% thrust...\n\n I believe in the days of Gemini, 1 in 5 Titan rockets were blowing up. And their total computing power for an entire mission could not power a single cell phone today. \n\nI\u0027ve never played this game before release, but I do think the SAS retrograde is a bit OP. It would be OK if it put you very near (say within 3%) of retrograde, but the flawless reliability and instantaneous extreme precision is a bit overmuch for a game trying to recreate the days of Apollo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T00:06:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:43:58Z","Content":"The thing is - it\u0027s not OP for manoeuvres but it is for landing.

No cheats involved here, don\u0027t worry. Knowing your parameters is certainly not cheating."}]}
