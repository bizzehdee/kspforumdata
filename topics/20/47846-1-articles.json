Isotopes that are quite rare, much too heavy to move long distance but provider much better yields of liquidfuel and oxidizer. The rarest requires either luck or a 80-90% planet scanning coverage, but yields 100x more than stock Kethane. The downside is that it\u0027s 10x heavier, so immediately the trip-for-trip yield difference compared to stock kethane is about 10x more. I may tweak this. Requires large amounts of power (1,200/s) to convert meaning this is really only viable at a base or station. Again I may change this to use KSP Interstellar\u0027s MegaJoules or something else entirely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Science gathering (for KSP Interstellar) that occurs in locations of the rarest isotope - the idea being that if you can find it, the value of the location is of scientific interest itself. I still haven\u0027t decided on maximum values for the numbers. Science is \u0027mined\u0027 for now until I can think of a better way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Deuterium and Tritium deposits for Impossible Innovations, but the overpowered nature of the (intended for cheating) mod puts me off a little, and the overlap of resources with Interstellar Warp makes me twitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Mining/Harvesting in some form for IonCross, but I\u0027m not convinced it needs it, or that it\u0027s stable enough (encountered an infrequent but annoying ship disintegration when trying it out). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) In general, better use of the functionality provided by the Kethane mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Combine different resources to make better fuels. e.g. Jool has plenty of LiquidFuel, great for ISP. But if you want more thrust, you\u0027ll have to bring oxidiser!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking suggestions to fuel my enthusiasm!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
