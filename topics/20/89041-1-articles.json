Three of four solar farms may be more ideal, though. The absolute most power you need is the amount necessary to turn all on the lights on and be running your science lab(s) and transmitter(s) beyond that is just waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably will be wanting to use Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) to attach the various parts of the base together. However, I think you may hit the limits of KSP preventing you from covering the entire surface of Gilly. There is a mod to expand that limit, but at the cost of performance and tempting the Kracken.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-01T22:29:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2014 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruedii\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore details\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
