Mods that use the new 0.20 structure (it\u0027s not a floating point number, 0.2 was a version back before the game was publicly available) will have a directory that you copy into your KSP{whatever}/GameData. Within that directory, you\u0027ll then have folders for parts, plugins, and whatever else you want. Or you could have directories that contain other directories, that then break down into the parts you want. It\u0027s pretty flexible from what I\u0027ve seen. Try not to install anything into KSP/GameData/Squad, that\u0027s for the stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
