They\u0027re neat for the first time around Kerbin but I don\u0027t want to do them for every single world to explore. Is there a simple way to go about this? I couldn\u0027t find them in the Contracts.cfg file (GameData\\Squad\\Contracts) and I don\u0027t have any particularly decent modding knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
