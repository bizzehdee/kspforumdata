Because I am using it on 1.0.4. \n\nThere is one thing that comes to mind apart from that, but it has been outdated even longer than TimeControl. [Orbit Manipulator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70881-0-25-Orbit-Manipulator-Series-%28Updated-March-12-2014%29) theoretically allows thrust during on rails timewarp. Someone wanted to [take it up](https://github.com/NanoExplorer/IonWarp)some time ago, but you will have to test whether it works yourself."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:21:12Z","Content":"Oh, when I tried it a few days ago it caused me to not be able to control craft.
