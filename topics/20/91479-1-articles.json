Unfortunately my PC could not handle it and after 2 days, 5 hours of play, 24 crashes, 3 kraken attacks, and weird glitches I decided that my Windows Vista PC could not handle it. But, I decided to give the demo a try. It worked perfectly (and i am glad it did.) So, I was wondering if there was any mods for the demo. Don\u0027t get me wrong i am glad there is a demo, however after playing for a few hours and going to the mun there is nothing left to do. If there are any mods for the demo please let me know, and continue making what I think is a great game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T17:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe demo is designed to not support addons at all, the most you can do is a one-for-one replacement of an existing part, and there\u0027s no plugin support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T17:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately for you, the demo is hardcoded to only recognize the parts it comes with.
