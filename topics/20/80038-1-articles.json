I have been trying to find better engines for the purposes of clustering. Specifically, I am looking engines that are realistic in that they have no predefined coupling ring at the bottom of the tank, and just have the structure and turbopumps to attach to the tanks. I already have FASA, KW, and Near Future propulsion. It is ok if these are older packs, I can adjust configs for .24 of my own. I have seen the soviet engine pack, but I am concerned about he RAM footprint. As an extension of this, is there a mod which strips the tank connectors from stock engines (if appropriate)? I could do this myself, but I guess .mu files can not be reverse engineered?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR, looking for realistic form factor engines, I can upgrade them per part for .24 if necessary, and I already have FASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T22:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35383-0-23-AIES-Aerospace-v1-5-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAIES\u003C/a\u003E, it has some small surface mount engines that might be just what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T23:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much.
