Install that directly into GameData. The sounds will not work but everything else will function fine. If you would like to have the detector sounds, you need to leave only the sounds folder and it\u0027s contents in the KSP/PluginData/MMI_Kethane folder. Everything else in the DL needs to go into KSP/GameData.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hansman1982","CreatedById":62705,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T03:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
