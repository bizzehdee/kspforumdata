(Maybe two weeks ago). You could look for it over there or maybe ask in their thread for a quicker response. I \\*think\\* they said delete all the parts that aren\u0027t what you want and it should be okay."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbinDriveYards","CreatedById":137802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:46:40Z","Content":"Ok, thanks!

The absolute minimum files needed for using the redone seismometer experiment are:\n\n-CommunityResourcePack\n\n-InterstellarFuelSwitch/Plugins/Scale\\_Redist.dll\n\n-WarpPlugin/Patches/science.cfg\n\n-WarpPlugin/Plugins/Interstellar.dll\n\n-WarpPlugin/Plugins/OpenResourceSystem\\_KSPIE.dll\n\n-WarpPlugin/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg\n\nWarpPlugin/WarpPluginSettings.cfg is not needed but without it the mod throws an error upon loading a save. The error has no actual effect, but I included the settings because the popup error window would be annoying to deal with every time.\n\nNow I\u0027m gonna launch some Impact mod \u002B Interstellar mod seismometer probe and impactor experiments!"}]}
