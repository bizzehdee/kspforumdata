I\u0027m really liking the look of the new things that have been added to the career game and want to play it, but the only thing keeping that is (and was before) me away is the tech tree progression. Sure, I could just research the whole tech tree up to the points I want to start with, but then I\u0027d have no incentive to gather science or a goal to work toward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy preferred method would be to start with rover parts, driving around to science local collection locations, then to aircraft, and then to rockets. Perhaps another way to go about it would be to separate rover, aircraft, and rocket parts into different sections, each connecting to the \u0022Start\u0022 node. This would allow the player to choose which they want to do first (rovers, aircraft, or rocketry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy intent with how I want to play is to start off with rovers to allow for driving around the areas local to KSC in order to gather science on foot, then moving from there to aircraft and rockets. After the basic aircraft I\u0027d like to go to very basic unmanned rockets, and then manned rockets. From there I\u0027m perfectly happy with stock progression, it\u0027s really just the beginning that bothers me. I\u0027d even be alright with going straight to manned rockets from basic rovers, if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what is needed to make my own tech tree, and I suppose I can if it isn\u0027t too hard. Would a custom tech tree work with mods, parts finding their place on their own (mostly)?
