I understand this is one of the intended uses of the CTT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Comment on the CTT thread if we need any new nodes added *now*. If capsules are a later game addition, we may need nodes to support that. (Or we might not, but asking for new nodes now is really good.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hope is that this will minimise the work required overall, and maximise compatibility with future mod development by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Not requiring a new tech tree to be developed from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Easing the support transitions for new mods which already support the CTT, as we only need to code the changes in part placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the CTT is a super-set of the stock tree, so many mod that places its parts in stock will place its parts somewhere in the Realism Tree by default. This means if the user installs any unsupported mods (and they will), then they at least have those parts available via career mode, even if they\u0027re not balanced. I believe this view is compatible with Felger\u0027s view that we should \u0022retain the current nodes, but re-arrange parts to match a realistic progression\u0022. It also means that if we aim for a stock-tree re-arrangement, we are CTT compatible going forward. (Although I think the CTT gives us more flexibility by providing new nodes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m happy with us requiring one parts pack as core, but I\u0027m hesitant to *require* more than that.

On the \u0027core parts\u0027 I\u0027d recommend instead of listing a required mod, figure out which mod(s) gives enough parts early on to have a successful space program. If we can manage it, just the required mods for RO \u002B Stock would be awesome. If not, it\u0027d be nice to have required mods \u002B stock \u002B Highly recommended.

I agree with practically everything there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only concern is, with the current required mods, even with KW/NovaPunch/AIES as well, we\u0027re going to very rarely use the added nodes of the CTT, and if we\u0027re not really using it, is it worth the extra effort for the user to install? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling RSS\u002BRO\u002BRequired mod\u0027s seems to be hard enough based on the number of people who manage to stuff it up so far.
