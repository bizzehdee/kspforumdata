The ship has a Mobile Processing\u00A0Lab on it and this gave me an idea: it would be interesting if probes could transmit science to other ships instead of directly to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. In the case above, the probe could transmit science data to the orbiting ship, which could then process the data in its MPL.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what would this require? An advanced probe core and a pilot are required to *control* a probe without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E connection, so I\u0027d say an advanced probe core and scientist would be needed\u00A0remotely gather data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
