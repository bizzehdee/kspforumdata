They would have to take medicine (Carried around in Command Pod and also cost money) or be treated by a doctor (Kerbals can be trained for founds to be able to Heal others)"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:57:21Z","Content":"Not too bad an idea, though I think it may have been suggested before.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be *too* hard to implement, I would think. AFAIK, there have been reports that a Kerbals Courage can potentially drop during a mission (this may have been a bug that was fixed), but if that\u0027s the case, then changing stats can be supported by the system. From there, I guess you\u0027d just need a new \u0027stat\u0027 called \u0027health\u0027 or something.\n\nHaving a doctor on-board your ship could potentially slow the decay of health, and having a \u0027clinic\u0027 module or something could be used to \u0027cure\u0027 \u0027sick\u0027 Kerbals, using a similar process to the Science Lab research function thing. Higher level Doctors could help keep more Kerbals healthy, or keep the ones that are there even healthier. Maybe a fully-leveled Doc could boost some of the others Kerbal\u0027s stats.\n\nI don\u0027t know if I\u0027d want my Kerbals to suddenly \u0027lose control\u0027 or anything like that... maybe a progressive reduction to their skill level or something? A sick level 3 scientist doesn\u0027t give as much of a bonus as a healthy level 3 scientist? Or a sick level 2 pilot might forget how to point prograde/retrograde? After being \u0027cured,\u0027 of course, their stats would return to normal.\n\nJust tossing out ideas ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:02:10Z","Content":"Yea loosing control would make it too relevant, it should just cause minor trouble your right"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T21:19:28Z","Content":"Check out:\n\n[KeepFit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739)\n\n[KabinKraziness](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114956)"}]}
