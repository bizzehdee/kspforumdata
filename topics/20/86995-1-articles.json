The Mk3-9 is a beautiful pod, similar to the Mk1-2 but much more advanced.

There\u0027s a modder working on a nice 2.5m stock-like Dragon, though it hasn\u0027t been released yet- Tundra Space Industries I think it\u0027s called. Tantares has some cool stock-like Soyuz pods. Stockalike Station Parts Expansion has a few different sized cupola modules, and they\u0027re very well done. I can\u0027t think of any others, but I believe there are some crazy sci-fi mods out there if you want some really unique pods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T06:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-24-2-Near-Future-Technologies-(16-08-14-All-packs-new-parts-balance-fixes)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENearFuture\u003C/a\u003E has also some nice command pods (big ones) along with everything else it offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Spacecraft imgur album \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/E7Am8#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T09:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out transparent command pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84054\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84054\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey offer great field of view in iva.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T10:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKOSMOS.
