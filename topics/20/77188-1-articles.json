However, there are so many that I\u0027m not sure where to start looking really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor context, I\u0027m not a complete beginner but wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m particularly good either. I can reach the Mun/Minmus etc. and have just about worked out docking now so that\u0027s the kind of level I\u0027m at. My experimentation with Spaceplanes has been a complete disaster so far, so I\u0027m going to focus on rockets for the moment, although I\u0027d quite like to build some sort of Space Shuttle to service my Space station when it gets bigger. So yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve currently got Mechjeb and Interstellar, although that\u0027s it for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bedlem","CreatedById":114795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T14:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out my thread I am pretty much in the same spot as you, see if the reply to my thread is going along the path you want.

I imagine MechJeb would do a similar job though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock - very very useful to avoid time warping past events, especially when you have half-a-dozen probes going at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced NavBall - useful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavyfish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator - made my first ever docking very easy. I will have to try again using just the stock controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanSat - love the idea of sending mapping probes first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System (KAS) - needed it to rescue some stranded Kerbonauts and really like the idea of EVA being more than \u0022EVA report\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Frontier - keeps track of each Kerbal\u0027s achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkOS - script your probes. I initially thought I could pre-program probes and they\u0027d execute their manoeuvres when the conditions are met, but the ship still has to be active for this to happen. My idea was to use this for non-kerballed probes to add realism, and to be able to control multiple probes at once. But due to the restriction I haven\u0027t really used it yet. Might still be useful once I get ion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive Texture Management - reduce memory usage to allow more mods! Only needed until I get more RAM for my machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerrram Aerospace Research (FAR) - like you I can\u0027t seem to fly planes. Or at least, land them. So I installed this last night to see if I have any more success. Also I like the idea of being restricted to more sensible rockets.. although in retrospect that doesn\u0027t seem quite .. kerbal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocktry - installed purely for the fairings to play with FAR as I haven\u0027t exhausted the possibilities of the stock parts yet. I toyed with the idea of installing procedural fairings instead, but I liked the idea of having to design within limits. Perhaps I watched too much of Scott Manley\u0027s YouTube series..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had Clouds and Cities installed, but it blew my RAM budget. Might try again now that I\u0027ve switched from KDE to WindowMaker for playing KSP (that alone freed nearly a Gig!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there\u0027s quite a few more I like the look/idea of and might try once I get further into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a few lists from other people as further inspiration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73743-My-personal-must-have-mod-list\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73743-My-personal-must-have-mod-list\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1upc6g/scott_manleys_interstellar_quest_modlist/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1upc6g/scott_manleys_interstellar_quest_modlist/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/255cjn/essential_and_nonessentialbutstillcool_mods/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/255cjn/essential_and_nonessentialbutstillcool_mods/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
