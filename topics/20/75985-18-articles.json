I apologise for the inconvenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis morning, I woke up to discover that Kerbal Stuff had vanished. The server was completley gone, not responding to pings or anything, and a bunch of emails in my inbox led me to believe that it had been an issue for several hours. I called in late for work and started to figure out what\u0027s going on. For those who don\u0027t know, Majiir has been hosting Kerbal Stuff for the entire lifetime of the site (and I am very thankful for that). Recently, Majiir and I spoke to consider the future of Kerbal Stuff and how it would be administered. We agreed to both have equal authority over the website\u0027s administration. The last thing I heard from him, however, was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84154-Kerbal-Stuff-an-open-source-Space-Port-replacement?p=1406282\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1406282\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehis post\u003C/a\u003E last night, issuing an ultimatum that clearly flies in the face of what we had agreed upon earlier. I attempted to contact him privately to resolve this issue, via IRC and email and finally forum PMs. Unfortunately, he did not respond to any attempt to contact him, so I submitted my response in this thread. This is the last time he and I talked, draw whatever conclusions from that that you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of this morning, he has left the modding IRC channel we usually talk in (for the first time in months) and has still not responded to any of my attempts to contact him. All these things considered, I took steps to move Kerbal Stuff away from his hosting under the assumption that he would not be immediately available to help resolve the downtime. As of this morning, Kerbal Stuff is hosted on my own servers and as of a few minutes ago my backup has been completely restored. This may or may not be a temporary arrangement depending on what actually happened to Majiir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important part is that Kerbal Stuff is back up and healthy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T17:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers. thanks for the update. hope things work out for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T17:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
