Principia, which changes the way physics are handled in KSP, does not play nice with the Firespitter plugin-- specifically, \u0022FSengineBladed\u0022 and\u00A0 \u0022FSbladeLiftSurface\u0022. I\u0027ve looked through the code but I haven\u0027t found an obvious source for this incompatibility, but I am certain that it comes from those two classes conflicting with/improperly using Principia\u0027s slightly different physics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn practice this incompatibility manifests basically only with helicopter parts. If you throttle up a helicopter blade while Principia is installed, your helicopter will flop from side to side and bounce up and down like a fish out of water. It\u0027s quite funny, actually. Tellingly, the \u0022current force\u0022 field of the rotor will always remain at 0. Simply put, the parts won\u0027t work for their intended purpose. Remove Principia, and boom- Helicopters can take off, hover, and crash catastrophically into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E just as you would expect.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know for certain that this issue affects the Firespitter rotors, as well as those from \u0022Airplane Plus\u0022. Another separate but very similar issue occurs with lifting bodies that use the mod \u0022Hooligan Labs Airships\u0022-- the parts from that mod also bounce about like convulsing fish when you attempt to use them in conjunction with Principia, so I can only assume that something very similar is causing both issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment, since my cursory knowledge of unity modding doesn\u0027t afford me the ability to really find out what\u0027s wrong, and possibly fix it, There\u0027s not much that can be done if you find yourself with the same mod conflict. However, on the bright side, in the case of \u0022airplanes plus\u0022, many of the parts cause no conflicts: so, you could simply hide the offending parts with something like \u0022Janitor\u0027s Closet\u0022, and not encounter any problems. Hopefully this little write-up serves to help someone figure out why their helicopters just won\u0027t work, without having to check for mod incompatibilities one at a time for hours on end like I did\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ErikErik","CreatedById":223707,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-10T13:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, I just saw this after scouring the internet for hours to try and figure out why my helicopters don\u2019t fly.
