Theoretically* then I could re-attach it to the crane, drive up to the mini-clamp-o-tron and attempt to dock. I managed to do this ONCE with a kind of \u0022traditional\u0022 crane design, but not only is it almost impossible to turn the thing to the exact angle you need to dock, but the one time I did do this successfully everything just sort of blew up for some unknown reason. (I guess since the crane \u002B radial engine \u002B HOME base pod were all technically docked and the physics freaked out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*probably not\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T07:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadially mount engines that don\u0027t leave any trace after you remove them?
