The problem I am having is not that big, but it is annoying me. It is the control surfaces. They keep flapping around when I am in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think it would be possible to code an addon to allow turning off of aerodynamic control surfaces? Maybe add a button that will turn them all off or somehow allow them to be bound in an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas, feedback, modders possibly willing to give it a go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself am abosolutely useless when it comes to the technical side of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Othuyeg\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-27T00:19:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2014 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Othuyeg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T01:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10char\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T03:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENEAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso 10 char.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T19:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is just that I do not really want the other stuff that comes with them.
