This system, although simple, is too easy(imho), so what I propose is that you have a yearly budget (much like a real space program), and how big of a budget you have is dependent on you reputation and you accomplishments. This modified system you give you reputation if you successfully complete a contract, and completing contracts will also count toward your accomplishments. And by having a higher reputation and more accomplishment on your resume, you will have a bigger and more generous budget next year. You might be wondering, \u0022Then wouldn\u0027t you just time warp to stockpile your funds from you budget to get money?\u0022 This is where accomplishment comes in. In order to keep the taxpayers paying, you will not only need to have accomplishments to convince the public that you are worthy, and also there will be \u003Cstrong\u003Egoals\u003C/strong\u003E. Goals are set, so that you must accomplish things that you chose, in a limited time frame(such as putting a colony on Duna in 3 years). And if you fail to accomplish this goal, then you will get major budget cuts. This puts incentive in trying to do new things, and also present a potential failure condition that will enhance the game experience by having a tight schedule on what you will need to do (Like a real space agency, you have to get the people to believe in that you are worthy of the money.) In addition to all that, the current contract will also give you some boost in funds, but hard to sustain on compared to government funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in conclusion, these are the things that are added/changed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFunds \u003C/strong\u003E- Instead of getting funds, you get a funds, that are limited by your yearly budget, so that you need to be wise about spending you funds (Like you salary)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBudget \u003C/strong\u003E- You will get a yearly flow of funds, and in order to have high budget, you need to have high reputation and accomplishments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReputation \u003C/strong\u003E- The new reputation will now affect how much budget you get. If you lose a lot of kerbals, the government will deem you irresponsible and severely cut you budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAccomplishment \u003C/strong\u003E- Not only keeping a good reputation is important. You will also be required to convince the taxpayers that you can have noble achievement in the field of space exploration and aeronautics. So in order to get persistent funding and a high budget, you will have to have persistent accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoal \u003C/strong\u003E- This is a object that must be done in time, or else the public will think that you are wasting money. This and reputation shall be the major deciding factor in the budget you get. If you can convince Kongress that you can live up to your words, more money will flow your way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts \u003C/strong\u003E- The new system will have contract give more reputation, instead of giving you money (it will still give you money, but not as much, so that government funding seem like a better choice). The increase in reputation will influence budget, which then allows you to have more money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas are welcome. This is all just food for thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T23:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou just described the current system.

Its more like there is a major contract that you MUST complete, and there are smaller contract that you can use to gain extra funds/science/reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
