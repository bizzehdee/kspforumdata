I know that I couldn\u0027t live without many of the mods that some of the mod makers have been working on and supporting for years. And so I\u0027ve made an open letter asking us all to remember developers this Release Season and to perhaps join me in finding one or two with a donate button and chucking $5 their way. \n\nAs a YouTube content creator I\u0027m even more conscious of the fact that I actually make (very tiny) amounts of money off the efforts of mod makers. Sure, making videos takes effort, but it doesn\u0027t take weeks like 90% of the mods do, and so I feel a touch guilty that I\u0027m earning a couple of bucks off the work of these guys and girls. That\u0027s why I\u0027m also pledging to donate a chunk of my channel profits from Kerbal mods videos to mod makers at each channel anniversary. \n\nI\u0027d love to see some people add #donationcountdown to their excitement over #kerbalcountdown. Will you join me?\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FqnOVx0fH8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"csebal","CreatedById":36793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T14:15:45Z","Content":"I love the KSP modding community and have the utmost respect towards those modders who not only put tons of hours into making the game better, but also share their creations with the world. I can also understand, how some might feel that they deserve some sort of compensation for their effort, after all.. why should someone benefit from the labors of their work for free? I do not necessarily agree, but I can understand.\n\nWhat I do not like, nor support, is 3rd parties pushing, nudging communities towards a paid model, just so they can skim their 15-20% off all the sales, because that is about the only reason Steam is pushing for the whole workshop thing. A freaky disgusting way of monetizing off of other people\u0027s work.\n\nWith that said, I will likely never pay for any but the most serious of mods and frankly speaking, KSP has maybe a handful out of the hundreds that I would even consider paying for. Main reasons:\n\n- Quality, which I do not get to judge as long as I get it for free, but will look at with a critical eye the moment someone asks money for it\n\n- Necessity, lots of stuff I use I do because I can, not necessarily because I need it\n\n- Longevity, games are made by companies and even then the likelihood of them not getting supported on the long run is quite high. Mods are made by enthusiastic individuals, who can get a new fancy the next week and leave their project in the state it is, not updating it any more. This is especially critical with a game that is changing so much as KSP does.\n\n- Principles, because the moment I start giving out money for something someone did for himself, either because he wanted to see if he could or because he wanted that feature himself (as those two are the most common modding drivers), I turn into a charity and I\u0027m definitely not the red cross.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it all comes down to how much I want something vs the asking price. I will buy it, if I cannot acquire it cheaper, but I will think twice on how much I need it before I do.\n\nThat and boo steam for even trying. I hope the whole idea crashes and burns, because its bad and evil on many many levels and it brings toxicity into otherwise awesome communities just by its existence.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T14:25:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by csebal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T14:18:20Z","Content":"Mod devs should make the decision to wheter to make people pay or not, if the chance ever arises."},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T16:36:27Z","Content":"\u003E - Quality, which I do not get to judge as long as I get it for free, but will look at with a critical eye the moment someone asks money for it\n\nYes you do. The freedom to judge quality and decide whether you want something or not on that basis is not restricted by whether said something is free. And I would fully expect a critical examination of any product I was selling. Including a mod.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Principles, because the moment I start giving out money for something someone did for himself, either because he wanted to see if he could or because he wanted that feature himself (as those two are the most common modding drivers), I turn into a charity and I\u0027m definitely not the red cross.\n\nWow. Just wow.

It\u0027s a stain on the gaming industry that EULAs have been preventing this for as long as they have. Thanks to that, consumers sense of entitlement has reached a point where a modder is at risk of being burnt at the stake for even considering charging for the work they do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T16:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaAsh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T17:03:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That and boo steam for even trying.

The only thing keeping it alive is the mod community. KSP and Squad are going to face this same exact challenge. The question is, whether Squad finds a solution to the paid mod question or whether they do what most game companies do, stop development entirely, let it die and move on to something else.\n\n(And you\u0027ll note that Forbes has NO problem bombarding you with their own attempt to make money off the story these mods create.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T17:06:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T17:23:48Z","Content":"What I find amazing is when I see the attitude that most people can pay $20 for KSP, play it for hundreds or thousands of hours and then cry foul when asked to pay $5 for additional content (whether that be DLC or mods). \n\nAnd then many of us (myself included) won\u0027t bat an eye at paying $5 for a latte....
