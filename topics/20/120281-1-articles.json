I am obviously missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put up a basic setup as seen in the picture: fusion Dusty Plasma Reactor producing charged particles, and a Charged Particles Electric Generator right on top. Added small fission\u002Btermogenerator on top to start the big one up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big fusion reactor is running and producing charged particles. However, the electric generator is not producing any Megajoules, despite being active. Few are being produced (and beamed up) by the small fission pair, as I tested by turning it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi59.tinypic.com/vncnt3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vncnt3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have more or less similar problems whenever I try to use anything bigger than just a fission\u002Btermogenerator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing, or did wrong? Any help would be appreciated (or even a link to a good current guide, as there are so many out there for various versions that I get lost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using KSPI 1.4.10 (latest by now), have KAS, KIS and some other support mods, but nothing else in principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-K\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T19:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod question moved to the mod subforum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T06:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need another reactor to start Dusty Plasma, and check that your Transmitter is inactive.
