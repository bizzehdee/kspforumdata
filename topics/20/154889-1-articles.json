(If you run any mods, chances are you already have it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 2: Create an empty text file somewhere inside GameData. It doesn\u0027t matter where. You can make your own \u0022Tweaks\u0022 subfolder if you like. You can also name the file whatever you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 3: Inside that text file, put the following basic framework:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@TechTree:FINAL\n{\n\t@RDNode:HAS[#id[ ]]\n\t{\n\t\t@cost = \n\t}\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 4: Find the ID of a tech node that you wish to change. You can get it from a part that is unlocked by that tech node. For example, if you look at the Swivel engine, it says \u0022TechRequired = generalRocketry\u0022 in its part config. \u0022generalRocketry\u0022 is the ID of the General Rocketry tech node, which unlocks the Swivel engine. Place that ID into the textfile in between the square brackets after where it says \u0022#id\u0022. Then, you can use the \u0022@cost = \u0022 line to assign whatever cost you wish to this tech node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 5: By copypasting the whole \u0022@RDNode\u0022 block and changing the node ID, you can assign a new cost to any other node you think needs changing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 6: After you\u0027re all done and saved everything, change the file extension of your text file to \u0022.cfg\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you now boot up KSP and load or start a career save, you will discover that the costs of all unresearched nodes that you have changed will have updated to whatever you defined in your patch. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E However, keep in mind that the level of your R\u0026amp;D facility limits how much you can spend on research nodes. A level 1 R\u0026amp;D facility can only unlock nodes costing 100 points or less, a level 2 can unlock nodes costing 500 points or less, and the unlimited level 3 is very expensive to upgrade to. Remember this when you design your career progression.
