Has anyone shown interest in doing that? It is an excellent pack, full of high-quality parts, and with as open a license as that on it, it\u0027d make sense to keep alive, and even expand upon. I\u0027ve seen a few expansions to it under development, including some IVA scenes and one with extra parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a big pack, and there have been some issues raised and solved in the community - specifically the SABRE engines and updating the dependent DLLs come to mind. It wouldn\u0027t be a trivial job, but one well worth doing, I\u0027d say - especially with the recent move to CurseForge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T11:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at the D12 pack, its a B9 supplement, that includes alot of the fixes and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77894-D12-Aerotech-a-full-B9-Expansion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77894-D12-Aerotech-a-full-B9-Expansion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochton","CreatedById":70134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T07:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one of the expansions I was referring to - and an impressive one.
