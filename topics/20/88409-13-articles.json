I\u0027ve put together an Atlas-Agena rocket using the \u0022Atlas SLV-3\u0022 tank, LR-105 \u0026amp; LR-89 engines (on the Atlas stage), the Agena-D Guidance Unit and antenna, Bell 8247 engine and a procedural tank setup to give the Agena stage the 265s burn time it\u0027s supposed to have. Historically this setup should be able to put a .7t satelite into GEO orbit. The satellite itself weighs in at 0.843t with it\u0027s own Bell 8247 engine and 16s worth of fuel. It also has a Communotron 16, two DTS-M1 and some solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch, I remain vertical until reaching 150m/s which puts this rocket at around 2500m asl.

I stay at 65 degrees and monitor the temperature of the SLV-3 tank until it\u0027s at just about 670C, at which point I jettison the boosters. This happens at about t\u002B1:43 at which point I\u0027m traveling at about 1km/s, am just over 30km and have an anticipated Apoapsis of over 65km. Once the boosters clear the remaining engine, I pitch over to 50 degrees which is where I stay for the next couple minutes. At about 90km asl, I activate the Agena antenna which should let me remain in contact with KSC to around 3.75Mm. At this point I pay close attention to my Apoapsis and vertical speed. Vertical speed has been dropping basically ever since I jettisoned the boosters but eventually it\u0027ll start climbing again as my horizontal speed picks up. Once my Apoapsis is around 120km (or if my vertical speed starts climbing), I\u0027ll start pitching over further.

Just before staging, I\u0027m on a suborbital trajectory with an Apoapsis a bit above 160km, a Periapsis showing as below -4Mm, a surface speed of around 4.5km/s and an orbital speed showing just over 5km/s. My Agena stage says its got 3835m/s dv available which should be enough to at least get me into orbit. Normally right after staging to the Agena, I\u0027ll also jettison the fairings I\u0027ve had covering my payload and will activate the antenna on it. I\u0027ll point one DTS at Kerbin and the other at Mission Control for now. Also, because of the pitching I\u0027ve been doing up till now, I\u0027m usually at around 10 degrees above the horizon which is pretty much were I leave the rocket pointed while the Agena stage burns through it\u0027s fuel. Only instead of running out of fuel, I encounter my first issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around t\u002B10:22 with the Agena antenna, Communotron16 and two DTS-M1 antenna all running, I suddenly lose my connection with mission control which shuts the Bell 8247 engine down. According to Mechjeb, I\u0027m about 1.5Mm from the runway and I\u0027m still just over 160km asl. Both of my omni antenna should still be well within range of mission control, plus I\u0027ve got a DTS pointing right at mission control. I suppose I could simply be out of LOS of mission control because of the curvature of the planet but if that\u0027s the case, how else am I supposed to get a comm satelite into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second problem is that when the Bell 8247 engine shuts down, Mechjeb reports that I have no more delta-v available in this stage even though I still have about half a tank of fuel. I\u0027m under the impression that the Bell 8247 can be restarted a few times but when I right click on the now shutdown engine, it say \u0022Ignitions: Hypergolic - 0/1\u0022.

After the shut off I\u0027m still in a sub-orbital trjectory with Apoapsis of just over 161km, Periapsis below -2Mm, surface speed of over 6km/s and orbital speed of around 6.6km/s. Supposedly the Atlas-Agena could put a 0.7t payload into GEO orbit and while my payload is actually 0.843t, 2000dv doesn\u0027t seem like nearly enough to get me near a circulized GEO orbit. If my comms weren\u0027t failing, would the 2000 dv from the Agena, plus the 1900dv from the satelite itself really be enough to not only finish putting me into orbit, but also to adjust my orbit up to around 36Mm?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felger","CreatedById":76828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T02:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is the right place for this post or not.

Pitch to 85 degrees as 100m/s then follow prograde, all the while monitoring the temperature of my atlas fuel tank. At t\u002B1:49 I\u0027ve slowly pitched over to around 65 degrees, I\u0027m at just around 39km with a surface speed of 1.1km/s and the Atlas SLV-3 says it\u0027s at 692C. At t\u002B1:51 I\u0027m just a tick beyond 65degrees at over 41km doing 1.15km/s and the Atlas SLV-3 has just hit 720C and exploded. I\u0027m using Deadly Reentry 6.4.0 set to normal mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Downloaded Deadly Reentry 6.5.2 Beta and reran my flight. Normal and \u0022Alternate Heading Model\u0022 selected (those are the defaults). Again, at 100m/s I pitch to 85 and then follow surface prograde. This time I was able to fly to t\u002B2:15 before jettisoning the boosters and even then, my tank is only at 264C which is much better. I\u0027m also at about 62 degree, 73km and doing about 1.9km/s. However, I only have about 3:10 of fuel left in the tank according to MechJeb. According to the wiki I\u0027m reading, the \u0022first stage\u0022 of the atlas-agena should be able to run for 5 minutes. I assumed that was 5 minutes after jettisoning the booster which means I\u0027ve lost 2 minutes somewhere. Is it actually saying 5 minutes from activation (which happens with the booster)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, at this point my Apoapsis is showing 230km which is higher then I think I want. Presumably it\u0027s okay to pitch over once my Apoapsis is about where I want it? Or should I be pitching a bit faster then I did for this set of tests?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: One last update. Went back to the VAB and reworked my payload so that it\u0027s 0.703t so it\u0027s only 0.4% above what the Atlas-Agena could put into GEO orbit. Figured I should rule out my payload weight being the issue. Still need at least 1000dV more then I have to reach GEO. So I went back into VAB and pulled the entire payload section. According to the wiki I\u0027ve been using, the Atlas-Agena weighs in at 155t. It\u0027s Booster stage should run for 134s, stage 1 should run for 5 minutes and stage 2 should run for 265s. I noticed that my 2nd stage can run 272s so it\u0027s a bit larger then it should be but my complete launch vehicle is only 128.4t. So I have to wonder, if I had another 26.6t of fuel in the Atlas stage, would that give me the dV I expect based on the wiki?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-13T21:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T21:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure these figures on Wikipedia are wrong, it says 1000 kg for LEO and 700 kg for GEO.

But when I finally took a look at the Atlas SLV-3A tank, I managed to get a vehicle weight that matched the wiki. So I\u0027m guessing that the wiki is based on values from all of the Atlas launch vehicles that are mentioned (LV-3, SLV-3, SLV-3A, SLV-3B and E/F) which explains some of the odd results. And probably explains why the wiki says 1000kg to LEO and 700kg to GEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my pitch rate, I have to run with SAS on so it\u0027s constantly trying to stop me from pitching over. I tried one flight without SAS going but it starts pitching AND yawing which results in my having to make constant corrections. Figure if I have to do that already, I might as well just control the pitching myself. I\u0027ll work on leading prograde a bit more. And not really sure why it stopped pitching during that first flight other than by that point I was out of the atmosphere by quite a ways. I did finally manage a couple of test flights with 180km periapsis (apoapsis anywhere between 2Mm-26Mm based on various factors in the flights) but I end up pitching pretty hard (40 degrees or so) just after I jettison the boosters to manage that. Just need more work on my gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait. I\u0027m supposed to shut the sustainer engine down? I\u0027ve been burning that till I\u0027m out of fuel and even then I have yet to actually manage to get into GTO, let alone GEO. I figured you burned the sustainer until the Atlas tank was dry, at which point you stage to the Agena. Keep in mind, I\u0027m not even making it to LEO on just the Atlas tank. I\u0027m running dry probably 1km/s shy of what I\u0027d need for LEO. If I shut the sustainer down and run just on the verneirs, I don\u0027t see how I\u0027ll do any better since the verneirs won\u0027t have enough thrust on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the circulization is also part of my issue. The few times I\u0027ve managed it to 180km periapsis, I\u0027ve basically burned the described gravity turn until my apoapsis is just above 180km, then I pitch over to 0 until I reach apoapsis. Once I hit apoapsis, I pitch back up just enough to keep my vertical speed near 0. I\u0027ll slowly pitch down again as I speed up, always trying to keep vertical speed at 0. When I finally run out of fuel on the Atlas and stage to the Agena, I continue that process but the Agena\u0027s lower thrust means I pitch up quite a bit (back to around 40). That\u0027ll slowly lower back down to 0 as I speed up, but maybe I\u0027m losing too much dV fighting gravity that way? I\u0027m guessing I\u0027d still have to fight gravity a bit if I initially aimed for 230km and let myself fall back to 180km while finishing the circulization process, but maybe less them I\u0027m doing now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it so weird, though.

It wasn\u0027t a great orbit (something like 140km x 1.8Mm) but still.
