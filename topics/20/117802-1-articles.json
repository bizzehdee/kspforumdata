The three types that are already there do the job, but they\u0027re outdated and bulky. I would kinda like some more LED type lights that pack more punch for their size. It would also be nice ta have lights that you can wrap around you vessel, like the external reaction wheels from spaceY. Perhaps you could change the color of the lights to create a unique look. \n\nI\u0027m shipping up some more lights for my station now in a container (using KIS and KAS mods), since it\u0027s a little dark. To get proper lighting on your station, you need many lights. I miss some low - profile lights that can illuminate a larger area. This could make a station look better. It would also decrease the part count for the station, meaning you could build a bigger station with less lag. \n\nIt would be great if other feel the same, and maybe someone who knows how to make it happen. I would do it myself, but I have don\u0027t have the know-how."},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:42:52Z","Content":"I dont know if they have been updated to 1.0.x (or if they even need to be) but there were several mods that add aviation lights, spot lights, general illumnation lights, ground tower lights, all sorts of lights!
