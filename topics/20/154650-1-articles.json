Hope everyone is doing great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was wondering if there was a way (with or without mods) to set-up a scheduled, recurrent task related to my vessel\u0027s equipment? I would like to start/stop my electrolysis unit recurrently in given time intervals\u00A0(would be great if the trigger could be the current amount of a certain resource though) - in this particular case, the electrolysis process uses a lot of EC and is performed\u00A0much faster than my current water-harvesting rate, hence only makes sense to turn it on, split all water \u0026amp; shut it down again - I would like to automate this process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTips and suggestions very much appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-07T17:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2017 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by hypervelocity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-07T18:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the problem is going to be that KSP doesn\u0027t actually track what\u0027s being produced and consumed in the background - it fakes it by doing a few big bunches as soon as you load the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you could use a mod to automate the control of starting/stopping the electrolysis unit (Smart Parts matches what you want there), but it\u0027d only work with the vessel in focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-07T21:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222913731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154650\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483812757\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DStaal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, DStaal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the problem is going to be that KSP doesn\u0027t actually track what\u0027s being produced and consumed in the background - it fakes it by doing a few big bunches as soon as you load the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you could use a mod to automate the control of starting/stopping the electrolysis unit (Smart Parts matches what you want there), but it\u0027d only work with the vessel in focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your reply Dstaal!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there was a workaround that issue, I am using the Background Processing mod which I believe fixes the problem!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-12T13:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe answer, of course, is\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61827-122-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system-v103-20161207/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthread can be closed, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
