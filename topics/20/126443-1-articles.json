It asked for my admin password, I did it, it showed a window with a progress bar for copying, completed, and closed, but did nothing. Same with everything else I tried, like highlighting both then right clicking and copying, or right clicking and copying/dragging one file at a time.

Which of the following statements best describes your problem?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. I know where to put the files but I am having trouble getting them there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. I can put files anywhere I want, but I don\u0026#39;t know where to put them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. I think I\u0026#39;m putting all the right files where they need to go but when I run the game nothing happens.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s what a typical mod installation looks like. Let\u0026#39;s say you want to install the Foobar mod and have just downloaded Foobar-1.0.zip. Installing would typically look something like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Open the zip file and navigate inside it to find a GameData folder. That folder in the zip contains various stuff. It might just be a Foobar folder, or it might also include other things like a ModuleManager dll.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Go to your KSP installation and find the GameData folder. It contains a folder Squad wih all the stock stuff, and also other folders if you have any mods already installed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Drag the contents of the GameData folder from the zip file into the GameData folder of your KSP installation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich of the above steps is causing difficulty?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T16:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T16:33:41Z","Content":"\nTry moving your KSP install out of Program Files, that\u0026#39;s what\u0026#39;s requiring the elevated privileges.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, moving this over to General Add-on Affairs.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T16:59:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECannot into spelling.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T16:56:52Z","Content":"\nThanks Crown.
