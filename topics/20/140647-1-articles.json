I\u0027m stuck on the first part - creating a copy of Gilly that\u0027s tiny! I know MM syntax but nothing\u0027s working! I\u0027m trying to copy Gilly, put it in orbit between Dres and Jool, call it \u0027A Speck of Dust\u0027,\u00A0and then plop a pair of planets orbiting it. It\u0027s really just a reference point and a cool place to visit. If anyone knows how to duplicate planets, PLEASE tell me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
