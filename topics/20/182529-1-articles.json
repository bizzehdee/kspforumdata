You might want to try several of them out and see what you find most fitting to the style in question.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it doesn\u0027t have to look exactly like in The Expanse, you\u0027ll probably be fine with the current BDAc:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022PDCs\u0022 could be replicated with any pop-out turrets with half-spherical coverage or better turret traverse.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMissiles and torpedoes might require a custom firing tube to suit the ship, but might not behave as well as you\u0027d expect when fired in space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe railguns are beyond me; I\u0027ve never seen or sought them out. I\u0027d settle for some high-powered cannonry attached to the hull. Technically, it\u0027s still a kinetic impactor... it just wouldn\u0027t have comparable velocity to a rail gun. High-explosives might help equate to the damage done by a rail gun, however, only a much lesser penetrative force against targets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI finished season 3 of the show just moments ago and I\u0027m inspired to build ships of similar style as well.

Unfortunately im not much of a builder, aesthetically speaking. I mostly just wanted it for the feel that combat in the expanse gives.
