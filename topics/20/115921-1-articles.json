You decide which shape your probe is to have (square, hexagonal, piano-shaped, you name it), and you decide how wide and tall it should be from the context menu. The top and bottom panel would then be usable for surface attatchment for science parts, fuel/RCS tanks, etc.\n\nThis is a quick mockup of what I have in mind:\n\n![XzcBeJ1.png](http://i.imgur.com/XzcBeJ1.png)\n\n1. You choose the shape (in this mockup, hexagonal) and size (width)\n\n2. You choose how far apart the top and bottom should be (and optionally the contents of the tube, RCS or fuel)\n\n3. You choose if you want to cover the sides with \u0022thermal blankets\u0022. In the drawing I only covered three sides for clarity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T21:58:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by makkz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mysterion","CreatedById":146240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T21:37:02Z","Content":"That sounds like a good idea.

Maybe even a probe core wedge.\n\nI also really liked the schematic, even though you only provided it as an example of what would be possible if the full proposal could be implemented.\n\nSo until someone comes up with a way to do that, I recommended the design idea as an addition to Dr. Jet\u0027s Chop Shop."},{"CreatedByName":"Mysterion","CreatedById":146240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T10:12:39Z","Content":"I think that the probes should have built-in cargo doors of sorts, depending on their size.
