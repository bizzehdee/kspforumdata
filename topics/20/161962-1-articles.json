So I currently disable friction before starting my takeoff roll. But while there is an action group assignment for wheels that lets me disable friction, it doesn\u0027t remember that I have it set to 0. So, when I load the craft I disable auto-friction and set the friction to 0. Then I re-enable auto-friction and go about taxiing. Then I get to the runway and toggle off friction but the tweakable has been set back to 1. Unless I\u0027m using it wrong, it seems kind of pointless to have an action to toggle friction when it doesn\u0027t actually let you switch between friction settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T17:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022103177\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Drew Kerman\u003C/a\u003E, big fan of KSA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have an answer to your question, but perhaps a workaround. Even though they\u0027ve improved much in the last releases, I\u0027ve pretty much given up on the stock gear because I could never figure out what the adjustments were supposed to do, and I would always end up sliding all over the place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found that the Adjustable Landing Gear from the Kerbal Foundries mod behave much more like I expect. I\u0027ve started to reconfigure the gear from that\u00A0 mod to look and work like fixed gear. I remove the steering and motor modules in the config and change the strut and wheel rotation limits to allow for the struts to be angled 45-60 degrees so they stick out like the stock fixed gear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimitations are that the gear are still retractable so I have remember remove it from the action group or at least not to hit \u0022G\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the gear bays are still visible so you have to clip them to hide them, but this may be adjustable in the config too, but I haven\u0027t gotten that far yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T01:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks. I am still considering the move over to KF with future aircraft, even though I do very much like the look of the stock gear. Even if I can\u0027t get the fixed gear to cooperate I don\u0027t really need to use them when I actually fly if I don\u0027t want to, but since I managed to get to a point where I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E use them was just wondering if I could make doing so a little easier and along the way see if anyone else had similar complaints about the behavior of the friction toggle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
