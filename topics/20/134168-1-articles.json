Well, more specifically star tracking as that takes both stars and some optical sensors. Better yet the ability to lock on planet terminators as well but I guess even some predefined \u0022stars\u0022 (not even visible) that have constant position would do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do I need it for - I\u0027d like to maybe try some automated craft control, you know, without the ability to see the perfect orbital paths in advance so that each maneuver is pretty much perfect to 0.1m/s. I was thinking the KOS scripter would handle the calculations and control, I just need some points of reference in space. Kerbol is one but I need at least another one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, inerplanet navigation, how hard can that be to code \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T15:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo moves very little it could almost be static but you can also account for its orbit in your code\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T04:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod question moved to the mod subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T19:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm this gave me an idea.
