These bugs are not easily identifiable, and crash logs are pretty obscure for normal people.\n\nHere\u0027s my idea: a script/mod inside or outside KSP that you run after each crash. It grabs the latest crash log and records it and the mods installed to database.\n\n- It records the log file (and maybe even the crash exception error message), and correlates it with mods installed.\n- It sends the record of to the aggregation server.\n- On the aggregation server, we can use filtering to figure out which mod is causing what kind of crash, and log output of those crashes.\n\nI obviously haven\u0027t fleshed this out, but I\u0027m wondering if there is community interest to talk about a project like this one and have a discussion about whether such a system can be technically feasible at all. Obviously, parsing KSP\u0027s log is kinda prohibitive and I\u0027m not sure if it even logs the error when the application crashes, and from what i see, the Unity error msgs to the Mac OSX console is not saying much.\n\n-Xrave\n\nEdit:\n\nEven frequency of crash can be a indicator (say you don\u0027t install A, and you crash after ~90 minutes, and after installing A your crash frequency went up to once per 30 minutes)\n\nAlthough, for me personally, i think i might just be running out of memory. \\*hmm\\*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T22:03:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xrave**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:50:29Z","Content":"Crashes to desktop are 99.999999% of the time from running out of memory. It\u0027s not that mod A or mod B or C or D is a problem, but just the fact that you have A and B and C and D installed and you\u0027re using up all your RAM. The more mods you have installed, the quicker you\u0027ll run out of memory.\n\nWhen a mod has a bug, it normally only takes out itself, or does something ridiculous (ship explodes, planet disappears, instantly accelerated to speed of light, etc). A bug in a mod will almost never causes a crash to desktop.\n\nCurrently the major memory leak in the game is the overheating gauges; if you turn those off you\u0027ll have a lot less crashes. This is slated to be fixed in KSP 1.0.3, which last I heard was about 2 weeks away."},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T09:52:28Z","Content":"I have a great suspicion that out-of-memories tend to cause some of your mods to log a NullPointerException before crash. You remove them and next time goes the next one. So it is possibly not so simple and you should look at error.log and memory amounts every time you got crash and NullPointer at the end of your output\\_log.txt.\n\nI\u0027m not sure, but it is very likely to be true."}]}
