It\u0027s based on Greg\u0027s Alien Space Program mods (which are amazing) and it looks like I\u0027ve got everything right to convert Kerbin to Minmus but it never works! I\u0027ve quadruple checked the code and compared it to all three existing alien space program mods. Now, I\u0027m turning to the ksp/logs/kopernicus/____.logs and I have no idea how to read most of them. I know it failed to load \u0022Kerbin\u0022 (supposed to be Minmus) and just appeared as Kerbin. Does anyone know how to read the rest of a log?
