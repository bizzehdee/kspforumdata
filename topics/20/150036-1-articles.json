I considered playing stock KSP and even went so far as to making a thread asking how to easily get the game back to vanilla. Ultimately, I just\u00A0decided against it and went and played something else. I did not realize it right away,\u00A0but going off to play another game instead of stock KSP caused me to gain a greater appreciation for how much better KSP becomes, for me,\u00A0when mods are added into the mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit that over time, once all the mods are installed and working, it becomes easy to forget how integral to my enjoyment of KSP they are. As a result, I find myself frustrated when mods are not instantly updated and ready to go for the newest version of KSP. But after some maturity of thought, realizing that the mods I use now are what make me want to continue playing\u00A0KSP renew my appreciation for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to say thank you to the modding community in general and for all the development you folks do for your mods. Whether it\u0027s quality of life mods, mods that add features, mods that add parts, and so on...I am confident I can safely speak for many in the community when I say I appreciate the hard work you put in, usually on a voluntary basis, to make KSP more enjoyable for others (and hopefully yourselves).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s to many days going forward of the KSP mod community continuing to thrive!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-14T23:15:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2016 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bandus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T23:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks all of you wonderful modders for your hard work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T15:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHear hear!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe love you folks, and what you do..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay the road rise up to meet you.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMay the wind always be at your back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMay the sun shine warm upon your face,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand rains fall soft upon your fields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
