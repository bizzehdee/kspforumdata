An example of balance would be: 1 day without power (in any module, command pod, lander can, or habitat) equals Kerbal death (or MIA, or USI-LS tourist mode), 1 week without a adequately powered habitat module would equal the same fate. The habitat modules act as long term life support and living space for Kerbals, if you want to get into the imaginary details one could say that the units break down Kerbal Krap, hair, and skin cells into their base atoms and reassemble them into tasty hot chicken wings and sauerkraut pierogis. The overall benefit is that it would simply add an element of LS along with the idea of a proper living space for our intrepid Kerbonauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of possible units:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.25m- single and double habitats (inline and/or radial attachable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.5m- 3 and 4 kerbal habitats (hitch-hiker can can be used for the 4 kerbal unit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus 3.75m- 6 kerbal habitat\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo 3, maybe 4 new units \u002B the coding end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a bit of Blender experience (but am a bit rusty, it\u0027s been a few years), and if anyone with some modding chops thinks this is a cool idea and wants to give it a shot I can chip in with modelling and texturing, but I\u0027ll need some initial guidance on the technical requirements (poly counts/mesh standards, UV layouts, etc.) at first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-25T17:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Waxing_Kibbous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T14:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectricity has never been a concern for me, never really ran out unless using KSPI/NFProp, but shutting down the engine and having a small solar panel somewhere always gets you back up and running in a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you run out of electricity, you will be stranded, and thus will run out of other LifeSupport resources as you can no longer recycle them.
