Looking back at it, I was never 100% satisfied with the parts I had available, and am considering making some more just for this purpose. I\u0027m thinking of at least a 0.625m cockpit, fuselage, main body that has wings incorporated, and hard points for either a single or dual engines. Probably in-layed spaces for a .625 fusion reactors. I don\u0027t think they will end up looking very stock like, except for the textures. Kinda thinking something along the lines of an F35 meets a Romulan Warbird, possibly a couple different variants consisting of a 100% non atmospheric version which instead of wings will have weapon pylons, and no air intakes. My skills in blender leave some room for growth, and my free time is a bit flooded with real life adventures, but I have been looking for something I can contribute to lately, and I know several people that can help with a lot of the technical hurdles ill come up against along the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does everyone think? Any interest? I might get some time in the next few days to pencil a sketch together to show more of what I am aiming at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T09:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a nice idea, despite the small cockpit need a better \u0022kerbal cruncher\u0022 (as players seems not very mad about this huge inaccuracy of former C7\u0027s parts) or be unkerballed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like building small probe plane with some of my mods (especially low profile misc engines, which have a 0.625 ultra efficiency Xenon powered engine, which is great with just 2 tanks \u002B the simple wings I\u0027ve made for the wings tutorial, they are small and also generate lot\u0027s of lift).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERLA stockalike mod also include small parts (there are many engines but I never tried them yet).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T09:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen thinking a lot about the cockpit designs, and was thinking of something similar to an a-10 design for the space only variant.
