The main reason that I started looking into making my own custom parts was that I wanted to retexture a part that I had downloaded, but had no clue how to go about editing a .mbm file (I\u0027ve seen the tutorial, but it frankly confused the heck out of me). What I was looking for was a way to have a consistant color scheme for the rockets I was building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making my new part, I found that when using PartTools in Unity to export my part, I had the option to export the texture in .png format instead of .mbm. This allows me (or anyone else) to change the color scheme of the piece any time I want to fire up photoshop. Personally, I like the idea of people being able to add their own personal touches to a part that I\u0027ve put out, and to this end I\u0027ve included the UV templates along with the download to make this easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this: Is there any particular benefit to using the .mbm file format that outweighs this convenience?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
