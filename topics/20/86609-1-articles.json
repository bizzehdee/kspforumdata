I\u0027ve played vanilla KSP for a little bit now, but I\u0027m more interested in converting it over to a realistic solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this has been addressed already. I\u0027ve done searches, but have only found vague, passing references to PlanetFactory (which I\u0027m not even sure works with the latest KSP update).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027ve downloaded Real Solar System, and have three main questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Is it possible to add rings to Saturn (and Uranus)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Is it possible to add Neptune, or at least replace Pluto with Neptune (proper orbit, and all)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Is it possible to add opaque atmospheres to Venus and Titan? (currently you can see the surface from space, which of course isn\u0027t accurate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI greatly appreciate the help! I have other questions, but I think I\u0027ll save those for later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T04:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of those things are possible!
