Is there a mod that adds trees on Kerbin? I know there are some in certain places but most of the entire planet is bereft of any type of vegetation and it makes my kerbal extremely uncomfortable. Seems a simple mod to add trees would alleviate their angst. Thanks for any tips!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-30T21:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending upon the biome you\u0027re landing in or flying over, trees already are present.
