Is there anyone who would be willing to create a mod that would allow a person to see a list of all the Kerbals that are part of the crew, their profession, location and the ability to have them EVA or transfer to another compartment. I know Kerbal Crew Manifest does some of this, but I think it may have more features than I need, and may not have the basic feature I\u0027m looking for.\n\nA quick mock up looks like this:\n\nJebediah Kerman Pilot Mk 1-2 Command Module [EVA] [TRANSFER]\n\nBill Kerman Engineer Mk 2 Lander Can [EVA] [TRANSFER]\n\nBob Kerman Scientist Mobile Processing Lab [EVA] [TRANSFER]\n\nI\u0027m not even that hung up on the transfer button as I could do that by clicking on the appropriate crew door once I locate the Kerbal I\u0027m looking for.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:40:17Z","Content":"I\u0027d really like to just have the profession and level show up on the crew portraits, and right-click menus when on EVA."},{"CreatedByName":"timmers_uk","CreatedById":97413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:14:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d really like to just have the profession and level show up on the crew portraits, and right-click menus when on EVA.\n\nI was caught out by this earlier today on my career game, and ended up making use of the fact that KIS shows the profession in its inventory window for a crew member.\n\nInterestingly I was just looking to see if I can add the profession or the profession icon (ooh, pretty icon) to KeepFit, and noticed looking through the API that there\u0027s a lot of interesting stuff now inside ProtoCrewMember for someone to provide access to, as I\u0027m not sure the stock UI shows it anywhere that I\u0027ve noticed.\n\nedit to add : boo - looks like none of the ExperienceTrait configs have an icon set.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T17:18:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by timmers\\_uk**"},{"CreatedByName":"DDay2021","CreatedById":136105,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:37:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d really like to just have the profession and level show up on the crew portraits, and right-click menus when on EVA.\n\nThat would work for me.
