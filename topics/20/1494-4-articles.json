This space station would just be less cool, you could do less things with it, and since most people are able to assemble it in orbit it will not fully satisfy those needs. A second, more-difficult version could feature enticing incentives in the form of cooler functions, cooler design, and you\u0027ll be part of the minority rather than majority. Granted, in my head I\u0027m imagining the types of space stations that you could walk around in. As I said, more long-term!

There were two really big problems with the Earth Orbit Rendezvous concept that nobody really wanted to acknowledge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) How in hell do you have a pilot in an Apollo command module at the top of the stack land something as tall as an Apollo CSM with S-IVB descent stage on the lunar surface, when he can\u0027t see a damned thing below him because the whole descent stage is in the way? (Seriously, the Direct Ascent/EOR options basically used an S-IVB as a descent stage for landing the whole Apollo CSM on the moon, then would use the SM engine to lift off, leaving the descent stage behind.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Once you figure out how the hell you\u0027re going to land this beast, how in hell do you get to the surface for your EVA, then get back up to the command module for departure? Rope ladders were tested and quickly proven infeasible for a man in an EVA suit (\u0027Did you see Ed White swing around like Tarzan yesterday?\u0027), so you\u0027ll need some form of fixed ladder starting at the command module and stretching all the way down the service module and descent stage, then down the lander leg. Will it be feasible for a man in a pressure suit to climb the whole distance down? How about up, when he\u0027s tired out after a six-hour EVA? What will the ladder do to the weight? How about drag during boost, is that going to be a problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, with the dedicated lander, was definitely the way to go, even if you used a combination EOR/LOR setup akin to the plans for Constellation, where you use multiple launches to put the vehicle up into Earth orbit, then use an LOR setup once you get to the moon. Indeed, I\u0027ve yet to see any post-Apollo manned planetary mission proposal *not* use a separate lander instead of trying to land the whole vehicle, except for \u0027one-way\u0027 proposals where the plan was to send everything needed to establish a permanent colony and not bring the crew back to Earth...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbalkicker","CreatedById":7684,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-31T15:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll true, but I was more referring to if they had assembled the lunar mission in earth orbit instead of lobbing it all off of the ground in 1 go, there would have been no need for the obscenely powerful first stage of the apollo rocket. It would have simplified the whole rocket design, and drastically reduced the importance of trimming weight (which is expensive as hell). I dimly remember some statistic that was something like every additional pound added to the CM/lander stuff up top required an additional 300 pounds of propellant (or maybe it was 300 lbs of thrust) in the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would have required developing the ability to do actual engineering-type work in space, which would have set us back a few years.

He saw the moon mission as a stepping stone to bigger and greater missions, and eventually having people live permanently in space. NASA saw the moon mission as an e-peen contest with the Russians. Thus, developing the ability to assemble big rockets in space, and having an orbital facility with the capability to do this, looked like a waste of time from the perspective of \u0027get to the moon first\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, part of my lobbying for the in-game ability to put rockets together in kearth orbit is, to some degree, to pay homage to Von Braun\u0027s idea of doing space exploration the *right* way.
