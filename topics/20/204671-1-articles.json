Has it happened to someone else that when installing Raster Prop Monitor, the Hullcam VDS cameras do not load in the game, and all the ships that include these parts disappear? It happens that only the basic camera \u0022Basic Hull Camera Deluxe\u0022 remains in the game, all the others, such as the night vision, the booster cam and any other disappear, they are no longer loaded in the database.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know if it is a compatibility issue? I installed Hullcameras with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E but RPM put it in manually, and it worked like a charm until I noticed the parts were missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
