Now, before you geeks start, yes, I know that a wing in real life will produce lift seemingly no matter what because of the shape, but the wings in KSP are the equivalent to planks of wood... which is why I (along with many others) like to use them as a structural part. But if you build an atmo craft out of wings (in this game) the CoL is out of place and, unless you get really lucky, this will cause it to flip, tumble, and crash. For example, here is an A-Wing Interceptor I\u0027m working on:\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jj7fORj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jj7fORj.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s certainly not the best, but the point is that because it\u0027s made out of wings, it always flips, so are there any mods that allow you to fix this? And I don\u0027t like to use part mods, so no procedural parts mod please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
