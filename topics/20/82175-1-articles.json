Anyone else having issue recovering vessels? When I hit the recover button, no bonuses are rewarded and the vehicle does not recover. Even quiting and reloading the game does not work. I know that having mods and running x64, things get buggy, so Im in no way mad or anything, just curious if anyone else is having similar issues and if anyone may know a fix.
