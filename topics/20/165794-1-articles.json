I have no idea what your skill level is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that would be all that easy to accomplish. \u00A0It\u0027s doable but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery part has a texture that starts out as a bitmap, or a png or jpg. \u00A0Those textures are 2D and represent all of the polygons in the model flattened out. \u00A0It\u0027s commonly called the unwrap. \u00A0When a part is unwrapped and the texture is created, the person who creates the unwrap decides where all those\u00A0flattened parts and pieces go. That means, all textures\u00A0are\u00A0all very, very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only what I know of to change the way a part looks (adding scorch marks)\u00A0is to change the actual texture. \u00A0And because you\u0027re suggesting a progressive increase, it would mean that there would need to be a new texture applied with each increase or at the very least an additional overlay texture. \u00A0 So, the first problem, you\u0027d need to swap in and out multiple textures for one part or fade one in and out. \u00A0That means more memory to hold those extra textures. \u00A0Next, all of those textures would have to be hand drawn. It\u0027s not something you could simply apply to a part (that I know of) because even though you know where the front is on a 3D part, there\u0027s no way programatically to find the front on a 2D texture. \u00A0It could be anywhere and at any angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that means, you\u0027d have to get every single modder to create multiple textures for all of their parts so that they could get scorched. \u00A0You\u0027re lucky you get ANY texture with my parts. \u00A0I\u0027m a minimalist and I likes white. \u00A0And if you look at Lack\u0027s LLL parts pack, you\u0027ll think I\u0027m Picasso (no offense I love LLL parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoooo... can it be done? \u00A0Yes. \u00A0Is anyone gonna do it?

Or for that matter, which way was the part turned? \u00A0Vertical? \u00A0Horizontal? \u00A0Maybe it was sticking out the side at a 45 degree angle?\u00A0Imagine for a moment you\u0027re blind and someone hands you a square painting and tells you to turn it right side up. \u00A0Trying to apply scorch marks to a texture and all you know about it is it\u0027s size \u00A0would be very much like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, unless there\u0027s some technique that alludes me, and there very well may be, applying the \u003Cu\u003Erealistic\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0distress the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
