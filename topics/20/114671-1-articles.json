You end up with super powerful Tiny Rockets, and relatively weak Massive Rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T00:55:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dres**"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T15:15:55Z","Content":"Since there doesn\u0027t seem to be any such mod currently available, I would like to change this into a request.\n\nPretty please, anyone? \\*puppy eyes\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Borogove","CreatedById":8752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T01:05:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking about implementing this as a command line program that would just generate the engine part according to your specs. Could easily support stock monoprop, biprop, and NTR, plus some basic realfuels options (kerolox, hydrolox, UDMH/NTO). \n\nYou\u0027d choose fuel type, vac thrust, and sea level or vac optimization, and it would determine size, weight, cost, etc from that and build the part with its config file. Sound useful?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:38:16Z","Content":"To make a more gamey suggestion, consider the following options to tweak (without getting into combustion cycles, etc):\n\nBell: Varies shape depending on what it\u0027s optimized for.

The three important values are combustion chamber volume, nozzle throat area (at the top of the bell), and nozzle exit area. The ratio of chamber volume to throat area is fixed, and depends on what fuel mixture you are using - increasing thrust means scaling up the chamber volume and throat proportionally. The ratio of throat area to exit area determines the efficiency at a chosen ambient pressure - usually between 1 atm (sea level), and 0 atm (vac). The shape (curve) of the bell is pretty much always the same, and it is made that way to balance out mach shock waves in the propellant flow.\n\nI would say tweakable options should be fuel (determines alot of stuff, including throat area for a given chamber volume), thrust (makes chamber bigger), and expansion ratio (makes the bell bigger). Also combustion and cooling cycles would be super awesome, there should at the very least be pressure fed vs. gas generator turbopump fed."},{"CreatedByName":"Chrozayis","CreatedById":146976,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:55:22Z","Content":"I have thought about doing this, unfortunately my experience is with Java not C# or whatever KSP mods are written in, it would be a huge project and I think you you might need an external editor to generate models if you wanted the engine to be in one piece, however somebody could also make tweakable stackable combustion chambers, pumps and bells, that might actually work pretty well."},{"CreatedByName":"hanhan658","CreatedById":157273,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T13:53:02Z","Content":"After i read this topic a few days ago i am working on \u0027\u0027Procedural LF Engines\u0027\u0027 mod that is surface attachable, it doesnt require nodes.
