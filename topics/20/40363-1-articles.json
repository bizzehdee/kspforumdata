The kerbal could take a fuel line from one ship to the other ship and fuel the other ship up. I dont remember the name of the plugin nor have I been able to find it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know where it is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T23:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS adds winches and fuel lines, and Quantum Fuel Transfer adds blue \u0022lasers\u0022 which you can connect and transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T01:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heartily recommend KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T12:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS(Kerbal Attachment System) is, indeed, what you are looking for. That has the physical connectors and hoses that you have to EVA and drag around to connect things. It\u0027s also useful for a lot more than fuel transfer, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also recommend TAC Fuel Balancer to go with it. It makes it 100x easier to transfer resources around because you can transfer into, and out of, multiple tanks automatically and simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
