This is backwards from what most people want, but I am working out some configs for some very powerful engines that use insane amounts of energy, and I want to control energy output based on throttle percentage to conserve resources. Basically I would start and stop different modules within an edited config that change energy output, or start and stop different reactors that have different output rates. I can find no mod that works this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T18:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could roll your own thing in kOS, it would appear to have all the tools you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NotCoach","CreatedById":91874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T18:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure it does.
