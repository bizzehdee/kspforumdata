I found the setting in KAC to do this, but KCT, contracts, and (assuming, as I haven\u0027t ventured far from LEO yet) maneuver node estimated times are in Kerbin days, not Earth days. I didn\u0027t see any settings in KCT to change the calendar type like in KAC, nor could I find anything to make sure contracts and travel times are using the same calendar. Also, I haven\u0027t done much in the way of crewed missions yet, but I\u0027m assuming I\u0027ll need to make TAC-LS report times to me in Earth time too. Is there a cfg I need to edit to do this? The main thing is getting KCT to report times to me in Earth days, as well as contract expiration dates. If I make alarms in KAC to do it, it reports them correctly, but I hate having my alarm queue that cluttered as I like to mainly use it for transfer windows and, when I get far enough, SOI changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion 2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed a lot of parts in the mods I\u0027ve added don\u0027t have are labeled \u0027non-RP-0\u0027. I\u0027ve been making notes of these parts and manually pruning them as I discover them in the tech tree. Is there an easier way (ie a script) that will just look through all the parts folders and prune anything that\u0027s non-RP-0?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh! and bonus question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I\u0027m getting used to MJ, is there any reason I can\u0027t use KER for readouts? I really prefer their HUD displays over the semi-transparent windows in MJ.

That\u0027s good info, thanks. The issue you used as an example gives me the idea that KER may not calculate dV stats correctly? Is it safe/accurate to use for basic info like orbital readouts (ap, pe, inclination, etc), relative orbit info for rendezvous, real-time vessel stats (TWR, G forces, burn times)? I guess I can live with one or two MJ windows open (I\u0027ve grown quite fond of Smart A.S.S.) as long as I can still rely on KER for some of the basic stuff that I like to have open at all times with the far less intrusive HUD readouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T23:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital readouts from KER will be correct, but delta V if you depend on surface-attachment (i.e. srf-attach a proc part to another proc part, and both contain propellants your engine uses) will not be correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding 2, that\u0027s very simple then!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReplace your existing RP-0/NonRP0.cfg file with this one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/raw/master/GameData/RP-0/NonRP0.cfg\u0022 ipsnoembed=\u0022true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/raw/master/GameData/RP-0/NonRP0.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen create a folder in KSP/GameData\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncall the folder NoNonRP0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstart the game, and magically the parts are hidden!
