I tried making that same exact design some time ago, but was not successful. I think the problem lies in slinging around the engines, moving all that mass, with the thrust vectors changing drastically. Ultimately, I could never get the blades to spin fast enough, and the very small amount of lift I did get, was due to the engines being angled toward the ground.
