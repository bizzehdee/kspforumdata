I\u0027ve been looking for something like a PAPI or a T-VASIS that can be installed near the runways on Kerbin to help with my problem of overshooting runways. I\u0027ve tried making something in game, but I\u0027ve had problems with the way the stock light parts work and the scale that needs to be used to be useful."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T21:16:47Z","Content":"There is a [PAPI mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/41435-0-23-Runway-PAPI-array-Version-0-3-2) - the models are just big glowing disks but they still work.

Personally I found the PAPI mod a little bit difficult to see, NavUtilities is more like a cockpit instrument. The pink triangles on the left and right side indicate the direction of the glide slope in relation to you. The white horizontal line represents the plane. So if you are on the glide slope, the pink markers will be on the line."},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T07:40:14Z","Content":"I use a flag planted few meters before the head of the runway. Set it as target and you can see on the navball if you are aligned and the glideslope you have to keep."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T08:16:19Z","Content":"I used to use a flag at the runway ends, and got fed up with not being able to see the runway through the flag brackets ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). I used to drop rovers at suitable marker points in line with the runway but now I just use the island airfield as a turn to finals, and could probably not bother with NavUtils by now.\n\nPictures worth a thousand words etc - here\u0027s both mods and me ignoring both the GSI and PAPI...\n\n![rdLpAh2.png](http://i.imgur.com/rdLpAh2.png)"}]}
