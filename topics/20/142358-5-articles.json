Please let me know otherwise.\u00A0Not going to quote you. No point in repeating the whole thing. In short. Your right in general but the basic analogy you using above is slightly wrong. I do however like it overall. The outcome of your analysis is none the less mostly correct I think. Although I suspect in will be lost in translation for some.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no distribution here. It is a metadata index. Basically a list of download links. So it is better to think of it as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Content creator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Index system (Which is crowd sourced information and usually not related in any way to the content creator\u00A0).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Content Consumers. ( which are in fact at best bug testers that might help group 1. Or can be safely ignored.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you whole point is aimed at 2. Honestly in terms of actual volume of mods and downloads. This whole debate is really a storm in a tea cup in the grand scheme of things. It is actually about how direct problem traffic away from group 1 and 3. However the tricky thing those groups will not help. Or rather should not\u00A0be expected to help.\u00A0There are mostly not even aware there is any problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the main point. Group 1. Simply does not care at all about group 2. It is all irrelevant to them. There is no process to improve here from their point of view. They\u00A0are\u00A0not interested. Creating content is fun. Whist doing the indexing is not fun. In fact until recently there was still few individual\u00A0mod authors packaging slightly outdated copies of module manager in manual downloads. Why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion checking is a group 3 job. That is what\u00A0best bug testers are for and\u00A0module manager is just another mod to manage. Version checking outside\u00A0of owned mods\u00A0has\u00A0nothing to do with the content creators\u00A0really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes there is a slightly\u00A0broken process in regards to managing the\u00A0input and verification of indexing data for group 2. If you know how things work socially everything is all ok. Stuff gets fixed. If people come into the forums and direct wrath at a\u00A0content creator instead. Bad stuff happens.

Where there was no update required by the vast number of modders. The first was in release KSP 1.0.4 (Sometimes it really is minor update). Fixed by global acceptance of 1.0.3 mods as compatible.
