I for one would not relish the job of just keeping up with the updates to even a couple of popular packed mods never mind a complete pack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your modded install isn\u0027t working, the first thing to try is updating all of your mods and removing any mods that haven\u0027t been updated for the new version of KSP.

It\u0027s also a good idea to bookmark all the threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs SpannerMonkey said, mod packs have been suggested numerous times. For KSP, they\u0027re really not necessary because mods are relatively easy to install and mostly compatible with each other. Also, it\u0027s difficult to create modpacks for KSP because licenses are required and enforced \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 anyone creating a mod pack would need to ensure that each license permitted redistribution, and they would need to provide support for those mods independently of the original authors. The closest to mod packs we get are mod lists like Realism Overhaul or Astronomer\u0027s Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having problems keeping up with mod development you might want to bookmark \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u003C/a\u003E.

Different people like different things, in many cases wildly different things; MechJeb is probably among the 2 or 3 most used mods (certainly, I\u0027d be surprised if it were anywhere below 5), and yet many of those who don\u0027t use it rather strongly dislike it and wouldn\u0027t want any mod package including it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure licensing is as big an issue as it might seem; while CC licenses with SA, ND, or NC terms, and the GPL, impose restrictions on derivatives, it\u0027s not clear a modpack would fall under those terms, because neither license considers distributing a bunch of separate unmodified things as a single group (e.g. as one download, on the same CD, etc.) to trigger copyleft clauses or the ND clause. But there are some mods under non-CC/GPL/BSD/MIT/other free licenses, which don\u0027t allow redistribution \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-11T19:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2014 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedHell","CreatedById":118609,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T20:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks for the feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the following info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t use x64 because its too slow, even at lowest grpahic settings, don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t know why...
