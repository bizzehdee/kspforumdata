They have their place, but the reason why I am asking for this mod, is because wing surfaces come in various shapes giving us more freedom of design. More importantly, they are white and match well with the white color scheme KSP already has. To make the ugly grey structural panels usable in this method, you would have make angular panels, and such. Why make more content and more parts, when we already have these parts serving as wings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to request a mod that allows us to be able to turn off wing lift in the VAB/SPH, making the aero treat the wing as it would a structural plate. I also considered asking for this mod to somehow change the texture of the wing to indicate that it serves as a panel and not a wing, but I do not want to mess with the aesthetic and I think it would be ok to leave the texture as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR - Toggle wing lift so we can use them as non-ugly structural panels because of KSP\u0027s broken aero.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T09:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T14:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis request for a mod has been moved to General Add-on Affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T08:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know of anything that can toggle lift.
