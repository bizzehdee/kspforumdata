I\u0027m using 2.0.9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried having it bring down a lander on Duna and it did some wacky burn that popped it up to 250km using a dumb normal burn and then brought the craft down. I started at a 75km x 75km orbit. Fortunately the lander had so much fuel that it didn\u0027t run out until 1000m from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrice today I\u0027ve brought down some craft manually on Duna, because of the idiocy above, and during the descent decided to hit \u0022retro\u0022 on the SASS to help kill my horizontal velocity. All three times MechJeb sent my landers into uncontrollable spins. In fact, it was almost as if the craft lost all control after doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen some other dumb behavior before when landing on the Mun. I hit \u0022retro\u0022 on the SASS during a gentle burn and MechJeb stops following the retrograde indicator after it passes 45~60 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut in space it works great; set up a node and execute, does it perfectly, no problems. Any time it gets near a planet it goes complete retard. I suppose this is all fine and well because the new KSP SAS is pretty much garbage for holding a precise heading but is brilliant for docking and airplanes, and at least isn\u0027t idiotic for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torminator","CreatedById":78617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T04:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only problems I\u0027ve had is when using retrograde for landings, if I get a little too cautious and my Vspeed goes above zero, retrograde obviously flips around and MJ has a heart attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, There\u0027s a difference between surface retro and orbital retro.
