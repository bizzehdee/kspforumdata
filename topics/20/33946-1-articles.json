So let me just make sure though I understand this correctly, the TMA acts as a transport for crew memebers to and from the ISS? The Soyuz U is the launch rocket that carries the TMA and Progress Modules? And Progress takes supplies to the ISS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asmi","CreatedById":59068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T14:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent version of Soyuz spacecraft is TMA-M (a.k.a. \u0022Digital Soyuz\u0022). It is currently being carried to orbit atop Soyuz-FG rocket, which is basically Soyuz-U with some modifications for man-rating (primarily aimed at reducing max acceleration to 4g, while Soyuz-U is rated up to 6g if my memory serves me well). As for Progress, current version is Progress-M-M, also \u0022digital\u0022. Basically \u0022digital\u0022 upgrade removed all analogue control loops and replaced them with digital ones, upgrade also included more advanced main computers, which allowed performing fully autonomous burns while in LOS (Loss-of-Signal, so no comm with the MCC). This was required to allow for currently used fast 4-orbit rendezvous profile, that allows spacecraft to reach ISS in less than 6 hours instead of ~2 days-long profile that was used before that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T16:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh thank you guys for clearing up my confusion on the subject! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
