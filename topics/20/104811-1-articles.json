Maybe provide DV data and other stats that KER would provide.\n\nIt would be nice to go through my old (and new) craft files and see them without having to boot up and start KSP. Go to the KSC. Into the VAB/SPH. Then load it. It\u0027ll be faster and easier. \n\nPossible?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T02:30:06Z","Content":"Possible, but highly impractical.\n\nSuch a tool will require the following inputs:\n\n - The .craft file definition\n\n - Access to all models/textures in GameData, including every part from every third-party add-on\n\nBecause KSP parts are defined using the proprietary .MU format, you essentially need KSP and/or at least Unity to decode the .MU files and convert it into a 3D-examinable model, stick it inside a Unity web player container and then display that in a mobile-friendly webpage - all in real- or close-to-realtime.\n\nYou then need to host that webpage on a web server to allow public access, and content with server upkeep to support bandwidth from users of the service. As someone who once ran their own website, I know for a fact that setting up a website to support this mobile app would set you back $1.99/month for hosting and $14.95/year for domain name registration/parking (free web hosts do not allow you to host the server-side scripts needed to run this system).\n\nIn comparison, starting up the game takes between 5~10 minutes of load time, at no additional cost / upkeep."},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T02:36:10Z","Content":"But possible.
