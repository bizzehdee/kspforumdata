This is *NOT* about implementing it in any way, shape, or form into the stock game maintained by Squad. Therefore, it is NOT appropriate to close this thread, as it is NOT suggesting these changes be made to the stock game (I am well aware of the reasoning for it in the stock game).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see several (potentially equally valid) lines of thought here on how to achieve the desired effect with \u003Cstrong\u003Emodding\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Scale up Kerbin to the real-world parameters of Earth, like is done in the classic version of the \u0022Real Solar System\u0022 mod configs... This sets orbital velocity (which is then much higher, though gravity acting on spacecraft remains the same, due to the greatly reduced curvature of the larger planet) and atmospheric height to the correct values, but leaves the interesting problem that all KSP parts are meant to be at approximately 64% scale of their real-world counterparts, and the Kerbals themselves are approximately 40% the size of humans...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this makes it virtually impossible to build rockets that perform on par with their real-world counterparts (without a procedural parts mod), as, in extremely over-simplified terms, the Delta-V of a rocket is essentially determined by its burn-time: which is determined by its height (ignoring variances in ISP for a moment), whereas the height-limit of a rocket is (for structural/stability reasons) essentially determined by its width... Since KSP parts are only to 64% scale, in a real world-sized game, it is impossible to build rockets as large and effective as could be achieved with comparable real-world technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Scale up Kerbin by a 1:6.4 scale ratio (as is currently done in a popular alternative config version of \u0022Real Solar System\u0022). This preserves the relationship between the size of KSP parts, and the size of the planetary radius- but sets the Delta-V to orbit as much lower than in the real world, due to the shorter atmosphere and reduced planetary curvature... Still, these values would seem to be best-balanced, and lead to the most similar performance of KSP rockets to the real technologies they are miniatures of- as the performance of a rocket is heavily influenced by the relationship between its burn-time (and thus height) and the Delta-V to orbit..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Scale up Kerbin by an approximately 1:4 scale, so as to preserve the relative size of an individual Kerbal vs. the planetary radius. While it doesn\u0027t make a tone of sense from a game-balance perspective, it does from a realism perspective: it might seem more plausible that Kerbals (if they are supposed to emulate humans) simply build relatively larger rockets compared to their body-size than humans, than that Kerbals are smaller compared to their planet than humans (which would be the effect achieved with either of the other scale-ups...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing is clear between all the options. Kerbin DOES need to be made larger in order to create more realistic (and also, coincidentally, harder) game balance. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe question is, by how to most realistically achieve it with mods\u003C/strong\u003E (as Squad has declared they will NEVER change the scale...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to hear what you guys all have to say about the issue. I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ll all lean towards (1)- simply setting the parameters to real-world values: but as I\u0027ve stated, that creates major problems with Kerbal rockets only being to 64% scale. With such a re-scaled planet, you are forced either to have unrealistically restrictive limits placed on rocket size (from an engineering perspective- economic/financial costs be darned) that prevent them from performing as well as comparable real-world technology; or you install mods that let you build at a real-world scale (such as Procedural Parts), but then have the opposite problem instead- 6.4 tons of payload in things like electronics and orbital labs can do all the same things that would require 10 tons in real life... (thus meaning Kerbal rockets then essentially out-perform real world rockets with mods allowing 100% scale rocket-construction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-18T21:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2014 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T21:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I\u0027m afraid some of you may still not end up understanding what I mean by 64% scale rockets under-performing 100% scale rockets- so let me give an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you have a simple rocket that is a fuel tank 2.5 meters wide and 6.4 meters tall (for a total volume of 125.6 cubic meters) with an engine underneath that consumes 1 cubic meter of fuel per second, producing 1000 kN of thrust (these numbers are arbitrary- to have a standard for comparison). This is the KSP-scale rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s say you have another simple rocket that is a fuel tank 3.90625 meters wide and 10 meters tall (for a total volume of 479.12598 cubic meters) with an engine underneath that consumes 2.441 cubic meters of fuel per second, producing 2441 kN of thrust (this engine has precisely the same thrust per square meter of area on the bottom as the first one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first rocket of the two is a precisely 64% scale version of the second. It has the same ration of height to width. The same ratio of thrust to cross-sectional area. And the same ISP. Yet, it will have a shorter burn-time for the engine than the 100% scale rocket (125.6 seconds vs. 196.3 seconds), and thus in vacuum, a reduced Delta-V... It\u0027s only advantage is that it would produce more thrust per cubic meter of fuel stored- and thus might have a higher TWR...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t take a genius to figure out the larger rocket probably has the advantage of the two, at least if both rockets start from orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifting off from the surface of Kerbin/Earth, things get a little more complex due to aerodynamics and drag- but since Real Solar System and other re-scales don\u0027t change the actual gravity exerted by Kerbin/Earth (only the density of the planet), only the planetary curvature (and thus, speed necessary to achieve orbit) and atmospheric height (which effects the minimum stable orbital height, as well as time spent in-atmosphere, experiencing drag) are actually altered...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, since the 100% scale rocket is taller relative to its mass, it out-performs its 64% miniature aerodynamically, and will experience less drag relative to its mass in a FAR-like aerodynamics system (I can only assume anyone playing with RSS would play with FAR as well) and thus will ascend through that higher atmosphere with relatively less issue...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question then remains- which is the more \u0022realistic\u0022 re-scale then: a 1:10 re-scale that brings Kerbin up to approximately Earth-size (and atmosphere heights and planetary curvatures), or a 1:6.4 re-scale, which maintains the ratio of the size of equivalent rocket technology to its real-world relationship with planetary radius, but consequently still has a lower atmosphere height and higher planetary curvature (and thus decreased orbital speed) than real-world Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

Mirror Earth, as you say. Just rescale Kerbin to match Earth\u0027s average radius, move it to Earth\u0027s semi-major axis, scale everything else up by the same factors. You may to fudge a bit in order to ensure realistic values for other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbol has a temperature, according to the Wiki, the matches a K-type star, so rescale Kerbol to match a nice K star, move Kerbin smack dab in the middle of the habitable zone, then rescale everything else\u0027s SMA by the same factor. You then have some choices to make as to how to scale the planets, but at least you have an okay starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting to note that, if you take approach #2, scaling up Kerbin\u0027s SMA by 6.4x actually places it in the habitable zone for a K type star. This is the approach I will be taking with future version of 6.4:1 Kerbin for RSS (currently Kerbol uses G2V stats) even though the planets will be scaled up to match 6.4x their original and the densities altered to retain their current gravities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027ve personally been considering is running a ton of iterations of Accrete on K class stars until I find something approximating the Kerbin system, but Accrete doesn\u0027t do well with moons so I\u0027m a bit out of my league once the planets have been arranged.

Although I\u0027m not an engineer in real-life (I\u0027m a biologist), and had to just look up \u0022ballistic coefficient\u0022, it\u0027s precisely what I was describing all along... The problem is, 64% scale rockets have a lower ballistic coefficient than real-scale rockets, due to their not being as tall/long...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient#Formula\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient#Formula\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be clearly seen right in the second version of the formula: ballistic coefficient is proportional to body-length times density.
