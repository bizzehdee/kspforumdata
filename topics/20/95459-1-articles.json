Firstly, the term ISRU, in case you don\u0027t know, stands for In-Situ Resource Utilization. Its a fancy acronym for mining stuff and turning into something usable. In the case of both Kethane and Karbonite, the usable product is fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom extensive experience with Kethane and partial experience with Karbonite, I will say now that a self-refueling lander is more easily accomplished using the Kethane mod. That said, I\u0027m not suggesting Kethane over Karbonite. I personally prefer Karbonite because it is a better ISRU mod for what I use it for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, there are two things about Karbonite that makes a self-refueling lander a bit more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Karbonite drilling equipment is somewhat bulky and heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Karbonite is extracted based on concentration (you can find it anywhere, but its best to find a high concentration area) and can be slow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Karbonite will continue to be harvested in the background while you\u0027re off tending to an LKO space station and what not. This is one of it\u0027s main advantages. What I find to be the most effective way of utilizing Karbonite is to build a surface base on the Mun or Minmus (or both) which extracts and processes Karbonite into usable fuel. From there, I haul the finished product to orbit to fuel up an interplanetary freighter or another large reusable ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother key thing to know is that Karbonite has two separate converters each using a different mechanic. The normal convertor does a straight up one to one* conversion of raw karbonite to liquid fuel and oxidizer. The distiller, the other conversion option, produces monopropellant (and LiquidHydrogen if you use Near Future) BUT it only converts 10% of the karbonite it takes in to product. The remainder is pumped back into the tanks for re-use. To achieve complete conversion*, you\u0027ll need to run it for a while. My personal experience is that its best to run both the converter and distiller at the same time. The distiller will skim 10% off for monopropellant (something you don\u0027t normally need a lot of) and then the rest is converted to LFO mix (which you generally do need a lot of).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for finding Karbonite, it is tied to biomes. The concentration of it varies from biome to biome and planet to planet. You can send down a probe with a mini-drill, which is one way of determining the concentration, or if you choose to use the SCANSat mod, which is for mapping planets from orbit, you can see the karbonite density in any given area, allowing you to pick the optimal site for your karbonite mining operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done my share of refueling infrastructure so if you want any help/suggestions/advice in that department, feel free to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAengineer","CreatedById":123888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T03:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-shooty: Thanks a bunch.
