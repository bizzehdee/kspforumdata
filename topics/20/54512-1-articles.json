Just that using Realism Overhaul is making almost 80% of my parts useless. Am I missing something or are all the sizes incompatible with stock sizes?

If the part cfg uses MODEL node(s), it gets a bit more complex (bug): you set rescaleFactor as normal then in the model node use scale = 1/rescaleFactor, 1/rescaleFactor, 1/rescaleFactor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee how we do it in the RO part cfgs in Stock Resizes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T19:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh thanks.
