I like to play with cgf\u0027s and textures tho, and I can model quite well too.\n\nNow I have a request. Can we have Kerbals walking well on moving vessels? So far they stand on one spot and slide away if the vessel moves. Very annoying on big rovers and some other crafts.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to have them walking in airplanes that are mod-flight. I mean inside their cargo bays, that would definetely add some things to do during those long flights - like assembling your rover with KIS, for example. I know there are methods of detecting if the craft is inside cargo bay or fairing both for stock aerodynamics and for FAR/NEAR, so I guess they can be applied to vessels as well. I know this sould better be adressed to those mods, but even if we remove drag from such objects we would still need some code to make KErbals able to walk."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T07:20:35Z","Content":"[**lo-fi**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/114165-lo-fi) is working on something like this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127278-How-to-force-Kerbals-to-stand-instead-of-float?p=2118502\u0026viewfull=1#post2118502](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127278-How-to-force-Kerbals-to-stand-instead-of-float?p=2118502\u0026viewfull=1#post2118502)\n\n[**\\*Aqua\\***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/106824-%2AAqua%2A) took his code and started a WIP version, so stay tuned: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130907-WIP-MagneticEVA-Magnetic-boots-for-your-Kerbals%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130907-WIP-MagneticEVA-Magnetic-boots-for-your-Kerbals%21)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T08:05:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"}]}
