RT does not do this. You have to tell RT dishes what to point at, so it\u0027s a bit more realistic that stock CommNet just finding the best hop home (like, if you want to transmit to Kerbin but a planet is in the way RT won\u0027t automatically route the signal around through other probes - you\u0027d have to tell your spacecraft to point at a probe that could relay the signal to Kerbin). However RT does not care if the dish itself is physically pointing at Kerbin. As LGG said, since space craft are packed and the game itself doesn\u0027t even monitor this type of stuff, your only real hope is Kerbalism. That mod has background processing which I do believe factors spacecraft orientation into its monitoring of power levels for solar panels so comms pointing could potentially be included. However the current mod author has already scrapped most of the complex signaling system put in place by the original author so he may not be too enthusiastic to add more complexity to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-12T00:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRT \u003Cem\u003Eused \u003C/em\u003Eto have an antenna that did this.
