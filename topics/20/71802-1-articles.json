In the past ive always taken sounds from KW and Horizon Aeronautics ( Best sounding engines memory can buy ) and applied them to which ever engine I choose. The engage, the running and the flameout. It was really easy. I copied KW\u0027s method of a folder with the name of the part with my chosen sounds in it. Replaced the stock sounds in the .cfg. Easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new module system.. still easy.
