Francesco Lana de Terzi (known as the father of aeronautics) realized as long ago as\u00A01670 that a vacuum would be the perfect lifting medium because, unlike any lifting gas, it has no mass.\u00A0 Every bit of air shoved out of the way by a vacuum would be converted into lift.\u00A0 The problem there is, the mass of the container you need to hold a vacuum would weight more than the air you moved out of the way.\u00A0 Perhaps in the future when material science creates something strong and light enough, a vacuum airship will be feasible.\u00A0 Today, it\u0027s not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re familiar with most of the common lifting gasses, there are literally \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edozens of possibilities\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 And with the KSP system of resources all of those are possible.\u00A0 It\u0027ll even be possible to simulate coal gas by converting in-game ore into a gas.\u00A0 So none of those are out of the question.\u00A0 But if you read closely, at the bottom of that list, you\u0027ll see something KSP doesn\u0027t do well, mixing of resources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp till now, lifting gasses in KSP airship mods have been one gas at one density.\u00A0 In the real world, gasses can be easily mixed.\u00A0 And the math behind\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E mixing of gasse\u003C/a\u003Es is easy.\u00A0 You add the pressure created by one gas to the pressure created by the other gas and you have the total.\u00A0 Here\u0027s the problem.\u00A0 When you mix two gasses, like hydrogen and helium, the density changes.\u00A0 All KSP resources have a fixed density. If you mixed two gasses together and came up with a new density, you\u0027d have a new resource.\u00A0 That also means that even a small fractional change in the mixture of gasses, would also change the density and thus, yet another new resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as you can see, mixing of gasses in KSP would be a bit impossible\u00A0.\u00A0 You\u0027d essentially have infinite resources clogging your computer memory.\u00A0 Unless, that is, if you didn\u0027t consider it a resource at all.\u00A0 It would be easy enough to track how much of each gas (say hydrogen and helium) go into a bottle.\u00A0 By remembering how much goes in, you could calculate the densities and thus, it\u0027s lifting potential.\u00A0 So mixing gasses is possible and realistic results could be achieved. The down-side to that is, you wouldn\u0027t be able to use those gasses as a KSP resource.\u00A0 Meaning, moving the gasses between various parts wouldn\u0027t happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is then, which would be more realistic?\u00A0 Allow the mixing of lifting gasses or have a single gas\u00A0 but treat it like a resource?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is another option, and this is something no other airship mod has attempted (to my knowledge).\u00A0 Liquified gasses.\u00A0 Hydrogen, like many gasses, can be compressed into a liquid form.\u00A0 Suppose an airship mod allowed those liquified gasses to be moved around, loaded onto trucks or rockets and even bolted onto the side of the airship.\u00A0 When the airship needed a lifting gas, it would simply open the valves and instantly create the gas.\u00A0 You\u0027d have a very compressed form of the lifting gas, a resource that several mods already include as collectable/minable and you could take a supply with you.\u00A0 Once converted from liquid to a gas inside the airship, it would be a \u0027use it or lose it\u0027 though.\u00A0 And,\u00A0lifting gasses would not be a resource you could fill in the editor.\u00A0 It would be something you\u0027d have to create after you

few.\u00A0 Most, if not all of those can be turned into a lifting gas in KSP.\u00A0 So, the physics needed to get airships off the KSP runway exists.\u00A0 There is a slight problem though: being able to make the ship realistic yet, light enough for the gasses to lift it.\u00A0 While my testing is showing that even a small airship of a metric ton or so with enough space to carry a couple of Kerbals around can get off the ground, the envelopes are filled almost to capacity, leaving very little room for cargo.\u00A0 \u00A0Fortunately,\u00A0 lifting gasses aren\u0027t the only way to get an airship

engine arrangement.\u00A0 \u00A0By placing the engines inside the airship skin and mounting them at a 90 degree angle to the direction of travel, it allowed the props to be rotated.\u00A0 But, if you look at the second and third image, which is supposedly from the USS Akron, the Macon\u0027s sister ship, you\u0027ll notice that the mounting brackets prevented the props from rotating directly upward, meaning they were most likely used exclusively for descent.\u00A0 Whether they were connected to a transmission that allowed the prop rotation to be reversed, I wasn\u0027t able to discover.\u00A0 Either way, this was a huge improvement in engine design compare to earlier airships like the USS Shenandoah.\u00A0 Prior to rotating props, airship engines were so large that the designers actually called them cars and they were large enough that the crew\u00A0worked inside the compartment.\u00A0 Today, modern airships employ the rotating

Hydrogen, the best possible lifting gas, is highly explosive.\u00A0 It was easy enough to produce but flying around strapped to a ticking time bomb wasn\u0027t exactly the ideal solution.\u00A0 Helium, which is very close to hydrogen in it\u0027s lifting abilities was the next best solution.\u00A0 But, it was, and still\u00A0is, impossible to manufacture.\u00A0 It\u0027s only found near deposits of radioactive material.\u00A0 While Helium is plentiful in the universe, not so on earth. The only way we could possibly manufacture it is in a fusion reactor, which we still haven\u0027t perfected.\u00A0 To make matters worse, at that time, only one source was known to exist with any viable quantity and that was in the United States.\u00A0 And that meant, if the Americans didn\u0027t like you, your helium got cut off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydrogen valuable enough and helium was hard enough to get that the designers behind balloons and airships started coming up with ideas on how to conserve lifting gasses.\u00A0 Even those engineers in the US where helium was easy to get realized that there was a finite quantity and they needed to conserve as much as possible.\u00A0 The theory that came out of all of this was that once they put the lifting gas into the envelopes, do\u00A0everything possible to keep it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to try to replicate the value placed on this resource in KSP, you won\u0027t be able to fill gas envelopes inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have to do it the old fashioned way and fill your envelopes using a compressed resource like liquid hydrogen outside the editor.\u00A0 Once you fill these envelopes, recovery of the lifting gas won\u0027t be possible. You\u0027ll have to pack along some extra or find a way to have some delivered to you.\u00A0 This also means that keeping what gas you have in the envelopes will be something you\u0027ll have to consider. Blowing it out the release valves won\u0027t be a long term solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngineers building early airships realized that blowing gasses out the release valve\u00A0 wasn\u0027t a long term solution either. The Hindenburg held\u00A07,062,000\u00A0 cubic feet of lifting gas. During a typical Atlantic crossing, they\u0027d vent some 1,500,000 cubic feet of gas.\u00A0 The reason this was necessary was to compensate for fuel loss.\u00A0 At normal speeds, the Hindenburg would consume some 130 kilos of diesel fuel per hour.\u00A0 At it\u0027s best, an Atlantic crossing from Germany to the US, it took almost 53\u00A0hours of non-stop flying. (For us \u0027Yanks\u0027 the Hindenburg got less than 2 m.p.g.). Some method had to be developed to help compensate for that loss of weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVenting -\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0While the least desirable method of descending, it\u0027s still a very valid one. You just have to realize that each time you do vent, you lose precious lifting gas.\u00A0 Like modern and historical airships, this mod will have valves that you can open and close. Unlike other mods, these vents will be actual parts that you have to place and they will have to be on an envelope to work.\u00A0 The way they\u0027ll work is pretty simple, with both a manual and an automatic mode.\u00A0 In automatic mode, you set the pressure at which you want them to open (somewhere between 1 and 5000 Pascals).\u00A0 Should the internal pressure of the envelope exceed that amount, they start venting your gas.\u00A0 You an also turn them on manually to vent as needed.\u00A0 The bad news.\u00A0 These vents have a fixed rate at which gas can escape through them.\u00A0 The good news, you can set up action groups to turn them on and off and you have have multiple vents on an envelope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBallast\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - While ballast alone doesn\u0027t prevent the loss of lifting gasses, it be came, and still is, necessary for the proper operation of airships.\u00A0 Later, it became important in conserving the lifting gas.\u00A0 Rigid airships have a structured frame with one or more\u00A0balloons inside them.\u00A0 In order to keep that balloon from flopping around and risking puncture, it had to be inflated to a minimum volume. Even today\u0027s airships are non-rigid or semi-rigid and have to have a minimum amount of lifting gas to retain their shape.\u00A0 Depending on the payload, ballast had to be added or removed in order to help achieve a neutral buoyancy, where it neither ascended or descended.\u00A0 Even today, the GoodYear blimps are designed to have an expected payload.\u00A0 When that payload isn\u0027t exactly met, sand bags are added.\u00A0 To give you an idea of how critical ballast has become, in 2011, a GoodYear blimp pilot lost his life as a\u00A0result of ballast loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022goodyear-blimp-burning-midair.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022250\u0022 src=\u0022http://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/goodyear-blimp-burning-midair.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022520\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a condensed version, the pilot of the blimp and 3 passengers began to smell fuel during a flight.\u00A0 Making an emergency landing, a fire aboard the airship broke out and the pilot instructed the 3 passengers to disembark.\u00A0 The ground crew hadn\u0027t arrived to secure the blimp and as a result, it shot back into the air due to the ballast loss.\u00A0 Ultimately, an investigation by German authorities attributed much of the disaster to pilot error.\u00A0He was also credited with being a hero for saving the life of his passengers.\u00A0 While tragic, the point I\u0027m trying to make here is that historically, and even with today\u0027s airships, ballast plays such a critical role in maintaining a perfect balance in these airships that even the loss of a few hundred pounds is enough to radically alter their aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EBalloonets \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- The idea\u00A0behind \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballonet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eballoonets\u003C/a\u003E dates back to the late\u00A01700\u0027s.\u00A0 Their purpose was to decrease lift by adding to the envelope\u00A0a much heavier gas, air.\u00A0 Whenever the airship needed to descend, a balloonet was inflated inside of it, creating added weight and the airship descended.\u00A0 Thus far, I\u0027ve tested this in KSP and, surprisingly it works.\u00A0 In a video I posted further down the thread, you can see one of the test airships lift, fly around and descend without a significant loss of lifting gas by inflating and deflating balloonets inside each cell.\u00A0 Balloonets also had another important function.\u00A0 By inflating or deflating them and depending on their location in the airship frame, they could be used to trim the pitch of the airship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ballonet_analogue.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Ballonet_analogue.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:300px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022699\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EBy TraceyR [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html), CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) or FAL], from Wikimedia Commons\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP I\u0027ve had to take a slightly different approach to balloonets.\u00A0 In the image above you can easily see that anytime the inner balloon is inflated, the volume of the outer balloon doesn\u0027t change but it\u0027s size does.\u00A0 Because the airships I\u0027m first trying to replicate are of a rigid design, I\u0027ve had to allow for some creativity in how balloonets work.\u00A0 It\u0027ll be easier to think of them as two opposing pistons inside a cylinder.\u00A0 Each balloonet can be inflated up to 25% of the capacity of the cylinder. One of the problems with replicating a balloonet has to do with the density of air.\u00A0 In the image above, no calculation has to take place. You blow up the inside balloon and it works.\u00A0 In KSP, temperature and air pressure all have an effect on how the ballonet works and need to be factored in.\u00A0 In the first iteration of this mod, it\u0027s going to be much simplified.\u00A0 The air added to the balloonet won\u0027t have any weight.\u00A0 Instead, this is how it will work.\u00A0 Up until the point that the lifting gas envelope is 75% filled with lifting gas, the balloonet will have no appreciable effect.\u00A0 Once beyond that 75%, the balloonet effectively reduces the maximum volume that the gas cell can hold.\u00A0 This causes an increase in the pressure of the lifting gas\u00A0and, as a result, it\u0027s density increases.\u00A0 This also has the effect that since the total volume of lifting gas is reduced, the \u0027hole\u0027 it creates in the atmosphere gets smaller and thus, the airship isn\u0027t able to lift as much mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CltWDMe.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022287\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CltWDMe.gif\u0022 width=\u0022931\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow balloonets will work in this mod.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mass of air in the balloonet isn\u0027t insignificant.\u00A0 When you start working with airships the size of the Hindenburg, 50,000 cubic meters of air has a significant weight.\u00A0 And eventually, I will be adding this mass but not at first.\u00A0 The reason being is it will take some careful mathematics.\u00A0 For example. Assume you\u0027re on Kerbin and you fill your balloonet to maximum.\u00A0 Let\u0027s set\u00A0the air density there = 1.\u00A0 \u00A0When you\u0027re ready to lift off, you deflate the balloonet and you\u0027re on your way.\u00A0 Now let\u0027s assume you\u0027re doing some high altitude flying and you\u0027re at say 20km.\u00A0 Up there, the density is only 0.25.\u00A0 That means that the mass of the air for the same 25% volume is only 1/4 of what it was at the surface.\u00A0 To make it even more interesting, assume that you deflated the balloonet at the surface and very slowly, as you ascended, you started inflating it.\u00A0 In order to calculate the mass of the air in the balloonet, you\u0027d have to constantly sample the air. Take that air and it\u0027s density and then\u00A0add that volume and density to what\u0027s already in the balloonet and come up with a new density and thus, a new mass.\u00A0 Now this can all be done, I\u0027m just not going to do it in the first iteration of the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBlau Gas -\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003EBlau Gas was a rather unique idea.\u00A0 It was a gas distilled from naphtha that had two very desirable properties. First, it was flammable. Second, it\u0027s density was very close to that of air.\u00A0 This allowed airship designers to add a fuel that the engines could run off of and as it was consumed, replace it with air.\u00A0 In essence, this created a 0 sum game whereby weight wasn\u0027t lost or gained.\u00A0 I do plan on adding this into the mod but it too will take some work.\u00A0 \u003Cs\u003EIn KSP there\u0027s basically two choices that I\u0027m aware of. 1. Make an engine that runs specifically off of a type of fuel, which would require more parts, or 2. Write a plugin that would allow specific engines to \u0027switch\u0027 fuel types at the user\u0027s choosing.\u00A0 For now, I\u0027m not sure which I\u0027m going to pursue but I do want this fuel type in the game.\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0 The burnable gas may come into existence as\u00A0a by-product of creating a lifting gas from KSP ore.\u00A0 *edit* I just did a bit of research and this will be a lot easier than I initially thought.\u00A0 RAPIER engines already have a dual mode.\u00A0 The only thing that would be needed to switch and engine between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and Blau Gas would be a .cfg file.\u00A0 Problem solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBallast Reclamation -\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0One of the other solutions to loss of mass was to create your own ballast on-the-fly.\u00A0 Interestingly enough, about half of what comes out of the exhaust pipe of an engine is carbon monoxide.\u00A0 The other half, is water.\u00A0 Engineers during and after WWI set their attention to collecting this water and using it to replace mass loss.\u00A0 One engineer,\u00A0Robert F. Kohr, wrote a paper describing how he and a team of engineers in the 1920\u0027s worked on a method to extract this water from the exhaust of airship engines.\u00A0 Ultimately, their method consisted of creating condensers and mounting them on the sides of airships.\u00A0 They conducted numerous experiments and the math gets pretty heavy.\u00A0 But the basic conclusions they drew was that between 70% and 90% of the mass lost to fuel consumption could be collected from engine exhaust as water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested in this work, you can read about it here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/nbstechnologic/nbstechnologicpaperT293.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/nbstechnologic/nbstechnologicpaperT293.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKohr and his team experimented with LOTS of different fuel types and atmospheric conditions. For the sake of my sanity, I\u0027m not nearly going to be delving into the mathematics that he did.\u00A0 But, I will be adding a part into the mod that will reclaim water from the engines in a MUCH simplified manner.\u00A0 The amount of that water reclamation will have a number of factors involved including air pressure, air temperature \u0026amp;\u00A0engine thrust (or throttle position).\u00A0 \u00A0And, if you took a look at the pictures in that .pdf, there will be condensers that you can place on the airship to collect this water which you can turn on and off.\u00A0 Another thing that I will factor in is which planet you happen to be on.\u00A0 While I haven\u0027t seen anything that indicates the oxygen content of any particular planet\u0027s atmosphere, breathable air will obviously provide better results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine Vectoring

of the first, if not the first, to use vectored thrust.\u00A0 By taking the forward propulsion engines and rotating them up or down, engineers essentially added or subtracted lift.\u00A0 This mod will also employ vectored thrust.\u00A0 Thus far, and as far as I can plan, all of the engines designed for forward propulsion will be able to rotate 180 degrees, front to back.\u00A0 You\u0027ll also be able to adjust that rotation speed to your liking and stop the rotation at any point.\u00A0 You\u0027ll be able to assign action groups to this rotation and stopping so that, if you set all of the speeds the same, you can have the engines point any direction you like and stay there.\u00A0 And, with all of them having reverse thrust that can be placed in an action group, that gives a full 360 degrees of thrust rotation.\u00A0 In the replica of the GoodYear blimp above I was able to exclusively use vectored thrust from just 2 small engines to ascend and\u00A0descend as well as move forward and in reverse without changing the volume of the lifting gas.\u00A0 I will be creating both an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and an electric version of each engine

I could live with this minor discrepancy.\u00A0 Now, let\u0027s see what it takes to get this 5 ton airship off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RbWJkTR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RbWJkTR.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the things to note from this screenshot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst is the cool burners I\u0027ve created and placed on the bottom of the airship.\u00A0 Next is the odd shaped item just in front of the burner. That\u0027s a \u0027blower\u0027 that can be turned on and off to pump outside air into the envelope. What you\u0027ll want to take close note of is the numbers in the UI panel.\u00A0 It\u0027s showing that the highest temperature of the air inside the airship is over 900 degrees Kelvin! And in this test I even cheated and didn\u0027t use any type of fuel to run the burners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHot air balloons are extremely light.\u00A0 The gas volume of the balloon compared to the payload is a rather large ratio.\u00A0 When it comes to airships, that ratio drops significantly.\u00A0 Airships are inherently more massive than a balloon.\u00A0 Plus other problems arise. In all of my testing, each envelope was it\u0027s own unique part.\u00A0 For lighter than air gasses, this has worked great.\u00A0 For hot air, it\u0027s a nightmare to control.\u00A0 Imagine 3 balloons bolted together with each having it\u0027s own independent temperature and volume of gas.\u00A0 This means that air density in each one could be vastly different from the others. In the screenshot above, the rear envelope was at 900\u002B degrees while the forward one was at around 750 degrees.\u00A0 This creates vastly different amounts of lift between the front and the rear.\u00A0 Combine that with the fact that at these temperatures the cooling is (and should be) pretty rapid, I was having to fire up the burners every 30 seconds or so to stay aloft.\u00A0 And when they cooled, they cooled rapidly when meant, it had a tendency to start dropping like a rock.\u00A0 Next add in the fact that because the envelopes are at different temperatures, adding more heat creates even more varied temperatures.\u00A0 And finally, there was that minor issue of temperatures that could melt aluminum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I still haven\u0027t explored all the possibilities (like having a uniform temperature across all envelopes) the biggest problem I see is that in order to generate enough lift to get something as massive as an airship off the ground, that air needs to be hot, really, really hot.\u00A0 The only other viable solution I can see is to vastly decrease the mass of the airship itself.\u00A0 Either way, if hot air is going to be an option for a lifting gas then\u00A0there\u0027s going to be\u00A0unrealistic temperatures or unrealistic mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince my plan was to make an airship mod based on real-world physics, perhaps the best answer is neither.\u00A0 Then again, there may be another option.\u00A0 Using hot air to boost the lift of helistats without having to carry around a lifting gas.\u00A0 Hummm....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*edit Updating the Hummm...*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerformed a quick test with a helistat.\u00A0 The basic results were, it\u0027s viable. The theory behind helistats is is that the airship lifts itself including the rotors.\u00A0 The rotors are then used to lift the intended cargo.\u00A0 While hot air won\u0027t achieve that goal, it can help.\u00A0 In a quick test of the screenshot below, at roughly 520 degrees Kelvin\u00A0(still considerably warmer than a standard hot air balloon but not an insane temperature) the hot air was able to lift about 3.5 metric tons out of the total 8 ton airship weight.\u00A0 While that still puts a 4.5 ton demand on the rotors it does have one large advantage over lifting gasses...

To get more, you\u0027d have to have it delivered.\u00A0 But, if you happened to have a mining op with the \u0027special\u0027 ore-to-ore gas converter, you could make a lifting gas. If the cells were pre-set in the hangar to only accept hydrogen and helium, well, plan on a supply run.\u00A0 \u00A0Resetting them in the field, while doable, I think would add considerably more code to what\u0027s already several thousand lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a good idea but I still think what I came up with will work best for now.\u00A0 It allows the flexibility to use what you have on hand and not have to pre-define or, as you suggest,\u00A0redefine what gasses you\u0027re going to use.\u00A0 For that matter, you could mix all 3 the way it is now.\u00A0 Not only that, it\u0027s a bit more realistic.\u00A0 And, since the gasses can\u0027t be recovered anyway (or rather I\u0027ve found no examples of them being recovered), they\u0027ll either leak out or get shoved out anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, while not exactly practical, the only limit to the number of gas cells you can have is your hangar size.\u00A0 Managing volumes for a dozen or more would parts would be... rather boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the idea though.

Are those numbers correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course not.\u00A0 Other factors get involved, like the fact that Duna\u0027s air pressure is so low that you can fill 11,000 m3 with a very small amount of hydrogen so it\u0027s weight is going to be a LOT less.\u00A0 \u00A0And then, because Duna\u0027s gravity is much lower than that on Kerbin the amount of lift (in kilo newtons) generated by the lifting gas is going to be much higher than it is on Kerbin.\u00A0 So, less gas and more lift would also figure into these equations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve done here is to intentionally give a somewhat misleading example of the kinds of calculations that need to be done in order to figure out the real physics behind airships.\u00A0 I don\u0027t want to give you all of the numbers you need in order to determine if an airship of a given volume and given weight will get off the ground on any particular planet.\u00A0 That would defeat half the fun of figuring it out yourselves.\u00A0 Is it possible to fly an airship on Duna? Yes.\u00A0 With the first release of this proposed mod? Maybe, maybe not. The current airships\u00A0are designed to be rigid airships and will intentionally have a weight that supports that design.\u00A0 It may take a non-rigid blimp with some extremely lightweight materials.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have to experiment and find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, does this mean\u00A0your suggestion can be done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, and no.\u00A0 The physics and the modelling are possible.\u00A0 Where this runs into issues is with KSP, which I mentioned in another recent reply to KerBalloons. Once you leave the ground, a vessel is considered flying. You can\u0027t leave that vessel while it is and have it remain where it is.\u00A0 If you try, you\u0027re pitched into a wormhole and warped backward in time to your last game save.\u00A0 There is a technique called air parking whereby a vessel is taken \u0027off rails\u0027 and is fooled into thinking it\u0027s landed. The problem there is, when it is taken off rails, physics no longer applies to it and it becomes sorta frozen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means, that while the airships may be doable, having them perform as in HAVOC won\u0027t be.\u00A0 You\u0027d have to either land them or cheat and air park them.\u00A0 And as for the air colonies that were proposed in phase 5 of HAVOC.\u00A0 Again, you\u0027d have to cheat and force them to be landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, thinking about it, there may... I say may... be a way around all that cheaty stuff but that will take a lot of digging and testing. It may be something for the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the idea and it\u0027ll stay stuck in me\u00A0\u0027ead for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NASA_Cloud_City_on_Venus.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022530\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/NASA_Cloud_City_on_Venus.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-11T16:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2018 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T16:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd sure you have seen this one\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://curious-droid.com/302/zeppelins-mars-havoc-venus-nasas-new-planetary-airships/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://curious-droid.com/302/zeppelins-mars-havoc-venus-nasas-new-planetary-airships/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they don\u0027t have to land if I remember right you just have to have a long cable that we used the winch and anchor but still that\u0027s close to landing and some one did make a great mod of a airship part will try and found it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit- Does anyone still have the mod ( Discreet aircraft parts )\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlooks like it was nuked by the forms\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273-Discreet-aircraft-parts\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273-Discreet-aircraft-parts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-11T16:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2018 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T18:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223449430\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536684268\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181994\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mecripp\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Mecripp said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd sure you have seen this one\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://curious-droid.com/302/zeppelins-mars-havoc-venus-nasas-new-planetary-airships/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://curious-droid.com/302/zeppelins-mars-havoc-venus-nasas-new-planetary-airships/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they don\u0027t have to land if I remember right you just have to have a long cable that we used the winch and anchor but still that\u0027s close to landing and some one did make a great mod of a airship part will try and found it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit- Does anyone still have the mod ( Discreet aircraft parts )\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlooks like it was nuked by the forms\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273-Discreet-aircraft-parts\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273-Discreet-aircraft-parts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen several examples of how real airship/balloon probes would function.
