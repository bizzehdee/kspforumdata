I did some testings, and found out it was the contract packs that caused them. Even just one is enough to cause stutters.\u00A0Another player also had a similar problem, and by removing the contract pack, the stutter was gone as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what causes this stutter with contract packs?
