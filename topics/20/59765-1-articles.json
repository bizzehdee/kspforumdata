Having dealt with KAS, use a manned space craft, load up one or two radial ports in a storage bin, fly out to the debris, put the radial connectors on to the debris, tow it in and lock it, de-orbit the debris. For larger pieces, use two winches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.E.

Sometimes KAS *is* the huge pain in that it makes your ship spontaneously disassemble, with problems only showing themselves AFTER you\u0027ve quicksaved thinking everything is fine. I have the worst luck particularly in orbit using the wench to wrangle in debris to deorbit. I do that a couple times with no problems, switch to another ship to break the monotony, and when I return to my deorbiter ship it explodes, or crashes the game, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you try it, and if you have any problems just delete the debris and make sure all of your future likely-to-become-debris stages have a docking port on them, then build a deorbiter with a docking port and do it that way.
