Back after an extended hiatus. I did a fresh install of KSP v1.1.3 and installed the latest MechJeb v2.5.8. Seems to have installed OK, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E menu is there and a bunch of modules, but \u0022Landing Guidance\u0022 is missing. Tried everything I could think of to get it to work with no joy, including modifying the AR_202 part.cfg file so all the tech requirements are \u0022start\u0022. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T11:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot unlocked on the tech tree yet?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T12:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTried in sandbox?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epox75","CreatedById":143300,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T13:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a problem i also had in different careers:\u00A0landing guidance and ascent guidance disappear after unlocking a certain tech node (which one I don\u0027t know).
