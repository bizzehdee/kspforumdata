I assume not because that\u0027s just the :X and :Z components of the velocity vector SHIP:VELOCITY:ORBIT (or SHIP:VELOCITY:SURFACE, depending on which you wanted), which would be too easy of an answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect you mean relative to your ship\u0027s facing - as in the fore direction and the starboard direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s the case, then you can get that with dot products of the vector with the ship\u0027s current facing axis vectors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESET STARBOARD_VEL TO VDOT( SHIP:FACING:STARVECTOR, SHIP:VELOCITY:ORBIT).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESET FORE_VEL TO VDOT( SHIP:FACING:FOREVECTOR, SHIP:VELOCITY:ORBIT).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswer to (2):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a vector:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESET ANTI_TARGET_VECTOR TO (-1) * TARGET:POSITION:NORMALIZED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
