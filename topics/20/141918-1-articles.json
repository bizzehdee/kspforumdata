Mod authors: Mod authors usually care only about \u0022their\u0022 mod, because that\u0027s the mod that they have control over. They care a lot less about incompatibilities, or figuring out bugs in other mods. They also don\u0027t care about the ease of installation. Why would they? It\u0027s really easy! Just download from here, copy this there, that here, don\u0027t forget that dependency. They\u0027ve done it a hundred times and don\u0027t get why people even bother with CKAN, because manual installation seems simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Users: Users usually only care about their game, and about playing. They see a mod in the forums, or highlighted somewhere, and they just want to \u0022play\u0022 it. They don\u0027t want to read installation instructions, they don\u0027t want to figure out dependencies or conflicts. Some users have dozens, maybe even a hundred of mods installed. Each and every single one of them is downloaded from a different location, has different folders, has different conventions, ... And the users are supposed to keep track of that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat about updates? Even with KSP-AVC, keeping your game up-to-date is a nightmare. Imagine, you want to update 10 mods! 10 different websites, unpack 10 zips, delete the right folders, extract the right folders, and OH NO don\u0027t forget dependencies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese two points of view are inherently\u00A0incompatible, and will always cause troubles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat CKAN *aims* to do is provide a buffer between those two groups.

I wonder if it would be possible to make use of one of the formats already used in Linux software packaging, where a lot of that kind of stuff already has solutions. A good solution also needs to be friendly to the modders - don\u0027t burden them with excessive work to create packages, and don\u0027t cause issues that aren\u0027t present with a manual install.

the case of Ferram, totally refused to de-list, even at the modder\u0027s request. \u00A0Heck, they\u0027ve refused to delete several dead mods of mine despite asking nicely a couple of times

Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I was ambivalent about my mods being listed initially (basically, I expected things to not go well, but I saw no reason to complain so long as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E did not cause problems).\u00A0 I was told by one of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E contributors that if I did have a problem, I could ask, and they would de-list the mods.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E v0.15 comes out, and due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s metadata being incorrect for that version (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E has no archive/metadata error checking of any form for mod updates) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E pushes out a completely broken install at the same time that I am attempting to bugfix a complete overhaul of the aero model.\u00A0 Bug reports that I need to read to fix things get buried by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E-only install issues that are being reported by people that I knew never had install issues before.\u00A0 So in one swoop, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E caused more install issues for me than I ever got before on the one thing where they were supposed to make things easier for modders (at least when they were pretending they cared about modders).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little over a month later, after fixing those \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E issues I\u0027m mulling over asking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E to be de-listed over the entire mess, though not sure either way.\u00A0 I look at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E policies, and lo and behold, they\u0027ve declared that non-All Rights Reserved mods shall not be de-listed.\u00A0 A month after \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E causes hundreds of install errors on one of the most-used mods authored by one of the more outspoken critics of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I demanded it be de-listed simply on principle at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, I have a few problems with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Unlike RD, who handles his metadata for his own sanity, I\u0027m ticked enough at them that I refuse to do that.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E can cause issues for you and then get you to handle the metadata for them
