Not sure where this goes..or if its even a thing or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I started a new science game. built the basic rocket with command pod parachute a flee engine and some science\u00A0to start. my tech tree hasn\u0027t even been touched yet. Launch. well on the right side tool\u00A0button menu for all the mods i have installed...there\u0027s well...all the buttons(for me theres like 15-20. I meen...i dont think ill need fmrs to land my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003Esrb\u003C/abbr\u003E straped command pod. would I? ive caught myself noticing im scrolling a lot on the menu to find a button or 2 I use more often than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy proposal, is possibly a quick made \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch or tech tree patch\u00A0that unlocks the tool bar buttons as you get the required tech tree\\parts to actually make use of certain buttons/mods. I have quick hide mod installed. but that really just hides the problem. id rather start blank-ish,\u00A0and when i unlock the tech to recover a vessel for example. then fmrs will be available in the flight menu. A different approach\u00A0would be able to hide whatever\u00A0buttons on the menu or at least have the ability to place which buttons you want on top. so you see them first and dont have to scroll a bunch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthoughts? thanks for reading!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Electrocutor","CreatedById":109593,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-17T23:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, I wish all modders would just have less toolbar spam altogether and find a way to better integrate the interfaces into the game itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the gameplay settings displayed there could easily just be setup as GameSettings or DifficultySettings instead of having their own settings window that pops-up from the toolbar; and most other things could be integrated into the right-click menus of parts or added into already-existing GUI elements on the HUD. Many settings could also just be delegated to a config file, as only very few people would be interested in changing them from default values (like pop-up window transparency and such).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
