Not for a specific missions, just for flying around delivering needed parts. A bit like the shuttles from star trek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have mods that might be able to do that (with very efficient engines, or electrical ones), but they are essentially overpowered and i don\u0027t want this vessel to be able to be used for interplanetary transfers. It should need a mothership for that. Also i\u0027d love if it had some sort of interesting gameplay to it, like having to stop for refuel every once in a while, or having to meet some prerequisite while flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about some engines which had thrust based on the local gravity force: the farther you get from a planet, the less thrust you get. Or maybe an engine slaved to a mothership: get too far, lose thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe KSP interstellar can do this with beamed power networks, but i\u0027m not sure. I\u0027d have to setup a network in advance around each planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-16T09:38:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2017 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Madeiner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T11:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223093414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162148\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497605479\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002295585\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Madeiner\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Madeiner said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about some engines which had thrust based on the local gravity force: the farther you get from a planet, the less thrust you get.

Perhaps you can patch some of your rocket engines with Module Manager to perform similarly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Unless the performance loss is dependant on air density, not altitude. I\u0027m no expect on the implementation. In that case it would not work for airless worlds, only for ones with an atmosphere.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I looked it up.
