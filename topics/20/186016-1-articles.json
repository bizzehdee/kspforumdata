My goal is to make Kerbals representing NASA astronauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s just one problem, though: Kustom Kerbals hasn\u0027t been updated since 1.2.2. I downloaded a version recompiled for 1.4-ish off GitHub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth versions have various errors: the 1.2.2 version doesn\u0027t create a Kerbal no matter how many times I press the spawn button, and the 1.4 version will spawn a Kerbal, but with a random name (I tried to spawn Alan Shepard, but all I got was a warning saying he already existed, and it instead spawned a Kerbal with the Kerman surname).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how to get Kustom Kerbals to work with 1.7.2? Or am I just gonna have to go through the process of recruiting Kerbals, closing the game, and renaming them in the files? Because my install has so many mods that loading takes upwards of eight minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EDisregard this thread. Turns out what I thought I downloaded wasn\u0027t truly Kustom Kerbals.
