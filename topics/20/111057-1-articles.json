Would def be nice. Given the cinematic community that exists with this game, frankly I\u0027m surprised a tool like this hasn\u0027t been done already. But, mod authors are largely driven by personal needs and so I guess everyone that\u0027s needed this so far couldn\u0027t make it themselves ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T21:05:44Z","Content":"Anyone yet? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T21:36:50Z","Content":"That\u0027s a cool idea.

First off, that\u0027s going to probably put a lot of load on the RAM, and it certainly won\u0027t happen before we have stable 64bit on all platforms.

The idea is pretty cool, though.\n\nI have no knowledge of coding or KSP\u0027s limitations, but it feels like it only has to save the actively loaded crafts and it only has to quicksave when you pause and want to replay something. It would then load that save when you go back to realtime. Obviously this wouldn\u0027t allow something like reverting to a specific point in the replay, but it would be good enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:12:11Z","Content":"I feel like this could be a feature of persistent trails.\n\nRight now, the mod records a trail that you can replay later. But maybe the recording could always be on, and you can always replay to a certain extent. You could set it to delete the track 30 seconds behind you to keep RAM and CPU down. You could also make that adjustable. you would only need a few seconds of replay for those close calls and such."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T06:25:41Z","Content":"All three of you have the wrong idea. When you start recording, the game state (SFS file) is saved. From that point on, all that is tracked is player input: What part menu actions are activated, what the current pitch/yaw/roll input is, what action groups are activated, etc etc. when you play it back, the mod loads that SFS file and starts streaming the input into the game as if it were the player. Recording inputs multiple times per second is still a paltry amount of data compared to an uncompressed video file. Just look into any \u0022recorded\u0022 RTS match if you still don\u0027t grasp the concept"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:56:33Z","Content":"RTS replays don\u0027t log the input and replay them, they log the positions. I doubt that replaying input in KSP would lead to the same state after a few seconds."}]}
