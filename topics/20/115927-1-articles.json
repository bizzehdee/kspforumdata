The last step can be accomplished by using the TWR equation but reversed:\n\n    EngineThrustRescaled = EngineMassRescaled * (EngineTWRReal / 100)\n\nI used this method to create a lot of real life launch vehicles before starting tinkering with RSS. I was impressed to find out that the Atlas V and Delta IV replicas i made had the same payload capability as the real ones (of course on rescaled payload masses).\n\nThe only problem is that i have not found a way to \u0022rescale\u0022 the Isp values yet.

If you use RL engine TWRs, your additions will not fit with stock at all.\n\nThis is a fine example of \u0022realism for the sake of realism\u0022 and why it should be avoided. Stock KSP is not realistic; you\u0027re much better off statting up your engine with a useful and balanced niche than to blindly convert RL stats.\n\nRealism has its place, but by definition it requires you to depart from stock for it to make sense and feel consistent.
