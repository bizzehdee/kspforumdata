This would make the parts lighter and/or giving more space for stuff like fuel. So the question would be how do we get it into space... well with mods like Extraplanetary\u00A0Launchpads would help answer that question.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else thought of this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeker\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteShock","CreatedById":112071,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T19:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the 1 seat lander pod isn\u0027t really meant to hit the atmosphere ever, and you get that into space with a fairing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rushligh","CreatedById":31038,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T07:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlike, half of near-future and station parts packs are based on that principle. you either use large fairings and radiators or construct them soley in space/other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
