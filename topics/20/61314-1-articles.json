Just having a few UI problems. Ever since I updated Toolbar last night.. I cant recover crafts. I get the science log, but when I hit \u003Cem\u003EDone\u003C/em\u003E the \u003Cem\u003ERecover Craft?\u003C/em\u003E box remains as does the craft itself. Strange enough though it seems it does tally up the science. ( hoping it doesn\u0027t double up when I get it to work ). And along with that my space bar doesn\u0027t seems to work.
