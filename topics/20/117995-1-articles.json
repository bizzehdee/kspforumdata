Some of these things I\u0027ll look into doing myself, but these seem like simple things that could be added to stock.\n\n**Toggable Flap Limit \u0026 Speed**\n\nThe ModuleControlSurface Module has both Range and Speed in it. Is that something that could be made tweakable? I have been duplicating the part and changing the values to make bay doors. In addition it would be fun to help tune aircraft even more when used as traditional flaps. Setting the speed and limits of the flaps would allow incredibly precise tuning of aircraft.\n\nI\u0027m not any good at writing plugins, but this doesn\u0027t seem like it would be very difficult to do.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_gx3V4LP-8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Action Key Controls**\n\nMy craft perform wildly different at sea level than they do at altitude. At sea level they can perform turns that would turn kerbals into a puddle, but have the perfect level of G force at 5,000m\u002B. Thus I often turn the flap\u0027s pitch off at low altitue/high speed, and reactivate it at higher altitude/lower speeds. Right now the only way to do this is to turn the UI on and do it manually.\n\nWhen I film however, I try to avoid turning the UI on. Making this impossible.\n\n**G Force Limits**\n\nThis one is the farthest stretch. Going along with the problem stated above, my craft perform way too well at lower altituedes, but perfectly up around 5000m. Would there be a way to limit the amount of G\u0027s the flaps allow the craft to turn? So they aren\u0027t able to sustain 15\u002Bg circles at lower altitudes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T14:49:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by clown\\_baby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T13:35:54Z","Content":"Sliding bay doors anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T17:34:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sliding bay doors anyone?\n\nI could probably even do that with the Infernal Robotics plugin and a flap.

One more request. I want the opposite of this. If things surface attached to flaps would also move, you would essentially have stock robotics.
