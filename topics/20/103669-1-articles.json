I\u0027m actually excited about having to learn what the real astronauts had to do as far as TLI burns and Orbit Insertion. I feel like I\u0027m really accomplishing something when enjoying KSP.\n\nBelow is a mod or suggestion that I have for the business career mode for KSP. I feel this doesn\u0027t break the game but if you invested many hours only to run out of money then I\u0027m interested in some guidance as far as making my theory into an addon compatible with KSP. Probably the shortest mod idea perhaps but I feel this will minorly tweak the business aspect of that Career option (career business) that will only force you to warp time to get some funding if you totally screw up which is what happened to me during my first ever play. I enjoy the management and strategy beyond just building the rocket I really like how KSP integrates the science and the financial planning of this. So as to celebrate being a part of this new forum for one of my distinguished new favourite games I thought I\u0027d celebrate by saying hello to this wonderful community and share a thought that may help KSP become even greater. Below is my proposal for a mod that I would like to learn how to write but would appreciate some guidance so I can learn more about adding to the multiverse of this game which has literally limitless potential. I am so grateful for any help.\n\noh was curious how you could make your own flags for the game also..\n\nLooking forward to discussing this with the members.\n\nSincerely Jason Chapman \n\nPlease email me if you have tips or helpful suggestions to help me make this possible.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*PROPOSAL MOD FOR KSP CAREER BUSINESS MODE\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**KERBAL FUNDING MOD OUTLINE**\n\nby Jason Chapman\n\n[\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#517466133e2125383e3f746615)\n\nHi everyone just enjoying KSP very awesome and challenging. I like the business aspect managing a space program brings me back to the days of Project space station for the commodore 64. When I learned KSP offered these resource management features I got extremely excited.\n\nI am not a moddeller slowly learning with challenge about coding, there is one little tweak I thought would be kind of an essential minor tweak to the KSP business career mode is a steady cash flow based on achievements.\n\nIf there would be any change to this mode of the game it would be something like this among all the other awesome aspects already featured.\n\nI started a business career game and although each KSP game is essentially a sandbox I consider it a cheat to have access all at once to all parts available. Its great of course to see what the program has to offer. I like the concept of building my way up from start.\n\nI during my first game with the career business, found myself running out of money. I ended up being broke, and thought I\u0027d have to wait a month or something before a budget influx would give me some cash resources to work with instead of absolutely nothing. This killed my game and brought it to an abrupt halt.\n\nI hope someone could help me or point me in the right direction as far as knowing what I would need to accomplish this tweak.\n\nBasically have a formula where if in the event you run low on cash and can\u0027t complete contracts there should still be a way to get some funding say its called Government funding mod I\u0027ll use as a working concept. Or company sponsor funds mod. \n\nBasically if you have obvious reputation points which will earn as you play plus completing science.\n\n\\\n\nMore or less creating a formula would be the only thing in the mod and probably maybe one of the less complex. No parts or models just a formula that would add to players business budget at the end of every game month or even day.\n\nEach day Funds=(Rep\u002BScI)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 24\n\nEach month funds=(Rep\u002BSci)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 30\n\nEach year funds=(Rep\u002BSci)x number of completed contracts complete divided by 12.\n\nObviously as you progress and by the time a game year passes the contracts will probably be alot that you\u0027ve completed.\n\nNot sure if contracts repeat or offer again but I feel this would keep your business career going even if you experience massive problems ie accidents and so forth, but it will keep you going instead of bringing the game to a halt where you have to restart.\n\nFor myself this is 1 mod I really would like to either know how to create or someone make it according to my outline, I only ask for recognition for the idea.\n\nThank you for your time and please feel free to contact me if needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T03:58:52Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nAlso, moved to General Add-on Affairs, where requests for mods are made."}]}
