However, the few things I\u0027ve been able to dig up regarding part mirroring achieves the mesh mirroring, which solves the visual asymmetry, but then breaks the actual function of the control surface since the entire model is mirrored, which breaks the internal transforms the control surface uses to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t found any other information on how to maybe fix this in the config file. There may be some third-party extensions that resolve this? I wouldn\u0027t know about any of those though, so if there is, it\u0027d be great to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
