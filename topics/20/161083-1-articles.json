I remember there used to be a window you could open that would show you the global stockpile of the planet you were on. Could someone enlighten me? thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t you know it I found it.... please delete this thread sorry about that. Or keep it up for someone else with the same question?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer is that you need to enable the Kolonization button in the mini menu that you get on your screen, and then click on it to open the Kolonization window, then select the planetary logistics tab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-26T05:47:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2017 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by stratt76\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
