Or even create new parts entirely. You could put them into a converter to get 1 sheet of metal or however many is realistic. That then can be use to craft new parts, patch up space stations when parts wear away or reach the end of their life ect.. just depends on how advanced you can go and what a modder is willing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-24T15:52:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2016 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ketaz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T09:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could look at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kolonization System.
