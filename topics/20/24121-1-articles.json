It allowed construction of ships on other planets from a VAB that you could send to a planet, using resources like molten metal and such. It looked really interesting, and was set for a test release a few days before the forum crash. However, combing through the addons section, I\u0027ve found nothing of the sort. Google returns nothing, as do Bing! and Yahoo. I\u0027m beginning to doubt it ever actually existed in the first place, and it\u0027s driving me insane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... Does anybody remember that mod? Do you know what happened to it? Is it still being worked on, and can we expect a thread put back up sometime soon? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr am I misremembering things, and it never actually existed at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I got BCed","CreatedById":18121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T06:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t recall ever hearing about such a mod.
