There are a lot of different tech trees providing a variety of progression experiences.\n\nThough at the moment, only very few have been updated to the radically changed (disimproved) KSP 1.0.x techtree definition.\n\nFor modded games I m only aware of the [**CTT**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) and the [**SETI-CTT**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130) (which is an addon to the former, starting with probes and other changes) being available for 1.0.x."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:08:50Z","Content":"There\u0027s no one \u0022best\u0022 tree, it\u0027s what fits your playstyle best. Most tech trees support mods reasonably well, but the [Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) is designed specifically to provide a tech tree for modders to place parts in, rather than just rearranging stock parts. It\u0027s based on the stock tech tree and has a ton of mod support.\n\nIf you would rather not start with manned pods, [SETI](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130-0-90-SETI-BalanceMod-Scope-Economy-Tech-Integration-v0-7-6-Feb-13?highlight=seti) provides an extension to the CTT that reworks a few nodes and moves a bunch of parts around to better fit starting with probes. Since it\u0027s based on the CTT, it still has excellent mod support. Disclaimer: If you didn\u0027t notice from my signature, I very much like SETI. It\u0027s my personal favorite.\n\nA few others as well (copied from the SETI page, I haven\u0027t tried these personally):\n\n[Mod-Oriented Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90938) - 2 versions available, one for a manned start and one for an unmanned start\n\n[KSAEA](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94271) - Kerbal Space and Atmospheric Exploration Agency Tech Tree and Game Rebalance\n\n[Adios Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108785) - Star shaped, category based tech tree, manned and unmanned start available\n\n[Road to Kosmos](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109672) - Tech progress based on historical space programs\n\nAnyways, hope that helps you find a tech tree that fits how you want to play the game.\n\nEdit:\n\nNinja\u0027d by the author of SETI himself..."}]}
