The thing is, is it possible to apply it to the wheels? I modified stock torque curve of TR-2L wheel to fit my needs, but instead of having torque increased permanently, I would rather like to have two selectable modes - normal mode, and \u0022low\u0022 gear producing more torque to get over some steep hills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible to use MultiModeEngine for that, like in the Panther jet engine? Or maybe there is other method to get that effect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
