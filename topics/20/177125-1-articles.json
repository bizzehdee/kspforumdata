I made a mod some time ago that added extra parts you can fill with ballast in the game that worked well at sinking vessels however all that extra mass made moving the vessel a bit difficult and warranted specialist engines and thrusters etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/164215-13-buoyancy-control-add-a-buoyancy-control-slider-to-every-parts-context-menu/\u0026amp;\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis mod \u003C/a\u003Eby \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139010-xyphos/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022139010\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/139010-xyphos/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Xyphos\u003C/a\u003E which is excellent as it allows parts buoyancy values to be changed in the craft editor through tweakables however it is a little inconvenient to have to set this value for every part and it cannot be altered when the craft is being played in game. My idea would be a simple GUI interface in game that allows the user to input a value that changes the buoyancy value of every part on the craft by that value with some presets so the user can add values for Float on surface, Neutral buoyancy, Sink, Default values (i.e. off) etc. Trim, (balancing nose up or down), shouldn\u0027t be necessary if every part has the same buoyancy value but if it was needed there could be another editable value that adds a small amount of extra buoyancy to parts in front of the centre of mass and removes some from parts behind the centre of mass on top of the other set values, (or reverse this for opposite trim). Don\u0027t need anything fancy for any values, just user set values, (which would be decimal numbers between 0 and 2 from testing the mod above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen quite a bit of demand for something that would make it easier to submerge vessels without having to add a ton of ore tanks to the design. I don\u0027t think I have the skills to make a mod with a GUI and a bit of programming though.

Perhaps a simple solution would be to make a new small part, called for example a Buoyancy Control Unit, that you add to the craft you want to submerge and the mod only works on the craft with this unit. Kind of like how the AR202 case works for MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as stated, this will mess with the BDAc hp and armor calculations so any user trying to use a mod that uses this method will not work as intended ... if you want to refute the findings of 5 prominent KSP modders as well as the test information received from the test group then be my guest ... as stated, doing this will irrefutably affect BDAc, no questions asked as what I have repeatably said in this regard is what is the case\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether you think it will affect a vessel or not doesn\u0027t detract from the fact that it will affect BDAc, period, no passing go and collecting your $200, said and done, this is the way it is\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than BDAc associated mods or user trying to use this mod or a mod that uses the same method you will have no issues ... as soon as a user trys to use this method/mod with BDAc then all bets are off ...
