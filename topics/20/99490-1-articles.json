The largest one uses LESS energy then 2 of the mediums, and it has the same torque as 2 mediums. I never understood WHY this is the case. Is going bigger more efficient or something, as even that seems counter intuitive that a larger object, despite producing more torque, is using less energy to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other major inconsistency i dont understand is why certain fuel tanks have way less fuel capacity then volume would suggest. This mostly applies to the porkjet parts, almost all MK-2 parts, and almost all of the adapters that were added in 0.90. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, take a look at the MK2-2.5m adapter. It has equal capacity to a FLT-800, and just eyeballing it, it could fit at least 3 of the FLT-800s volume wise inside of it. Why then, does it have such lower capacity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is the MK1 inline jet fuel tank. It has LESS liquid fuel then the FLT-400, and is the same size. Even if it has extra impact tolerance, which i would say could remove 10-20% of the fuel, i very much doubt that it would have less then 300ish liquid fuel, which would still be less then the FLT-400\u0027s 400 total fuel (not sure, but i believe LF and O weighs the same per fuel unit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, almost every MK-2 part seems to have way less fuel then its internal volume seems to give. The MK-2 - MK-1 adapter is twice the volume of a FLT-800, yet has much less fuel then a single FLT-800. 500 total fuel, vs 800 in the FLT, in a tank thats much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre these new parts intended as structural parts that dont carry much fuel for their volume? Is this exponentially lower capacity a byproduct on the higher impact tolerance (50 vs 6), or is there some other reason behind it (do the old tanks have too much capacity?). I doubt the 1st reason is valid, or at least not as much as the new parts have less fuel, id guess that the higher impact means more dry mass, and slightly less fuel then volume, but not much less then -30% volume of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, id like to know why, or perhaps, if there is no reason, suggest that the fuel tanks be rebalanced in terms of volume they can fit. Same with reaction wheels, they dont scale linearly, which makes little sense for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T18:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the game is terribly blanced.

A 400 unit tank would weigh 2.15t (instead of 0.9t), and have that much more drag too (almost 2.4x as much). Also that would give it very high wet mass to dry mass ratio, so it\u0027s dry mass would have to go up as well, making the drag situation even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately new aero is coming which should hopefully eliminate this mass=drag nonsense, and making heavy planes will be less of a .. burden *cough*.
