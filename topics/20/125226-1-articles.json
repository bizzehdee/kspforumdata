So this was fantastic, but what came next was even more shocking. So I switched to liquid fuel (which is supposed to be the propellant that offers the lowest thrust) once I was to high in atm, and I turned on the engine just a bit, and in less than a second I accelerated 50 m/s! Now, I did not know what the max thrust was in this configuration, but according to mechjeb my TWR was 190. Yes, you read that correctly, not 1.90 or 19.0 but 190!!! And mind you, this was only using 4 of the 3.75m fission reactors, for a total thermal power of about 14GW, which is not little, but is nothing compared to what some of the more advanced reactors can do, which makes me wonder what would happen to this spaceplane if I had used antimatter!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T19:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should consider posting this in the KSP Interstellar mod thread.

And I was not using mechjeb to pilot it, only for info, so no problem there. Given that even at 1% thrust with the thrust limiter set to 1% I still struggled to burn less than 5m/s, I\u0027m pretty sure the 190 TWR was correct.
