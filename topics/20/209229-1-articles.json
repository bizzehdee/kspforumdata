Looking to set it up for a long game one time install of mods. So there\u0027s the list of suggested mods on RP1 wiki but is there a list of mods or mods you use with RP1 that are known to not break the game? Doing RP1 with sci Fi speculative realism. Also connections to systems outside our own if any will work with RP1.
