Anyway, I\u0027m looking for a mod that would allow me to create custom groups of parts or hide specific ones in the VAB/SPH. This way I could create a restricted set of stock parts that would be useful to explain KSP to my buddies and initiate them to basic rocketry, in sandbox mode. Is there a mod that already does this or a way to edit KSP files to get this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T02:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECopy your install to a different folder, delete all the parts you don\u0027t want.
