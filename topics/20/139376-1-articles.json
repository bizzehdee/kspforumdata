A tech node that in no way relates to any of the \u0027science\u0027 you just collected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if we modified things to make you work for your tech unlocks in a manner that makes sense?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the following concept:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of unlocking tech nodes in the tech tree by throwing hastily assembled science points at it, you progress through the tech tree by utilizing parts in the node you wish to unlock.\u00A0 I can think of a few different ways to approach this off the top of my head, but the way that I think would be both fun, and make sense is something I\u0027m going to call \u0027Prototyping\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the concept of prototyping, the science you earn to unlock a tech node normally is of no consequence.\u00A0 What we can \u0027do\u0027 with science points\u00A0can be thought about later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, the act of unlocking a tech node is akin to beginning research on a project.\u00A0 Using cash funds, you open a tech node for \u0027research prototyping\u0027.\u00A0 At this point, parts are unlocked for use, but their monetary cost to place on your rocket is greatly inflated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis phase, called the \u0027prototyping phase\u0027, lasts until you complete research of the parts.\u00A0 To complete the research of the parts, you must build vehicles that use these parts and perform\u00A0missions with them.\u00A0 What we define as \u0027missions\u0027 can be left open for discussion later in this thread (if anyone decides to comment), but as you build vehicles to use these parts and accrue points, you are actually actively creating vehicle prototypes and test beds for your tech node, putting your activities more in line with testing and prototyping phases for equipment in real life.\u00A0 When you acquire enough points (as a default, the amount of points equal to the number of science points needed to unlock the node in a normal game), the tech node comes out of prototyping, and becomes fully unlocked, allowing you access to further downstream nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this manner, the act of R\u0026amp;D is less building a compact instrument probe so you can fly it on a grand tour and unlock half the tech tree in one mission.\u00A0 The act of R\u0026amp;D is you actually using the parts and \u0027researching\u0027 them by using them.\u00A0 You are not required to use all the parts in a tech node (some parts are useless, or useless very quickly), but the more parts you utilize, the faster you can complete the prototyping in that node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, assuming you could create checks for parts like say, a ladder, and that it gets \u0027climbed on\u0027 at least once in a mission....\u00A0\u00A0 In order to unlock I believe it is \u0027space exploration\u0027 tech node, the node is first \u0027opened for R\u0026amp;D\u0027 using funds.\u00A0 At this point, the ladder part applicable is unlocked for use, but costs something like ten times more to utilize.\u00A0 In order to unlock the node for \u0027normal\u0027 use, the ladder must be put on a ship, said ship must be launched, and the ladder used.\u00A0 The more exotic the location, the more points accrued by using the ladder.\u00A0 But here\u0027s the catch... You cannot transmit R\u0026amp;D points back like you could science.\u00A0 You have to recover the part being tested IN-TACT! to acquire the points.\u00A0 (Engineers have to look at it, yes?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in this manner, you balance the risk and reward of prototyping.\u00A0 The further you go from the space center, the more \u0027research\u0027 you accrue for the part per sortie.\u00A0 But the further you go, the more difficult your recovery becomes by the nature of ensuring that it can survive the return trip.\u00A0 So, early game, on-pad testing nets you enough to get you going, but as tech nodes get better, the point requirement goes up, the more bold your testing operations have to become.\u00A0 You get maybe a 1 for 1 value for testing an engine on the pad, but you get maybe 3 to 1 in orbit, 5 to 1 on the mun, and so on...\u00A0 But in testing on the mun, you have to get the part BACK from the mun.\u00A0 You find a balance for what you can do for tests and where.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn effect, operating this way makes prototype vehicles using lots of new parts really expensive, but at the same time, very lucrative for testing...\u00A0 Assuming you can recover them in one piece.\u00A0 Parts generate points only if they\u0027re used (\u0027used\u0027 depending on what they actually do.\u00A0 For example, structure parts just need to work in flight for X amount of time under thrust, rocket motors need to fire), the parts produce ONE point per MISSION, multiplied by the highest\u00A0exotic location multiplier of the SoI/Biome it was at least used once in.\u00A0 And of course, the parts only generate said points if they are recovered on kerbin.\u00A0 (So, again, the engineers can look at them.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEX: A rocket motor used in on the pad, in flight, in orbit, and in the Mun\u0027s SOI would only count the Mun\u0027s SoI multiplier... and only count it if it was fired in that SoI.\u00A0 Otherwise it would fall back to the Kerbin orbit SoI if it was fired there, or further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther, this has the effect of making players TRY to keep their prototypes recoverable at all costs.\u00A0 Not only do you need those points, but the vehicle\u0027s stupid expensive, and you\u0027d be very upset to be unable to recover it and recoup the huge cost markup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcept, discuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T00:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you implied that the R\u0026amp;D points would only apply towards the node the part was from (I don\u0027t see it explicitly stated in a quick re-read) but that would make sense - would also allow a more balanced/even opening of the tech where you could work on multiple nodes at once.

I was thinking about something along those lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagined something like this: You have a basic node at the beginning and need to unlock other nodes by performing certain actions with certain parts at specific situations. The tech tree is not visible, you just unlock stuff along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you also mentioned, first you could only build prototypes, which are a lot more expensive, but also less reliable and have worse stats (battery with less EC, parachute that creates less drag, etc.). There could also be malfunctions (similar to the mod Kerbalism or dangit!) and the more you use a part and in the more situations, you would gather tech points for each part which then you can use to upgrade reliability and performance (similar to another brilliant mod:\u00A0Kerbal Research and Development).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther unlocks could have requirements like landing a craft on Kerbin using at least x amount of radial chutes and thus unlocking the prototype for the next biggest chute. So in a way that a new part is unlocked by the \u003Cem\u003Eneed \u003C/em\u003Efor it (as it would happen in RL).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in the tech tree there could be more complex requirements. For example, that in order to unlock a node, you first need to land on a certain body and retrieve a certain material that only exists there (An extension of this would be a mod where you require materials which have to be harvested on other bodies or refined in space to even build rockets using\u00A0certain parts; This would also give more reason to build and maintain\u00A0outposts and space stations, though not sure whether the game engine makes this possible at all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo pretty similar to what you had in mind in fact. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, since I don\u0027t even know how to read logs, I won\u0027t likely create such a mod anytime soon...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T21:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe repetitive aspects of science-collecting, and non-obviousness of what earns science-points, caused me to forget to even try to get science, but I still wanted to gradually work through the tech tree. \u00A0 I wanted something like suggested method of technology-tree advancement so much that I tried to implement it with pencil-and-paper. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI simplified somewhat:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Prototype parts are those in recently-unlocked nodes, those nodes needing sufficient Usage before the suppliers are able to produce parts on the following nodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Anything\u00A0in the KSP reward system counts as Usage of parts.
