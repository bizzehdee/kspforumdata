The place where the pipe go out the [Modular Girder Segment XL](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Modular_Girder_Segment_XL/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) is a small black circle with the diametre of the pipe to put a drill on, and to know where it will drill. The telescopic pipe use 5 electricity/sec when use.\n\n-a block with pipe in that go behind the [Modular Girder Segment XL](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Modular_Girder_Segment_XL/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) with pipe to make the pipe gain in size\n\nfor example the [Modular Girder Segment XL](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Modular_Girder_Segment_XL/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) go 10 meters deep\n\nthe [Modular Girder Segment XL](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Modular_Girder_Segment_XL/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) with the block go 160 meters deep\n\nwith two block behind each other go 310 meters deep\n\nthe block use 25 electricity / sec\n\n-a drill with the size of the pipe that can go in the ground to extract fuel/gaz/water (even if in that way water is useless), the drill can destroy every part but begin to be a little damaged when it have drill more than 300 metres deep or more than 10 objects of a ship, the drill can go in fuel tank to fill it with fuel but the fuel tank will drain itself when moving, will be useless when froozen and will explode when exposed to a hot place (so better to emptying the fuel than to fill it)(for all the broken probe that already have fuel can continue to help for other missions\n\n-a pump that can go behind the [Modular Girder Segment XL](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Modular_Girder_Segment_XL/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) with the pipe or behind the block, the pump transfer the liquid/gaz in a containers that can transfer it into a nonpurificated fuel tank or in a gaz tank (for the gaz it can directly go in Xenon containers). The pump can make the fuel go both direction. THe pump must be connect by a red [FTX-2 External Fuel Duct](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=FTX-2_External_Fuel_Duct/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) to transfer the fuel/gaz of the drill/tank to a fueltank/gaztank, the red [FTX-2 External Fuel Duct](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=FTX-2_External_Fuel_Duct/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) transfer pureless fuel, the pump can be fixed on a block, a pipe or on a pureless fuel tank or on a gaz tank.\n\n-a refinery that fit in a science lab and consume 1/10 his fuel to purify the fuel to go in fuel tank ready to use for next missions\n\n-a small block/circle like [Place-Anywhere 7 Linear RCS Port](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Place-Anywhere_7_Linear_RCS_Port/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) but different that go over fuel tank/gaztank to connect different ship too small for having [Clamp-O-Tron](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=Inline_Clamp-O-Tron/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1) to transfer every type of things it have in the tank, even water. This red pipe is remove by a kerblin or by an articular arm to the differents ships, that have the small block\n\n-different size of articular arms that can fix things on it like a thermometer or a fuel tank on both sides (for better clamp and better approach of other ship)\n\n-a wheel/engine that can have things fix on like solar panels or drill etc etc\n\n- a geodesic dome with plant in, one half is glass and let see the ovulution of the plant inside by a board to choose which plant to put and refil here is the use of underground water, the water is used at an insignificant rate but still funny to have, the geodesic dome can be use in landing station on different planet, not very huge but as fragile as the [RoveMax Model M1](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/index.php?title=RoveMax_Model_M1/fr\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1), the geodesic doem can be repair by the inside if a little broken, it have two door and can\u0027t have other thingsthan antenna fix on the glass\n\n-a small science lab that can use the underground water for research and research of purelessfuel / gaz\n\n-changement of parametrers that allow to rover without science lab to send it to the nearly science lab station for analyse it\n\n-one articular arm that can grab things slowly by magnetism:)\n\n-one tiny rocket that can go in the deployed pipe to shot other ship and lock one target for destroying it\n\n-a case for putting medium lander in without breaking them but that can open and close\n\n-for making those parts work, put on precise planet than can have it different composition of different fuel/gas/water at different deep like 5meter deep to 2000 meters deep\n\nThanks for reading or adding idea because it is just what i think that left to KerbalSpaceProgramm for a better gameplay and doing better missions. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nIf somebody able to make this mod want to call me, just send me a message, i can design with 3d program the differents parts. Thanks for reading/paying attention and sorry for the bad grammar, I\u0027m still learning how to speak English ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T20:33:01Z","Content":"Currently there\u0027s [Karbonite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401) for drilling for resources and [SCANsat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) for mapping.\n\nIn the next version of KSP (1.0) there will be some sort of resource extraction, based off Karbonite, and a mapping system.\n\nAdding another layer (depth) would be interesting, but I\u0027m not sure it would be interesting enough to bother making a separate mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T21:07:10Z","Content":"This sounds like a combination of a lot of existing mods.\n\nFor the articulating arms you can use [Infernal Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3?highlight=attachment\u002Bsystem), for the magnets you can use [Kerbal Attachment System (KAS)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29).\n\nAs mentioned above, Karbonite has drills, and the upcoming patch will feature stock drills and resources.\n\nYou may also want to check out the [Kolonization](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-8%29-2015-02-27?highlight=kolonization) mods, which add objects similar to your ideas of domes, etc.\n\nHope this helps!"}]}
