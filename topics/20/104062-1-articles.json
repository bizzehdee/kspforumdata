Here\u0027s a picture.\n\n![CCZV1yAWIAEKgfv.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCZV1yAWIAEKgfv.png)\n\nThe command/control pod the the M27 cockpit from the B9 aerospace set. The conical part below it, with a 2.5m top and a 3.75m bottom, is the the Utility section of the VAB system. It can hold 4 kerbonauts, and is named PXL-2 Pressurized Conical Storage Container. A plainer 2.5m cylindrical version, a bit taller, is labelled PXL-1 \u0022Hostel\u0022 and can accomodate 8 kerbonauts.Other Data: manufacturer = Kerbalmax Industries\n\nDescription text for the PXL-2 includes \u0022Unluckily for them, we couldn\u0027t afford seatbelts.\u0022\n\nThe PXL-2 has an astonishing 70 m/s Crash Tolerance.\n\nI can find it OK so as to use it, but I am trying to reduce the number of Mods I have loaded, and so far I have had no luck checking which Mod contains it. I am guessing that it is something that uses the anonymous part.cfg filename, but it may simply be a unique filename that doesn\u0027t have any obvious connection to the item name.\n\nI\u0027m feeling a bit frustrated right now. I might have missed something. It\u0027s this sort of problem which can make passing around CRAFT files awkward: I can find the name of the thing in-game, but I can\u0027t tell people which Mod they need. I know it\u0027s not KW Rocketry or Novapunch, I didn\u0027t need three different Mods covering the same area.\n\nIt occurs to me that I might be able to get somewhere with a general file search, but I am at a bit of a loss on that. Windows XP could do it, but Windows 7 seems to have it well-hidden..."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:28:49Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-0-90-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2817-11-2014-CTT-compatibility%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-0-90-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2817-11-2014-CTT-compatibility%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:31:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-0-90-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2817-11-2014-CTT-compatibility%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-0-90-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2817-11-2014-CTT-compatibility%29)\n\nBeat me to it.\n\nIt only took a quick search for kerbalmax."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:51:21Z","Content":"Thanks.\n\n(I think I could get faster searches of text-based files under MS-DOS.)\n\nIt\u0027s a good set.

I added a crew module and a service module from the Station Parts and NearFuture sets, and used it as a base. It can be landed from orbit at need, but it\u0027s meant to stay up at a station.\n\n![CCjrY7kW0AEgrHX.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCjrY7kW0AEgrHX.png)\n\nWith the length and the two sets of RCS thrusters it\u0027s good for manoeuvring larger station components. Or you could mount something other than a docking port at the nose. Remember the fuel crossfeed problem is you use a docking port rather than a decoupler. You need to check the fuel tanks before you undock from a booster."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T19:04:32Z","Content":"This is the current version of the rover-carrying lander that I had crashed in the original pic, up-thread.\n\n![CCp1wAiWMAApNvF.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCp1wAiWMAApNvF.png)\n\nThe fuel tank on the right is an attempt to balance the rover, both can be dropped off after a landing. There is also a general stiffening of the structure, though I think I may need to add a few more struts to take the load from the \u0027chutes opening for a landing on Kerbin. This does have the RCS capacity to act as a tug.\n\nThe TWR is crazy-high for Mun or Minmus. If you didn\u0027t expect a Kerbin landing, you could could cut back on the radial motors. You could also reduce the nass of RCS fuel, and maybe use a stock capsule with a docking port on the nose. It would help to use lighter landing legs. The main reason for the extended radius is to make it less sensitive to the ground slope at landing. This is certainly not the most efficient option, but it looks good.\n\nIf you want to use fairings it would look very ungainly."}]}
