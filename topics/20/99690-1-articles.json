Balancing is not symmetrical enough and I got roll issue as well as pitch issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea was to move center of lift in flight to keep controllability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I design an aircraft for space and return to Kerbol and I calculate and try the best position for CL (center of lift) at maxi take off weight, CG not moving during atmospheric climb as fuel is drained from 4 FT800 tanks, around CG, to 4 rapier engines. Fuel in other tanks is locked. Then I toggle to rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best position for CL give a certain gap between CG and CL. As CG moves keeping this value constant (between CG and CL) improves the controllability of the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor return and landing I looked what was the best tanks to keep 200-300 kg of fuel I need so that the CG would not be moved to far away from the Take off CG and I determine where was the best position for CL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to move CL as CG is moving to keep the same gap between CG an CL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I worked on movable swept wings attached to Adjustable rails from Magic smoke industries on each wing tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the plane with swept wings positioned for take off at max weight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=258047screenshot0.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/258047screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022258047screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwept wing are at middle course, I can nearly release the control, the space plane climbs steadily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=586482screenshot9.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/586482screenshot9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022586482screenshot9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the plane with 300Kg of fuel in the forward tank, all other tanks being empty.
