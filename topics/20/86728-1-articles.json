Fun in that I was able to figure out what most of the things did and a chore in that at a certain point there was nothing more to figure out from the configs provided.

If we could get an official primer on the moddable features introduced in 0.25 than that would really great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m interested in learning more about valueIds and which AffectReasons there are. Those two really define what can be done with strategies, so it\u0027d be great if this could be explained in detail. Previous updates often had such an overview of stuff and that really helped the mods made for those updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-15T22:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2014 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptRobau\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T02:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuplicate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
