However; my desktop recently went kerbal on me and powered up on stage burnout with too few struts (a power outage cooked the motherboard because of a faulty old surge protector). Now; playing on a laptop, lag has become a concern. I have certainly noticed that ships with mechjeb lag harder than those without, regardless of how many or few mech jeb windows are active. However, I still want all my flight and orbital info. I\u0027m soon doing a fresh install with minimal mods (my current download anything that looks cool approach is sub-optimal: I spend way too much time trying to do crazy things; rather than actually doing things) and if flight engineer is less lag prone; I will replace mech jeb with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also debating the following; on the basis of lag and over complicating things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKethane\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EB9 pack\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAirships and KAS (both or none; for base building)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFAR and the neccessitated fairings\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrTaxman","CreatedById":70450,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T17:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the B9 stuff and I use KAS plenty.

I personally deleted all stock windows and made my own that fit my needs. I haven\u0027t used flight engineer outside of VAB, but I don\u0027t think it has info like air needed for jets to work. It seems better in the VAB though as you can adapt TWR for any planet/moon and it shows individual stages as well. It might have been my ships fault, but flight engineer caused a second or two pause when adding or removing parts, it seemed to calculate dV and such. Also worth noting that MJ is the source of rather frequent FPS drops (like the game skips a frame every 10-30 seconds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Haven\u0027t tried Kethane, I might though after rebuilding my stuff in 0.21.
