Well, win x64 is unstable, I know it and really sad about it (though I am using Linux version, that have no such problems). OK. But what\u0060s the point of blocking and shutting mods on win x64?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, you are boycott Squad for instability of win x64. Well. But why because of this must suffer regular players? They do not care about your struggle for Stability, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and other %BigLetter%-ty. They just want to play in game with their favourite mods... but /gamedata/ is too big for x86 and KSP is crashing all the times, much more often than x64-version. Linux video drivers is not so good that I want, so I am understanding wish of big number of players to use Windows for playing KSP and other. Su, what the point?
