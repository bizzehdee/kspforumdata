Can somebody tell me optimal scramjet options? It should start work at 20km, and end work at 40km."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T16:09:38Z","Content":"Scramjets are atmospheric engines. Also these aren\\\u0027t scramjets. It says \\\u0027ramjet intake\\\u0027 which, at best, means subsonic.\n\nThere\\\u0027s very little air at those altitudes, not enough to make a standard engine work, scram or otherwise."},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T18:54:32Z","Content":"Actually ramjets work best over supersonic speeds. But the lack of air explanation makes sense. Since there\\\u0027s only one ramjet engine, and there\\\u0027s no intake configuration possible, that means that if it stops working at a certain altitude/speed then there\\\u0027s nothing to be done about it; that will change in the future."}]}
