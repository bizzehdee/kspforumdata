This could be done through the use of separate\u00A0parts \u00A0or as an option that can be changed both in editor and in flight. \u00A0The bubble should have a near infinite thermal tolerance but i think it would be more realistic if the power usage was proportional\u00A0to both the size of the bubble and the heat acting on it. Also the bubble should have drag that depends on the diameter.\u00A0\u00A0 here is an example of how it would look. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329763-100-magnetic-bubble-may-give-space-probes-a-soft-landing/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329763-100-magnetic-bubble-may-give-space-probes-a-soft-landing/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mg22329763.100-1_800.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mg22329763.100-1_800.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-18T22:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2017 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Mlg Dank Meme lord\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-19T07:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, we need this so we can make the spaceship from passengers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
