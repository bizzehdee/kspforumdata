I\u0027m using Ferram Aerospace and Procedural Fairings, and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. Now, Ferram usually makes things easier (read: less dV to reach orbit), but the mod is acting like the radiators are deployed even when they\u0027re stowed inside the fairing. Apparently this is a problem with Interstellar, not Ferram. In any case, I need a fix for this problem if I\u0027m going to construct big things in orbit. I just need help on a lot of things, really. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you have updated both mods (Ferram is on 13.3 and interstellar is on .11) so see if updating fixes things, also Don\u0027t deploy your radiators inside the atmosphere, they will fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScallopPotato","CreatedById":98794,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake sure you have updated both mods (Ferram is on 13.3 and interstellar is on .11) so see if updating fixes things, also Don\u0027t deploy your radiators inside the atmosphere, they will fall off.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do need to update Ferram, not sure about Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ScallopPotato\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ScallopPotato\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do need to update Ferram, not sure about Interstellar.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might be your problem then.
