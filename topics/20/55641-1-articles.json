I think incorporating a similar practice could allow you to use mods for one save but not the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could just remove the mod folder (depending on the mod) as well before loading back in your \u0022vanilla\u0022 save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFyi, I have used this method to make a career mode save with 50,000 science lmao\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T12:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea second installation of KSP is also easily made\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
