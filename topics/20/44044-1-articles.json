Cheating would be manipulating the crucial system files in the game. For example, you reach Tylo and you\u0027re low on fuel, so you edit some file(s) to refill your tanks. That\u0027s cheating and it\u0027s pretty pathetic if you ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is an autopilot addon and KSP is a sandbox. It\u0027s an extension, a very good one actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried it but don\u0027t use it anymore. Not just because it ceased to function properly when I started with v0.21, but also because I don\u0027t do large scale projects that would require tedious and numerous launches to get lots of fuel and other stuff into orbit, so I don\u0027t need any automatic approach to problem solving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to explore and have fun doing weird stuff, so I enjoy developing rockets and flying them, even if they crash sometimes. It\u0027s all part of the experience. Using MechJeb for that would take away some of that \u0022Kerbal\u0022 feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
