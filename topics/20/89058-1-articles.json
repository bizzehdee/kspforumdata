The easy part would be to make an animation to open the hatch (thats dead simple) but then you have to replace every single stock pod/cockpit. Next up you\u0027d need to move the kerbal out. And, someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but custom Kerbal animations haven\u0027t been done yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s very possible, but we need some custom animations first. (to animate the kerbal going out...because, it would be silly just to have the door open, then POP kerbal is in front of a door and it\u0027s closing.
