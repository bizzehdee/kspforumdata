I decided my reactor would be 50% efficient... or rather that it generates 2x as much power as it consumes - so it only has to decelerate the ion stream enough to remove 1/2 its kinetic energy. Given KE = 1/2 mv^2, this means approximately an ISP of approximately 70% the maximum listed over here at atomic rockets: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#hbfusion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#hbfusion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat results in an ISP of 70,000 (!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I decided that a net output of 500 Megawatts was \u0022reasonable\u0022, and a reactor weight of 3.5 tons was \u0022reasonable\u0022, and calculated how much thrust I could get with that much power, at 70,000 ISP.... Skipping the calculations (I can show if you want)... I arrived at 1,428.6 Newtons... or 1.428 kN -\u0026gt; which I rounded to 1.5 kN.... 3x the thrust of the games Ion Engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E (though these ion engines are already unrealistically powerful for gameplay purposes, since you can\u0027t time warp with active engines) - with a much much worse T:W ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to 1/2mv^2 ... if you lower your ISP by 10x, you can increase your thrust by 100x... so I figured I\u0027d do that, so I did some technobabble about how a high energy ion beam is used to superheat the Xenon propellant into a plasma...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I figured this system would be ~80% efficient.... so I made another thruster, this time with only 7,000 ISP (1/10th the max), and instead of 1.5 kN, I multiplied that by 80.... 120 kN of thrust.... Now we\u0027re talking:) It uses the Nuclear engine model, and adds another 1 ton (reasonable I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d be surprised how many Xenon tanks you can go through with such an engine... but it easily achieves SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems a bit OP\u0027d I\u0027m not sure this 1/10th ISP, 80x thrust engine is a good idea.... seems a bit unrealistic... but I did the math... and it seems to me that if one assumes a 500 MW reactor that fuses P-B11 (If you used Helium3-Deuterium, you\u0027d get even higher ISPs!) is reasonable... then it seems this would be the result... maybe I need to crank up the reactor weight......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T08:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHrmmm, lest someone read this and think its realistic, I realized I made a mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReducing ISp by 10x increases the mass accelerated by 100x, but not the thrust, as you accelerate 100x as much mass per second to only 1/10th the velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 7,000 ISP thruster would only get ~15 kN of thrust....
