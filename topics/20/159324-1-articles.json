I posted a couple years ago a thread regarding my desire to create probe parts, as I felt probes in KSP were desperately lacking the love they deserve. Unfortunately, despite the kind words and encouraging comments, the process quickly overwhelmed me, as I was unsure how to process with the mod-creation process, and my texture work leaves alot to be desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that was two years ago, and now I ask all of you a seemingly simple question: which areas of the game do you believe need improving upon; what niche or niches need to be filled to make the game more of what it can be? Of course, Squad provides us with the results of their hard work and we appreciate what they give us, but there are many of us that are left wanting more. Perhaps we feel that the game should be more realistic, and thus we want more mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, DRE, RemoteTech, and Kerbalism. Or maybe we feel that our dreams cannot be fulfilled by the limited collection of parts, so we yearn for more parts. Whatever the reason, there are many who are left wanting more. And that is where this thread comes in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, please, don\u0027t hold back, and tell me what you all would love to see. My main area is in 3D Modeling, with a little basic programming under my belt. What I don\u0027t know, I am willing to learn, so even if it seems complex, I will try my darndest at making it happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time, and I can\u0027t wait to see what my fellow members of the KSP community have to say regarding this subject!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T05:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a previous version of this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138886-what-mod-should-i-make/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T12:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething I\u0027ve wanted for a while is a mod to intergrate with texture replacer so that if a kerbal is standing within a closed fairing or cargo bay, then you are able to remote the kerbal\u0027s helmet, even off world such as in orbit or on the m\u00FCn. \u00A0I figure this may be possible with something like the occlusion thing for reentry heat or hiding parts in fairings and cargo bays from the atmospheric drag model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso a mod that could replace a kerbal head with a more human looking one, with a GUI to adjust the model to my kids faces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T14:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn X-20 would be pretty cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T14:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely not as cool as an X-20, but I\u0027ve recently wanted more realish communication and military satellite parts.
