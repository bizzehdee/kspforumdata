The problem with this is - although KSP is a small game in itself - it\u0027s not very practical. Let\u0027s say I have my regular \u0027vanilla\u0027 save, I then duplicate the entire KSP folder and start adding mods. I decide to add Mod \u0027A\u0027 to the \u0027gameData\u0027 folder - so it\u0027s working fine. Then I want to add mod \u0027B\u0027 but I don\u0027t want this mod to apply to my sandbox game I have running with the mod \u0027A\u0027 version. So I duplicate the original KSP folder again - I now have three folders, each around 2gb. You can see how this can add up pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my specific case and for the time being, I would only need two versions of the game (one for modded sandbox/modded career and one for modded career with the RemoteTech mod) so this workaround could be enough but if I would like better solution than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know a way to solve this problem, such as a mod manager?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T02:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy way: CKAN can export a list of all currently installed mods.

It throws an error because of the hidden .DS_Store file that\u0027s in every directory on Macs for some reason. If you delete that file from the instance directory it will work.
