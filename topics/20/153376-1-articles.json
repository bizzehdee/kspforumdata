So while trying to find ways around this i thought that a mod could be created that essentially turned a craft into part of the terrain. It would essentially turn stuff into a immovable, unrecoverable, terrain feature that wouldnt have any parts and couldnt break apart. This would solve lag problems while still retaining the aesthetics of expertly designed building and vehicles. You could create 1 kilometer long runways that didnt have 1000 parts. Basically creating runways like the one at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and island. Similar to the way Kerbal Konstructs allows you to create and place stationary objects but also combined with the welding mod from a while back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope i explained that well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T21:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Konstructs basically does this, but you use 3D models that are imported and set them at specified areas, they act like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings. You can launch from them, but sadly you can\u0027t have them be like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you can\u0027t click on them and go to a custom \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gman_builder","CreatedById":152775,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-13T14:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142607-legoclone09/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022142607\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142607-legoclone09/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@legoclone09\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0YEah but im saying a mod that can allow you to freeze current vessels into the terrain. With kerbal Konstructs you have to import models and use a editor and stuff. Im talking combining Kerbal Konstructs and the welding mod form a while back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
