So it would be a mod for a Dragon v2, but the pressure vessel for the crew is the actual pod and the rest of the Dragon are stand-alone parts, such as SuperDraco engine packs, heat shield, the actual capsule minus the crew pod, docking port, parachute, engine parts, and heat shield with nodes to connect those components. Without the \u0022crew pod\u0022 part, cargo of sorts could be put into the Dragon v2, allowing\u00A0for the building of things such as Red Dragon and whatever other landers based on the general Dragon v2 design by adding or removing components. Perhaps less realistic than it could be, but it could be a fun idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA horrendous paint image I made that generally shows what I want to do...
