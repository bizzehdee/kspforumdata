That\u0027s just a fact, lets just get that clear first and foremost.\n\nSeriously however I would like to know what mods there are that add decals you can place onto the side of you craft. Preferably just for fuel tanks. What really made me want to ask however is because *I know* there was a mod I saw a few months back that did just this. But I cannot for the life of me find it. And if by chance there are any other decal mods please share. Infact... please share and and ALL rocket cosmetic/beautification mods you can think of. Im also looking for some really nice fairings... Gonna use Blackheart\u0027s for now. Hope they still work as well as his tank textures."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T18:31:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m actually gonna use this thread to ask another question for now. I\u0027m having trouble with textures for Procedural Parts. The ones that come with it work as do Blackhearts in his own folder.\n\nHowever MainSailor\u0027s textures do not show up. Now I dropped those textures in. With the stock textures along with a cfg that came with the pack. One texture shows up in game. So what could be the issue? Should I keep MainSailor\u0027s textures in one folder in GameData like blaclheart instead? Or is there something I\u0027m missing here?\n\nEdit: Solved.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T20:34:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T18:39:32Z","Content":"This mod basically turns your flags into placeable objects\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46856-0-21-1-Flag-Decals-and-Flagpole-New-File-Structure](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46856-0-21-1-Flag-Decals-and-Flagpole-New-File-Structure)\n\nEDIT: I just realized there is no download link in his thread now, but here:\n\n[http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222813-flag-decals-v2-1#t1:changes](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222813-flag-decals-v2-1#t1:changes)"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T19:01:03Z","Content":"There is also this one: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update%21-Quality-fix-more](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update%21-Quality-fix-more)"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T19:50:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There is also this one: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update%21-Quality-fix-more](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100984-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-Decals-Update%21-Quality-fix-more)\n\nThat\u0027s the one!
