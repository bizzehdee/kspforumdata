If I am orbiting the camera all over the place, trying to align with a contract satellite mission, etc... I may have to do this more than once to help ensure I am adjusting my normal to result in the needed direction of the contract.\n\nIt would be convenient for something like an arrow sprite that renders tangential to the orbit pointing in front of the vessel. Or am I alone in thinking this could be useful?\n\n(Yes I know I could look at my AP/PE and see which time-to was shorter)"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:38:14Z","Content":"Try this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543)"},{"CreatedByName":"JetJaguar","CreatedById":146965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T12:04:11Z","Content":"When I\u0027m not sure which way I\u0027m orbiting in the map view, I\u0027l click on the orbit near the vehicle I\u0027m flying and create a temporary maneuver node. The prograde and retrograde markers will then tell you which direction you\u0027re travelling."}]}
