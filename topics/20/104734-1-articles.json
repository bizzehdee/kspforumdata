I\u0027m interested in creating my own textures and remakes of the stock parts, but I don\u0027t have a way to easily convert .mbm files to .png files and back, so I can\u0027t currently. I\u0027ve heard that there was a program in the past that could convert KSP textures to png\u0027s and back, meaning it would be a ton easier to edit textures.

I want to take the stock textures, and revamp them or edit them. Not create a new part or texture by itself. Thanks though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T05:17:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 05:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T05:27:27Z","Content":"Sorry thought this would have been on the list [https://github.com/krupski/MBM_Utilities](https://github.com/krupski/MBM_Utilities)"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T05:31:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sorry thought this would have been on the list [https://github.com/krupski/MBM_Utilities](https://github.com/krupski/MBM_Utilities)\n\n![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) OMG that might be exactly what I\u0027m looking for.\n\nEDIT: Yeah that\u0027s exactly what I was looking for. Rep! I highly suggest you post this on the Mod development page and ask for it to be put into texturing. I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one who would benefit.
