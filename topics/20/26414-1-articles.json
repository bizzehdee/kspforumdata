My orbits were usually 50-75k off from the apogee to the perigee, which was making it almost impossible for ME to dock or build any solar system... not to mention try and match that orbit everytime...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I downloaded Mechjeb. My problem is that Mechjeb doesn\u0027t show up in my Parts menu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I noticed when moving folders. I do not have the \u0022Patcher_data\u0022 \u0022Plugindata\u0022 or \u0022Plugins\u0022 folders in my KSP folder. These simply were not there when I installed it. (I believe I have the newest version, 1-19-1-(1) is what it shows up as.) So anyhow, I decided to simply create a plugins folder and drag the .dll over to it. Then I dragged the parts folder(s) (each individual parts folder) into the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder under KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the program loads and shows the bar at the bottom of the screen I see mechjeb parts flashing by as it is loading, however while building a rocket non of the parts show up in the control, or any other tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and all help would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Here is the picture taken from the MechJeb Installation guide on the Spaceport, you can see the 3 folders I am talking about that I do not have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/wp/wp-content/themes/kerbal/images/kspRoot.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kspRoot.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gabmaia","CreatedById":33005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T18:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere should be no problems with what you did, just try copying all the contents from the zip file to your ksp folder again and fire it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T19:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou aren\u0027t playing with the demo, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jwmflying14","CreatedById":65900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T19:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I figured it out.
