Would that be possible to mod into Kerbal? Sure making maneuvers, precise burns and waiting years in game to get to where you want to is fun from a realism standpoint, but whizzing through space in a small cruiser and exploring would not only be more fun, but would also open new possibility for mods like \u0022To Boldly go\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T07:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly put: No. KSP is a exactly not a game of \u0022whizzing through space\u0022. The bodies themselves are rather meh, so if one could get there without the challenge the game would be a third rate NMS. This is about the only game written for people who thinks orbital mechanics are fun, so nobody who take an interest in it wants to remove the orbital mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have heard really good things about Space Engineers, that game might be more to your liking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hms_warrior","CreatedById":142205,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T10:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly put: Yes. All you need to do is activate the cheat menue (alt\u002Bf12) and activate infinite Fuel. There is a mod somewhere that allows to timewarp with engines running. Stoping at will would, however, require you to match the gravity-forces with your engines...that would be a bit tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(not saying that playing that way would be fun tho.
