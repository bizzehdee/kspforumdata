KW Rocketry is great for fairings and 3.75m parts. Lots of people like HOME for bases.

For one it allows you to connect fuel lines between vessels which makes land-based refueling far less frustrating (land docking is very annoying to do), pretty useful if you\u0027re already using kethane. The crane parts are great as well, I built a rover crane which I used to assemble my Munbase out of separately launched modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane is a pretty obvious recommendation. While scanning for kethane is a bit dull and slow kethane opens up new possibilities for missions. Want to simulate sample return automated (or not) mission? Add a drill and kethane tank and mine it full then return it to kerbin. In addition you can do in-situ fuel production for return missions like Mars Direct wanted. Also designing mining and refining rigs can be a bit of a challenge due to the power requirements, unless you\u0027re content with just using the kethane-powered electric generator (but even then you need more drills to fuel the converters and the generator).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter is a nice mod I recommend if you ever want to fly planes on oxygen-less atmospheric worlds as it adds electric propellers (in addition to helicopter rotors, VTOL propellers and other fun aircraft parts).

KSPX is also a good content mod, as the parts fit with the stock look. MechJeb REALLY helps with some more advanced things in-game and, in my opinion should be integral to the game, as the amount of stuff it can do for you is amazing. Crew Manifest is another one that is important to me, it lets you play with Kerbals in crew modules more easily, without needing EVA. Procedural wings is just a plugin that lets you make wings of any size or shape you need, as you need them. There are two models, one that fits with the stock style of wings, and one that fits better with B9 Aerospace parts.

I see this mod as the \u0022Science and Probes\u0022 supplement to KW Rocketry, just like B9 is the Aerospace supplement in my eyes. Anyhow, it\u0027s still under heavy development and the descriptions are currently, to my knowledge, in need of some heavy English re-works, but my point stands, it\u0027s a GREAT mod if you\u0027re looking for more variety when building probes and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T04:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 04:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by M5000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T03:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I got some, see sig V Did I make good choices?
