Just a simple button in the UI that when pressed, makes your whole rocket goes kaboom. Totally for range safety role play option and not because I want to see explosions. *Totally.*\n\nCould possibly have a lock that prevent this button from activating if there are kerbal on board. Might be something that can go with the abort sequence, so you can also eject your kerbals in time."},{"CreatedByName":"Redhotita1","CreatedById":90870,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:10:22Z","Content":"What about glitching some separatrons and making them fire towards a tank so it overheats, explode, and let the rest of the rocket crash to itself?"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:19:31Z","Content":"As far as I recall there is a mod that will explode your craft with a hot key you can set."},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:44:10Z","Content":"This should be that mod I think\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25830-1-0-2-TAC-Self-Destruct-v1-5-1-13May](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25830-1-0-2-TAC-Self-Destruct-v1-5-1-13May)"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T00:19:45Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s the one."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T08:11:35Z","Content":"There\u0027s also [Kaboom!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105026) which lets you explode individual parts."}]}
