I\u0027ve found some addons, but most of them wont work together. Do you guys and girls have any tips on which addons make it realistic as possible? I also like to have the tech tree a little bigger, with more parts!\n\nI also looked into the reddit post about Scott Manleys Interstellar Quest, but they dont seem to work in 1.0.4. (atleast CKAN wont allow me to download them, seems like it says its not compatible)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:46:48Z","Content":"Most of the Interstellar Quest mods works well in 1.04, also if KSP says different.\n\nFor realism, look for Real Solar System/Realism Overhaul."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T11:27:21Z","Content":"Ferram Aerospace Research, Engine ignitor(?), Remote tech 2"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T11:42:41Z","Content":"[Realism Overhaul](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966)"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T11:48:31Z","Content":"Oh, so many.
