With a bigger rocket (either built in orbit or launched in one go) and a few mod parts like near future propulsion you could probably land on the planets and moons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T17:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kerbonaut101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T17:47:46Z","Content":"I mean the planets are glitched the terrain may disappear or not be as smooth as it looks once you are close enough to land. No need to be offended I am only telling you what I heard. It isn\u0027t that you can\u0027t get there it\u0027s the planets themselves that are glitched. Also talking about a gas giant that doesn\u0027t even have the same planet terrain mods as normal planets does not prove any point you were trying to make."},{"CreatedByName":"gannon2145","CreatedById":148182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:14:04Z","Content":"I would wait for the mod to be fixed--right now it\u0027s quite buggy and landing on many of the bodies is glitchy if not impossible."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T15:54:45Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know of any delta-V maps for Kerbol Plus.

Workaround for that is to quicksave, edit it to landed, and load again."}]}
