I told him that i wanted to do a similar thing for \u003Ca href=\u0022http://d-mp.org\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDMP\u003C/a\u003E a while back and would love to have a \u0022wich mod lincludes part x\u0022 search on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceDock\u003C/a\u003E. I suggested to include CKAN into this, since they distribute metadata. In addation tot he parts stats it would be great to have an image of that part so my idea is to ther have some sort of headless render setup or/and some sort of mod that generates them on players ksp games (as crowdsource campain). EIther way non of us has the time to implement those things but i would be willing to contribute the needed Server resources to make it happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for posting it here is to ask for opinions, ideas how to implement it and folks who are willing to build such a setup (given that CKAN and the rest involved are ok with it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
