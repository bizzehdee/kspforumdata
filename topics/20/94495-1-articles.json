Once you get more advanced probe cores, pilots aren\u0027t necesary anymore and once science is maxed, training scientists doesn\u0027t make a difference. But engineers, OTOH, have relevant skills no matter the tech tree. And here comes the problem, IMHO: training engineers (ok, all kerbals anyway) in preparation for a mission (say, a Jool-5) becomes tedious: Make a large kerbal transport, fill it with your untrained crew, land it on Minmus, EVA all kerbals, plant flags, take them to short trip into sun\u0027s orbit, return to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat for every new batch of kerbonauts you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wonder if some cheat mod can be done which gets your kerbals at level three (or more) the moment you hire them at the Astronaut Complex\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesa","CreatedById":130333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T15:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, there is a mode that does it.
