I am usually browsing at long burns but i want to demount my 2nd screen. I don\u0027t know anything about modding, so here da questionz:\n\n1 is it technically possible to do?\n\n2 do you like to see that too?\n\nor\n\n3 is my idea crap?\n\n4 thanks for reading. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:01:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tyren**"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:43:39Z","Content":"Technically possible, but tricky. It would mean finding a cross-platform web browser component for C# (as opposed to an IE web browser component that\u0027ll only work in Windows).
