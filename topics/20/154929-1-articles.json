It wouldn\u0027t really be fair to say panels get \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E amount dustier per day just based on the environment they are in. However if a rover is driving around or ships are landing/taking off near bases, it\u0027s feasible to say that dust is falling on the solar panels. It does still present a problem for remote rovers however since they would continue to get dustier and dustier with no kerbals to clean them off. Would there then be random occurrence of wind storms that blow through with a random amount of dust getting blown off the panels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea, because it\u0027s a realism thing, but not sure a lot of necessary gameplay is in place to really make it worth dealing with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
