The newer Interstallar has so many mods that aren\u0027t updated they don\u0027t work well (Interstellar itself is out of date).

It is pretty much clouds only (and those clouds look better than Interstellar IMO).

I\u0027m not sure why EoO seems confusing when you first install. It really isn\u0027t but does require you to slow down and follow step by step directions. After installing go into your Game Data/BoulderCo/CityLights/Textures folder and remove the tga files (leave the png) - trust me, it will keep you from asking why the dark side of Kerin looks weird. Once your clouds and city lights are looking awesome, try adding Distant Object Enhancement so you can spot planets and moons. I also love Planet Shine and Scatterer. All of these work in 1.04 even if they are seemingly out of date. The Kerbal Universe is beautiful with these mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T17:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
