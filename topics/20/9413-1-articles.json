Initial load time is within the Kerbal \u0027Snore\u0027 Zone (that area of time when Bill and Bob fall asleep during a mission, and Jeb has to noogy them to get them awake). Which got me to wondering ... is there a mod manager of any sort, which will increase the load time of KSP, depending on what you want to do when you load up? If not, I have enough basic programming knowledge to do something similar (so long as all the mods have a prefix code ... hoping most of the mod/part developers have done so, and so far, I think they have).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust curious if there\\\u0027s something like this already, so I don\\\u0027t waste my limited time trying to develop something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWired2theNet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T07:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at GME; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=997.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=997.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use it, its pretty swell; can manage not only Parts folders, but Ships and Plugins as well.
