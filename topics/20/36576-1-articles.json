The aerodynamics from FAR are nice, but they break MechJeb\u0027s landing autopilot on anything with an atmosphere and also cause deadly reentry to apply way too much heat on reentry. Are there any fixes for this at this point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"redteddy23","CreatedById":57312,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T22:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about DR but I have an install with FAR and Mechjeb. When it comes to landings in atmosphere I just have to estimate based on experience. To get MJ to work out landings for FAR it would have to have all the calculations it uses redone to take into account FAR\u0027s more complicated model for drag and the forces applied to your ship, which is possible I guess but I know of no alternate MJ build. You can use the landing window to show target and estimated landing then burn retrograde until you are landing in behind your target from between 20 to 200km. The distance depends mainly on two things, how shallow your re-entry is and how aerodynamic your ship is. For a barely controlled rocket coming down end first there will be a lot of drag and the overshoot will have to be big, for a controllable plane a lot less as you can dive down into a horizontal landing approach. Obviously a steep re-entry will land closer to the target as the drag forces are not acting as much horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T23:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf sources are included on both you can try rewriting MJ2 landing guidance - would be mostly copypaste from FAR code I guess.

Mechjeb is useful, however. The \u0027Prevent Flameout\u0027 works fairly well if you set the margin high enough; I use 10% with most designs. Additionally, the information tabs are quite useful for determining when you have a good apoapsis for the climb out. Just don\u0027t use Mechjeb to fly the ship when in the atmosphere for planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rockets, ascent guidance works but you need to have a cleanly designed rocket. Additionally, I\u0027ve found that any active fins should be set to \u0027roll\u0027 only or you risk having your rocket shake itself to pieces. Additionally, you need lots of gimbal authority to stay under control until you get up to speed where the vehicle becomes aerodynamically stable. That, and EVERYTHING needs to be in a fairing or the drag is going to be really high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T03:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR \u002B MechJeb is much harder than I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T18:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the responses, it looks like there isn\u0027t an easy fix at this point. With how popular FAR \u002B MechJeb is hopefully someone can put together a MechJeb build that supports the FAR flight model (way beyond my limited programming skills). Deadly Reentry issues sound like its more an issue of me not being terribly good at designing/flying craft for atmospheric reentry. I probably should aim for a much gentler slope into the atmosphere instead of blasting straight down (like mechjeb sometimes likes to do) and hoping I put on enough heat shielding...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom question: does anyone have any working designs for an Eve lander (would be nice if it was capable of returning to Eve orbit) that utilizes this combination of mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T13:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith DR and FAR, you should set your PE somewhere between 20 km and 29 km, depending on reentry speed.
