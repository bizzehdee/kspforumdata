The problem? It leans to the left, but if I build the same design shit but with vanilla pieces and ACS systems, it doesn\\\u0027t lean, is there something I am missing here? ![15wcjg5.jpg](http://i49.tinypic.com/15wcjg5.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"TerranCmdr","CreatedById":23552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:49:12Z","Content":"You\\\u0027re talking about it being off-center, right? Go back to your source file, make sure your object\\\u0027s pivot is centered on your object, and make sure your object is at 0,0,0 in your scene. Then re-export and try again.\n\nIf that doesn\\\u0027t fix it, take a loot at your cfg files. Sometimes the axes get a little screwy. I was working on a part last night where I had to put Y values for Z and vice versa, and that fixed it right up.\n\nLet me know if you have any luck. I\\\u0027m still a noob at modding myself."}]}
