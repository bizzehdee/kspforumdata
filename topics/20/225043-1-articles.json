So you would be able to see each convertor, input resources, output resources, and maybe a efficiency option. You would be able to toggle each convertor on and off, as well as see the total resources going into convertors and total resources leaving convertors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould also be cool if it supported some of the more popular mods, such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026amp; Pathfinder. If it did support these mods, it would be useful to have a dropdown or something for their respective switchable convertors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think such a mod could significantly improve gameplay in heavily modded installs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would probably have to update every frame or ship update rather than scene change, because lots of mods switch convertors in-flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
