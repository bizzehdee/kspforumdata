(If not already and me just beeig ignorant^^)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be like hitting backspace, then a number for the mode, and swoosh... or just sudden silence followed by high levels of activity on the navball \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not requesting it, merely checking out, if there\u0027d be any sort of interest at all, to have such a thing and enough people wanting it and modders considering to code it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is, consider it requeted ;P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
