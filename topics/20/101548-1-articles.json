Im not in love with the whole budget and upgrading facilities but i do like the way you have to rescue kerbals, survey areas, land on planets, orbit and make satellites. Is there any mod out there that allows these contracts to work on sandbox or science?. (Not the part contracts where you have to test them, they are very annoying).\n\nBut if anyone knows of a mod or a way on how to do this please drop a comment. Thanks for taking the time to read this post and help me/others.\n\n-Sam ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T18:57:37Z","Content":"Why not just play the Science game as there is 3 to pick 1 sandbox then 2nd Science game and 3nd Science and budget ?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T08:59:23Z","Content":"In career mode, give yourself infinite funds and use [Rejector](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108316) to get rid of the contracts you don\u0027t want.
