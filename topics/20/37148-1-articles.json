If you like the orbit and want it to scan Kethane like that forever than there\u0027s really nothing more to say. Could definitely look visibly better if that\u0027s something you care for. It could even use a tiny baby xenon engine with some fuel if you want it to do small orbital changes. Of course, you\u0027d probably need bigger batteries to have a larger electricity supply for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou actually dont need to scan the whole planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei never put a kethane probe polar since i wouldnt want my mining station too far from the equator anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehowever... if you are sending an ISA MapSat probe; you need to orbit it at\u0026gt; 80 inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyways...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget back to your question\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei usually try to put everything in my probes so that i only need one single probe sitting at each planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormally my all-in-one probe is like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboth Kethane scanner and ISA MapSat surveying unit in the same probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand usually i put at least a couple of those 500unit batteries and at least one thermal generator; trust me you dont want your probe dies during an interplanetary transit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand since the gigantor solar plannel is OP; i always pack a pair of it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese things altogether is a ton or two at least and ion engine cant give a meaningful thrust for my probe then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso i always use the LV-N engine on my probes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esometimes i would snap a small size Ordin Telescope on it too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand in rare occasions which i may want to refuel my probe; i\u0027ll add a Kerbal Attachment System port together with a few grips on it. so that someone from the refueling ship can EVA to the probe refueling it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-15T06:55:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2013 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lammatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bobert577","CreatedById":72153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you don\u0027t need any help!
