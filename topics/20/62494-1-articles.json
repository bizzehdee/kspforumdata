Now I\u0027m here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, does ANYONE have any knowledge of modifying kerbals, as in doing something like... changing EVA propellant from 5 to like... 9785? Anything is appreciated. Not sure if this is a \u0027valid\u0027 modding question, or if it infringes any kind of squad legal things. If it does infringe such legal things, thread can be locked, as I have no knowledge of anything related to the actual logistics of kerbals, and have scoured google about this topic very thoroughly.
