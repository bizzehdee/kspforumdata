It\u0027s me again! I got another idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to fix the issues I see with the mod community (namely distribution and updating) and to that end I have been looking for a way to standardize mod submissions. So, first I got to thinking about having the mod authors put a file in with their submissions that would include all the vital information. But one quick look around here was enough to prove that idea would not fly. Secondly I tried to figure out where mod authors would rather host their mod and then enforce a type of standardization that way. But the general answer was wherever they [darn] well please so that got nowhere. But this time I think I got it, something that the mod authors would want and a way to standardize submissions! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I envision is a program, a tool. This is how I propose the tool would work for an author\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuthor finishes work on an update for a mod. They open this tool, select the mod from the list of projects, type in the information to add to the changelog/forum/github/curse/kerbalstuff. Press submit and DONE. The tool takes the files, zips them up with a *.info file and sends them to wherever the author wants their mods hosted. It would update forum posts, upload files to the host(s) of the author\u0027s choosing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting is a SINGLE point of submission while maintaining multiple locations for coverage. And it CAN be done. Automating tasks on websites can be easily done and it is even easier if the website in question has API calls like forums and github. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here is the biggest question about it. If we build it, will you USE it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
