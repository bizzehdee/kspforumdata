This means that you can concentrate on flying while performing the mission and then go back in time. If you click the \u0022Replay\u0022 button, then the game will basically replay your flight and repeat all actions that you have performed, to create a perfect simulation. You only need to control the camera...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not create a mod that allows for this in KSP?
