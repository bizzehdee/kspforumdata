As long as a player has a good enough grasp of the basics to understand what MJ is doing they can attempt it themselves. The way MJ is introduced in career mode does a great job preventing early over reliance on it. Besides, most players eventually realize that they can fly better than Mechjeb and scale back their usage as they improve. Pretty much all I use it for these days is the dV calculator, orbital info, and for flying extremely long maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d caution newer players to wait until they\u0027ve hit some of the early milestones (like Mun landing) before trying Mechjeb, then go crazy with it if they want to. MJ is like trying to teach someone math and handing them a TI-89. Too soon and it hinders their learning, but eventually it becomes a great tool for learning more advanced concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
