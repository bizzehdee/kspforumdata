Please note - it\u0027s proper aerospikes I\u0027m interested in rather than the plugnozzle design in stock that is erroneously called an aerospike. I\u0027m mainly wanting something like a Pegasus/Ithacus type vehicle to use as a standardised heavy lifter to LKO, although it might be nice to be able to build a smaller version that could be used as a manned Duna lander. I\u0027ve some interest in linear aerospikes designs for Shuttle-type craft, but am most interested in large circular aerospikes.\n\nEsme"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T00:26:33Z","Content":"Not familiar with aerospikes so I\u0027m not sure if the Convair NEXUS mod ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121017](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121017)) is a proper aerospike - but it\u0027s definite a heavy lifter."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T12:16:05Z","Content":"There is a much better model of stock aerospike in Ven\u0027s stock revamp.
