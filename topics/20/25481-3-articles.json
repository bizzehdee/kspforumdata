But whenever I see someone\u0027s picture of \u0027awesome achievement X\u0027 with MechJeb open I just find myself thinking, well, you didn\u0027t really achieve that did you. Of course I never usually say that, people should be able to play the game however they want - they paid money, they should enjoy it however they want to without someone telling them they\u0027re wrong to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to the more vocal anti-mod lot out there, is that what this really comes down to for you? Assuming when people use non stock parts they use only balanced once (otherwise lets face it, it is just outright cheating), is it MechJeb that\u0027s really the bone of contention here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb in my experience seems to be what a lot of people argue about when it comes to mods vs anti-mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really, and it has been said before but I feel like I really need to stress this \u003Cstrong\u003Every important piece of information\u003C/strong\u003E, it all comes down to the person using MechJeb. I\u0027ve seen four different groups of people that use MechJeb, and I will list them below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u0022DO EVERYTHING!\u0022 (So this one of course is what a lot of people \u003Cstrong\u003E(note: not all)\u003C/strong\u003E who don\u0027t use mods simply assume has happened if somebody has MechJeb, which is often not the case.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u0022Show me how it\u0027s done!\u0022 (This group of people will usually first get MechJeb to complete tasks for them, while they watch and take mental notes on how MechJeb does it (Sort of like a visual tutorial), then will later turn off MechJeb and try it for themselves.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u0022I\u0027ve done it before, and I know I can do it manually, so do it for me from now on.\u0022 (This is the group of people that prove to themselves they can in fact achieve certain things, and once they know they can, don\u0027t see much point in doing it repeatedly so they get MechJeb to do those things for them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) \u0022I just want all the information on my screen, and nothing else.\u0022 (This group doesn\u0027t really want the autopilot part of MechJeb, they just want all the readouts so they don\u0027t have to keep switching between screens, holding protractors up to their screen, and doing extensive calculations mid-flight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow usually people move in between these groups, but these do seem to be the primary 4 ways people will use MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe personally, I\u0027m in groups 3 and 4, but primarily 4, I use MechJeb mostly for the informational readouts that you \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan get yourself\u003C/strong\u003E, whether it be from the map view, holding a protractor to your screen, or scrambling to do a calculation mid-flight, and in that respect, any achievement is still MY achievement, there was no computer helping me through everything, but instead just a box on my screen to tell me the information that I wanted to know on the fly as I needed it. As for why I say I\u0027m in group 3, this is because I will often use MechJeb to set down a maneuver node for interplanetary burns or launch a vessel into a parking orbit around Kerbin for me, but that is hardly cheating. Both I know I can do myself, but ask MechJeb to do because it\u0027s simply a tedious task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with that being said, I know that when a lot of people (Primarily from groups 3, 4, possibly even 2) hear somebody say, \u0022Oh they had MechJeb, that\u0027s not an Achievement\u0022, they usually feel some bit of hurt because they know that they did achieve something for themselves whether it be successfully docking with a ship manually after learning how from watching MechJeb or simply using MechJeb for it\u0027s informational readouts while they performed a manual maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll in all, my point is...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not saying that everyone should use MechJeb, but I\u0027m also saying that just because someone uses MechJeb does not mean that they necessarily cheat either. So please, to everybody, the next time you see somebody using MechJeb, please don\u0027t just assume that they\u0027re not putting in any effort, instead try to see how they used MechJeb if possible, and make your assumption based off of that rather than just blanketing MechJeb users as cheaters or people who put in little to no effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T10:11:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T10:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell said! let\u0027s leave Mechjeb arguments out of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to promote* another mod I use ~ JARFR Tri-Hexagonal Structural Strut ~ great shapes and a really useful motor part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* note: no money has changed hands though I\u0027m open to bribery \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finnerty","CreatedById":61457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T14:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100% Vanilla for now.
