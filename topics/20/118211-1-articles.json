I\u0027ve tried to install a .90 sunflare into 1.0, but saw somewhere that sunflares don\u0027t work between versions because the shared assets files change every update.\n\nBut, a few weeks ago, I was looking at one of pingopete\u0027s RSS albums, and saw that he had a modded sunflare.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

HOWEVER The stock flare likely won\u0027t be bright enough. RVE used configs to make the sun flare bright enough, so you\u0027d need to figure out how to encorperate this node into a non-RVE/RSS game.
