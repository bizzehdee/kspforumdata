I\u0026#39;m only beginning to mod contract pack config files. Modding this though is out of my league, but should be stock for those hard core career players who don\u0026#39;t play with reverting real missions. At least this idea gives them the ability to simulate launches within the game while playing with revert off or want a more formal way of declaring a mission as a simulated mission without having to click that revert button (and not feel cheaty doing so).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently this mod that attempted to do so is dead: [url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93722[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nand Kerbal Construction Time is too much mod.

I\u0026#39;ll check out KCT\u0026#39;s sim option, but for now HoloDeck seems to fit the exact parameters outlined in my OP without the extra KCT feature set until it breaks in some future KSP update. For sure though I\u0026#39;ll be the first to happily volunteer and test any split out mode of KCT Simulator functions whenever you find that precious time to revisit the idea. Thanks for your amazing mods!\n"}]}
