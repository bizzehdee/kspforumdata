Ive downloaded all these mods so my KSP is REAL! like REAL life real. but I\u0027m not sure at what angle to come in for the reentry plugin. Any Ideas? Ive heard of people saying you should have periapsis at 60 and some at 26. WTF?

Depending on the craft and FAR/no-FAR your aero performance will differ.
