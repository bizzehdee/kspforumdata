Full disclosure: my coding skills hover around the ability to code tick tack toe so I\u0027m not exactly an expert. Anyway, what if you wrote a second program that outputed configuration files for new solar systems. Place the file in a specified folder in gamedata with the other necessary components, along with a folder to store systems you\u0027re not using (that way you can have multiple, just need to remember to swap them out for the correct save game). So, would this be possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternative idea: a system editor. You type in things like orbits, sizes, and moons and it does the rest. Make solar system creation\u00A0as easy as possible and have people upload their works to a server where others can download them. Over time you would build such a massive library that true procedural generation wouldn\u0027t be necessary. The editor would ideally make biomes and textures\u00A0for your planets procedurally to streamline the process.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T17:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I had mulled over previously was using something like the old \u003Ca href=\u0022http://accrete.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/accrete/accrete/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EACCRETE\u003C/a\u003E codebase to randomly generate solar systems. \u00A0You could modify that to generate config files for Kopernicus, depending on how good your C coding skills are. \u00A0I translated that to Java at one point but lost the updated code in a hard drive crash a few years ago; my only copy was incomplete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as generating heightmaps and biomemaps, that\u0027s up to someone else to create but you can make tiling Perlin noise generators fairly easily for a shotgun approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
