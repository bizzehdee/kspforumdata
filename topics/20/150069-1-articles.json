Namely, you activate the difficulty option to make part unlocks cost money. Then, you press that one cheat menu button (if it still exists in the new 1.2 menu) that instantly unlocks the entire tech tree.

Do you even remember why you were entranced by KSP at first? What you felt when you landed your first spacecraft on the Mun?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think PC Gamer put it best in their opinion piece that contrasted the experience of playing No Man\u0027s Sky to that of playing KSP: \u0022When I completed my first successful Mun landing, I felt like I had conquered not the millions of miles in between, but my own expectations of what I thought I could achieve.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u0027s the most salient point I\u0027ve ever seen anyone make about KSP, or even gaming in general. Beating the most difficult boss/level/challenge feels so good not because you guided a little electronic figure to some place, but because in doing so, you also beat yourself. You surprised yourself. You became more than you thought you could be. That\u0027s the essence behind the feeling that KSP\u0027s first Mun landing gives you, or the first time you beat Anno 1404\u0027s last campaign mission, or the first time you get poor little Ori out of the Ginso tree. (And it\u0027s also why MMOs are grindy and must rely on item reward spam to keep you interested - because most of the content in no way requires you to exceed, or even just exert, yourself.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the second time you land on the Mun, you already know you did it before. The third time, you know you did it twice before. And so on. The task no longer challenges you to exceed your own limits. And therefore you don\u0027t get that same feeling anymore. That is why many a veteran becomes disappointed, and begins to examine the game for flaws. It clearly must be those flaws that make the game no longer fun; it must be that you just didn\u0027t notice them the first time, but clearly they must be there, or else it would still be...!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, they must not. That is a self-delusion. There can be faults, of course, but even the most flawlessly crafted game will still only give you that amazing feeling once, for one particular challenge. This is not a fault with the game, that is an intrinsic property. And looking for flaws can end up being merely the act of finding a scapegoat for your disappointment. The game that made you feel this way is not secretly bad when you look more closely... it is a fantastic game, and everything it made you feel is real. It just spent its ammunition. It already performed its job, and marvelously so. It can still continue to entertain you, if there is replay value present, or further challenges to be beaten; just don\u0027t expect it to repeat the first time in all its glory. That\u0027s an expectation nothing and nobody can ever fulfill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, don\u0027t call KSP a game that tricks people to like it with some cheap illusions and/or unusual elements despite being crap under the hood. And don\u0027t call out reviewers for falling for it. They didn\u0027t fall for anything. They reviewed precisely the thing the game sets out to do. They allowed themselves to be challenged, and overcame the challenge, overcoming themselves in the process. And then they write about how that feels like. And anyone who buys the game on their recommendation will experience the same, because they, too, will be challenged and must overcome themselves. The reviews are absolutely valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, they say that the biggest critics of something are those who care for it the most... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I can see where you\u0027re coming from. You genuinely wish that KSP was even better, because you do like the game, and you want to see it grow. And the game does have room for improvement, too. Just don\u0027t let that make you forget what made you love the game in the first place.

Strategies were one aspect of gameplay that made little sense unless you went in 100% (lower investment conversion rates sucked). So I kinda ignore the Admin Building. I guess with 1.2 I\u0027ll have to check and see if Strategies actually work right for me once all the mods I use update. (I had several issues with\u00A0that install.

That is a self-delusion. There can be faults, of course, but even the most flawlessly crafted game will still only give you that amazing feeling once, for one particular challenge. This is not a fault with the game, that is an intrinsic property. And looking for flaws can end up being merely the act of finding a scapegoat for your disappointment. The game that made you feel this way is not secretly bad when you look more closely... it is a fantastic game, and everything it made you feel is real. It just spent its ammunition. It already performed its job, and marvelously so. It can still continue to entertain you, if there is replay value present, or further challenges to be beaten; just don\u0027t expect it to repeat the first time in all its glory.

It\u0027s more that KSP, IMO, lacks gameplay mechanics with longevity and sense . KSP\u0027s sim aspects still entrances me. I still find myself coming back now and then to engineer a new vessel just to see if it would work or make sense. It\u0027s just whenever I\u00A0look at it as a game rather than a pure sim that it feels\u00A0very lacking. (At least in stock, without a lot of gameplay-based mods installed.) Of course, I\u0027m also a little jaded from the brokenness of KSP up until 1.2 (well, so far), but that\u0027s something else.
