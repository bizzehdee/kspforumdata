I have some mods I would like to use again, but I realized that the author has been offline for a while, so I am almost certain that if I ask for permission they will not respond. Other people have tried to request permission, but they were never responded to either.

If it\u0027s unlicensed, then without express permission you\u0027ll not be able to do anything with it. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo note the the LCARS mod is ancient,\u00A0 ran using a plugin that would need to be remade to current code API.\u00A0 The sciFi ship yards mod is from before the node overhaul so all the connection nodes are wrong, and the craft in general require a huge amount of work to even come close to being useable in the current game.\u00A0 You could get away with a lot more in pre 1.05 ksp, and many one part craft mods ceased to be of any use afterward.\u00A0 Not to say it couldn\u0027t be done, though simply updating cfg\u0027s isnt going to get anywhere near whats needed today\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso worth a mention, is that I\u0027ve brought a few mods\u00A0 back from the dead and without exception the moderators on the forum have required that permission be obtained from the original creator, which involved some major detective work in tracking them down to\u00A0 wherever they hang out these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-23T14:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to add what SM said, it looks like SciFi Shipyards would be a ARR (All Rights Reserved license), which means you cant do ANYTHING with it publicly...even rehosting it somewhere. you *might* be able to get away with modifying it to work *FOR YOUR OWN USE*... but that would be a lot of work to put into it, to then not be able to share it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe LCARS mod looks like it has a very permissible license, so you might be able to publicly share that if you got it working. But make sure you read the specific license, and ask questions about it on the forums, if there is anything you are unsure of, about the CC-BY license.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd even tho others have supposedly tried to contact the authors, and gotten no response, you should still try to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI *always* attempt contact, to ask,\u00A0 even on fully open licenses... I dont *have* to, but I still think its the *right* thing to do, to try to get an authors blessing, or to at least let them kno I\u0027m planning to mess with their mod. And, besides, if I *do* manage to make contact, even on an open licensed mod, it can possibly open up an ongoing channel between you, so you can ask questions, or even get help/direction from the original author.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-23T14:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2018 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
