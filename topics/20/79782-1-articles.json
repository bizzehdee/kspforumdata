When far away from a planet with clouds ( and I noticed it when the Mun\u0027s HD texture ) that theres a severe shimmering/sparkle effect. It gets worse the farther you get. Ive tried different levels of AA, but it all seems to be the same. Has anyone else experienced this? Im using Astronomer\u0027s pack, but ive noticed it in the past with just about everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T02:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s a well-known z-fighting issue. The renderer can\u0027t decide which texture is above the other when the distance gets too great and so they clip through each other constantly. No known solution as of yet, as far as I know and I\u0027d like to think I\u0027ve been keeping a good eye out for one! Generally what needs to be done is the textures need to be moved farther apart as the camera moves away, but whether that\u0027s possible via a mod or needs to be rectified by Squad/Unity is still up in the air. But hopefully I\u0027m wrong because it is indeed annoying. Usually happens to me after switching between flight and space center scenes once or twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
