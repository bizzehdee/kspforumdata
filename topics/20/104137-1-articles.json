Just now I received a Kerbal alarm clock message a craft was about to enter Minmus orbit. I seriously haven\u0027t got a clue what I launched it for.\n\nAlso I have a Kerbal traning facility around Mun with a group of half trained Kerbals. I totally lost track of who\u0027s done what and who\u0027s been where. Only way to see what they\u0027ve done is bring the whole group back home and launch the new recruits again.\n\nI know I can add some description to reminders in alarm clock but those are lost as soon as the alarm clears. What I\u0027m looking for as a way to add some custom text to my active craft. Preferably a simple plug-in (no parts) accessible through right clicking a probe core or cockpit similarly to renaming a craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T21:05:30Z","Content":"I think the [Notepad](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55625-0-90-In-game-notes-notepad-checklist-v0-10-1-16-12-14?) mod might have what you\u0027re looking for... just not 100% sure you get a different note for each ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T21:12:50Z","Content":"Strangely I\u0027ve never noticed that mod before.

If you\u0027re giving them names like \u0022Phoenix\u0022 then you might consider renaming them (or at least adding a suffix; \u0022Phoenix: resupply Mun\u0022). I run a lot of missions at once and do forget what\u0027s going on, but it\u0027s usually obvious when I see the ship what it\u0027s supposed to be doing. Not always; once or twice I\u0027ve sent a ship in the wrong direction after playing until late and not paying too much attention. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003EAlso I have a Kerbal traning facility around Mun with a group of half trained Kerbals. I totally lost track of who\u0027s done what and who\u0027s been where. Only way to see what they\u0027ve done is bring the whole group back home and launch the new recruits again.\n\nI\u0027m currently keeping a spreadsheet of whether I need more Scientists, Engineers, or Pilots, and where, and who is actually in the pods. It also keeps a designation for their experience level. -1, -2 for leveled-up people, -min for people that have been to the Mun but not Minmus yet, or -mun for vice-versa, -r for people that need to return. No suffix for noobs. With conditional formatting, the spreadsheet can automatically color the Kerbals according to their job and experience, which makes it real easy to see who\u0027s supposed to be going to the Mun and who\u0027s supposed to be going back to Kerbin.\n\nNote that simply landing on Mun/Minmus is enough for full points. On other planets you have to plant a flag, but for Mun/Minmus I have a 19-Kerbal ship (\u0022The Experiencer\u0022) that just lands, sits around for 10 seconds to be sure I got credit, then takes off and goes to the other moon.

I could indeed simply install that plug-in and have module manager add the functionality to all command modules.\n\nI\u0027ll try this out later today. I\u0027ll let you know how it goes.\n\nEdit:\n\n*ABSOLUTELY FRAGGING BRILLIANT!!! IT WORKS!*\n\nAnd for those that want this too it is actually incredibly easy.\n\nRequired files, you probably have those installed already:\n\n**Firespitter.dll** which comes standard with a variety of mods.\n\n**ModuleManager** which also comes standard with many mods.\n\nCustom ModuleManager file (I called mine InfoDrive.cfg):\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleCommand]]{        MODULE    {        name = FSinfoPopup        textHeading = Craft Information        textBody1 = 1 -         textBody2 = 2 -         textBody3 = 3 -         textBody4 = 4 -         textBody5 = 5 -         textBody6 = 6 -         textBody7 = 7 -         textBody8 = 8 -         textBody9 = 9 -         textBody10 = 0 -         textBody11 = Press [ o ] to toggle this window.        showAtFlightStart = false        hideAfterCountdown = true        showOnEachFlightStart = false        countDownDuration = 30        toggleKey = o    }}\n\nFrom now all command modules show a new item in their menu named \u0027Show info\u0027. Click it to call up the pop-up and edit at will. The info pop-up can also be opened directly with [O].\n\nMany thanks go out to Snjo for Firespitter.dll. Bac9 for the coding on the infodrive. Ialdabaoth \u0026 Sarbian for ModuleManager.
