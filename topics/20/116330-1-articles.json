It has KE\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153J65 Zero Bypass Turbine jet engine , and it was almost perfect for landing and taking for from Eve... But now after so much changes in the game ( talking about mining and aerodynamical model ) , I dont think that Kethane mod is not needed any more . Still I would like to have some sort of jet engine , with the same efficiency of normal jet engine that works in Kerbin atmosphere. I dont really now what propelant this engine shoud use... Maybe I think it would be great if there was a mod that add to Eve\u0027s atmosphere some kind of resourse ( methane intakeair for example) , and that jet engine uses it with in cojunction with oxidizer for example to produce thrust. If there is a similar mod existing i would be really happy test it out."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:20:45Z","Content":"I don\u0027t recall if they have jet engines but Karbonite ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401)) fills a roll similar to Kethane.
