Well I\u0027ve decided to ask for info. I tend to have very grandiose ideas when entering a new hobby. What would be a good intro level project that would both be doable for someone with little experience but also actually contribute something useful to the community? I have a hobbyist understanding of Blender and 3d modeling,\u00A0 a few classes of college level Java programing under my belt, and have done one or two basic Unity tutorials a number of years back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-06T19:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223517481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181185\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221546797233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CastleKSide\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, CastleKSide said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would be a good intro level project that would both be doable for someone with little experience but also actually contribute something useful to the community?

This is the basis of everything apart from coding in KSP,\u00A0 exporting and importing,, you get the basics sorted\u00A0 first.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen on to\u00A0 other stuff,\u00A0 I \u0027ve always suggested the fuel tank ( textured cylinder) as part two , the pod (textured cone) as part 3 , then maybe a winglet or two . I know it doesnt sound very glamorous,\u00A0 but just look around the forums, you\u0027ll find 100s of posts\u00A0 \u0022 \u003Cem\u003Ei\u0027m making this awesome mod, it will have this that and those and be all this\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 in 99.9% of those cases you find one or two posts and then the idea and usually the poster vanishes , because\u00A0 running before you can walk doesn\u0027t work out well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided to make (at least) one of every part in KSP which I\u0027d recommend as a way forward, as it\u00A0 opens avenues into all kinds of weird and wonderful spinoffs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for making what the community wants, erm stuff that for an idea, 99% of current long term modders ( not yer 1 version wonders) make stuff that \u003Cu\u003Ethey\u003C/u\u003E want to see in the game, and sometimes\u00A0 it turns out that other people want it also and so it gets released.\u00A0 It shouldn\u0027t matter to you what the community wants, yeah sure fine , when you\u0027re established\u00A0 there\u0027s no harm in doing requests, but even then it should be things that you hadn\u0027t thought of rather than stuff that you\u0027re making to keep someone else happy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou aren\u0027t going to get paid for it,\u00A0 likes and downloads don\u0027t pay the bills , it will be massively time consuming, it\u00A0 can be hard and damn frustrating, and occasionally thanks to halfbottomed updates, tedious and damn right rage inducing . So make it all about you and what you want and you\u0027ll have a much easier time of it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck should you take the dive\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
