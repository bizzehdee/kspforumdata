Due to the controversy of mechjeb, I don\u0027tm publicly reccomend it. My rule on it, and what I encourage every new player to do, is to not have mechjeb do it for you (except after maybe a few times) until you understand what it\u0027s doing, why, and how to do it yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biker Joe","CreatedById":82495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T19:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the info guys, been reading a lot about mechjeb, anything that makes my life easier I like!
