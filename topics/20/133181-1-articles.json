But now it\u0027s getting boring and I downloaded MechJeb. I don\u0027t know anything about MJ, so I just launch my lander near the Duna and started the Autolanding. I don\u0027t change any setting, I usually orbit the lander first before landing, but MechJeb just fired up the rocket to Duna and turn the rocket upside down to slow down the rocket like what I usually do. But the\u00A0rocket exploded into pieces.\u00A0I definitely can\u0027t use the parachute, they will broke apart if I open it (I have 30 on my rocket) Can anyone help me how to use this Autolanding?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T13:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod-related question moved over to Add-on Discussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T11:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have problems with MJ when I\u0027m using the autolander when I\u0027m not in a orbit around the planet, or when I start it really high up.
