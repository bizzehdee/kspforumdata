The way I currently do it is is to right click a parachute and keep that menu open throughout the whole decent which is messy and and a PIA. \n\nSurely it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to take the readout from whatever variable is giving safe, risky, unsafe and convert it into a traffic light signal for each chute.\n\nI guess ideally I\u0027d display it next to the relevant chute in the staging set up down the left hand side but I\u0027m guessing that would be tricky.\n\nAlternatively just a window containing a readout on the \u0022safe status\u0022 of each stage containing parachutes."},{"CreatedByName":"meyerweb","CreatedById":135212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:23:01Z","Content":"I *love* this idea.
