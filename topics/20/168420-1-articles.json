Sometimes, if I zoom out and in, the ships appears for a few seconds. Most of the time I\u00A0need to go to the tracking station to switch between them.

Now I can\u0027t find it anywhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone know this mod or any similar? Any mod that help to not lose randomly the encounters are also welcome.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI already use \u0022Easy Vessel Switch\u0022, is an awesome mod, but as far as I know it is designed only to vessels inside the physics bubble (2.5 km).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-10T17:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere used to be a mod called haystack that lets you switch vessels easily.
