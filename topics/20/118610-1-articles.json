All of those fuel tanks make it look so unrealistic and completely-not-at-all streamlined. There should be 1.25 meter (maybe some at 0.625 or at 2.5) probe cores with Monoprop built in. Not only is this realistic but I feel like it would be easy to make. The probe cores would basically look like the large probe core in the Asteroid Day pack. We don\u0027t want to need structural panels to build good looking probes. If all else fails I guess I could make this mod myself, but the textures would be worse (I only have experience with small amounts of pixel art) and there would certainly be tons of bugs and glitches \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t need to be very large, only like 5 parts at max.
