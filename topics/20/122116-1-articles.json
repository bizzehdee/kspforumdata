This also makes it easier to set up proper parachutes with RealChutes. Then import the subassembly and attach the booster anywhere. Then add a radial decoupler to the main stack, and move the booster to the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hacky, but works pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if I\u0027m lazy, just add 4 sepratrons to every booster (2 on top and 2 on bottom). It won\u0027t be perfect, but the booster will be pushed far enough away before it really starts turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82791\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmartStage\u003C/a\u003E is great for staging everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
