Heat is generated by all components that use power, such as science equipment and life support. Heat can be dissipated through the use of Radiators mounted onto a Utility Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower can be generated through the use of reactors (very heavy but long lasting) or solar panels (lightweight but fragile). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew is, obviously, the Kerbonauts that are occupying the station. Certain operations require them to be on board, but not all. Things such as attitude adjustment and orbit boosting does not require a crew, however, assembly, EVAs, and many other tasks require a crew - making it a good idea to keep a presence in the station at most times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverheating stations have a raised chance for equipment failure, and greatly reduce the health of the crew. Underpowered stations will likely freeze, and equipment will not function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother minor factor is trash production. Cargo craft can be sent up and filled with rubbish, then sent back into the atmosphere to harmlessly disintegrate. If it\\\u0027s not taken care of however, it will start to affect the crew of the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFurther work\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere still is some refinement to be done - how close to modules need to be for assembly, how easily broken should they be. Maintenance could require EVAs or not. It\\\u0027s a balance between realism in gameplay for most aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew, Nov. 10: Wet Workshops\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently discussed the idea of Wet Workshops (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_workshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_workshop\u003C/a\u003E) with HarvesteR.

The structure illustrated by the OP is laid out in a reasonable manner and seems to be assembled with a large degree of common-sense and know-how...which is why it can\u0027t work. Part of what would makes this game so satisfying is that we\u0027re working with \u0027Dent \u0026amp; Ding\u0027 goods, the stuff that was tossed away by people smart enough to realize how insane it would be to even try using it. We then take this broken stuff and use it to build things considered crazy and dangerous even with the best technology--and even occasionally succeed! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a space station to work, it has to have the Junkyard Wars mindset. Spent 2 and 3m stages make great labs, hallways, and storage space. Need crew quarters? A whole bunch of broken command modules duct taped together would be adequate. And if you can\u0027t seem to find something, \u0027find\u0027 something. What\u0027s easier than using stuff already up there?
