And since the terrain is getting expanded, that means a lot of the details are lost. Many of the mountainous regions in vanilla end up looking like flat golf courses, and the valleys just look like table top surfaces. This makes landings on the Mun and whatnot a little boring because you lose the great cliffs and details the terrain\u0027s have to offer. \u003Cspan\u003E@EatVacuum created some wonderful configs for 64k, however they were only limited to Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus (albeit with a couple bugs and glitches).\u00A0The rest are either currently in the works, or not.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe question is, is there any way to increase the size of these planets, but not lose the details on the surface?\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHe are some example photos of the problem (courtesy of @EatVacuum):\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7gf5UZY.png\u0022 alt=\u00227gf5UZY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iLBqD78.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iLBqD78.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd his configs (what I\u0027m asking if it\u0027s possible to do with the rest of the planets/OPM):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ghcNIks.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ghcNIks.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9PjdSxV.png\u0022 alt=\u00229PjdSxV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
