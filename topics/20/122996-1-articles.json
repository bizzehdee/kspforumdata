It gave out audible altitude call outs. Pull up warning. Over G warnings and, the mod maker was planning on adding more. I thought it was a great and fun idea to have that. The mod maker of Nagging Nadia stated that he had pretty much moved on from KSP and wouldn\u0027t be working on his mod any longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, I was hoping that either some other kind mod maker would pick it up and finish it. Make a similar mod that does those things. Or just maybe Squad would add this into the game. Some people might not like the constant call outs but, I for one would love to see and hear this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T08:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112420\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGPWS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
