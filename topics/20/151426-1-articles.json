The problem is none of the maintained tech tree mods satisfy my particular needs as far as part progression go, I like the CTT but the way most parts are organized doesn\u0027t quite fit my needs,\u00A0plus I always have quite a few mods that lack support and need to be patched into the tree, this is an incredibly frustrating and time consuming process and is one of the longest parts of me building out an install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe solution?:\u003C/span\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0So while sitting at my desk staring at the tech tree in the R\u0026amp;D building thinking of ways to make this easier this is what I came up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nmod has it\u0027s own UI window and it loads all the data on the techtree, it would need to be visually structured similarly to the tech tree in the R\u0026amp;D building where you could see all the nodes, prerequisites etc. (it actually doesn\u0027t necessarily need it\u0027s own ui window, it could be done from the actual tech tree itself but I feel like for the functionality planned that would be harder to do than giving it it\u0027s own window)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nable to see what parts are currently in each node and their description and stats, if we can have images of them just like in the R\u0026amp;D building that would be super friggin awesome.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nNow here is the nifty bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are able to grab a part and move it to a new node in the tech tree\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhave some \u0022node\u0022 that contains parts that don\u0027t have a specified tech node or whose tech node is not present in the tree currently\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA \u0022save\u0022 button that either writes out a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch file that would reassign the parts to the nodes you have them in or just some log file that gives the part names and the node they are in that you could use to quickly write a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch file.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like it would be an incredibly useful quality of life tool not just for users like me with massive part lists but also modders that want to support multiple tech trees and modders that want to make tech trees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this wouldn\u0027t be a simple save your config and everything works perfectly situation, I think of it as more along the lines of something like ubio\u0027s welding tool, it gets things situated but the end user will still likely have to go in and tinker with the config\u00A0manually before everything works \u0022flawlessly\u0022, but it will still be way way way faster than arranging things manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESo my questions to the modding community is how feasible does this sound?\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to try my hand at it myself but as I said I will basically be starting from square zero with C#, while I have a general high level understanding of the coding process I have forgotten a lot of stuff and the most complex thing I ever wrote was a game of snake and a small 3D\u00A0solar system you could move a camera around in, and that was 9 years ago, so it will likely take me a long while to even get started on it.\u00A0\u003Cu\u003ESo if any one else wants to try their hand at it then please by all means do so!!!\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could also see this being an external tool, like it doesn\u0027t actually have to be run in KSP, as long as it loads all the pertinent information you would need like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches and such, I don\u0027t know if that would make it easier or harder though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-04T16:38:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2016 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Akira_R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI spel reel gud.......\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RaginCaucasian","CreatedById":147477,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T15:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the objective you wrote is spot-on: graphical method for viewing and editing the tech tree.
