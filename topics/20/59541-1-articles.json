I was left with about 100 fuel in the Ablate Drive stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--About 15k delta-v is necessary from Ablate orbit back to Kerbin orbit. I got lucky and got an encounter earlier than expected, so I only used abot 13k delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--In my case, the extra RCS tank was not at all necessary. The 15 units in the lander can would have been enough as I only used 2 units for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Make the return stage as light as possible. By making my return segment just 500 kg lighter, I was able to lower my to-orbit mass by 50,000 kg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--At Ablate altitude, a single 1x6 solar panel produces about 19.5 electricity/second. The means only about 1 panel per ion engine is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Your to-Ablate mass is absolutely vital. I used lander legs, but you could use lighter structural elements instead. I knew I would need to re-dock, so I used docking ports on the top segments and no decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- EVA jets are not strong enough to lift kerbals off of the surface, but it can allow them to jump very high, I added a ladder, but it may not be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-25T20:38:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2014 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FastasGod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T03:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ghost13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ghost13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really like Ablate from Krag\u0027s Planet Factory mod; I want to see it in official game, along with the Ascension.
