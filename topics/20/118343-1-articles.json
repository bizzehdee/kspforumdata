Completely or just delay thing? What are requirments to make that base again? Iam preparing to create new orbiting one (if can be done) because current delay is over a minute so no ideal. also my minmus base was not connected to ksp and i could send data (i was confused but tought i was connected somehow).\n\nthanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T01:55:16Z","Content":"It means you accidentally made a command center. Congratulations. Yes, it does replace the KSC for control (not science transmission though).\n\nEDIT: A command center is 6 (I think) kerbals and a RC-L01 Guidance Unit, if you wanted to know."}]}
