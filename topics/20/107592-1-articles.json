According to Murphys Law, when I try to click on the prograde button, for sure I will click one of the others first. So I\u0027ve been thinking about how to simplify the interaction, especially when the maneuver node is over- and underlayed by some other icons and text... see picture below:\n\n![6B7Q7Ih.png](http://i.imgur.com/6B7Q7Ih.png)\n\nIt would be nice to have a separate gizmo somewhere, which is fixed (not rotating with view) with some additional informations and some small tools like preciseNode has, e.g. \n\n1. Snap Node to AP,PE,AN/DN, view next/previous node.\n2. An increment slider for increment steps of the vectors as well as time of the node (mousewheel or 3rd mouse button over gizmo-icons).\n3. Readouts of the predicted orbit values: AP, PE, inclination - in Targetmode: Distance of closest approach and rel. inclination.\n4. Perhaps \u002B- one orbit buttons.\n5. Visible only in Map View, if at least one node exists.\n\nA quick and dirty pic to illustrate my thoughts:\n\n![ymXnA33.png](http://i.imgur.com/ymXnA33.png)\n\nI\u0027m not able to code a plugin. Therefore I hope sb. will attend to it. I\u0027ve some concrete details in my mind, which I\u0027d like to share and I can give some support if needed... except coding! \n\n Suggestions anybody?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T10:45:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 10:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T08:37:15Z","Content":"Check out [Precise Node](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-1-0-2-Precise-Node-1-1-3-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes)."},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:24:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Check out [Precise Node](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-1-0-2-Precise-Node-1-1-3-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes).\n\nI know about PreciseNode and Mechjeb ManeuverPlanner.

I used PreciseNode for a while, but I ran into the same problem as the you and this would be a fantastic addition, especially when I\u2019m planning mid-course corrections to Mun/Minmus encounters. (Haven\u2019t gone beyond those, yet.) This is because I create the node, switch focus to my destination, and then rotate the view around until I can see both the destination and the maneuver node, THEN try to pull on the handles in such a way that I can get the right approach vector without losing sight of the node or the approach.\n\nWith a plugin like this one, I could concentrate on the destination and projected encounter course, and not worry about keeping the node onscreen. I wish I knew enough coding to make it happen myself!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T14:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by meyerweb**\n  \nCleaned up forum migration errors (Unicode and hyperlinking were both botched\u2014sigh)"},{"CreatedByName":"JWag","CreatedById":112631,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:00:38Z","Content":"I love your mockup picture.

So there might be room for optimization for the following description.\n\nBesides implementablility, I would use the gizmo like this:\n\n1. click on the imcrement slider defines increment steps [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] in m/s - alternatively [1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, orbit]\n2. prograde, retrograde, radial in/out, etc. handles\n    - Hover over \u003E highlight\n    - left click or mousewheel upwards \u003E increment step forward\n    - right click or mousewheel downwards \u003E increment step backward\n    - left click and hold \u003E dragging (like the original gizmo)\n3. ring or cycle in the middle is used for time steps\n    - Hover over \u003E highlight\n    - left click or mousewheel upwards \u003E increment timestep forward\n    - right click or mousewheel downwards \u003E increment timestep backward\n4. AP/PE/AN/DN handles are used for \u0022snap node to\u0022 features\n5. maybe there is a possibility to switch to next/previous node somehow without using an extra button - suggestions welcome!\n6. delete node with the (X) of the navball\n\nAs mentioned before, I\u0027d be glad seeing this in an add-on...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T09:00:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 09:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T10:38:37Z","Content":"I am sold on the idea but I am not sure I want to spend time on code that will go to the trash when 1.1 is out, even if it is clearly not happening soon."},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T13:27:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, sarbian said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am sold on the idea but I am not sure I want to spend time on code that will go to the trash when 1.1 is out, even if it is clearly not happening soon.\n\u003E \n\nNice to see you, as an expierenced add-on writer, are interested in it.
