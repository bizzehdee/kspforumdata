It was around for .20ish but then faded away. Now with the stock 1.0 re-entry damage I would like to see it revived. All the mod did was redo the (then current) re-entry heating model (shock effects) so it looked more... Well Gratitious\n\nIf someone could revive this mod or point me to a place where it has been revived that would be greatly appreciated!!"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:25:36Z","Content":"Is no one interested in this?"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:43:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is no one interested in this?\n\nMy guess is noone understands what you\u0027re talking about.
