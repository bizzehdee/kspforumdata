I forget who had the pre-calculated dV for Kerbin escape burns in their signature which is kind of what I\u0027m looking for but that\u0027s only helpful when you\u0027re doing only-prograde burns. A lot of planetary transfers require some amount of normal/anti-normal and it would be nice (easier) to get proportionately the right amount of normal burn to get to your departure inclination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, it would be cool to set up a maneuver node (typical maneuver node procedure)\u00A0that gets you the transfer you need then click a button that converts the node into multiple nodes of some lesser dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may be suggested somewhere else or maybe there\u0027s a mod that does it, I don\u0027t know.\u00A0I looked and didn\u0027t see anything; also, it doesn\u0027t look like PreciseNode does it which was my best guess for something that might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T03:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t gotten around to playing with it (to many neat mods popping up every day!) so I don\u0027t know if it does what you\u0027re looking for but it\u0027s the only one I can think of that might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107676-wip105-solarsailnavigator-v106-alpha/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Racescort666","CreatedById":137852,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T04:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks interesting but not really what I was thinking.
