KW space y and bluedog I think are my main parts mods. I\u0027ve noticed that there\u0027s only like two tanks that say they have insulation. i think It\u0027s just a short 3.75m tank from kw and the stock 2.5m orange tank. Is there something I\u0027m missing or is there a mod I can get to have a wider variety of insulated tanks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I noticed that the fuel selection for the tanks is quite extensive but all the engines I have use only like 4 or 5 different combinations of the fuels. Are there any other engines that might use a different fuel mixture or anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T16:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never written (or had anything written) to give Bluedog compatibility with Real Fuels.

I believe the engine used kerosene or liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and had one ignition and it let me fill the tank just fine too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
