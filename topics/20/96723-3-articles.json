I have to agree that FAR is easier for me, and, more importantly, I\u0027m of opinion that it\u0027s fundamentally a better choice for new players, as things looking like real planes actually fly like real planes when you have a proper aerodynamic model. Making aircraft design more intuitive is an undeniable benefit. I also think it\u0027s important to look at the difficulty in combination with design depth and potential for fun gameplay. If some system adds a bit more challenge to the craft design process but enriches it with branching, meaningful design choices (for example, making previously completely ignored wing shape or rotation meaningful), I can only welcome such a change.

A possible solution is to instead try to get size from the part mesh, but that leads to issues for parts like the quadcoupler where you\u0027re trying to detect and allocate a common area among many nodes. Not really easy, and lots of edge cases.
