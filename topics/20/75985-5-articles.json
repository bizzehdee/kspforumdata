I\u0027d really prefer to avoid requiring an extra download, because that really is a pretty confusing step: \u0022Mod X has an update! Yay! Don\u0027t forget to read the changelog to check if its dependency Mod Y also got an update. If it did, make sure you go get it first!\u0022 That\u0027s not work that I feel like forcing upon my users, and lacking an automated mod manager setup that would let me assign Mod Y as a dependency and have it auto downloaded, this option mandates that the user be responsible for the extra work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next best option would be for me to completely re-architect the library into a singleton format (currently it\u0027s all static classes), do a version election in the singleton logic, and write version numbers into my .dll files. The big problem with that is that the library includes a lot of extension methods which MUST be static, so I\u0027d also need to completely refactor all of the code that depends on the extension methods in the library to call utility methods from a singleton instead. This is a bunch of work for me and requires me to forgo the use of a nice convention of the C# language, and I\u0027d prefer to avoid such restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I can look at things like auto-downloading the library, or even loading the assembly direct from the web every time a user starts up KSP. But that will cause a Major Kerfuffle with some subset of the userbase that I\u0027d rather avoid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I know my current solution isn\u0027t ideal, but all of the other solutions have big downsides as well. If Kerbal Stuff takes off and gets a good, cross-platform mod manager that will respect dependencies as I and many here seem hopeful it will, I will distribute the library separately and let the mod manager do the extra work for users that aren\u0027t willing or able to do so. Until then, I\u0027m going to keep doing what I\u0027m doing and if I can use Kerbal Stuff with my current solution until a mod manager gets developed, I will.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T01:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove the site it\u0027s tons better than curse already.
