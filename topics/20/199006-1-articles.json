So therefore this thread will be the place. Now i\u0027m not an expert in KSP BDArmoury ground combat however, the reason i make this so that far experiences player could share their techniques and way. This will certainly help evolve the BDArmoury ground combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow let\u0027s start with my techniques on developing competitive techniques:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Off-set Building.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically you put all of the part of your tank into the root part. The Purpose of this method was to prevent krakening. By putting all part in your root part, when the BD Shell hits and destroy one panel, other panel wouldn\u0027t be affected because they technically aren\u0027t connected to each other. However, the cons of this method, was that it was time consuming and when the root part is destroyed, the vehicle will fall apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Sloped Armour\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSloped Armour with BDA Panel works the same way as IRL sloped armour. it helps both deflecting round and increase thickness and potential of the armour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Compartment Spaced Armour\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo prevent the root part being destroyed and due to how Armour panel works, Compartment Spaced Armour works like a charm. To do this, all you need was to create a compartment inside the Tank chassis with the Armour panel,\u00A0and to further increase the tank survival ability, You put other stuff inside that compartment, such as Fuel tank (to run the fuel cell), Ammo Storage, Batteries and more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Composite Reactive Armour\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing IRL tank such as M1 Abram and Challenger 2 for example. Those two tank uses composite armour called Chobbam. From what i\u0027ve been researching, the Chobbam\u0027s Unclassified composition is made out of Concrete sandwiched between 2 steelplate. So therefore, if we uses this method In KSP, it should look like\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBDA Armour Panel \u002B KSP 1x1 Stock Panel/DLC Panel\u00A0\u002B BDA Armour Panel. Basically sandwiching Stock Panel and BDA Panel with the Stock Panel in the middle. From my experience, KSP Panel both Stock and DLC works like a reactive armour while the BDA Panel works like a regular panel. So therefore, after the BDA Shell penetrates the first layer of armour, it will hit the KSP Panel and the KSP will explode. However, from my testing, when used this way, The KSP Panel could damages the BDA Armour panel so used cautiously. My Recommendation would be used Compartment Spaced Armour and then using the Sandwich armour in the front, mixing it with non sandwiched Spaced BDA Armour and then using Another Reactive armour like how the Russian\u0027s T-90 tank uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Softkill and Hardkill APS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat i mean by Softkill and Hardkill APS, is that using BDA Jammer to prevent or at least make it harder to lock onto your tank with missile. And using Turret (Such as the 30mm Chain turret or the M20 Vulcan Turret) for Hardkill APS like a CIWS system. This way, killing your tank with a missile will be somewhat Harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Power Unit and Wheel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom my experience, most competitive lads would uses either\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/RoveMax_Model_M1\u0022 style=\u0022color:#0b0080;font-size:14px;\u0022 title=\u0022RoveMax Model M1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERoveMax Model M1\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0or\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TR-2L_Ruggedized_Vehicular_Wheel\u0022 style=\u0022color:#0b0080;font-size:14px;\u0022 title=\u0022TR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheel\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheel\u003C/a\u003E. Those two wheels both have pros and cons. First one with Rovemax M1. It has a great acceleration rate and consumed less power than the TR-2L Wheel. It also have a great suspension system compared to the TR-2L. However the cons of the M1 is that it has a lower top speed, narrower surface which leads to instability at higher speed than the TR-2L.\u00A0 To fix this was to duplicate the wheel so it has the same surface width as the TR-2L. This would increase the acceleration rate and top speed however, the power consumtion rate and the price will be so high that it became worthless. TR-2L meanwhile have a lower acceleration, high power consumtion rate, and a mediocre suspension compared to the M1, however, the surface width of the track is wide enough so that you won\u0027t need 3 tire layer on one side jsut to have a grippy vehicle. For maximum speed from my experience, usually many competitor uses Juno engine and TR-2L, while some use Juno and M1. However, running on just battery isn\u0027t gonna last that very long especially you need the battery to run the vehicle and the track. To generate the power for the battery, i usually uses 4 Baguette tank and one large Fuel cell. This is enough to prevent draining power from the battery once you\u0027re on full speed with the tank using just the track power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have more tips and tricks to min-max your ground vehicle, please reply\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Sorry for the grammar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
