Last time I played which was months ago the mod looked like it needed a lot of maintenance and it was unplayable\u00A0for me.\u00A0 It also didn\u0027t play nicely along other popular mods. Today I was googling around and found some new info on the ptk development that I wasn\u0027t aware of for this last year\u00A0and it seems many things have changed including the PTKs\u00A0design and specs. Considering that there are more than 2 or 3 Orion SLS mods out there I was wondering if any modder would have any interest to make a new fresh version of the latest PTK just to balance the field between the latest\u00A0US and RU spacecraft in ksp mods.\u00A0Also asking to see if this spacecraft is as popular as much as I like it. Wish I had the knowledge, skills and talent to make one myself but unfortunately my calling lies elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I respectfully request for such a mod and at the same time I make this thread to see if other people share the same sentiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am aware that at some point there will be a change to a new unity version ( not that I understand completely what that means) and that will definitely create a lot of work for modders so I have in no way any expectation of anyone to work hard to make a good mod that will potentially \u00A0break after the unity upgrade in ksp\u00A0\u00A0. And of course in no way do I or will I ever demand from anyone to create a mod just because I happen to like the PTK or whatever other reason, so please understand that im making this request without having any kind of expectations from anyone. It simply is something beyond my reach cause I don\u0027t have anymore the time or skill to make a mod ( cause of real life stuff ). im trying to ask as politely as possible and also avoiding being misunderstood and making this into a toxic thread because I have read other posts not in these forums but in others for other games and mod requests are not always welcome , cause I guess its understandable that modders do this for fun or whatever reason and pleasing people is not their goal nor their obligation. I have been away for a while so Im not up to date with the community or the state of game so please excuse any lack of proper etiquette or game state knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks a lot for taking the time to listen to my thoughts.

I fixed it for 1.0.4 and just played around with it last weekend but guess, I didn\u0027t post the newer update will check when, I get time but no one has said anything so maybe that\u0027s why, I didn\u0027t post any more updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"techstepman","CreatedById":68505,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T08:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ll check it out.
