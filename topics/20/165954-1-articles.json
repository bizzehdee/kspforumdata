Even with the much larger and science hungry tech tree provided by CTT, I inevitably find myself finishing the off the tech tree long before I run out of available science, and so it ends up just accumulating uselessly in the late game. There are plenty of mods that add more science experiments and more ways to do science and more places to get science (that\u0027s part of the issue, in fact), but I\u0027ve found very few mods that add anything to \u003Cem\u003Espend\u003C/em\u003E science on, outside of tech tree mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is me asking if there are any science sinks that I\u0027ve missed.

My issue is not with the pace of game progression -- I\u0027m usually around the mid-to-late tech tree by the time I start going interplanetary with kerbals, and how quickly I reach that point is almost entirely down to playstyle.
