I also have OPM installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought that this would be relatively easy to do by using Duna for a gravity assist to capture (like using Ike for a gravity assist to enter Duna\u0027s orbit in a stock install), but I\u0027m having some problem with asteroid spawn locations. As far as I know in a stock game, asteroids only spawn in orbits that intersect Kerbin, or around Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe asteroid day mod added an IR telescope that could cause asteroids to spawn in other orbits, and track those, but for some reason it doesn\u0027t seem to be working now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the asteroid day mod\u0027s IR telescope still work? might it be the modded planets that break it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have advice for getting an E class to intersect Duna\u0027s orbit without using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E on the asteroid (for... reasons...

If you were to add a config for Rald that lets asteroids spawn on intercept trajectory with Rald, that would probably solve your problem. Otherwise I have no idea how you\u0027re going to do this without shipping enormous amounts of liquid fuel to an asteroid in solar orbit and propelling it with a nuclear engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T09:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I removed all my planet mods, and then the IR telescope asteroid mapping started working again....
