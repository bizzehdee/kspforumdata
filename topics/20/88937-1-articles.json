The problem is that the control surfaces on the left would act differently to the ones on the right (just because that\u0027s how it works) so what I need is someone to make a module that works the same way that the stock one does (so I guess you could just copy and paste) but I need the option to add more than one control surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly I need \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/NSCrDFin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E module from my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91583-Cubic-Octagonal-Rocketry-Expansion-%28C-O-R-E%29-Images-Thread?p=1369036#post1369036\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EC.O.R.E.\u003C/a\u003E mod to be added into the same .dll and be renamed from \u003Cem\u003EModuleCORESolarPanel\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003EModuleMergedSolarPanel\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t write plugins so I don\u0027t know how difficult/easy this would be but I don\u0027t think it would be too hard.
