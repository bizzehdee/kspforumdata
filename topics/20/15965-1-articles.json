I remember long time ago when KSP used to be 0.10 there was a steampunk texturepack, but it exists no longer. I do not know how to texture parts which have no texture file, and, i\u0027m not THAT good at texturing things. So i ask you please, if you would be able to make a texture pack which includes wood, brass, a lot of brass, some golden paint and pretty shiney bolts, i would be delighted, and i guess not only me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith respect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlymouth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plymouth","CreatedById":8420,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T06:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m frankly sorry for posting a thread into the wrong forum.
