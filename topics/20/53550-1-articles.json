I mean, when RT2 starts working, you need connection with KSC through the right range antennas, and the default ones don\u0027t get you further than Duna, anything in Dres/Jool/Eeloo will need a satellite relay. But, you have a second issue. Antennas should be enabled to work. And as far as my savegame shown me, it\u0027s not the same as having them extended in stock game. You need to enable after RT2 is installed, but as they are disabled and out of the 3Km probe core integrated antenna range, you can\u0027t enable then because you don\u0027t have communication to KSC. You may be luckier than me and your antennas may appear enabled, but I think that\u0027s not the default option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ingame option is to get an active probe with connection to KSC less than 3Km away from each probe, switch to it, and enable antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe option I used, as I had only three stranded probes, was to edit the persistence file to enable the antenna parts of that probes, after placing satellites in range for them to connect, but you may screw the savegame this way, and if you have a lot of probes, you may need a nice amount of time editing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T20:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a good answer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have to edit the savefile, which parameters should I be looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to have the mod working on only ONE savegame?
