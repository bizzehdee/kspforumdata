Is there already a ModuleManager patch that does this? If there isn\u0027t, how would I go about making one (and possibly sharing it with the community?) Would I have to enter all the values for all the engines manually as opposed to there being a nice clean way to just increase a multiplier and being done with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis question really popped up after I was thinking about an idea for a mod that would let you \u0022overthrottle\u0022 to 110% or so, with greatly increased heat output. After finding nothing of the kind, I figured that it\u0027d be mostly useless (as everything\u0027s already balanced all nicely, and you probably wouldn\u0027t ever need that extra push, unless you were coming from Eve or something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, in short, or \u0022How I learned to stop worrying and read the \u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs there a way to make engines overheat easier WITHOUT entering everything manually?
