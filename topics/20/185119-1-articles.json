The one thing that could break is the part switching, theres\u00A0a bug in the 1.7 versions that makes it not remove the tanks you switched off of until you click off of the part, but outside of the part switching mods (which when they break, seem to get fixed pretty quickly) it seems pretty stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferratus","CreatedById":98648,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T20:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB9 seems to be one mod that was well made and it keeps ticking while some other mods had a hiccup with the new DLC.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
