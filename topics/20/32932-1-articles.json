Trouble is Damned Robotics is on the back burner for 0.20 update right now. Does anyone have an alternative. All I want is a hinge with a control that allows you to fold an unfold it ala DR. Fixed 90-degree and 45-degree ones would be a good start but ultimately i\u0027d like to be able to set them to any angle in a 180-degree arc so I can make ramps, folding solar arrays, pods etc. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T12:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArticulation is a big thing that people have been clamouring for for a while, it\u0027s certainly on my list of cool things to get (along with updated Aero!). I think that Squad are planning something in the future, and given that Romfarer is part of the modding team and he worked on a Canadarm equivalent in one of his mods, it will certainly be something they\u0027re looking into (cause all the cool stuff in space comes from manipulation!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khalidibn","CreatedById":994,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T12:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a fix in the Damned Robotics thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/9675-v0-19-Damned-Robotics-Version-1-3?p=428734\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post428734\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/9675-v0-19-Damned-Robotics-Version-1-3?p=428734\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post428734\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MDBenson","CreatedById":65560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh really?
