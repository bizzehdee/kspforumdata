If a mod is supported, the tech tree mod itself ships definitions of where the parts are to show up, overriding those present in the parts mod. If a mod is not supported, its parts are very likely to no appear at all, because these custom tech trees usually delete the stock nodes outright (it makes it easier for the author to control what parts end up where). The advantage to this approach is a very consistent and logical distribution of parts even across mods, and the guarantee that every tech node actually has a purpose. The downside is that all mod\u00A0support is handled\u00A0by one single person, and that person may only have so much time (or may not be interested in supporting the mod you want).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproach two is the one taken by Community Tech Tree. This custom tree only ships the empty nodes, period. It does not add any modded parts support at all. In addition, it keeps the stock nodes intact. Under this approach, it is the authors of the part\u00A0mods that choose to support CTT. They will ship a config that, if it detects CTT installed, distributes parts in a different manner than if it was not present. Meanwhile, part\u00A0mods that do not support CTT simply end up landing in the unchanged stock nodes. The upside is extremely broad compatibility; there is literally no part mod in existance that is not compatible with CTT, and it \u0022supports\u0022 (rather, is supported by) more mods than any other custom tree. Any author of a new parts mod can come in and effortlessly integrate themselves, or even make a case for new nodes to be added to CTT. The downside is that different mod authors may have different ideas of balance and progression, and so it is not always guaranteed that the collection of parts found in any given tech node makes perfect sense. And if non-supporting mods are in the mix, you might get very powerful parts in the \u0022early\u0022 stock nodes. Additionally, some nodes are pretty specialized, and only few mods will use them; the vast majority of CTT installations will probably have some nodes that are empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Regardless of the chosen approach, though, you can always redistribute\u00A0parts yourself via fairly simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-02T10:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2018 10:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T15:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all of that said, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168100-h0ff1/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168100\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168100-h0ff1/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@H0FF1\u003C/a\u003E parts basically require a line for what tech node they require in order to show up.
