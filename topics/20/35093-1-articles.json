From what i know Unity can only have ONE rendering window at a time. So your best chance would be, like 6677 mentioned, to use software to mirror your screens output... but i cant think of a mixed UI/NonUI system that could work with unity as it is today.

Double the rendering costs of KSP, B. be an exact duplicate of the main window. I doubt it would be possible without major consideration in the deep code to allow for a second screen operating at a different resolution. However, it may be more possible to create a system that would record the events of the mission and play them back in the rendering engine without most physics later on; allowing for it to be played back at much higher resolution and hopefully lower load. Such a method may also permit it to be played back slowly, say one frame per second, and recorded that way, then sped up in editing, a great way to allow for better looking output on lesser machines, or programs that simply suck at being efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say all that but it\u0027s kind of a not-worth-it topic for mod devs right now because Squad has suggested they\u0027re interested in it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this video\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKp_nAqlzaw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately if you desire it to be live, you\u0027re kinda screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote, you can currently edit the resolution in the main settings cfg, to allow for any resolution you desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect Squad would be more than happy to allow this show to happen, as you\u0027re not even allowing the visitors to play, it\u0027s basically a giant really nice advertisement, plus it sounds fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
