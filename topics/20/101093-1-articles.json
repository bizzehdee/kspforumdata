We\u0027ve seen all the components for the idea of this mod before in various mods before, but this particular amalgamation is something I came up with last night.\n\nWe have a stanford torus mod, but it\u0027s, well, actually too big to fit in-game without work. We\u0027ve got Porkjet\u0027s centrifuge inflatable habitat, but it\u0027s old, and, well, kind of wimpy. We\u0027re got the MKS/OKS systems, but they\u0027re small, and not that suited for monolithic structures. We\u0027ve got the universal storage system, with wedges of purpose-built modules that allow for multiple purposes and vast flexibility within the same area of space.\n\nSo, let\u0027s combine the ideas. A central axis/wedge holding system, designed to fit wedges around it to produce a diameter of 5 or 10 meters (depending on the design) with zero-g environment end-caps for purposes needing them. A series of purpose-built wedges designed for various needs (life support wedge, snack high security chamber, crew quarters, SCIENCE!, workshop, power generator, rec room, observation deck, etc) which can be fitted into this system, albeit permanently welded in due to their size (2 meters from inner attachment point to outer hull for the small size, 3.5 meters for the 10 meter size). All of this with all the optional modules for various life support mods and colony mods, with a zero-g 5 \u0026 10 meter super-lab for helping to close one end or another, or a super-workshop for Extraplanetary Launchpads, or a super-command module, and a plate built for welding 4-5 3.75 meter drive systems in case you don\u0027t have something like old \u0027boom-boom to loft the assembly into orbit. \n\nI have negative modeling skills, but I might be able to help with the programming of said modules and chribbing the good stuff off to make it all work."},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T06:40:56Z","Content":"General Part Objectives:\n\nMaximum Habitat, Utility, \u0026 Station Size without unrealistically massive part counts/unrealistically massive rockets (like, say, anything more than a 5-cluster of 3.75 meter ascent rockets).\n\nAimed for sizes: 5 Meter diameter, 7.5 meter diameter, 10 meter diameter in 2.5 meter height, 3.75 meter height, and 5 meter height.\n\nTypes: Centrifugal \u0026 Fixed sections respectively for varying needs.\n\nCentrifugal types: \n\nSingular drum mounted between fixed ends, wedge system for multi-purpose sections (in half-wedges and quarter wedges).\n\nSnack/Life Support Storage \u0026 Processing Center\n\nEPL Workshop\n\nScience Lab\n\nCommand Post/Communications center\n\nReactor system/Utility Section\n\nDual Paired Reaction wheel system/Utility section\n\nLife Support Generation Section (Farm center?)\n\nObservation Deck\n\nFixed types: \n\nWedges around central Axis (possibly reusing Centerfugal sections)\n\nBetween-size adaptors with use?\n\nSingular Drum\n\n4-Way retracting/extending shielded arms for creating Hub section, minimum of 3.75 meters tall for allowing users to connect up to modded 3.75 meter berthing docking collars. Extending arms revealed from behind clamshell doors/extend from unshielded doors. Alternate version could be massive utility bays for storing bajillion SCIENCE! experiments, Universal storage wedges in the walls for various needs, EVA micro-vehicles (command chair strapped to singular solar panels and RCS system, with KAS container attached)\n\nCommand deck center: Massive communications center, lots of kerbals aboard, lots of reaction control. \n\nAdaptor drum/system (Short) for out-rigging 1.25 meter parts to extend parallel to the axis of the part down the length of station (see the B5 heat exchanger arms). Could do multi-way nodes for added use.\n\nFuel storage drums in multiple flavors with pressurized crew tube up the center.\n\nMassive Observation Deck/Zero-G rec Center. Sliding armor panels over windows. Could be inter-size for added view, or fixed diameter.\n\nGiant (short) reaction wheel assembly/battery assembly. Includes RCS thrusters (possibly) and lights. Reaction wheel capacity of \u0027Yes\u0027, but drains hideous amounts of power.\n\nMassive EPL Launch bay (ala: IXS spacedocks), doors open, crew tube down one side to allow passage through. Biggest part of pack, equalish to small bay from IXS pack. Ginormous version also possible. (12.5 meter or 15 meter diameter?)\n\nPossible massive nuclear reactor set-up? Would need permission from Nertea for using his reactor scripts. \n\nEPL containers in wedge and drum form, EPL conversion workshops for both form-factors.\n\nI\u0027ll try and start work on drawing up design sketches for the general ideas that I have. If there are modelers out there who might be interested, I\u0027d love to contact you."}]}
