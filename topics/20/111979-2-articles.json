Alarm Clock is for managing time warp. The new \u0022warp-to\u0022 in stock is a step in the right direction, but KAC is still more functional and flexible.\n\nThe others I group together because they all solve a serious problem in stock - the player is information-starved. Take or leave the build information - doing it by hand gives you a lot of insight as to what is actually going on, but it\u0027s tedious. Take or leave the autopilot - it\u0027s what the real pros do, but it somewhat turns the game from \u0022flying\u0022 to \u0022programming\u0022 your flights.

It was sort of neat using spreadsheets to figure out delta-V and stuff on my own, but after proving to myself that I could build/plan/fly effectively that way, it really just became a waste of time to keep tabbing around plugging in numbers when Engineer could just give me the numbers in-game.\n\nDynamicWarp is one of my favorites because I don\u0027t trust the stock physics warp. Also nice for when my altitude doesn\u0027t allow high timewarps for some arbitrary reason, and for watching things break in slow motion - either to figure out why something is failing or just because it looks cool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T04:07:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zarakon**"},{"CreatedByName":"mielgato","CreatedById":113298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T04:44:17Z","Content":"I like playing heavily modded, but since I have to choose, I would select the few mods i\u0027m absolutly waiting for them to update every patches before playing :\n\n- TweakScale\n- Procedural Parts\n- Kerbal Alarm Clock\n- Transfer Windows Planner\n- Kerbal Engineer\n- Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (no more wet noodle rocket/mothership)\n- ScienceAlert!
