If any 5x Kerbol mod author can ensure their mod is fully compatible with CCF certified mods, that would be a different thing, and not really fit within the framework above, but such a modder could/would be able to certify their mod as CCF compliant - but they would have to do the actual work of making it so. To keep this project simple, however, I highly recommend we avoid requiring more of CCF compliant mods than the bare minimums to sustain a balanced career with other CCF certified mods. This might mean putting the onus on compatibility with the 5x Kerbol author than on all other CCF authors.

A list of who\u0027s certified would eventually arise from this collaboration, making seeing any\u00A0holes in the framework as opportunities for new mods to be developed to fill in the gap, so that eventually a full career experience if a player opts to do all progression nodes, could be served. \u00A0Essentially I felt that career seemed to be lacking a few key mods when I started my career game in November for the first time. Hence why I\u0027m developing GAP. But I can\u0027t develop all missing elements. That and I can\u0027t self-balance all existing mods. That, and SETI is no longer being developed. So... Community Career Framework is born here to hopefully get the ball rolling on something more collaborative, open, and directional in serving this need for a solid career game experience for players. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst up, discussing current stock imbalances to see if there are any changes that really need to be made - if any at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, discussing what people would like to see in a collaborative mod author career project - what do people want in Career that is nearly universal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, how should we balance our mods with stock or whatever stock changes we base the project on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s publish some guidelines based on consensus, and keep it a living publication as we grow, learn, adapt, and develop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T07:55:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T14:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me to throw my 2 cents in this thread. Somehow, I got a feeling that I will end up with wall of text, but I will try to make it interesting to read.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have watched various topics in the past regarding career modification, Yemo have even adopted some of my suggestion in SETI, so I will write some of this stuff as much as I recall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look how stock career look like, especially for players who are new in KSP.\u00A0 For player who play KSP for the first time it is recommended to try sandbox game first. But for new player who are not familiar with game at all, SPH/VAB editor might be overwhelming with all those unlocked parts. New player don\u0027t know where to look at to start building his first rocket. So, new player decide to make first steps in game trough career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn starting new stock career game, player have limited funds, have very limited access to basic rocket parts and can only create manned rocket. First objectives are to reach space and establish orbit around Kerbin. I don\u0027t like to kill many kerbals due to failed test flights, so I mostly reload saved game. That can be tedious sometimes. Other players don\u0027t care if they killed some poor kerbal or not, they just hire new one available in roster. But guess what, hiring new kerbonaut is costly and you will end game too quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is one of reasons why many of players seek for career mod that will allow to start with remotely controlled crafts, at least for the very first\u00A0 tasks, like reaching space or establishing first orbit and first re-entry attempt without killing any of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s say that player learned how to build his first rocket, he know how to make re-entry and walk out alive. Next thing who everyone want is to land as close as possible near KSC, so player can recover maximum value from craft as possible (both, science and bucks). So far so good, but where f***k is KSC location on Kerbin ????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven veteran players of KSP could find difficult to locate KSC when it is on dark side of planet. There is no built in icon or nav point or anything that can be used to mark KSC (various mods excluded to keep things on topic). So player is advised to put some flag near runway, so he can calculate re-entry to land craf close as possible to KSC. And guess what, you no longer can plant a flag near KSC, you need to upgrade kerbonaut building first to be able to do that. And that cost large amount of money that player does not have early in career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that can be solved in a way that you build another craft and put it near KSC, so at least you have a clue where KSC is. It is tedious to create some craft on runway each time, so you want to put it near runway or launch pad instead exactly on runway, to avoid reposition of it each time. Also it is better to use some probes instead of flags due to kraken that always watches and eat up those planted flags so often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut guess what, you can\u0027t create craft with wheels at begin of career because it is located much higher in tech tree. Having ability to mark down runway is even more important for players who like planes, so you can align plane properly with runway even before you are able to see runway model. It is some kind of very primitive ISL, but it works for game purpose well enough. I will return to this later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is reason why I suggested Yemo to make low grade rover wheels available early in game, so you can drive around KSC and create custom waypoints that serve as ILS. On top of that, early scientific parts like thermometer and barometer are also pushed early in starting node. That allowed player to grind some science points by measuring temperature and pressure near KSC, and to get familiar how science mechanic work in KSP in genaral. Yemo balanced this well enough for SETIctt, you can\u0027t get too much science from it, but it will allow you to unlock some first tier nodes if you need some part in that node that is essential for building some early rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, let\u0027s say player get a grip with KSP, he has learned how to build rockets, establish orbit, make proper re-entry on desired position.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext thing new player need to learn is how to dock with another craft in orbit - stock career contracts does that well enough with those rescue missions, although it silly to some degree. How some poor kerbal stranded up in space at all is mystery, since player is pioneer of space program on whole Kerbin, but never mind that. Trough rescue from orbit missions player will learn essentials how to play KSP later on. Docking procedure with another craft in space is very important for space station building and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter learned docking/rendezvous procedure, next thing that is covered good enough trough contracts(I\u0027m not sure if that is from stock or some mod) is to put some satellite in exact orbit that have certain Ap/Pe/Inclination on various space objects. Those contracts were good for player to learn how to explore distant planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let see what is next step that some player want to do in KSP. Another logical step is to build base on some celestial body. But, before building base out there player need to grind enough money for those missions and need a \u0022good\u0022 reason to build base somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good\u0022 reason to build something on distant planet is various resources. I think that Roverdude covered that well enough trough USI MKS/OKS mod. He actually did that so well that it become part of stock game too in large degree. There is also mods like DMagics orbital science and SCANsat that covers exploration good for various expectations from average KSP player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is not covered well in stock game is how to grind money needed to build crafts and bases/probes etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStock contracts like test part X at Y speed on Z altitude is good early in career, to learn how to build craft that will reach proper altitude and have required speed at same time, but those kind of contracts could become boring very soon especially when you start new career each time new KSP version is released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat gave me idea of new kind of contract that someone hopefully will be able to create for game. Let\u0027s say that player learned to put some probe around Kerbin and discovered various resources around planet. Probably very few people will bother to create bases on Kerbin, but to be able to create some base on distant planet you will have to learn how to assembly base at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one type of contracts regarding this could be similar to station building contract packs for orbital and distant celestial body bases. Other type of contract could be that some Company have extracted some resource type based on info from your probe in space. To pay off that information to you, they have collected that resource in container instead of money, because that company is short on bucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment you accept that contract, some debris can be spawned on Kerbin and you can recover it to earn some bucks. But it is more valuable if you create a craft (plane/boat/rocket whatever player want) and transport it close to KSC. That way you will be able to recover it with much greater value. That type of contract covers grinding money need for space exploration and also will teach player how to create his own craft that he need to use to assembly big bases on distant planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I\u0027m still on contract topic, I have also idea for GAP in mind. I already mentioned need to put crafts/flags near runway to serve as ILS (sort of) to help with landing. Main issue with flags, small probes is due to game engine physics - it could be blown away whenever you come in physics calculation range and various other kraken related issues. So, I was thinking about contract where player need to deploy navigation probes near runway. One probe 1km on land west of starting plane position on runway, one probe near runway close to starting craft position, but outside of craft spawn range and runway model range(three level of runway), another one on the end on runway near shores and last one in sea 1km from shores. All those lined up so, when targeted could serve as ILS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce player fulfill\u00A0 contract, those deployed probes should be removed from game to not disturb kraken anymore, but instead of probes, nav points could become available that can serve as same ILS purpose. I think that something like that is feasible, only problem is that those nav points should be able to show/hide as desired. Something like contract that never expire with ability to turn off those nav points to not abuse players who don\u0027t need those in game at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the end some comparison between ETT and SETIctt. Although those trees looks visually very different, ETT spreads in both directions, left and right while SETIctt have look more closer to stock tree, but both have some similarities in essence. Those similarities are already mentioned - branches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst rule for CFF that should be respected by other mods is that player shold be able to build very first craft in a way he want, should be land/sea based craft, plane or rocket it is up to player to decide how he want to develop career later on. Should parts for those be in only one starting node or it will be spreaded trough several tree nodes, should tech tree be spreaded in one direction or two is less important. It is up to vison of moder or group of moders how they want for tech tree to look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on wall of text above, there should be starting point for very low tech level that all mods should respect:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nparts for land(rover) a like crafts - wheels and command seat from stock parts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nvery basic cockpit/wing/landing gear that alows you to build first plane\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nvery basic command probe with built in antenna and limited range that can be put on plane or rocket without risking kerbal life, , thermometer, barometer, and lowest grade battery\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nbasic low tech rocket parts that allows you first manned space craft if you want to choose that path\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other parts/tech nodes should be derived from those first branches and should be possible to use further spread of tree however some moder have his own vision how tree should look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m\u00A0 divided about opinion should some moder need to give tech level required for his part or not. Sometimes part could \u0022fit\u0022 vision of tech tree model for anyone that create career mod based on EET or SETI for example, and sometimes someone might think that this part is out of overall gameplay balance and should be put somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will be good if CFF compatible part gives info where should it belong: \u003Cstrong\u003Eland/plane/rocket/science\u003C/strong\u003E and give tech level number.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTech level number should be used as general guideline how much science should be required to unlock this part, but should not be restriction if someone find it out of balance and move it higher on lower on tech node.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running out of time, to elaborate it any further right now, I will clarify my opinions if needed in some other post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T15:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222335346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450968808\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127158\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kcs123\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, kcs123 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got a feeling that I will end up with wall of text, but I will try to make it interesting to read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep on both accounts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T15:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222335346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450968808\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127158\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kcs123\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, kcs123 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that can be solved in a way that you build another craft and put it near KSC, so at least you have a clue where KSC is.

But I was considering whole this new feautures for new players who are completely noobs in KSP, who haven\u0027t tried to build plane and find it difficult to land. I was thinking more of that mini contract missions to put probes on specific places more as tutorial of gameplay mechanic than absolute need for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if player choose to accept such contract for probe deployment can do that as I described, he can do that and earn some money in process.

In either of cases, if contract is is successful, player fail contract or refuse do do that at all, at the end nav points can become available if player need those to be displayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter numeruos career start, some players might find this kind of contract tedious and might choose to not do that at all.

If player cancel or fail contract it could be notified that someone else have accomplished it, so he didn\u0027t earned any money, but he got those nav points free to use if he needs them. That would not be immersion breaker of whole idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m not short of ideas, but I don\u0027t have enough time to wrote everything at once, so I will write other things that floating somewhere in my mind as soon as I can.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would also try to be smaller wall of text to be easier to track down everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T17:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI primarily mod, rather than play, but if I may offer my two cents on something here that has piqued my interest: part balance guidelines.
