I had not noticed that before. Just installed the latest version, and it does indeed look like your screen shots. Maybe it is a way to control rovers (since \u0022Wheel\u0022 is prominently displayed, and if you press the \u0027enter\u0027 key in the fields it will say something like \u0027drive to\u0027) ?.

I have to unlock the rover wheels before I can put that to the test but it certainly sounds plausible. As for wheel, I was speculating that perhaps it was the reaction wheel power setting or something like that but yeah, rover wheels does sound sensible. It would have been\u00A0nice if the documentation covered it though and especially the how-to bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T19:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally had a chance to have a look at this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRodhern is correct, this is for rovers. (someone tell me how to \u0022mention\u0022 names here, with that blue background and all)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did try 2 of the modes: Hdt and Fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe directional PID for the Hdt needs tweaking. That could be a challenge as tweaking is on a case to case basis but perhaps one could include sliders for a DIY tweaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fine mode seems to work fine. One needs to manualy steer but if the rover has enough motor power and traction, then it holds the speed fairly well. A bit of tweaking would work but it\u0027s a far better choice than Hdt, the way I figure. Only thing is, to maintain speed, it appears that the computer will not use brakes but run the wheels in reverse. This drains power unneccessarily but all things given, for game balance it actually works pretty well. You gain some, you lose some and a higher power consumption is\u00A0a fair price. Perhaps if it would use the brakes and drain the batteries at a higher rate than not at all\u00A0could work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe turn function in Fine is a bit strange and I\u0027m not entirely sure what use it would have. Basically, from what I figured, you set the wheel slider to whatever turn radius you want, in percentage, then in the turn box, type in a turn angle between 0 and 90 degrees. Hit enter and it performs the turn. This function cancels any other program you have running so if for instance you have a program running to drive straight ahead for 10km at 15 m/s, then hitting the turn function will cancel the drive program and initiate the turn. After the turn, the computer is idle with the original drive program erased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll modes it seems apply parking brakes after the program ends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
