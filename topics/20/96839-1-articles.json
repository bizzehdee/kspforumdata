This machine has 48 of those XeEV-01 Xenon extraction units. Leave it sitting out in the sun for less than a day and you get 56000 units of Xenon Gas, which nets you well over 200000 in Kerbal currency when recovered, essentially rendering Career Mode into Science Mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the game balance isn\u0027t perfect yet, and maybe this is one of those things, but perhaps this could be tweaked a bit so it can\u0027t be used to make free money? Perhaps slowing down the rate of xenon production to the order of weeks or months for such quantities of gas, or increasing the power requirements for the Extraction Units. Or alternatively, if the game allows for this, put the gas produced by these units into some sort of fuel supply at the Space Center that can\u0027t be recovered for its cash value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this really undermines much of the challenge of Career Mode (e.g. trying to put a modular space station in orbit on borrowed money and not bankrupting your space program). I don\u0027t object to the possibility of having your space program pay off economically at some point down the line, but I would rather this become possible after your space program becomes much more mature, after a long and costly pioneering era. (I haven\u0027t even reached Duna yet in this game). What do folks think?
