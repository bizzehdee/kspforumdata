Discuss!","CreatedByName":"Yarrula","CreatedById":99782,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:42:20Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Yarrula","CreatedById":99782,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have been a lot of posts recently discussing whether it is too easy to earn Science or Funds through contracts. Given the popularity of mods such as MechJeb and Engineer, I suspect most players are using one or the other. If the Devs balanced the game with just the stock interface in mind, would information mods like these drop the difficulty via reduced trial and error?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you know your rocket is going to have enough dV to go to the Mun, it stands to reason that your profit margin would be a lot greater than someone who guessed and over-engineered a margin of safety, resulting is too much fuel/weight being brought along. Obviously, the more skilled the player, the better that guess will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use mods anymore, because I can\u0027t be bothered to update them and I like the guesswork engineering portion of the game. With that, I have not felt any financial strain. Sometimes, I fail launches, but I have been reverting those to the VAB and trying again after some tweaks. I do like the ability to make huge, ridiculous stations/contraptions, which wouldn\u0027t be possible without the budgetary surplus that comes along with the contract missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m enjoying the heck out of the contracts. It feels a bit like abuse when I leave a probe in orbit to pick off the \u0022transmit science from X\u0022 contracts, but it hasn\u0027t stopped me from doing it. That\u0027s a valid reason to have stations now, which I like a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that there are nearly as many ways to play KSP as there are players, is trying to balance the game for any particular style a futile waste of time? Someone will always be unhappy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think? Do mods play a role in a player\u0027s ability to amass a stash of cash? Or does the revert option skew every mission towards profitability regardless? Should every launch ride the razor edge of profit or does the joy of lobbing mailsail-based boosters into orbit on a whim gloss over the ease of making bank? Let me know!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamuchi","CreatedById":110857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like playing with mods as they add alot more versatility? to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfcourse some could be seen as cheat lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MJ so it saves me time as I usually f\u0060it up one way or another, but can do it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency with launches, yes and no, adding mod parts now with contracts just makes it more expensive and if you use, say RT2, you can\u0060t just shoot probes around the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe it\u0060s just me, but I\u0060m not a fan of efficiency and throw on all sort of junk on my ships for fun, overkill or a complete lulz moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid a orbital rescue from contracts and built the most stupid thing for a lol instead of a simple pod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E [will be posted in a couple of minutes as I just finished the edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all comes down to what each and every one sees as fun in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing stopping someone playing stock career from building and testing vehicles in a parallel sandbox save before continuing in career.

Some mods are utility mods that can help you accomplish a lot of different tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorites is Kerbal Engineer Redux, which can figure out a craft\u0027s delta-V, TWR, and a whole bunch of other very helpful information. Kerbal Alarm Clock prevents you from warping past maneuver nodes, SOI changes, and whatever else you set it for. It can also help you find transfer windows. It\u0027s amazingly helpful for when you wanna run several missions at once. SCANSat lets you make maps of a planet for elevation, biomes, and even anomalies, and can help you make more precise landings by watching your orbital path on the map. Mechjeb does a lot of the stuff KER does and also has autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome mods are there specifically to make the game more difficult. Deadly Reentry adds reentry heat which can destroy parts of a craft or even possibly the entire craft, which is normally something that you don\u0027t have to worry about. Ferram Aerospace Research requires you to add fairings for probes and other non-aerodynamic stuff, which actually requires a separate mod if I remember correctly. TAC Life Support makes you have to keep track of how much food, water, and oxygen you have or your Kerbals can die. Remote Tech makes you set up a communication network with satellites to connect to KSC, and without it you can\u0027t control probes if they don\u0027t have a direct line of sight to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people like the difficulty mods because they are supposed to make the game more realistic by adding in other concerns that stock KSP doesn\u0027t have. Some people just wanna play with rockets.
