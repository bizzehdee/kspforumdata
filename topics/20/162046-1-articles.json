However, \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s really hard!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s difficult to attach propulsion systems without blocking the doors, and even moreso for the windows. There are no hatches either. Reentry is a huge pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I the only one who wishes there was a better part for this? Some kind of horizontal lander part with more attachment nodes and a better hatch system? Maybe one that holds 3 kerbals?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone already make one? If so, who? If not, would someone?

The viewer pod from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140262-13-airplane-plus-r160-fixed-sounds-revised-iva-and-rotors-now-with-hover-jun-2-2017/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAirplane Plus\u003C/a\u003E makes a great horizontal lander cockpit. This one has a docking port on the back, which means no room for an airlock, which means the cockpit has to serve as one. I\u0027m thinking that an inline airlock like the one from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133606-130-kerbal-planetary-base-systems-v144-6-june-2017/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKPBS\u003C/a\u003E would be perfect, sort of like the inline shielded docking port but an airlock instead. Kerbals could enter and exit from the sides no matter what crew parts you were using, and I could still have my docking port at the back. It would also work very well with plane designs in which you don\u0027t want passengers climbing through the cockpit to get out. I\u0027d make it but I don\u0027t know how to model in 3d. Maybe someone else could?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T13:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you like KPBS, it has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E engines and you could make a lander with it directly, if you wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther options that immediately spring to mind:\u00A0 The Karibou (now rolled into MKS) has some very good parts for this.\u00A0 Although it\u0027s a bit short on airlocks - but has some very good attachment points for MKS airlocks.\u00A0 Also, the Buffalo or Bison from WBI have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E engines and landing legs, and could be used for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
