But all of them need some work. There are the stock parts, the LLL-Mod, with awesome parts, and there is the Mk4-Plane-Mod, also great. But afterall, i am just searching for a box to put a (also a big) rover in, and don\u0027t need to think about landerlegs that break of or melt on reentry or how to get a rover out of a cargobay that is 5m in the air, because there are no ramps.\n\nCan you give me a advise for a mod that is out there? Thank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:11:33Z","Content":"Have you looked at Lithobrake Exploration Technologies [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517)\n\nEDIT- Glad to help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T20:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"Melcom","CreatedById":89393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:35:50Z","Content":"ahh, thank you. \n\nTweakscale does miracles. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
