Or maybe a mod even adds a clone of a stock part with a different model or texture. At this point, I as a player am fairly quick to pick out the one of the two (or more) that I like best, and I end up using only that one, leaving the other one to clutter my VAB interface and consume memory needlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that simply deleting the part\u0027s folder will result in it not getting loaded, because it\u0027s not there anymore. However, in today\u0027s mod environment that becomes increasingly dangerous, as modders have devised texture-sharing between parts as an ingenious way of saving memory. Deleting the wrong part folder can screw up other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I\u0027d like to know in a bit more detail what exactly I can do to not load a part. For instance, is it enough to remove the part.cfg file? That surely will make the part no longer appear ingame, but will the client still load the left-over texture and model files into memory? Is there perhaps something similar to ModuleManager (or even MM itself) which allows me to specify a \u0022blacklist\u0022 kind of textfile with part names (paths?) to not load? Is there some other way I have not yet thought of looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T12:51:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModuleManager can be used to not load a part.
