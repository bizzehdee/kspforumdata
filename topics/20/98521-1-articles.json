But I\u0027ve looked around and can\u0027t find anyone who has released their personal build. Are there any out that someone could download?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T05:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m understanding what you\u0027re asking, you want a build of KSP that has various mods built-in as if they were stock features and parts. If that is the case I\u0027m afraid it can\u0027t be done. KSP is not open source, it is commercial software produced by Squad and the EULA explicitly forbids decompilation of the game\u0027s code. This by no means indicates that you can\u0027t add various mods to your game. Most, if not every, mod gives installation instructions and some give indications of mods that they do not play nice with. I would suggest making a list of all the mods you want, then go to their release threads and look them over for any incompatibilities to narrow down your list if necessary. Once you\u0027ve done that download the mods you want and follow their installation instructions, which typically is simply placing a folder or so into the KSP GameData folder. Note though that if you are using the 32-bit version of KSP, which as I understand it is the more stable of the two at the moment due to Unity 4\u0027s limitations is the more stable of the two, there is a RAM limit. ATM helps greatly by saving a significant amount of memory, but even with ATM you could still reach the RAM limit and cause KSP to crash even if all the mods you\u0027ve downloaded play nice with one another. I hope that I\u0027ve been able to help in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T05:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo expand on what The Shadow said, the general rule is that we don\u0027t do modpacks around here, due to licensing issues, versioning issues, and the assorted drama that comes with making copies of other people\u0027s work. Keeping all the responsibility for maintenance and distribution with the individual modders works pretty well, and avoids the clusterbomb that the Minecraft community has become.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T05:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere, just use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E, it\u0027s much better than a modpack because it can keep the mods individually updated and any mod on the network has been put there by the author.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
