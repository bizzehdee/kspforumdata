Any suggestions for general layout? I can do some static designs for feedback in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we can all agree on I think: Main navigation is a horizontal menu at the top, bellow a logo/banner, search field up there as well, question is what the navigation would contain, mod categories? (what are the categories?) top lists (most downloaded, highest rated etc)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavigation is the primary hurdle the spaceport failed to jump, there are a lots of good mods in there, buried by ship files with all tags you can add, if replaceport aim to be an improvement it needs intuitive navigation that quickly and easily gets you what you\u0027re looking for while showing you things you might also want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think replaceport could also have ship files but they would need to be clearly separated from mods, and the main search shouldn\u0027t list them by default, the option to search through ships and the search on the page specifically for ships would ofc allow you to look through them, but not the main search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne neat feature you could do with the ships is include a list of mods it needs, basically tag those mods on the ship entry, though again if you search for KW, show KW, not ships using KW, unless you search for ships specifically. A similar feature could be used to list needed libraries for a mod, say module manager, SmokeScreen, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObvious question is obvious: since this is a fan-project and not an official squad site can we use \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 or parts of it in the name, logo/artwork etc? I doubt Squad are the sue-happy kind but it\u0027s best to get these kinds of things down on paper, if the site\u0027s URL is something like \u0022kerbalmods.com\u0022 (not a particularly catchy url but you get my point) and at some point in the future squad gets an on-staff lawyer... well... though I guess if they object it\u0027s easy enough to switch at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"croxis","CreatedById":11516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T16:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECategories/Tags are hard to get right.

The most obvious push method would be an email (w/user selectable frequency). For a passive notification, logging on to the site would yield a notification icon that would link to a page listing mods that are newer than the version last downloaded by the user. This requires two significant elements. First, users must be logged in when downloading for this to be tracked. However, requiring registration as a barrier to entry is probably not what we want. Second, date and version of download must be tracked by the server for logged-in users.

It\u0027s not like we\u0027d want to harangue them them reminder e-mails if they didn\u0027t log on and download. And for a notification icon, you could just use their last logon date.
