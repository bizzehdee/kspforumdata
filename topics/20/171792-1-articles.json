Evidently, in a few years or so, the RTGs that power the probe will degrade to the point where they\u00A0can\u00A0no longer power the systems necessary for both scientific devices\u00A0and also communications; which leads to this question. Is there a mod that adds a degree of realism to ksp such that the solar panels and generators will degrade in efficiency to the point where they can no longer provide adequate power? I know of a few mods that add something similar (the only one I remember atm is dangit), but I\u0027m only interested in the electrical degradation, not system failures. Also, is there a mod that alters the experiments so that they require electricity to function, just like in real life?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-07T18:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor time degradation, I can think of DangIt which I\u0027m pretty sure has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
