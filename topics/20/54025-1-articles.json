Also, zzz has designed several engines and other bits that are exclusive to that mod. For myself, I\u0027ve downloaded the mod but I don\u0027t use it, I just altered the configs so I could use the parts I like. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no need for me to post a link to KSP interstellar though, just go to the \u0027Add-on Releases and Projects Showcase\u0027 thread, it\u0027s almost always somewhere on the first page, usually near the top, because SO MANY people have SO MANY questions about how to get the mod working right, it\u0027s that complicated. That, or it can derail into a 5 page discussion about the minutiae of precisely how to accurately replicate the decay of lithium into whatever within the nuclear reactors, or how efficient a thermal rocket engine is or isn\u0027t when attached to an antimatter reactor as opposed to a fusion reactor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUgh. You can tell that I\u0027m not a fan of the mod due to its complexity, but I do like a lot of the parts that it comes with, so there you go. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also, I think some of zzz\u0027s parts are used in a few other mods, such as KAS (Kerbal Attachment System) and the Kethane pack too, but I don\u0027t use those so I\u0027m not sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, most of what you\u0027d want as far as space station parts you should be able to get from the original thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"larsmaehlum","CreatedById":51566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T13:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add on to the question in the original post, are there any good station parts for generating science yet?
