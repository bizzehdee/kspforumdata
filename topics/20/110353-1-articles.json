When I first started playing KSP I always thought it was silly how the tiny little yellow tubes could transfer fuel so quickly for asparagus-staged rockets. I think it\u0027d be cool to have a mod that puts limits on the fuel lines and adds a slight penalty for using them. I assume in reality it wouldn\u0027t be so simple to pipe fuel all over the place like we do in KSP (especially at the rate we transfer it).\n\nWhat I had in mind was a single fuel line part that would have a fixed flow rate and a (relatively small) mass that is determined by the length of the fuel line. Then in the VAB right click menu, one could increase or decrease the flow rate. Adjusting the flow rate would then change the diameter of the pipe and increase the mass of the pipe.\n\nIt probably wouldn\u0027t be a huge game-changer, but I would definitely enjoy having a mod like this. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: although the actual pipe part would need to gain mass with diameter, theoretically there should also be a pump on one end and the pump would have to increase in mass to increase the flow rate. Would it be possible to add the mass of a theoretical pump to the tank part that the fuel is coming from? The mass of the pump would probably be more of a limiting factor than the mass of the pipes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T09:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 09:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cvod**"}]}
