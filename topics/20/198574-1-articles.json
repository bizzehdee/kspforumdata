But i was so used to a sea of mods and trying to put together another setup is a little frightening. But i have noticed a lot of mods doesn\u0027t explicitly say it support 1.10, but if i dig into the latest replies it looks like most do. but one of the reasons i once quit was because every time Squad released any little update half my mods would stop working. So i was wondering if this maybe isn\u0027t the case any more? And if so, at what release would you expect a mod to work from? (i.e. mods for 1.9 is expected to work on 1.10?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-07T20:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a big compatibility break with the change from 1.7 to 1.8, but since then most plugins have remained compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elmotrix","CreatedById":155589,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-07T21:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncool thank you\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
