On my latest attempt I got up to 28000m and I started to gain a bit of speed in air breathing mode but I was still way short of orbital speeds.

That engine sure has an amazing exhaust velocity for an air-breather; not to mention the super-materials needed to not melt at that (would-be) intake temperature! Makes sense to switch there? If your vertical velocity is at least 300 m/s (or so) of that then you\u0027re on your way out of the atmosphere as is! My designs usually linger around 13k and start climbing around 875 m/s to get to at least 300 m/s vertical, my engines lose thrust just above 1000 m/s (when I play with AJE, they rather melt and explode at that point), so I\u0027ll switch somewhere in the 20-25 range and pull into at least a 45 degree climb until my apoapsis hits my target altitude (usually 150km).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T19:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got the speed (1,400m/s is close to top speed for a FAR jet) but not the altitude; take it to 30,000m before switching to rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
