The parts will just be sorted into the same stock tech nodes you have already unlocked, so the parts will already be unlocked right away too. In order to get new tech nodes to unlock, you need a modded tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Interstellar bundles one, called Community Tech Tree, which is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-122-community-tech-tree-dec-31-122-update/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ealso available stand-alone\u003C/a\u003E. There are other modded tech trees out there as well, but this one is most likely your best choice, for a simple reason: it merely extends the stock tech tree by adding new nodes that branch off from stock nodes. Meanwhile, other modded tech trees might reorganize, change, or outright remove the stock nodes in favor of their own design. While this is fine for newly started saves, it means those other trees are incompatible with installing them into an existing save. And in general, you should follow the rule of the thumb to \u0022never change the tech tree of an existing save\u0022, else weird things may happen. The only exception that I know of is installing CTT into a stock save; that should not actually break anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the way CTT is built, it works a little differently from other tech tree mods. In those other cases, the author of the tech tree decides where parts should be placed, and that means they also decide which mods are supported. In the case of CTT, the author only provides the tree layout. It is every modmaker\u0027s own choice to support making use of these new nodes. This makes CTT guaranteed compatible with everything (except other tech tree mods), because even mods that don\u0027t make use of the extended nodes can still fall back to using the stock nodes as normal. But it also means that there may be unused empty nodes here and there if none of your part mods decided to use them, and that there is no handy list to check which mods have explicit support. Maintaining such a list would require keeping up with every single mod available for KSP, after all, and that\u0027s pretty much impossible. Still, you\u0027ll find that many part mods nowadays do support CTT, and if you are unsure, you can always ask in the respective threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in your case, I would start simply by installing CTT. Then, you can go look for mods that make use of it. If you\u0027re only looking for parts, then I would recommend not using KSP Interstellar right away; it does a lot more than just add parts. It adds many new gameplay mechanics as well. It\u0027s more of a complete overhaul of the game than a parts pack. You can try it out later, when you\u0027re more comfortable with playing modded. Instead, try smaller packs for now, which are more forcused on just parts. For example, try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90545-122-spacey-heavy-lifter-parts-pack\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESpaceY Heavy Lifters\u003C/a\u003E, which gives you a new size tier of rockets that are even larger than the 3.75m Kerbodyne parts. Comes with tanks, SRBs, liquid engines and various support parts like fairings and nose caps. If you are looking for nuclear reactors, try the Electrical subpack from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-122-near-future-technologies\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENear Future Technologies\u003C/a\u003E. There\u0027s plenty of other nice part mods that you can find by browsing the Add-On Releases subforum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s also \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128204-122-kerbal-research-development\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Research \u0026amp; Development\u003C/a\u003E. This mod lets you spend extra science to improve the stats of parts you already have. Not a parts pack, but if it\u0027s new ways to use science points that you\u0027re looking for, it might be just the thing you never knew you needed \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-14T08:31:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2017 08:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giygus","CreatedById":159017,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T20:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTYVM I downloaded all of it, Near future stuff looks like it will be just the fit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T20:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo for a full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E install \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt feels like starting over again with everything you\u0027ve learned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
