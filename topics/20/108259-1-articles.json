(kerbcam maybe)\n\nSo yeah, that was my request.\n\nBTW: if it\u0027s too hard, please don\u0027t get upset and yell(caps lock) at me that i\u0027m asking the impossible. And if the mod already exists, please tell me."},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T19:01:50Z","Content":"That would be a large undertaking, but there are mods that let you add new spawn locations, so you could build your own crawler and spawn it with a rocket aboard right outside the VAB."},{"CreatedByName":"EVDE","CreatedById":107276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:57:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That would be a large undertaking, but there are mods that let you add new spawn locations, so you could build your own crawler and spawn it with a rocket aboard right outside the VAB.\n\nYeah, that\u0027s a good idea!\n\nI already thought (somewhere in my subconsciousness) that this would be a hard mod.\n\nBy the way, do you know when KSP 1.0.x 64 bit for windows will be released?

I should be able to drive in and out of it. And... Rockets get built on the crawler in the vab. Then when your done you can either \n\nA.) Launch directly to the pad as is. Your rocket will spawn on the crawler out at the pad ready to go as it was in the VAB. Or..\n\nB.) You manually open up the VAB doors and move the crawler out yourself. \n\nDifferent sized crawlers too. I\u0027d love to put smaller rockets on... I don\u0027t what it\u0027d be called, but that trailer/train type horizontal mount. And then get to erect the rocket vertical."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:26:52Z","Content":"Moved to General Add-on Affairs."}]}
