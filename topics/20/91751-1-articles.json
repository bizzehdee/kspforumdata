Once out of fuel it despawns (crashes). I\u0027ve been working on a flying carrier/star ship mod. This would be good for near end game exploration and flying bases even on Jool. I was thinking of using Kerbin Side but I know everyone would like to move thier carrier around. I\u0027ve made parts for a helicarrier but I haven\u0027t found a plugin that fits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T04:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Eskandare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
