The warp drive will generate ExoticMatter for as long as it\u0027s supplied with Megajoules, when you tell the warp drive to warp, it will consume a set amount of ExoticMatter and speed you up to lightspeed. The mod is reasonably well documented so you can just read the front page for more information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T20:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks!
