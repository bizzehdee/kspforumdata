There\u0027s just one problem: I\u0027ve almost managed to complete the tech tree, and I just left Kerbin. About 3800 or so science remains in my tech tree, which seems like a reasonable amount except the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThree of these nodes are (in fact) from mods. Two are for procedural fairings, the other is for Kerbal Attachment System. The remaining nodes are related to spaceplane nodes that I never bothered to unlock. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have a couple of mods that provide additional science: namely, ScanSat and Station Science. I wasn\u0027t expecting ScanSat to have science (though I will gladly take it), and I have not done much with Station Science (although I presently am working on an interstellar craft utilizing it). These are the only two mods I\u0027m aware of that add science in my installation. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EContracts have been providing more science than I was expecting them to.
