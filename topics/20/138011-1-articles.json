I downloaded the updated versions of Interstellar fuel switch and Firespitter just in case and copy pasted the patch file from my 1.0.5 installation, but it\u0027s not working. So, am I doing something wrong or is there an alternative way to switch fuels in 1.1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is there some mod/MM patch to override the whole rover wheel mechanic? My heavier 1.0.5 are simply broken in 1.1 and I\u0027m not sure if heavy rovers are possible at all in 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
