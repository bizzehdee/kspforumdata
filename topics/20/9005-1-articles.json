I was thinking something like a small asteroid or spherical body about 1/3 the size of the mun. further out than the mun is. The reasoning behind this? Training at going further distances and landing on an object with much less gravity than we have gotten used too. it would make for more variety of missions than we can currently do. Also I would suggest having its orbit reversed to the muns, for diversity and so the mun can effectively be used as a staging point, again making things interesting. I would hope for things like this even in the final with the whole solar system, because it makes kerbin\\\u0027s AO more interesting and playable. Anyone have any thoughts on this?
