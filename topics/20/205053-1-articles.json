But I will tell you the story\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E in 1.10.1 and when I opened my save to launch a Soyuz, the shaders and the terrain were going crazy, I was thinking it was parallax doing all this craziness, so I decided that I would un-Install parallax, so I did, but it was still going insane, so then I realized that my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E icon was blank, so I thought to myself that It may be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E doing all this trouble, that\u0027s bc it was, I installed the wrong version for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, I uninstalled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and grabbed the compatible version, so yay for me I guess\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
