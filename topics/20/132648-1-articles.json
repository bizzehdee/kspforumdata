I\u0027ll go to the mun and the planets beyond with grace and style!\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then 2 hours later you\u0027re tired of playing with airplanes that will never make it to Duna and building the same rocket for the same probe to do the same fly by of the same Ike you flew past in every other save ever. Well what if there was a reason to go, to land, to explore, to stay in low orbit on hi graphics settings for hours analyzing the surface for anomalies that require full sets of crafts to be fully unlocked. I don\u0027t mean a face on Duna or a few arches on the Mun, I mean geological phenomenon, artifacts of some kind worth collecting/discovering other than just a generic soil sample. The tallest mountain in the system for example, or plumes of ice or lava, rivers of methane what have you. rocks of all kinds scattering the worlds of Kerbol, organic compounds in the soil, odd new compounds found at the shores of these lava feilds, or methane rivers. All there waiting to be found and cataloged. You\u0027d have missions like our own Munar mission, where we hear astronauts say \u0027look at that orange dirt\u0027 and you FEEL the excitement too. It isn\u0027t just the same procedurally generated terrain in real life, and that\u0027s WHY exploration exists. because we DON\u0027T know what Eloo will look like, or what type of craft we will need to fully understand a world like Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i guess where I\u0027m rambling to with this is something akin to a pokedex, or that feature in subnautica where you catalog your surroundings and have unique things to discover throughout entire worlds and entire solar systems. So I actually have to go and land a rover on duna, or fly a glider on laythe, or send a solar powered baloon to jool. so that exploration in this game means as much as the ingenuity in craft design. And I get its big, and I get it doesnt appeal to every one. But by giving us that sense of discovery, and that completionist dose of adrenaline, I think the game becomes more replayable. Exactly the way pokemon is replayable. You can find new things every play thru.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould I have posted this to the game design discussion board or would the modding community be able to support that sort of project?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
