A newbie here! just got the game today and been a big fan since it got out an now i am anxious to start this adventure!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a very methodical player and love space things and i was thrilled to start a gameplay for myself but i wanted a challenge, so i thought of something that i could try in sandbox and then try in career mode but i need a mod for this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ll leave here my idea of challenge if any of you like to try it and share with me their experience!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso my challenge is called \u0022Project HOPE\u0022 where, unfortunatly, my dear kerbins are at risk, resources in Kerbin are ending and they need to find a new planet to call home... so they decide to explore their solar system in search of this planet, once they reach it they need to explore it and make it \u0022habitable\u0022 (ex. create a full functional and self-sustentable base). Pretty much sums it up! but to do this i need a mod that hides all the planets and moons besides Minmus and mun (if it exists of course) so i can \u0022find them\u0022 on my own. also, because i never played i dont if there is such planet or moon similar to kerbin, if not i need one to include it in the solar system! please if u can help me i would be very thankfull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also open to sugestions on how to make this experience even better! i saw a lot\u00A0of gameplays online and have some knowledge of the game but not much, already have kerbal engineer redux and no dlc\u0027s. i also am familiar with that fan made chart with all the delta v\u0027s and think that\u0027s now on the game itself as a wiki.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you so much fellow kerbins!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-29T12:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022114736\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8863489543\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139473-18x-researchbodies-v1110-19th-oct-jun-2019/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere ya go.\u00A0 Maybe a colonization mod like MKS as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022105198\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed453422859\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154587-18x-modular-kolonization-system-mks/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-29T12:03:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2019 12:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by klgraham1013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-30T21:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf ResearchBodies supports modded star systems, you can go for that as well.
