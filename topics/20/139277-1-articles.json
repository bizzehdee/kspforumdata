So at 0, the leg suspension would activate instantly at the start of the deployment, or at 1 it would wait until the end. Some of the stock legs have 0.83, so it would get 83% of the way through the animation before activating the suspension. As far as I can tell, the idea is that the suspension would start working while the leg was still swinging into place, to help keep vehicles from leaping off the ground, if they were already sitting on the ground with the legs stowed. But that\u0027s for legs. I have no idea if it does the same thing with wheels or landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
