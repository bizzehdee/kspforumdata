Legs in KSP. Now, we\u0027ve seen BahamutoD\u0027s CritterCrawler, but that doesn\u0027t work too well for large things. So, more to the point, who should I ask?

Be aware that both the parts and the plugin are being updated in other threads at the moment, so there may be sudden game-breaking changes."},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T01:52:44Z","Content":"Thanks. The idea was to have a glue-on sort of leg. I imagine it would work like a wheel, but have the appearance and hitbox of a leg. I am aware of IR\u0027s capabilites, but I\u0027ve had some...*interesting*...experiences with phantom forces and my own incompetence, not to mention the difficulty of controlling it without scripts."},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T23:47:55Z","Content":"I need an intuitive, simple leg system too, because what fun is a giant killer robot if you need 3 years of training to know how to use all the hotkeys and controls?"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T21:13:43Z","Content":"What I want is a leg that can operate with multiple others similar to the wheels in stock ksp. it should also be big, and radially mounted. I really want to make something like the SMS Beowulf:\n\n ![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS86vwzItdZfGILqqXsSAYZymaiC46A0JUjOGOPGJ555Qe2mFNm](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS86vwzItdZfGILqqXsSAYZymaiC46A0JUjOGOPGJ555Qe2mFNm)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd yes, that is a ship with legs. Six of them. from an alternative WWI. From the Leviathan trilogy by Scott Westerfeld. It is effing awesome.

Imma probably make some more, better ones now that I have the maritime pack installed. I can put so many guns on them. all of the anti aircraft guns. all of them."}]}
