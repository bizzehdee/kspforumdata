I\u0027m trying to reproduce a memory leak that I\u0027ve had with Moho and Ike on a near-stock branch install but it doesn\u0027t seem to be happening and I\u0027ve got lots of mods on the main save.\n\nEdit: I do have GCmonitor, so theres that.\n\nEdit2: Okay..... I\u0027m not seeing the memory leak on Ike. I suspect maybe something with the heating overlay?..........\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T22:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:50:40Z","Content":"The heating overlay is (in 1.0.2, supposed to be fixed in 1.0.3) a known source of a memory leak. There\u0027s some kind of edge-highlighting option that can be disabled to prevent it from leaking, or it can be disabled manually via Mod\u002BF10 (or just F10, I forget which), or with e.g. [Temperature Gauge Killer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731)."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:30:51Z","Content":"While this is likely the PPFX edge highlighting bug, for future reference the way to tell is to do a binary search.\n\nIf using CKAN you can import/export your installed mods list, that makes things easier.\n\n1. Anyway, make a list of your currently installed mods. \n\n2. Remove half. \n\n3. Test for the bug. \n\n4a. If it\u0027s present, go to step 1. (or stop if there\u0027s only 1 mod left). \n\n4b.
