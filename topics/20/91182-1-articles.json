Like you say, Orbiter has UMMU, but Orbiter is fundamentally not well designed for EVA\u0027s, or base building for that matter. Plus, I\u0027ve rather come to enjoy actually building my own rockets, rather than depending solely on cool, yet unrealistically whimsical spaceships (IE: DeltaGlider). Plus, KSP has things like object collision, or (often through the use of mods) \u0022universal effects\u0022 across all vehicles. As opposed to Orbiter, where one ship supports EVA\u0027s, while another may not... or one ship may have reentry damage effects, while another doesn\u0027t, etc. It often becomes a pain when planning missions using multiple incompatible crafts. Most importantly, I love that KSP is a persistent system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, KSP with real-sized planets and real solar system is kind of unwieldy.
