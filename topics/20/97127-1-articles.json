The problem is that I only have the \u0022activate\u0022 button available if the antenna is deactivated. As it is now, the only option shown is deactivating. This is obviously a catch-22 because if I deactivate the antenna, it will no longer be connected for me to send the delayed activation command. Is there a way for me to send an activate antenna command without using the click buttons?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T04:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving not tried it myself, my understanding is that there is an \u0022Activate Anteanna\u0022 action you can assign to an action group and then activate the action group to activate an already active antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if that works for you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rotorwashed","CreatedById":68960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T04:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, this would definitely solve it, unfortunately I had no action groups capability in my career mode when I originally launched the ship. I thought I might have a fix using the actions on the fly mod, but it seems to have some hangup with remote tech that wont allow me to edit the action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rotorwashed","CreatedById":68960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T06:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finally figured this out using the \u0022action group manager\u0022 mod. although, I then ran into an annoying bug that kept destroying my landing craft at touchdown on eve at 2.4m/s.
