Knowing that some little twerp that does nothing but play game \u0027X\u0027 24/7 thinks they have the right to grind my teeth in the curb because I do not play like them, is the same as being bullied. I have a life. I have a job. I have a family to take care of. I am not a 5 year old with nothing better to do than have my X-Box be my parent. For the same reason, I do not post in forums as much. I have already been insulted in these forums becaused I overlooked something in another post and asked about it. I play my games at the difficulty level that is comfortable for me and where it remains enjoyable. It only effects me, not you. If that means having \u0022God mode\u0022 on, so be it. I am out to have fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is no different. I play it at the difficulty I feel comfortable with. I use MJ, Kethane, Enginner, and FuelTastic.

Yes, sending probes, sattelites, stations, and bases are one aspect. Kethane gives it an added layer to sending everything to all the planets and moons. Enginner gives me the data MJ does not and helps with giving me the numbers I need. FuelTastic is a God send for me. Yes, I know that you cannot convert energy into LOX. Without it, I would not be as far ahead as I am now and would still be trying to figure out how to get enough fuel into orbit to use later and that in itself has started to make me want to put the game down in frustration.

I will be more than impressed knowing you have done all you have on your own with stock parts and no mod help what so ever. Good for you. That is my ultimate goal as well. In the meantime, I will explore my solar system the way I want to. If you want to flex yoru muscles and feel the need to insult me for it, that is where you have issues.
