During this time I got thinking about electric and hybrid vehicles (irl) and started reading a [regenerative brakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake). Then, because I still had a crazy amount of time to wait while recharging, I thought maybe there\u0027s a mod for it. Sadly, after searching through a full recharge cycle I could find nothing. So I\u0027m putting it to the community to give this a go."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T13:29:08Z","Content":"Very great idea. I love wheels that do this so I don\u0027t need to bring 30,000 RTGs"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:01:12Z","Content":"If I had modding skills, I would do this."},{"CreatedByName":"HeckuvaTester","CreatedById":138862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T18:56:39Z","Content":"I see a part that gets toggled with the \u0022brake\u0022 action. It would produce a value of electricity equal to (some constant that is decided for balance) \\* (surface speed). This way, no electricity is generated by sitting there still. Sounds like my first mod!"}]}
