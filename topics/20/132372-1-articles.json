Stock instruments like the Mystery Goo, Science Jr. and the Negative Gravioli Detector aren\u0027t based off of any existing scientific instruments, and are therefore more \u0022Kerbal\u0022 and therefore wacky. The silly science reports are always enjoyable (except for the infamous \u0022You record\u00A0observations about the situation.\u0022 one that is used 25\u002B times, which I hate) and fit the Kerbal \u0022duct tape \u0026amp; definitely not\u00A0off-the-shelf/stolen things with fancy decorations added\u0022 attitude to engineering. So that said, I think a \u0022less serious\u0022 version of DMagic Orb. Science would be a neat stockalike (in both aesthetic and experimental\u00A0design) science experiment\u00A0mod, which there aren\u0027t very many of those in active development.
