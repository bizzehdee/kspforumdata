I would be looking for textures close to that of stock KSP just a bit more detailed. Also the pack would remove all stock planets and recreate them orbiting Kerbol instead of the Sun so I would need some of them retextured to look a bit nicer as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease let me know if you are interested.
