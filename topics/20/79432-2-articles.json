Secondly was the fact it reported on every single assembly loaded into the KSP execution space (see first point re user privacy). If the purpose for ModStatistics is to report on mods which want to collect those statistics, I feel a far better way to do so would be to expose an interface (like FARAPI, blizzy toolbar), and start up one instance of ModStatistics (in it\u0027s own GameData\\ directory) and have the mods which want statistics reported report via that interface. If the user doesn\u0027t want to report statistics, they opt out of one mod on startup and then delete the GameData directory if they wanted (future upgrades would prompt again in this case). This model (DLL in it\u0027s own GameData directory) seems to be almost universally accepted for every other plugin out there, I can\u0027t figure out why a different approach was necessary in this case. An additional benefit of this model is that mods could report mod-specific statistics if necessary (error counters, how long windows are open to see what users are actually doing with the mod) via an interface similar to statsd that the collector/reporter mod implements. This is far more useful (and more invasive, but it\u0027s opt-in, so it should be acceptable to most privacy conscious observers) than raw \u0027X people use mod Y\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond point on implementation is the GUID. This gets into the legal ramifications area if anyone from the EU/Canada/Mexico is involved (those being the top 3 I found having laws w/r/t cookies and tracking of users). It\u0027s an easy way to de-duplicate reports so you can get \u0027how many users are using X\u0027, but there are less invasive ways such as tracking hours in each mod (which you can aggregate anonymously) and dividing by tracked number of hours running the statistics mod which gives you a percentage of users using each mod. Then you just need to quantify the number of people reporting statistics which is trivial enough if you limit reports to 1 per day/week (some known time interval) so you can collect statistics on how many reports were in a period, and from that (and our percentage calculated previously) how many users are using each mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now derailing into a couple of other items I\u0027ve been thinking about recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027m surprised nobody in the community has tried to standardize yet (which would help with statistics reporting, and dependency resolution via auto-updaters) is standardizing a module manifest file. Something trivial like json or ini format which can list the URL to check for (URL to latest manifest file) and download updates (URL in the latest manifest leading to latest download). Other mods could then declare dependencies in their manifest (linking to the other mod manifests) so an auto-update tool could automatically update dependencies. I know there\u0027s some people working on something similar to this, not sure how far along it is. This would also help with the statistics mod being able to report on parts mods (scan directories for manifest, have a key in the manifest for the mod declare it\u0027s desire to be reported in statistics). This also prevents the dependency hell experienced by some users (where updating other mods overwrites configs) since your manifest would specify what paths are mandatory updates (like part modules, and plugins) and what are optional (like config files). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuto-updating is something I\u0027m disappointed Squad didn\u0027t address (except I guess it has to be opt-in) in the rules. Cryptography is hard to get right, and good cryptography is necessary in my mind for secure auto-updating. To that end I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea (or responsible) to implement this in a plugin, and it should be in an external app instead where someone only has to get the cryptography right once. I feel cryptography (in the form of file signing) is important here because we\u0027re downloading executable code to user machines, and right now with the auto-updaters people are writing now a compromise of your server (if hosting yourself) or your github/kerbalspace credentials means every active user of your mod is open to downloading malicious code (and you helped the malware author do it). Keeping this out in an external app means the code only has to be written and updated in one place so more eyes are on it and that app can validate the file (based on an SSL or GPG signature verification) before extracting to the KSP directory (I\u0027m thinking the manifest would have SHA1/SHA2 of the zip, and the manifest would be signed with the mod author\u0027s private key). User\u0027s would be prompted the first time they install a mod to trust the key that signed it for future updates. This prevents the potential attack described above (where your hosting is compromised and the plugin replaced with something malicious) so long as your private key remains secure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of this is off-topic for the OP, but this seemed like a decent place to start a conversation around these points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T03:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ragzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ragzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAuto-updating is something I\u0027m disappointed Squad didn\u0027t address (except I guess it has to be opt-in) in the rules.

You can collect statistics, if you clearly and in detail explain what is being collected and allow users to opt-in, opt-out is not good enough. All problems would go away at that point.
