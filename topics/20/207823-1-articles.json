However, it costs money so you should start with GIMP although you can\u0027t make normal maps with it. Maybe you should ask someone to help you convert the normal maps. I\u0027d be willing to help, but I don\u0027t have the tools. For the configs, you should refer to the kopernicus wiki. It saved me tons of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
