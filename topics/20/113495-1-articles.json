In 0.9 it seemed that as soon as I got to the Mun, the minmus contract popped up. Then when I got there the Duna and Ike (and Eve) ones showed up. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s different in 1.0, perhaps a glitch or intended, but I liked it better in 0.9 (not that I mind the new types of contracts in 1.0)\n\nBut yeah, the above list sounds right, Dres, Moho and then Eeloo are last. Moho is not that bad to fly to, but the 2000\u002B dV to capture is a challenge ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T08:33:20Z","Content":"You\u0027re probably stopping your science tree progression - unlocking parts will unlock new types of contracts.\n\nAnd you can always do stuff outside contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T17:02:09Z","Content":"The Explore x place you need a high rep and never visited the place before Explore Minmus you need 750 rep 750\u002B\n\nDuna and Ike you only need 500-700 rep Which makes the Minmus weird. Eve Explore Contract you need to do Minmus Explore Contract First. Gilly one you need Duna and Ike done, another wierd on. Then you get Jool followed by its Moons. Then Dress then Eeloo with Moho being the last as it is the highest Delta-V required place to get too.\n\nHow you can tell you are ready to get the Explore X place is if you get the Fly-By X place that has no end duration once the contract is accepted.\n\nThe Order of progression to get the never expire single contracts are: Fly-By, Orbit X, Return Craft from Orbit, Then Land on Place?... Not sure if there is any more. Also you need to complete each one for the next to show up. All this can be done with one craft just need to go back and accept the contract if and when it pops up.\n\nEdit: Also make sure you have plenty of 3 Star Contracts Available. As in if you have at least 2 to choose from you are more likely to get it to pop up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T17:12:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aragosnat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T02:54:05Z","Content":"Have a mod-related question?
