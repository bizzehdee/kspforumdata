I find I complete the tree far too easily with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar - as mentioned above, unless you plan around it, it\u0027s clutter. I could never get it to work right and got frustrated at my lack of knowedge of it and by the end of it, the only bits I was using was the radiators and that\u0027s only because KSPI also adds waste heat.. Shame though, I really enjoyed trying to figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 - not much of a plane guy, the parts are all Structural, some are obsolete, some are bugged (this was before I found the 0.23 fixes for it), doesn\u0027t fit in with other parts well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer and Soundtrack Editor - I usually play with KSP really quiet or on mute so they were pointless being there. Both very good mods though, on the occasions I had the volume up, I did enjoy them. But I had the volume down more often than not, and soon after I downloaded them (from KSPRC), I started getting more and more crashes so they were among the first to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd probably some more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T22:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve dropped very few mods without solid replacements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUniverse Replacer\u003C/strong\u003E I traded up for \u003Cstrong\u003ETexture Replacer\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/strong\u003E lost out to \u003Cstrong\u003EGoodSpeed Fuel Pump\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVOID\u003C/strong\u003E didn\u0027t live for an hour before being replaced by \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled \u003Cstrong\u003ETargetron\u003C/strong\u003E because I tended to find it easier to find stuff in Map Mode, but have recently installed it again to see how it\u0027s changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled \u003Cstrong\u003EAction Group Manager\u003C/strong\u003E because though I love the idea, I found myself never using it.
