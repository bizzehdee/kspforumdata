I feel like I\u0027m wasting more time babysitting labs than having fun playing the game. Every 30 days I need to take control of station #1, manually transmit the processed science, control station #2, transmit, repeat.

Then what about the data processing rate above 750? Well, it seems dumb to me that the processing rate changes with the amount of data loaded... just make it constant equivalent to 700 data loaded (about average if it stays between 650 and 750 typically when transmitting 500 science periodically)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
