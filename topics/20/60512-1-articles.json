KJR applies to every single joint and works wonders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS struts also help with station building, just to sure up docking joints. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly though if your still having such an issue with KJR installed then Id look at your design. If your building a station that you intend to move then this need to be accounted for in your design. Your typical station design (a la ISS style) is not really gonna hold up to more than small orbital adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T16:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm trying to design something on the line of the Nautilus X so its a multi module interplantery ship.

This kinda spreads the load of torque out, rather than it coming from a single location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor ships that are long (anything over 80meters tip to tail and 3 craft or more) you want the majority of the thrust to \u0027push\u0027 the craft rather than \u0027pull\u0027 it. This puts ALOT less stress on docking port connections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS struts do wonders...built a station once...didnt really have a plan when I started so it came out a disaster, looked like if ya sneezed it would break up. But I KAS strut the hell out of it and managed to get it in orbit around Duna (where it was in orbit for all of 5 months till a wayward satellite kapowed it lol).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MmPMSFmM","CreatedById":56831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T18:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry quantum struts: kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T18:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MmPMSFmM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MmPMSFmM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry quantum struts: kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot updated.....even when it was current it was buggy.
