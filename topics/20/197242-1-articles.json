I want to be able to create more creative rocket designs, which aren\u0027t in the wholy kerbal style of strapping on moar boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch part ideas include, radial, surface attached heat shields. Kinda like the curved solar panels from Near Future Solar. And maybe an upgraded version of the mk1-3 command pod, I would like to see one with more kerbals crammed in as the current internals allude to lots of space available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I had the idea for the upgraded mk1-3 from reading Eyes Turned Skyward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if any mod developer is up to do this i would we happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I wait for a respose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
