I put 4 of them around each docking port and leave them enabled so as soon as i dock with something, those engage and lock the connection tight. Reduces the wobbling to practically nothing. They do use a tiny bit of electricity to create and maintain the connection, so make sure you have at least a solar panel or generator on your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/quantum-strut/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-16T15:00:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dave4002000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T15:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DocLangy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DocLangy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anyone know any good mods with solid docking ports or have a design for a solid docking connection.
