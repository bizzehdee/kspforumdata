However, I just spent the last two months intensively learning \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes, and I\u0027m really proud of my newfangled proficiency.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceplane folks: What do you think of your Galileo career experience, and how different is it from stock?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill my normal, working \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane designs fall flat in this new mod pack? Will my tried and true design philosophies just need gentle tweaking, or ground-up overhauls? Do \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes even have a place in this new solar system, or are they made obsolete and inefficient by its unique features and limitations? Will I be able to build intuitively and enjoy the science payouts from my efficient and handsome ships, or will I have to learn an entirely new way of building around entirely different engines and planetary requirements?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T23:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPP changes planetary characteristics, but doesn\u0027t touch parts at all, so you may have to tweak your designs to accommodate different planetary requirements, but won\u0027t have to start from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTellumo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is considered a bit challenge.
