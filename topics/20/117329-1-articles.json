Ive been looking for a cool project to contribute to the community but Im a noob when it comes to unity and getting models and textures into game. Definitely not new to modeling and texturing though. I guess it could either be a scaled down version, or if its possible somehow it would be cool to do it to scale, but no way would that fit in VAB and I\u0027m not sure how youd launch it from sea instead of the pad. so in a nutshell id need a lot of help getting it to work in game, getting the seperate stages to be stageable, and have the engines working and all that. (360MN seems like it would hit the speed of light in kerbal scale lol) If there\u0027s someone with the technical knowlege of all that stuff thats willing to collab with me, I\u0027m up for it, otherwise id be reading and troubleshooting for weeks lol. I prefer realistic textures and models, but if people would prefer one that fits to kerbals aesthetic then that would be easier of course. Just throwing it out there to see if an experienced modder is interested, would definitely be cool to have a rocket that size that launches from sea."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T17:18:33Z","Content":"I could get it through unity after you model it.

Just hold Alt when attaching the TVC engines and their fairings. To attach anything to the bottom of the engines and tanks, you just need to change the 5th number on the node\\_stack\\_bottom from 1 to -1 in the .cfg files. Alternatively, you can enable \u0022ignore node orientation\u0022 (or something like that) from the Alt-F12 \u0022cheats\u0022 menu, and they will be able to attach the correct way.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The backward nodes is common in older parts - since 1.0 KSP pays attention to orientation.
