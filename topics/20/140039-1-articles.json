I mostly either play sandbox or use mods like Career Manager to get around the tech tree (so I can play a sandbox game with kerbonaut advancement). The reason for this is I don\u0027t care much for the stock science system. The whole \u0022conduct experiment - get science\u0022 is a bit dry to me. IRL, science experiments take time to run, and in some cases, the longer they run, the more fruitful the returns. Which brings me to my point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I propose is a mod that allows science instruments to continually gather data. The idea is that you would get an initial lump sum of science when you first activate the instrument in a given situation (a given biome or orbit), similar to how the game works now with NMSG installed. After that, the instrument would continue to gather data as long as it is active and remains within that biome. This data would be small, something like .1sci/hr (just a figure out of the blue), and would only accumulate while the instrument is in the same situation. If the situation changes, the data is corrupted and lost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make long-term bases and stations/satellites have more reason. Some instruments, like the barometer and thermometer would allow their data to be transmitted (unmanned satellites or research outposts). Others, like material studies and goo-pods would need kerbal interaction to retrieve and reset the data periodically (either sending a manned mission to the satellite/outpost or having at least one semi-permanent resident scientist at the station/outpost).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know mods like DMagic Orbital Science and Station Science add some similar concepts, but not the same. They also, as the names suggest, deal mainly with orbital science, and I\u0027m looking for reasons for ground bases, beyond resource development.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this sound like an interesting idea?
