For obvious reasons one modder can\u0027t do the translation into all supported languages on their own so they need help from other members of the community (or outside) who are fluent in the missing language. The problem is, it will be very hard for the modder to verify that the translated texts are sane and do not break the rules of the forum.

So, let us consider the following scenario, where one add-on (or a third-party translation for one add-on) is found not compliant with the above rules (what would happen because either forum members report the issue, or because of our own \u0022fantastic\u0022 abilities with foreign languages \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E). As normal policy in these cases, the moderation team will notify the author, and is expected that action is taken shortly to remove offending material from any package (be it the true add-on, or just translation files). We may actually de-link packages from forum posts if no action is taken, so to ensure compliance with the rules, what has occurred in a few cases over the years. Can\u0027t tell for sure yet, but if the issue is limited (at least with languages we can actively moderate) we may actually have the ability to suggest proper corrections to the author, so allowing the ability to implement them and bring the package back with minimal delay.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
