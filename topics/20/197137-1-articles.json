I have installed a mod that adds several other solar systems (Tau Ceki, KERPIST etc.). However, I do not see a feasible way to visit those systems. Is there a mod for this purpose?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, I do not like FTL mods as I think they destroy the purpose of the game. Therefore, my first preference would be a mod that places a wormhole somewhere on our solar system, just like the movie Interstellar. (That is why I think to teleport my vehicles to these starts after getting a specific orbit around Jool, for role-playing purposes \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JcoolTheShipbuilder","CreatedById":204576,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-26T23:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry Ksp Interstellar Extended, it has some very good engines that, at maximum, you can go 0.4c but with the antimatter drive, the delta v readout on every mod break since the delta v can be 1.5c, but tiny acceleration.
