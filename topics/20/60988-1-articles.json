This was a research project of the late 1950\u0027s. Basically it was a system involving throwing a succession of nuclear bombs out the back of your spacecraft and riding the blast wave on a gigantic shock absorber! The science is perfectly valid and the radiation increase caused by the rocket was negligible, but everybody got very anti-radiation and it got shelved. Project Orion had the advantage that it could get very large payloads into space very cheaply, (as I remember it was something like 250$ to get a mass of 1lb into orbit, as opposed to orthodox rocketry, which costed out at 5000-6000$/lb). This seems to me to be a technology that Kerbals would leap at!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1vKMTYa40A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is a computer animation of what Orion could look like\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ambulatory Cortex","CreatedById":57269,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T03:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere I was, all set to scold you for not using search, ready to screenshot the search page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I searched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it wasn\u0027t on the first page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr the next page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr the one after that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was on the 6th page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28428-Orion-aka-Ol-Boom-boom?highlight=orion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28428-Orion-aka-Ol-Boom-boom?highlight=orion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T10:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe search engine really sucks tbh.
