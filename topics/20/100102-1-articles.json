Is there a way to rotate the entire animation so that I can have the part facing the (Blender) -X direction? I tried childing everything to an empty, and it works, but when I put the part in KSP it is not rotated the correct way in the part list and SPH, and the node is in a weird spot..\n\nEdit: Whoops, meant for this to go in the modeling and texturing discussion..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T17:39:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323**"}]}
