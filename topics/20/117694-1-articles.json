And the link always search a way to go at the KSC\n\nIf i\u0027m behind the mun, and had a possible connection with the KSC by satellite, the mod use it without any manual linking process between mun-com/sat-com/KSC\n\nI\u0027ve tried to look at the MM files, but, as a newbie, i don\u0027t understand anything !\n\nAnyway, thanks for the reading, and all other things !"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:26:48Z","Content":"Looks like you want something like Stock KSP is planning for 1.1...?"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:48:36Z","Content":"Stock 1.1 will have something along these lines, but until then I\u0027d recommend you take a look at [AntennaRange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-1-0-AntennaRange-1-10-1-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity) as it is the closest to what you\u0027re asking for."},{"CreatedByName":"DennoD","CreatedById":121138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:35:57Z","Content":"I will !\n\nIf it\u0027s planned for the futur, it\u0027s perfect ^^ \n\nBut i\u0027m wonder if AntennaRange use the conic path like RemoteTech or if all the antenna was omni-directionnal.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the return !"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:40:21Z","Content":"**DennoD**, all antennas in AntennaRange are omni-directional, and there\u0027s no requirement for multiple antennas to support multiple connections.
