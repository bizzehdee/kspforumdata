Most mods written for 1.4 or later work fine in the latest versions of KSP. Very little in the game changes in a way that breaks older mods with each new release. There are exceptions. So, if you find a mod you are interested in, check the forum thread for that mod. Usually someone asks \u0022Does X work in KSP 1.X.x\u0022 within minutes of a new release or you will find people complaining if it actually doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess than\u00A0half of my 110 mods are specifically stated as compatible for 1.7.3. The oldest dates to 1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
