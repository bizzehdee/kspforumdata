The biggest issue lies with the incoming heat flux from being so close to the surface of the star. And traditional ablative heat shields simply do not work very well for the \u0022fryby\u0022 part of the mission.\n\nThree things really struck me as being beneficial for these down-sun missions:\n\n1. Some sort of *reflective* heat shield for you to tuck all your equipment behind, deep in the shadows.\n\n2. An active heat-rejection system better than the stock radiators that can be surface mounted.\n\n3. An insulator to isolate the thermally sensitive parts from the high-temperature parts.\n\nI can deal with the second part with a quick .cfg edit to the stock passive radiator, but the first and third parts, the reflective shadow shields and insulators, are beyond my comprehension of how the game tackles incoming heat.\n\nAnyone feel up for the challenge?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T20:47:58Z","Content":"Personally I use [**Heat Management**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189).

The issue is that there\u0027s no thermal shadow as you get lower than 500Mm or so. Your radiators simply won\u0027t radiate any heat, even if they\u0027re shadowed by heat shield. In fact, I think they start accumulating external heat at some point."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T17:17:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope.

The forward shield was over 1600 Kelvin, but the aft end of the craft was down around 1300 Kelvin. The four radiator panels were doing their job, as everything \u0022downstream\u0022 of them was significantly cooler."}]}
