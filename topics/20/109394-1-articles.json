Now, when we have in career contracts like temperature scan in 4 places close to each other, rovers are really useful. But what should we do, if the next target is on the opposite side of planet?Imagine this: You set coordinates for rover. Rover travels to target alone. (Non physical way, only a point on map.) It slowly moves through a planet with speed based on energy generators, amount of wheels or something. If you switch to it, rover will spawn little over ground level (Maybe a security save like in KAC or something).\n\nRovers are really funny things, but in fact they are one-use things. In real life NASA have AI in rovers, people don\u0027t control them all the time.\n\nSorry for my grammar, non English."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:36:02Z","Content":"I can\u0027t agree more.

Well, sort of. It\u0027s just a kOS program not a real mod and you have to have the craft loaded - but it automatically controls physical time warp and you can leave it running in the background or when you\u0027re out of the house or sleeping or whatever. I\u0027ll be revisiting it sometime in the next few months for a refactor with new kOS functions and several other features that have been added to kOS since I last worked on it. I\u0027m also going to see if I can get it to work with User Waypoints. But hey, it\u0027s [tested and proven](http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Flights/craft.asp?db=lupek\u0026filter=inactive)! (you can see more test drives by opening the Rover category on the right)"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T04:46:40Z","Content":"Allista had been elaborating on this code for his Hangar mod [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1?p=1776984\u0026viewfull=1#post1776984).

Just small thing which counts how long it takes to get to somewhere, calculates it based on slopes or something and only show on map your slowly moving rover. If you warp to it, rover will spawn in actual position on ground level. Non speed calculating, non brakes, only position and maybe solar panels and sun position calculations too."}]}
