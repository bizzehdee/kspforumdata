Mechjeb 1=8.whatever.whatever did a great job of getting within 1-3km. For some reason after installing mechjeb 2 it only gets me in the same orbit. (yes I am launching to rendevous, not orbit plane) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso occasionally it skips right past T-0 and does it quite a few times in a row!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure how to fix it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T22:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame here... I\u0027ve gone back to MJ1 for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even launched with both versions on the same craft and it still worked. Used the MJ1.9.8 for launch to rendezvous and then used MJ2.0.7 for the rest of the flight and it still worked fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plur303","CreatedById":56324,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T04:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry guys, looks like you might have to learn how to actually play the game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to rendevous with a ship in the same orbit as you make your orbit lower in order to speed up and catch your target or make your orbit higher in order to slow down and let it catch up to you. Then just time accelerate for a few orbits until you are close. You can easily use the maneuver node system to plan rendevous with even more precision. It\u0027s not hard. You might even learn a thing or two by playing the game without mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest getting rid of the training wheels and playing the game manually. It can be difficult at first but soon you will be rendezvousing and docking like a pro. You will laugh at how much fuel mechjeb wastes on its ascents and how much RCS fuel it wastes when docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T08:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can play KSP how they want, as long as they are having fun then everything\u0027s good, and as has been mentioned ad-infinitum, astronauts also use computers to fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
