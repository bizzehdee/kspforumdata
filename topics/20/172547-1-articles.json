I\u0027m aware that the stars are not visitable, but I would like to see a mod that allows you to \u0027observe and study\u0027 stars. The way I picture this mod, it would have\u00A0a\u00A0telescope, in that the amount of science points you get per \u0027observation\u0027\u00A0is random and limitless, to coincide with the random and numerous\u00A0diversity of the stars. To make it fair, and also quite realistic, this telescope would be fraught with potential errors and breakdowns, requiring repairing missions to keep using them. I\u0027ve no idea if this can even be created, nor if it should, but I feel that there should be such a mod; primarily because using a mod\u00A0tech tree might result in getting stuck in spots because of lack of science points and ways of getting more!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaximumThrust","CreatedById":185090,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T19:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you saw this mod?
