Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m currently using two mods: KW Rocketry(KWR) and MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb seems fine, but KW Rocketry, tiny problem with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It seems SRBs hate decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time I attach one of KWR\u0027s SRBs on decoupler and bring it to the launch pad, report gives me that there was structural failure between SRBs and liquid fuel tank. So I tested different types of decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth TT-38K Radial Decoupler and HDM had 9 out of 10 structural failure with KWR\u0027s SRBs, mostly with Globe X-5 \u0022Thor\u0022 SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing came to my mind was that it could be collision detection problem, so I changed to TT-70 radial decoupler(To give more space between liquid fuel tank and SRBs). This time, 4~5 out of every 10 launches showed structural failure, and this time, most of KWR\u0027s SRBs shared same number of structural failure report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Attachment problem with SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay before with SRB\u0027s random structural failure on the launch pad, I had problem where I can\u0027t attach KWR\u0027s SRBs on decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing overlapping was there, and yet unable to attach. I had to use debug(Part clipping debug) to attach those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Attachment problem with LEs and interstages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Engines do attach normally in VAB, however, when I try to launch my rocket, LEs start to cause two problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst problem happens right before launch, where LEs start to wobble violently as if they were not attached properly to liquid fuel tanks, or as if they were colliding to some \u0027invisible\u0027 object. This continues after launch, and it messes up entire lift off \u0026amp; climb stage. Quick fix to this problem was to attach struts between LE and liquid fuel tank, as well as SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond problem happens mostly during launch \u0026amp; climb phase, where interstages fail to decouple with engines so that decoupler \u0027debris\u0027 are still attached to an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith interstages, I tried to detach them by attaching normal decouplers within interstages, but didn\u0027t work out well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny thing is that, if I attach decouplers correctly, LEs starts to wobble, and if LEs were attached properly, decouplers fail to decouple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded : I zoomed into climbing rocket and found out that first stage LE was attempting to \u0022attach\u0022 to SRBs, and second stage LE was drifting out of interstage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose 3 are my problems, and I wanted to know if anyone was having same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BKW Rocketry version is v0.2.3, which, according to Kerbal SpacePort, SpacePort was corrupting mod files so they uploaded txt file with download link in it.

High-res and good looks is all nice, but your pack shouldn\u0027t be offering fewer than the default number of parts while taking three times more RAM to load. KW Rocketry is 400 megs unloaded, and given you only have about 2GB of RAM available for part loading before loading the game itself (any more and you start getting highly unstable), this means KW Rocketry is going to take up almost a quarter of your part memory load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not hard to see why either. The textures are insanely high-res, and the models are unnecessarily detailed. I think if you clip the camera inside the fuel tanks you\u0027ll see actual internal tanks that are modeled and textured, tanks you wouldn\u0027t see otherwise. I don\u0027t know why. Even the fairings are 4 megs apiece, and they\u0027re just white. The 3m decoupler shrouds are \u003Cstrong\u003E8 megs\u003C/strong\u003E, twice that of the engines themselves. That doesn\u0027t make any sense at all. Decoupler shrouds are tubes painted white with some lines, it shouldn\u0027t be more than maybe a meg. The entire pack is horribly unoptimized.
