I started building serenity a while back, but my attempt got over-complicated and I\u0027m planning to start again. I went too detailed and the goram part count became a problem (I had internal walkways in the cargo section, several crew sections and had two small shuttle craft). The biggest problem is the rotating engines. At the time I tried to make her, the rotating parts where not strong enough to hold the large engines needed to lift her off the ground. But now Infernal Robotics (the replacement for damned robotics) has got some better hinges and rotators so that will help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with making Serenity is that basically she\u0027s an SSTO-VTOL with interplanetary capabilities, and SSTO\u0027s are hard at the best of times. But she\u0027s a strangely balanced (and in my case very heavy) SSTO which makes it all the more tricky. (also Serenity is also a FTL craft, but I\u0027m not interested in mods that offer FTL engines). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, being hard is no reason to not attempt it! So my suggestions as to the mods you\u0027ll need are, Infernal Robotics (for the rotating parts) and B9 aerospace for panel sections which will help reduce part count as they\u0027re larger than the stock panels (which I\u0027d used). You\u0027ll prob also want KW rocketry or novapunch for a selection of different sized fuel tanks. Quantum Struts to use a \u0027locks\u0027 to re-enforce the engines when they\u0027re not turning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what my first (incomplete) design looked like. She could just about hover but as soon as I tried to turn the engines (which required switching off the Qstruts) they\u0027d flop about and I\u0027d loose control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VUmtet1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VUmtet1l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VUmtet1l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with your attempts.
