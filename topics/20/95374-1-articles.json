But anyways to the point, I\u0027m lacking on my rover builds mainly i feel from lack of decent parts (wheels/ base structure). ive tried searching for a decent mod parts pack on curse but havent came up with anything. Could anyone suggest some to me to look into? I\u0027d highly appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second question i have is regarding B9 Aerospace, I dont know if this is the correct place to ask this but if not please direct me to it. I love this pack alot, but im lost with putting the HL? maybe its HX? the very big parts into use. I know it suggests assembly of these parts in space. Im guessing with use of docking ports? I\u0027ve spent moderate time looking into how others have and everyone has done some really nice builds. I\u0027m open to any guidance, sharing of craft files to play with (this is how i learn the best), or links to helpful info. I\u0027m also puzzled about how there isnt a command module for these parts (unless im wrong or theres just an issue with my install). Correct me if im wrong on this too but when selecting the hanger variate, you cant open and close the doors. If i can implement these parts into a craft and get it into orbit it will greatly make all my future interplanetary missions both easy and successful as a support vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
