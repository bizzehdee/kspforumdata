Thanks in advance for any answers!\n\nOn a side note, I used Asparagus Staging for the first time on the stations lifter, I hardly expected it to even make orbit, but when I got the proper orbit it had enough DV left to possibly get to Eve and orbit it, and thats insane for the standards of my craft, so I must hop on the Asparagus bandwagon and say \u0022Asparagus efficiently OP\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:07:49Z","Content":"Could you share the vessel file and/or a save ?

Probably because Im too noob to understand certain aspects of it, in any case, the ascent is not always the same for different crafts. \n\nSo, no help there, but everything else works pretty well for me, I use the circularization option in maneuver planner and it works perfectly, I know it\u0027s not the same.\n\nI also use asparagus staging, nothing too fancy, my biggest lifter has 5 orange tanks where it drops to 2 each time and keep going. I find it, that asparagus is a bit overpowered now because of new physics. While in previous .90 it was 100 full throttle and just dropping the tanks, launch, 10k, turn, my first asparagus stage almost reach 10k, now with the new physics it goes much higher since we must cut on the throttle to avoid the soup drag.\n\np.s.\n\nI also stopped using struts. They are ugly and I never saw a rocket with weird struts on the outside (maybe im wrong). I use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. Now, that\u0027s a beauty since it properly attach things to each other without breaking or wobble. They still break if you push it too far like landing using velocities above crash resistance, but for example, when you put decouplers they stay rigid.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T15:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kar**"}]}
