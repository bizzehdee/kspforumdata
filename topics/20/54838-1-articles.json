But yes its also a MASSIVE memory hog. The largest one there is. I pick and choose what parts I want. For instance right now Im just using the Soyuz TMA and N1 parts. I got rid of all the shuttle, progress, and LOK parts. ( though I highly recommend a Mun mission with the LOK its a blast. Especially sending it up on the N1 ) You get to see what a successful soviet moon mission would\u0027ve looked like.
