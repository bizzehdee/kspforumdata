The idea being, it added larger stationary solar panels than the OX-STAT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was useful because the OX-STAT solar panel had the single best mass-to-power ratio of any of the solar panels even BEFORE it was given no PhysicsSignificance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch larger scaled-up panels were *EXTREMELY* useful for large electric UAV\u0027s (using either ion engines or Firespitter electric propellers) where atmospheric conditions meant that moving solar panels COULD NOT be deployed, as well as to save mass on larger ion-powered spacecraft (those with a large array of stock ion engines, or larger more power-hungry ion engines such as those in NearFuture mod) and Microwave Beamed Power solar farms (constructed in KSP-Interstellar) if the player was willing to turn the entire spacecraft to face the sun rather than having the solar panels auto-adjust...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also looked cool, and were much harder to break, on surface bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping that somebody might be able to release\u002Bmaintain such a mod- preferably one with nicer textures/models than simply up-scaling the stock OX-STAT solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I could just go and create a such a part for myself by up-scaling the OX STAT, but I have no idea how to create textures/models (so I would just have to use the stock texture- which looks ugly when re-scaled to huge sizes due to the size of the base), and it would be helpful if it were an actual mod as then it would be available to other players and could be used in challenges like the Flying Duna challenge (the mod author himself got around the problem of producing lots of power for his entry by using the Uzbor Welding Utility to weld a bunch of OX-STATS onto the upper surface of a wing as a single part, but the Welding Utility no longer works correctly with current versions of KSP...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the larger solar panel would need to have its cost adjusted appropriately in proportion with its size and energy production (although maybe with a 1 or 2% discount for \u0022buying in bulk\u0022 when it came to PV cells, or something like that for balance. Remember, unlike the OX STAT, it *WOULD* have PhysicsSignificance, and thus would add mass to rockets/planes unlike the OX STAT...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T05:04:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T05:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm, TweakScale?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T16:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr use Near Future Solar.

The trusses are the closest thing to what I\u0027m looking for, but still not exactly it- I\u0027m looking more for a large squarish (though slightly rectangular would be preferable to completely square) static panel that I could slap on the top of large B9 or Procedural Dynamics wings for airplanes powered by Firespitter electric propellers...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENertea, if you wanted to do something REALLY cool, that would get me and a lot of players to love you even more, though, you could generate a thin-film solar array version of the Procedural Dynamics wings that unlocked when both Procedural Dynamics and your mod were installed, and kick it over to the Procedural Dynamics thread/mod author. Basically, this would be a Procedural Dynamics wing with a thin-film solar array (thin-film solar arrays have low mass, low power, but excellent power:mass ratios, and need to be coated onto a static surface to work right) on the top surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter, \u003Cstrong\u003Eanything\u003C/strong\u003E you could do with thin-film solar arrays would be AWESOME (they also have MAJOR utility on surface bases and the skins of Hooligan Labs blimps- basically anything with a lot of surface area that doesn\u0027t work well with deployables...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T21:03:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T21:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vahal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vahal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe static panel in the Boxsat mod is nice looking and really effective.
