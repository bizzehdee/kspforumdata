In addition to various crazy projects involving space sheep and flying pigs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am quite delighted to have a chance to contribute an important part of the community and would like to leave the floor open - what are the best practises for content contribution and how should I split my time between various projects? Of course, I\u0027m not the type to \u003Cem\u003Espontaneously disappear\u003C/em\u003E from stuff that I like but I do want to see if some sort of \u0022what I\u0027m working on at the moment\u0022 WIP list could be beneficial to help plan my time between mod teams. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours sincerely,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- kitten :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kalzuron","CreatedById":150863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T02:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen a thread where people can offer or request assistance, at least not stickied anywhere. I think it would be awesome to have a \u0022contribution request\u0022 thread where people can link their project thread(if they\u0027ve started one) and ask for volunteers to help in the work. And there can be a list in the OP of people who don\u0027t mind being asked directly to write some code or model a part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T13:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the thing about hobbies - you get to set your project schedules and priorities, since there\u0027s no boss to fire you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you don\u0027t bite off more than you can chew, or promise and then don\u0027t deliver, people will be happy.
