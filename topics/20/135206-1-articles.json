Could somebody make a mod that turns it into the Firefly solar system? The data on all of the planets - sizes, orbital periods and radii etc. - can be found in \u0022The Verse in Numbers 2.1\u0022, available online as a pdf. I think this would be very cool as there are tons more planets and moons to explore in the Firefly system. It\u0027s all one system, so FTL travel is \u003Cu\u003Eprobably\u003C/u\u003E not needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AG5BPilot","CreatedById":146044,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T23:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must say that \u0022The Verse in Numbers 2.1\u0022 made for an interesting read. \u00A0Thank you for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a modder, but I foresee two huge problems in making a mod such as you\u0027re\u00A0asking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is sheer size. \u00A0The KSP stock solar system consists of one central body (the sun), 7 planets, and 9 moons. \u00A0The Firefly Verse consists of one central star, which is orbited by 4 other stars, 7 artificial or proto-stars, and about 260 planets and moons. \u00A0I doubt KSP could handle that. \u00A0It would also take an immense amount of work to make it happen. \u00A0I could see this sort of endeavor taking months or years to do, and that\u0027s assuming a whole group of people were working on creating all the worlds and moons. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is licensing. \u00A0Firefly itself is certainly\u00A0copyrighted and trademarked, and the fan work that went into making up the \u0022Verse\u0022 is also protected by copyrights. \u00A0In particular, the document you referenced starts off with this: \u00A0\u0022 Any replication of this content, in part or in whole, without express written permission of the copyright holders is forbidden.\u0022 \u00A0I\u0027m no lawyer, but it\u0027s a good bet that this includes using the names and orbital arrangements. \u00A0To even think about doing this, one would first have to get permission to use this information. \u00A0If you were going to make the mod for your own personal use you could decide you\u0027re not going to\u00A0worry about the licensing, but if you\u0027re going to distribute it the mod must be properly licensed (to protect Squad, if for no other reason). \u00A0You would probably need permission from\u00A0both the publisher of \u0027The Verse by numbers\u0022, the studio that holds the rights to Firefly, and possibly some other entities whose intellectual property went into making that document. \u00A0That might not be impossible to do, since I suspect many if not all of the rights holders would be thrilled to see their work used in this way, but it\u0027s some legal hoops that one needs to go through before even starting such a project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomPN","CreatedById":157102,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T08:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough. Getting all of the legal permissions would probably be the easiest part of it. You probably wouldn\u0027t need many textures for the planet surfaces - from what I saw on the show, they\u0027re mainly cities and deserts. Throw in a moon-like texture for bodies that haven\u0027t been terraformed yet, and a Jool-like texture for gas giants.

I play(ed) with 3 planet mods (2 add a new solar system) and lots of mods without problems in 64bit, but thats still probably 1/5 or less of all the bodies in the verse. Then there is the problem that it is very boring, for KSP players i mean: Most planets are obviously terraformed, have an atmosphere and around 1g. So the whole thing has to be modelled before human colonization, which means outside of orbits and a few \u0022landmarks\u0022 like diameter or hillsize every planet is basically a \u0022fantasy planet\u0022 as there is no information on how they looked before the terraforming. That also means all the artificial stars are still gas giants etc. The orbits have no inclination (again, boring for KSP) and to top it off, lots of conversions has to be done (the whole thing is in human scale) but that\u0027s the easiest part. Also, even tough in comparison still small, the verse is huge: The last star, blue sun, has an orbital period of well over 2000 years (going the opposite or polar direction of all the others afaik), which means FTL probably still is a must (you\u0027d really want to visit it if you play that universe for obvious reasons).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont want to discourage anyone, actually i\u0027d love to help if some decide to go for it: Would make for a good community project or smth similar, for the sheer amount of bodies there are to implement.

However, approximately 50 of these have no terraforming (including the planet Shadow, whose terraforming was destroyed at the start of the Unification War), and 7 are gas giants. In addition, the vast majority (all except two or three) of planets have a lunar system, and many of these have 3 or more moons. Of these, the largest is that of the gas giant Fury, which has nine moons - quite a challenge to explore, even for veteran Jool explorers. There is no data on the inclination of the moons orbits, so the orbits of the moons could be placed at various inclinations making them more of a challenge. So, even though about 80% of the Verse is composed of similar worlds (gravitywise, not sizewise - the sizes vary between a minimum of 970km diameter and a maximum of 1.4 x Earth diameter,\u00A0according to the Verse in Numbers), there\u0027s still quite a bit to explore. However, I do agree that the system is of titanic size and would take a long time to put together. The Blue Sun system would be quite a challenge to reach - it does orbit in the opposite direction to the others, and on the Complete and Official Map of the Verse, it appears to me that the orbits of the Blue Sun\u0027s planets are highly inclined compared to the rest of the solar system, although this may just be the way the map is drawn.

Of course, anything else that is actually mentioned in the series or in Serenity would make it into the mod. Then they could pick other important bodies based on some of the more well known fan fiction to make sure there\u0027s a proportionate amount of planets and moons.
