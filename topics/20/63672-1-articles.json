However, the stock game does. I haven\u0027t seen that video or I wasn\u0027t paying attention. There is a newer (and IMO better) mod called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67163-\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGoodspeed\u003C/a\u003E that may be what he was talking about? No clue. It allows you to set up automatic pumping via right clicking the parts.

First: I have downloaded the latest IR and installed it. I find the stuff in sandbox but not in my career mode. Nothing in the tech tree either. And worst still I can\u0027t find a cfg file for it either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: As for transferring fuel in the stock game if I right click a tank I get a green bar showing the amount of fuel and oxidiser, each with a little green triangle which if I click turns into a red no entry sign. No sign of any ability to transfer fuel to another tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also downloaded Procedural Fairings. The stuff appears in the tech tree and I researched it all but find that some parts are not available because I have not paid for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will check out Goodspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those that haven\u0027t seen them the Interstellar Quest videos by Scott Manley are well worth a watch (40 episodes so far and counting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have realised I am a bit of a newbie here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T13:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just downloaded it and the CFG\u0027s are there in GameData/MagicSmokeIndustres/Parts then any of the part folders in there.
