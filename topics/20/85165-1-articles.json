The tops of the boosters comes in and then destroys the inner fuel/engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried adding separator boosters to get the top of the dispelled shells to go away from the main body of my rocket but even with two on the top pushing out and two on the bottom pulling in (to get maximal torque) they fall inwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tends to happen with my larger rockets. Is there some extra trick that I\u0027m missing? Is my rocket going too slowly at the point of detachment, or too fast? I have one I\u0027m using right now for a moon shot and it\u0027s getting to about 15km off the first stage solid boosters, hitting around 400m/s, and no matter what I do with the radial decouplers the solid boosters come in and destroy the central fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all a bit of a pain, because it means I have to keep the empty solid boosters attached to my central section for an extra stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T21:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a stock bug, since KSP 0.24.2.
