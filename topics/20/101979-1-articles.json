All the manned prefab rocket ships should have a alternative one with life support capability when using mods such as TAC Life Support; as well all of them should have alternative ships that have re-entry shields for use with Deadly Re-entry.\n\nIt is not that I am incapable of building things like these myself, or am just lazy; but spending hours of hours of trying to build and launch rockets to complete specific goals, with extra hours of hours of tweaking so they can only just get into orbit; all that can be very draining to the point where it becomes a chore. Then when add mods lie Deadly re-entry, or TAC Life support, and now your new ships need even more parts for your kerbals to survive, all your original designs have to go back to the drawing board because the added weight of these new parts changes everything. That itself can be very frustrating.\n\nThese prefab ships are not meant to replace the creation of our own rocket ships. Some times you are just tired of fiddling around with things and just want to get something accomplished. That is when these prefab ships would really lighten your day. And maybe just by studying them and trying to figure out how they were built you can even learn something from them to use in future projects."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T06:25:34Z","Content":"Very few mods offer entire ships.

If you\u0027ve ever owned legos... how long did the object that was in the plans last after you built it? I\u0027d give it a max of 2 days. \n\nIn my Stanford Torus mod having the stanford torus hull pre built is probably what held it back from being awesome (10000\u002B downloads and me with 5000 posts). I only did it that way to ensure the physics actually worked. A single part mod just to go to the Mun or to Jool... not expecting it to be popular. I learned from that in Civilian Population to make the parts separate so players can configure them however they want.\n\nNow single part mods are popular if they recreate something from other scifi (like Star Trek ships) or from real life. Even then, breaking it up in to parts makes it more fun for the average player.\n\nWith that in mind, finding a pre-fab generic rocket ship mod will be a hard thing to do. Like the others said, check the spacecraft exchange. Also you can copy the craft files from your other saves into your current one so you don\u0027t have to redesign your own designs. Go to your KSP install folder, check the Saves folder, and find a folder with the name of your older save with your rockets in it. In that folder you\u0027ll find folders called \u0022VAB\u0022, \u0022SPH\u0022, and \u0022SubAss\u0022. These are your saved rocket designs. Copy these into your new save and you get all of your old designs back."}]}
