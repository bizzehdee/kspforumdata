It\u00A0will\u00A0use\u00A0like 1.2 Units of Hydrogen.\u00A0And the hydrogen is going to be a\u00A0to be well light and\u00A0like\u00A0Xenon Gas so a lot of\u00A0it in a\u00A0tiny sized\u00A0tank. And Exotic\u00A0Matter\u00A0engine is going to have a like 5X as much as the Fusion Engine, And not a lot of Isp. Some what like 0.5 As much as the Fusion engine\u0027s Isp. Exotic Matter is going to be heavy\u00A0So something\u00A0like\u00A015 kg per Unit\u00A0of it. And\u00A0super dense so it will have a Ton of it in\u00A0a tiny sized tank for\u00A0Example\u00A0a tiny sized tank would have 8,000\u00A0units of\u00A0Exotic Matter. So the\u00A0full mass of the engine is 120,000 kg. And the Exotic Matter generator will use\u00A050 Electric Charge/sec to make\u00A01 Unit\u00A0of Exotic Matter. And Exotic matter is maybe what a black hole is made up\u00A0of. But this is super charged Exotic matter\u00A0so it will\u00A0be unstable. So if it gets Zapped by anything it will explode. And what\u00A0I would like if\u00A0there is a Fuel tank for\u00A0each Size in the game so they are\u00A0tiny, small,\u00A0large, extra large,\u00A0Mk2, And Mk3. Can any one make a mod like that. If you do can you send a link of it to me?\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"njmksr","CreatedById":114236,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-11T19:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Interstellar has that sort of stuff in it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
