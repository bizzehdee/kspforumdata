The background is that an advanced, modern civilization has gone through a Peak Oil crisis and is now arriving at unsustainable levels of resource scarcity. This pushes them to search for resources outside of the atmosphere.\n\nMy idea is to start out in the following situation:\n\n-Aerodynamics tech tree unlocked all the way up to and excluding Rapier engines, right from the start.\n\n-Astronaut Complex, R\u0026D complex, Administration Facility, Mission Control, Runway and Spaceplane Hangar start at Level 3 (max).\n\n-5,000,000 starting budget.\n\nThe following mods would be required:\n\n-MKS\n\n-KAS\u002BKIS\n\n-RemoteTech\n\n-USI Life Support\n\n-Nertea\u0027s CryoEngines and Near Future Propulsion \n\n-Kerbol Plus 2.0\n\nThis mod would adds two restrictions:\n\n-Other than LiquidFuel and Oxidizer, no fuels can be filled in the VAB. This strongly promotes Off-world resource extraction for LiquidHydrogen, Xenon ect.\n\n-Some planets have altered resource availability. To simulate resource scarcity, Kerbin has 0 resources. To push the player further out than the Kerbin system, the Mun and Minmus have diminished resource availability. \n\nAlso, there are three major tweaks:\n\n-Pilots cannot gain more than level 1 abilities (prograde/retrograde tracking). This forces the use of Probe Cores on practically every spaceship that wishes to leave low orbit, and therefore the establishment of a RemoteTech constellation for every step of the way.\n\n-Contracts do not provide funds. The only way to gain funds is return vessels filled with resources back at the space center. To compensate, extraplanetary resources have increased value, especially for .\n\n-Nukes use only LiquidHydrogen.\n\nSome tweaks will have to be made in the techtree to allow for easy access to structural and RemoteTech/MKS parts, while putting CryoEngines as end-game parts.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHopefully, the objective is that the player builds supersonic planes to explore Kerbin first for Science points. He or she will then spend those points on researching communication technologies and resource extraction parts. \n\nQuickly, the player sets up antennas on the ground, that communicate with the spaceplanes putting satellites in low orbit. \n\nThe player uses these as stepping stones for maneuvering their spaceplane-launched rockets to the Mun and Minmus, gathering more science and perhaps an extraplanetary launchpad. Cost and Science restrictions prevent them from making anything more than interplanetary flybys for science points at this stage. Lack of large rockets and fuel tanks further prevents massive extraplanetary missions that will unlock the entire tech tree from the beginning. \n\nQuickly, the player will run out of money setting up these constellations of satellites with spaceplanes, forcing him or her to develop their first extra-Kerbin resource extraction mission. A likely target is Duna.\n\nAs the player progresses, he or she will have to establish a regular stream of interplanetary flights that drop resources to the Space Center to be able to fund missions to the faraway Gas Giants and their resource-rich moons. Constant communication with the Space Center is a must for controlling the spacecraft.\n\nHopefully, this mod will encourage good behavior such as building a space station to dock the resource tankers running on efficient Near Future electric thrusters, then having heavy drop pods return to Kerbin, which punishing bad behavior such as rushing their exploration of the Kerbin system (extremely difficult without Pilot skills) for Science or fast forwarding resource extraction on easy-to-reach, resource-poor bodies (with the Life Support system).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease, tell me what you think.\n\n* * *\nUpdates:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  Currently, I\u0027m settled on creating a point system similar to Science and Reputation called Resources.\n\u003E \n\u003E All ingame resource costs are converted from Funds to Resources. \n\u003E \n\u003E For example, a 2 million Funds rocket would now cost 1 million Funds and 1 million Resources.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Resource points start at a high value, and the player budgets them for each launch. Gaining Resource Points can be done by dropping unprocessed Ore onto Kerbin and recovering it for a low Ore-to-Resource conversion ratio, or dropping Ore converted into LiquidFuel/Oxidizer/LqHydrogen ect. for a 1:1 ratio conversion into Resource points. \n\u003E \n\u003E Things like life support resources would have a very low recovery rate to prevent a player farming greenhouse products on Kerbin and converting them into infinite fuel.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There is no way around it: getting KSP to act the way I want it to requires fiddling with C# and .dll magic.\n\u003E \n\u003E And I\u0027m no wizard. \n\u003E \n\u003E I think that\u0027s that for now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve thought of a possible workaround:\n\u003E \n\u003E We stick with Funds as the resource.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, the cost of all Parts becomes a tiny fraction of what they currently are, while the cost of resource is vastly increased.\n\u003E \n\u003E For example: \n\u003E \n\u003E The stock KerbalX spacecraft has 6400 vacuum m/s, enough to go to the Mun and back. \n\u003E \n\u003E It costs 61680 funds, containing 35 monopropellant, 8200 liquid fuel and 10120 oxidizer. These resources cost 8424 funds, or about 13.4% of the launch cost. \n\u003E \n\u003E What I could do is create an MM patch that vastly decreases the cost of all parts while increasing the cost of all resources. \n\u003E \n\u003E For example, if I set LF/OX to be 6 times more expensive, they\u0027d cost 50544 funds and form 82% of the launch cost. The parts would cost 4.8 times less, forming 18% of the launch cost. \n\u003E \n\u003E How does this change things? Well, everything will cost pretty much the same, but fuel costs are much more important. \n\u003E \n\u003E How does this promote resource gathering? In conjunction with contracts not providing funds, the only way for the player to gain money is to farm resources and land them back at kerbin. The upside is that an orange tank full of LFO would provide (keeping inline with the multipliers in the previous example) 585 funds for the part and 17625 funds for the resources. That\u0027s enough to build the entire KerbalX ship and then some... but not refuel it ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, now that I think I know how to make a MM patch that reduces all part costs by a fixed amount (I\u0027ll check into making specific multipliers for different categories) and raises resource costs, I\u0027ll list the other implementations. Also, I think it\u0027s time to open a Github.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Contract and career rewards configuration (Custom Barn Kit)\n\u003E \n\u003E -Story mode contracts (Contract Configurator) \n\u003E \n\u003E -Resource availability modifications (?)\n\u003E \n\u003E -Abandoned extraplanetary bases for the player to discover and refurbish (Kerbal Konstructs)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T11:03:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 11:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TruthQuark**\n  \nProgress Update"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:44:02Z","Content":"I would recommend starting with [SETI](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130-1-0-2-SETI-CommunityTechTree-Contracts-Greenhouse-BalanceMod) as a base for your game and then making tweaks from there to meet your more specific requirements.\n\nSETI already rearranges tech and parts to start you with air planes and simple rockets that wont make it into orbit.

It seems like the prices of some parts have to be rebalanced, and personal rebalancing would have to be done for the various engines from other mods. Once I figure out how to make a module manager patch, I\u0027ll get to doing that.\n\nThe key step so far is to make an efficient small communications satellite, and a reusable large spaceplane. \n\nThe biggest limiting factor for the spaceplane designs so far is that the various air intakes required for high altitude high velocity flight overheat much too easily due to their small thermal mass. Maybe I should make a patch for different parts to unbind their thermal behavior from their thermal mass for easier use. \n\nThe end goal is a sort of roleplay mod with one single download and install.
