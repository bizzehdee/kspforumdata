The SETI Probe Parts mod\u0027s \u0022Alkaline Fuel Cell Mini\u0022 doesn\u0027t actually generate any energy or consume resources no matter how you toggle the fuel cells. As an alternative though if you use the Universal Storage mod\u0027s \u0022Alkaline Fuel Cell\u0022 it does work correctly and seems to only consume resources for fueling based on load rather than a constant output. They are larger though so for small craft they can feel rather bulky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daywalker81","CreatedById":192726,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T19:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a bug in the fuel cell configuration. Open SETIprobeParts\\Utility\\setiMiniAFC.cfg\u00A0 and search for \u0022FillAmount\u0022. Change \u0022.1\u0022 to \u00220.95\u0022. This will leave the fuel cell active untill the vessel charge is at 95%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun with you new working fuel cell!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
