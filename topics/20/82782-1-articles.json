It\u0027s too detailed. You can see all the details on a planet or moon without having to work for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is that you build your own map as you go in a sense. When you start off, all you have is a very visually basic map view showing the positions and rough size of some of the close, larger celestial bodies (stuff that\u0027d likely be visible in the kerbin night sky) but that is all. This starter map view would have no surface detail whatsoever on any of the present bodies and would be completely missing some of the more distant planets, all moons (except Kerbin\u0027s), and all asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YO88DlJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YO88DlJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would use satellites and telescopes to expand and add detail to this starter map. With a satellite in it\u0027s orbit you could scan a body\u0027s surface, overlaying this information onto the body\u0027s suface as the satellite scans, filling in detail. Telescopes could be used from a Kerbin orbit to scan for asteroids and new distant planets plus if used to target on body, could scan for moons in it\u0027s orbit and provide some very low res surface detail to that body in map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also see this mod working well as a nice basic 3D map that could work well with RasterPropMonitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could make this mod myself but rather than you all having to wait on me to learn how to code, if there is someone who\u0027d like to take this idea and make it reality in a more realistic time frame than what I could do it, then please by all means go for it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-12T02:12:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2014 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lucid Hills\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T07:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch idea suits career mode very well (in immersion and \u0022realism\u0022 point of view), and I\u0027m pretty sure it has already suggested before (in suggestion forum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you did it more precisely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

But, as Kerbals rove, walk, fly and orbit around a planet, moon, or asteroid the areas in their line of sight would be filled in. The trick is to make distance from surface reduce the resolution of the mapping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts tricky to get this right -- the simple approach would be to have a line of sight circle around a Kerbal and reduce the mapping resolution with distance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, when a Kerbal is stood on the ground or in a rover then they should get fantastic resolution of where they are but the resolution should drop away from the Kerbal towards the horizon. Also form the ground you get a good sense of the elevation of hills and mountains and of the areas topography.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Kerbal is flying or orbiting then the sense of the height of hills and mountains is reduced also the resolution of the image is much lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is mapping should be much lower resolution at twilight and nearly impossible at night. But, again if the Kerbal has a light illuminating some part of the ground then that should be mapped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m trying to say is if you look at Venus with the naked eye all you\u0027ll see is a bright white-yellow dot and you\u0027d conclude that that is all there is -- further because of the clouds you\u0027d not be able to see the ground anyway.
