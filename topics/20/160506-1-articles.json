How much of that heat is transferred to your craft is a function of atmospheric density. Assuming a simple craft like a pod \u002B heat shield, the optimal periapsis is 20km. As to shallow vs steep, there\u0027s a bit of a corridor where it\u0027s possible to go either too shallow or too steep.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nToo steep can have one of two effects: Either parts of your craft (or the whole craft) burn up because you didn\u0027t slow down enough before hitting the denser parts of the atmosphere where you\u0027re getting maximal amounts of heat and your shield is overwhelmed. OR you suffer enough g-forces to render your crew unconscious or kill them outright.

Or you can be so shallow that you don\u0027t brake enough and fly back out of the atmosphere or fail to capture on an aerocapture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStock radiators are not effective in reentry as they will not cool any part unless that part is hotter than the external temperature.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAblative heat shields start ablating at 500k. The ablated material removes heat from the shield. The faster it ablates, the faster heat is removed. Contrary to what some people believe, heat shields do have limits even in real life though the mechanism of failure differs from real life. In Deadly Reentry, heat shields that run out of ablator have a reduced maxTemp, which is probably why your shield is exploding as soon as its ablator is depleted.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceplanes: You didn\u0027t say what your altitude was nor did you say if you were cruising or reentering and it matters. It would be highly unrealistic to be able to fly a plane much faster than Mach 3.5. Only the SR71 has ever flown that fast and that\u0027s faster than its operational speed of Mach 3.2. They were allowed to push it higher and its official max speed was 3.3 though 3.5 is its record. The shuttle on the other hand came in at Mach 25 but that was a \u003Cem\u003Eshallow \u003C/em\u003Ereentry. With stock Kerbin you will be coming in MUCH slower than Mach 25. I don\u0027t personally do spaceplanes that much but IIRC, the right periapsis was something like 40-50 km. You will want a pitch angle of about 35-40 degrees. (I will also mention here that with stock Mk3 parts I have survived \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E reentries. i.e. a full Mach 25 reentry so it is possible, at least with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E physics configs to scale convection heating down to Earth \u00A0reentries)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEve: For capsules, I think I used 40-60. I don\u0027t remember the exact periapsis/angle I used but it\u0027s not hard at all. Make that dense atmosphere work FOR you not AGAINST you. Do as much braking in the upper atmosphere as possible. If you use the inflatable shield, you want your altitude even higher as is basically heat resistant cloth. The point of the inflatable is to increase your surface area which means more drag which means more braking higher up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, I\u0027m the current developer of DRE. I use the same DRE you guys have \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0.

The effect that has on reentries actually makes them hotter and I still survive just fine. (makes them hotter because the skin can\u0027t conduct its heat as quickly into the interior)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing about you running out of ablator. Sounds like TOO shallow and baking it off. I said that earlier but just to revisit that, a typical reentry should only use about 25-35%. (maybe less on a suborbital. Mun or Minmus would use more but you should still have plenty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I NEVER turn the difficulty slider\u00A0below %100.

DRE remodels spaceplanes to mimic shuttle tiles as best as I could. The skin of each spaceplane part is configured to hold very little heat, and very low conductivity to the interior of the part. They have high emission to help them re-radiate the heat that they absorb. (this is in contrast to the stock parts which increase thermal mass so they store more heat). The skin-skin conductivity is INCREASED to try to evenly distribute the heat to adjacent parts. The shuttle came in at a high pitch to maximize drag, which also served to reduce heating due to the blunt body principle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-14T19:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, back to the Eve issue, is that 2.5t landing mass? What are you putting down that is weighs so much?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think going with the larger heat shield is the way to go since it increases your drag and that\u0027s what you\u0027re going to need for something that large. The inflatable would be even better but you DEFINITELY will need a shallow reentry for that. If you have thermal debugging turned on then you will see that each part is given a heating rate/cm2. Keep the inflatable at 15-20W /cm2\u00A0If you have to have the ablative shield (is it career? inflatable not available yet?) then go with the 2.5m shield and make it steeper not shallower.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-14T19:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2017 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T22:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138417-baldamundo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138417\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138417-baldamundo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@baldamundo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0there\u0027s been a few problems reported recently with the DRE download.
