Kethane seems to be on-hold and not entirely working with 0.90, and Karbonite requires the use of specific engines (the fuel you produce is not regular rocket juice), which is something I don\u0027t like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... so, any other system that I overlooked or any of this I got wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, my basic goal is to have some sort of use for a station around some moon or planet. Nothing fancy or overcomplicated (at least for now), just something that would give a station/base a bit of purpose, even if a little.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T22:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese do not exist in stock, and so, moved to Add-on Affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T23:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite for sure and it has stock fuel too but does add some engines that can burn Karbonite too but has Converter for all the fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T23:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do not ever need to use the Karbonite engines (Note: Kethane also has engines that run on Kethane, but they are also not needed). Using Karbonite you can drop a base on Mun (in a rich area preferably) and start drilling Karbonite, and then use the converter to convert it into LF, O, or LFO (It actually has a button for that third one which is such a small thing but I love it). Then come by later with a tanker, fill it up (I like Kerbal Attachment System for that) and lift it to an orbital refueling station or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially it does exactly what you want. So does Kethane (I\u0027ve used both) but as you said, it appears to be on hiatus while Karbonite is in active development.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T10:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also Interstellar and Interstellar Lite, but they\u0027re \u0022fancy and complicated\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar 0.90 maint thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104943\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104943\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar Lite: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91867\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91867\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite is probably your best choice at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T11:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried Kethane, Karbonite and Interstellar, finally I stayed with Karbonite. I just wait for KSPI 0.90 adaptation to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these mods allow converting their resource into LF, O or MP with no problem. Interstellar adds many other resources of its own (reactor fuels: plutonium, uranium; chemical fuels like water, ammonia, methane; and even antimatter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Kethane I didn\u0027t like the hexagon overlay and poor models/textures. Karbonite has very cool landing legs, landing chassis even, propellers, atmospheric engines (which do not require oxygen), very cool textures and generally it looks much better. While you can mine Kethane only on surface provided there is a deposit there you can mine Karbonite virtually anywhere (in atmosphere, in oceans, etc). Karbonite is based on concentration rather than on deposits so you can safely assume you will find Karbonite everywhere, it\u0027s just a matter of extraction speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar is quite another matter. It is compatible with both resources and adds its own. While it\u0027s a bit more complicated it opens so many other exciting options that ISRU is just a side bonus. I only wish it had better models and less minor glitches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend Karbonite \u002B KSPI or just Karbonite alone. Still you can install all of them. As far as I know they are compatible with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
