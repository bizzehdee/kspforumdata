I think that\u0027s a godd idea, but , if Squad aren\u0027t interested on it, anyone could develop it (i don\u0027t knwo how to create or modify any part of the game or a game code).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is very simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are going to land land on a Planet/Moon. You\u0027re alreday deorbited and your trajectory couldn\u0027t be changed if you don\u0027t use a big supply of fuel. Suddenly, you noticed (Duna could be the most frequently case) that the place were you\u0027re going to land isn\u0027t as flat as it seemed from space. When you touch down, your ship is inclined on its side and fell heavily to the ground, destroying much of it and leaving you with no ability to take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my assumptions are correct, you will feel very frustrated and in your next mission you will try to solve this coming up with other landing gear system..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if all else fails, you ask:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if there is a sensor in your ship and special landing mechanism to bend or extend the landing gear enough so that your ship is kept as stable as possible? I do not know if it has been entirely clear what I intend to suggest, but a picture can be worth a thousand words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NHLr1KA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NHLr1KA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scientist","CreatedById":129760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T18:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can to a point do this, by locking suspension on the gear that needs to be longest, but thats something to doas you get close to ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can also send down a tiny probe before you de orbit, enough of one that can fly around the nearby landing area to find the best landing spot to aim for next pass\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
