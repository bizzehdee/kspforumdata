And from what ive read the Devs made it so the game was highly compatible with mods (which are really add-ons I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been poking around ans have already done some stuff. I have a couple mods at the moment, H.O.M.E., Firespitter, KAS, and others I can\u0027t remember at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried making a space-carrier to first carry rovers (gave up) then to carry spaceplanes (didnt even get far into that one) and some stuff like moon bases and space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the reason I made this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
