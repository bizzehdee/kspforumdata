Could a plugin be made to either list, or label by two sets of colors on the parts info, all engines loaded in memory to identify which would be the best given current vessel mass and minimum TWR requirement?\n\nI was thinking of either two colored circles that indicated red-green gradient on the part\u0027s info panel for atmo and vacuum, a ranking value instead of color, or a list that sorts by most optimal that I can pull parts from (or at the very least that displays the engine name)."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:59:52Z","Content":"Like [KSP Optimal Rocket calculator](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/)?"}]}
