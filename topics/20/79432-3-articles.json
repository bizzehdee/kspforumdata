The AMD drivers with that useless Raptr thing are the best example I can think of. If you guys think ModStatistics is bad, then look at just how much worse it can be, and from a (formerly) trusted company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, at some point in the past year or so AMD partnered with Raptr to bundle its software with its driver packages. Raptr is enabled by default, and not called out in the installation unless you choose a custom installation, which is pretty rare for most users. Raptr then proceeds to spy on the computer so it can phone home with game statistics, which Raptr certainly sells (why else does it collect them? The data is useless otherwise, it can\u0027t sell you games you already own and play). It falls very firmly into how I classify malware (unwanted software which performs an undesired function), but there are legions of people on the AMD forums defending AMD for intentionally hiding it in effectively mandatory driver updates. The argument seems to be that you deserve to be punished if you dare to use an express installation, because they\u0027re less intelligent for trusting AMD to not bundle malware with their drivers. Even if it\u0027s not malware, it\u0027s clearly not something the users wanted or expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddon authors not selling your data. They don\u0027t want to muscle in to your digital life and make you use their software when you never wanted to. All they want is usage statistics for their mods, information that\u0027s extremely helpful in maintenance. Cut them a little slack, they\u0027re not out to destroy your privacy. Disagree with how they did it all you want, but understand that they\u0027re not acting out of malice. Invoking the specter of EU laws, which is essentially unenforceable here (at best you could use it to annoy sites hosting the content in EU data centers), is just tacky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, my personal view is that any data collection should be prominently displayed and opt-in only. It\u0027s a fact that opt-out causes additional installations because of user error, and it\u0027s unethical to take advantage of users in that way. Playing fast and loose with consent is not acceptable, even if you\u0027re asking for consent to do something you believe to be totally benign, or even helpful. Your users have a right to go to whatever extent they like to protect their privacy, even if you feel it\u0027s unnecessary and silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull Disclosure: I am a professional software engineer working on financial software (among other things), and deal with stuff like this regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T18:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LaytheAerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification of who I was responding to\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"enneract","CreatedById":56759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T21:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only flaw in that argument is that a lot of folks just download the new version of their favorite mods, and were a bit surprised when they came with extra stuff.
