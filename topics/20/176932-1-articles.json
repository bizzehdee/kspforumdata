The faster your processer, the quicker the physics and graphics can be completed. There I\u0027d no way to speed up the update cycles within the game code itself. The only thing that would make it faster would be making the physics less accurate and turning down the graphics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lilithvia","CreatedById":190582,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-23T05:19:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could just remove all the parts, all but one flag, all the things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lilithvia","CreatedById":190582,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-23T05:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Like most mod devs have at least one install like this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
