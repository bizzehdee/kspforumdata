It works good given that your horizontal velocity is low (and thus the terrain below you is not changing rapidly). Be aware that it gives you the countdown when the root part will be at the suicide burn altitude, so if you have a long ship, you should start a little bit before zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, you can set up a maneuver node at the surface with the deceleration you want to perform (that you have to estimate/calculate yourself - you can find out your current altitude, velocity vector, mass/gravitational acceleration of the body you\u0027re landing on -\u0026gt; you\u0027re able to calculate the velocity you\u0027ll have at the surface). The node will give you the burn time and time to node, so exactly what you need for a suicide burn. Be aware that you want to perform 100 % of the burn before the node, not 50before-50after like normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-09T06:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2023 06:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 9\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JohnG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-10T00:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224329108\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221696810532\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022230850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blackcat67\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Blackcat67 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHI,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll, i\u0027m new to the forums, but had KSP1 for years and don\u0027t know if anyone has a mod that will do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Calculate altitude when speed will be zero according to current acceleration rate and current altitude-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUseful for suicide burns or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt ought to be a straightforward function F(current rate, current altitude) -\u0026gt; altitude when relative speed is zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone coded such a mod or is contained in a current mod package?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif not - anyone want to assist me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatthew\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Rebux (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E) has this - it isn\u0027t perfect, but it isn\u0027t too bad.\u00A0 You can also set up the HUD displays to your own whims as well!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
