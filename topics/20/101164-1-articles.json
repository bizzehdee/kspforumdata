Neither values are enough to have any effect on a astronaut/Kerbalnaut in the microgravity environment of space.\n\nFinally, the equipment required to generate measure this effect involves the use of superconductors, and is so large, cumbersome and fragile that there is no way this could be built into a manned spacecraft for the purposes of artificial gravity generation.\n\n![fig22_l.jpg](https://web.archive.org/web/20121021064919im_/http://www.esa.int/images/fig22_l.jpg)\n\n**Conclusion:** daniel l., you quoted a citation without actually understanding it.
