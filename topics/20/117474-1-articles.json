I saw a thread with a mod that allowed you to hide the camera setting text for filming. Specifically when you switch back and forth between crafts.\n\nAny help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T01:29:00Z","Content":"I do remember this being in a mod many moons ago - and yes, someone else asked about it somewhere. I\u0027m assuming that you want the green text removed that tells camera views, changing time warp info and instructions to grip ladders or climb?\n\nThat WOULD be a useful mod for cinematic users. I hope someone knows about it or is willing to recreate the mod.\n\nPeace."},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T10:35:27Z","Content":"Just done tonight!\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130759-1-0-4-ScreenMessageHider-Hides-screen-messages-when-F2-is-pressed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130759-1-0-4-ScreenMessageHider-Hides-screen-messages-when-F2-is-pressed)\n\nGive MrHappyFace him a thumbs up!"},{"CreatedByName":"Fisk02","CreatedById":137236,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T19:35:18Z","Content":"Hey clown baby thing...
