We came up with two ideas (and I\u0027m not going to blame anyone else for these.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 1: \u003Cstrong\u003E!!SCIENCE!! Rockets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple concept - make an engine that uses the universal pool of science as a reaction mass. I\u0027ll point out that I have absolutely no clue how (or if) this would work code-wise - it fits in with the general silliness of KSP though, and gives a really good reason to keep collecting science. Depending on the ISP and thrust of the !!SCIENCE!! Rocket, you might even be able to use science to get science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 2: \u003Cstrong\u003EUpgradeable Parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is another concept I\u0027m not sure is even possible: Basically, use \u0026lt;x\u0026gt; science to give a flat 1.05 or 0.95 multiplier to a particular \u0022stat\u0022 on a part: Mass, ISP, Thrust, EC/s, etc. The advantage to being able to modify any of the properties by a set amount \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E make a mod for this universal. Examples of how it would work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor makes for a wonderful orbital maneuvering engine. Great ISP, decent thrust... but it\u0027s a bit heavy. Using this mod, you could spend 10000 science to drop the mass from 2.25 to 2.1375. Not a huge difference, but enough to squeeze a bit of Delta-V out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you could spend 10000 science to raise the thrust from 60kN to 63kN. Again, not HUGE, but it\u0027s a way to spend that extra science AND a reason to keep gathering science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you could tweak is the cost - 10k science to drop the cost of it from 8700 to 8265. Not worth the science in this case, but if you end up with some of the pricier KSP-I parts, it might be (the Alcubierre drives are in the millions, for example.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor balance, you could either make it so each successive upgrade (either per-part or globally) costs more science, or you could tweak the formula from a simple multiplier to something that places a limit on how much you can tweak a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Milaga","CreatedById":25869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T19:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI approve of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond idea seems more plausible than first.

What I\u0027m -not- sure of (based on looking at the API) is whether you can modify parts on the fly like that, or if every \u0022upgrade\u0022 would require you to reload the parts - hence why I consider this a mod request. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
