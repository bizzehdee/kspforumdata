That\u0027s the easy part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalculate the exact node vector based on some other number - that\u0027s pure mathematics, and the harder part. In principle it should be just rotate a given ellipse (determined by your input Ap/Pe if I understand correctly) so that it intersect your current orbit at the node, then calculate velocity difference. Velocity should be easy to calculate once we know the orbit and the current position on the orbit. Some orbital mechanics, basically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
