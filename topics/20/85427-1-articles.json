This feature is coming soon to the release version. Not only does the dev version allow you to automate the roll to any angle, but it also allows you to set a maximum angle of attack, and limit acceleration to a set rate. While not directly addressing compatibility with FAR / NEAR and Real Solar System, these features taken together make MechJeb ascents with those mods installed much nicer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://jenkins.mumech.com/job/MechJeb2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://jenkins.mumech.com/job/MechJeb2/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
