The behavior of draining tanks top to bottom has driven me insane since, well, since I noticed it. It really can muck with ones CoG on launch. (Barring that, is there any way you know to get them to drain bottom to top? I know, realism and all, but... just imagine creative piping, lets say? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:37:09Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t respect decouplers.
