I ask because sometimes you need lighting, but not necessarily *all* the lighting, that a light provides. Plus, in combination lights quickly wash everything out and actually make seeing detail harder, not easier.

A light that\u0027s set to 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 will be half as bright as one set to 1.0, 1.0, 1.0.
