Would KSP still be installed on your hard drive without these mods and the community they built?\n\nAnd I have no clue where you got the idea that Steam develops DLC for KSP. Valve is a game company, but Steam is a parasite created by Valve. Yes, I use Steam because I like not having all these boxes and CD\u0027s lying around and my games are archived for me.

There are still gobs of free \u0027mods\u0027 being made every day for Wordpress. And there are gobs of paid mods for Wordpress. Neither has cancelled the other out. The Wordpress community is huge, active and Matt Mullenweg, the owner of Automattic who creates Wordpress, is filthy rich as a result of this business model.\n\nAnd Wordpress has a solution to the mods it \u0027hosts.\u0027 Volunteers test, review and evaluate mods before they\u0027re made available for download on the Wordpress website, just like volunteer moderators are reading this post to make sure it contains appropriate content. The same \u0027peer review\u0027 process could be made for KSP mods (which is a damn sight more than exists now). So, your issues of quality and stagnation are easily countered.\n\nIMHO, it was a huge mistake for Squad to turn mod hosting over to Curse in the first place.\n\nWhat I don\u0027t understand is, people have no problem with mod developers charging for derivatives of non-gaming software, like Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla.

Were I to develop mods for KSP, I\u0027d personally have no problem with a share going to Squad. And I have no issue with the permissions. Making sure that a mod meets certain standards is safeguarding their franchise. In a previous post, I suggested a peer review process before mods are allowed to be distributed. But, the original authors do get paid in the form of sales of their original product. They should be thrilled that there are people out there willing to spend time, money and effort creating mods and shouldn\u0027t breech the OMG greed barrier like Bethesda and demand 75% of the profits for Skyrim mods. And THAT is why I, in principle, disagree with with some mandatory fee being paid to the original authors.

You make a mod for yourself, and release it for everyone. Or not, as the case may be. Whilst I think modders should have the option to set a price on their work, I dont think they should take that option.

I would be surprised to find that software works much different.\n\nI don\u0027t doubt you\u0027re correct. Even though I have the ability to remotely disable these hacked copies (all of the help files are on the web and the stupid hackers assumed I just fed them raw html without recording the visits) in the past 5 years it\u0027s been on the market, I\u0027ve only shut down two illegal copies. There\u0027s an old saying in business, there\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nAnd you avoiding inflexible licenses is exactly why I haven\u0027t written anything for KSP. I\u0027m an old school programmer. It took me ages to figure out OOP. That means that my code uses old school methods that may be slower or less efficient than those who know the latest code updates. Old programming axiom, when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail. For that very reason, I don\u0027t release my code because I don\u0027t need some 12 year old telling me my code sucks. It works and I understand it, that\u0027s all that matters. Squad\u0027s demand that I release my full source is exactly why I won\u0027t write mods, addons, apps or anything else for KSP. I don\u0027t need the aggravation surrounding something I\u0027m not getting paid for."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T14:43:54Z","Content":"My answer to the OP is no.

Assets, maybe, code, no. Since all code must be source-available, nothing stops the user from downloading and compiling for themselves.

You make a mod for yourself, and release it for everyone. Or not, as the case may be. Whilst I think modders should have the option to set a price on their work, I dont think they should take that option. A mod should be made because you yourself want the game to work that way, not because you think you can sell it to the same crowd that spends their money on pay to win iphone apps.\n\nAnd why not? The shareware I created was out of necessity. I wanted a program to work a certain way. After I was done, I released it as freeware. A day and 10,000 downloads later I realized I\u0027d created something that I not only wanted but something others wanted. So, was I obligated to keep that program freeware because I suddenly thought I could improve and sell it?\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention. And because of inventors who saw a necessity, you have wondrous marvels, like electricity, automobiles, airplanes, cell phones, etc. If the people who invented those things were told, you shouldn\u0027t charge for them, they would have had no reason to give them away.\n\nYou\u0027re asking mod creators to be altruistic.
