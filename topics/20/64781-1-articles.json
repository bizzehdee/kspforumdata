It would be nice to have a mod that can automatically do some actions when it\u0027s power is about to be depleted in order to save the ship, like deploy solar panels, turn off non-essential tasks, lights, ... switch to powersaving mode to run only essentials on backup battery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, If someone has an ingame tech tree editor to make your own tech tree and use it, or an .exe that would fill in that role, i\u0027d be very very thankful.
