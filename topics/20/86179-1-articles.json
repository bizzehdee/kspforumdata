That meant i had to \u0022master\u0022 ascents again from scratch before i could begin to use mj again. The changes that followed were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- simpler, but more powerful rockets. Topheavy (com in front) with small fins, vernier engines for correction, procedural fairings. After some testing the paylot got way up, and it got easier to orbit (inkl. Reentry and pinpoint recovering with DR). As a matter of fact its now easier and cheaper for me than without FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- in mj my new friend is the field for angle of attack, the more my rocket is not well balanced the less percentage. Since some trial and errors my rockets got good enough that i dont need this most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no force roll. At least for me for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ascent path by hand... Mostly starting the gravity turn around 1000m (or as soon as possible), and in a smooth curve up to 69km (for an 75km orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, i mostly build rather big rockets for payloads from 20 up to 300 tons payload with KW Rocketry. And since i can assure in 9 from 10 launches the return of the complete mainstage (minus boosters if needed) to ksp for a nice 97% cash return i tend to build not cheap. Lots of chutes of course, an some intense planning and construction to survive reentry and hit the waters near ksp. But now its possible again to let mj do the job without fearing too much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: concerning \u0022optimally\u0022... my goal in career is - with or without the help of mj with ascent and/or landing - to get the payload into low kerbin orbit, deorbit the mainstage, survive the reentry and hit the waters near ksp for high cash return. As long as there is some sparefuel at the end for a short burn before impact into the water the fuel consumption is irrelevant for me. Of course you can achieve all sorts of optimum by chosing burn times, angle of attack, ascent profiles and so on. The rocket may cost 300000 funds, but since the return is 97% ... who cares? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T03:30:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by smart013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T03:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArgh...
