Unlike comets, Ascension has a high albedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy approach was catching it while it\u0027s going towards Kerbol. Rendezvous is fiddly but manageable. dV requirements are high. I forgot to take account about dV for raising apoapsis, but braking took around 3.5 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s11.postimg.org/wtv7szqwz/ascension_rendezvous_lw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ascension_rendezvous_lw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was so overengineered that the tug use to push the lander\u0027s carrier still has lots of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/aundqqjtj/ascension_lw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ascension_lw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging orbital parameters is easy, the gravity well is rather shallow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/uugsxsf87/ascension_lupo1_lw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ascension_lupo1_lw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat bugs me is this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/722w8intj/ascension_bhole_lw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ascension_bhole_lw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I lowered lander\u0027s orbit, the whole body became pitch black. I don\u0027t know exactly when, because I was in map mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for laughs, I tried to land it and smashed into the surface. Some 850 metres at Mach 1 speed.

Ordinarily I\u0027d ask if you were on the dark side, that\u0027d do it, but your ship is clearly illuminated. Does your lander have lights you could use to try and see the surface? That can narrow it down between either a lighting glitch or a texture glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T23:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pitch black, textureless void regardless of the position. Yes, I do have 4 long range reflectors on the lander, but landing is very hard when you have absolutely no points of reference and the reflectors are pointing towards horizon. I know, it was a mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like standing over a creepy 2D punched hole in the fabric of space. I could try going down at 50 m/s - lander is the third stage of the whole ship so it might survive the impact. I don\u0027t know how variable is the height of the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mod I have is KSPX and as I\u0027ve said, graphics are at maximum, except resolution. It runs at 10-15 fps, enough for missions where I want to capture nice screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kragrathea","CreatedById":70850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T00:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finally found this bug.
