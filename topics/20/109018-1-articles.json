But something I am slightly annoyed by is that you can do all the science, collect it, and hope to the next location. It really gives you no incentive to remain on the surface of a place. \n\nWhat I think would be a cool mod is if you have to give the science experiments time to complete. And if you spend less time conducting the experiment, you\u0027ll get less science. Also, it would also be nice if during the experiments electricity was consumed. And if you run out of charge, you have to redo all the science that wasnt logged and saved.\n\nAn example: Goo Canister\n\nTime to complete: 1.5 hours\n\nSpent time: 1.4 hours\n\nReceived science: 93%\n\nAnother example: 2hot thermometer\n\nTime to complete: 30 minutes\n\nSpent time: 15 minutes\n\nReceived science: 50%\n\nAnd again: Crew Report\n\nTime to complete: 2 hours\n\nSpent time: 3 hours\n\nReceived Science: 100%\n\nWhat I want from this mod, if someone is kind enough to make it, is to have more realistic missions, that are harder and need much more consideration and diligence. \n\nHope I can inspire someone to make something like it. I would if I could (and even had time to do so). Leave a comment below if you would also want this."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T14:01:12Z","Content":"Perhaps this can be achieved with the [Real Science Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120748-WIP-RealScience-Say-good-bye-to-whack-a-mole-style-science)"}]}
