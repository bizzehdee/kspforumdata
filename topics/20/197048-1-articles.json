It\u0027s a very inviting (simple geometry) and promising design and there\u0027s decent room for slipping in new parts for modularity\u0027s sake (like a crew cabin. There will always be a demand for a high capacity cabin. As for IVAs, just use the placeholder. It\u0027ll be sufficient for many players just to get to see a crew portrait to know that there\u0027s a kerbal in the cabin or cockpit). As an air-launched spaceplane its engines are therefore high thrust vacuum engines (Poodles on steroids), very poor in thick atmo (unlike the stock Rhino or the SSME which are mid-range or sustainers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe body itself should definitely be just over 2.5m tall and over 3.1m from port to starboard (you can anticipate a great need for a spaceplane body that can hold 2.5m cargo and has lift surface, or a 2.5m-alike spaceplane body...which will, of course, hold \u0026lt; 2.5m cargo). Skipping the cockpit for a drone nose you can make it fill X-37\u0027s role with Tweakscale. With some adapters and/or angled engines it can fit the MAKS\u0027s role too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022clean.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.67\u0022 height=\u0022358\u0022 width=\u0022667\u0022 src=\u0022https://falsesteps.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/clean.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022103021-79d4116c6b1c58402985f6565eb04fcf.\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002246.00\u0022 height=\u0022230\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/103/103021-79d4116c6b1c58402985f6565eb04fcf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022103020-e0a342276d4f3d45178772710899eadf.\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002234.80\u0022 height=\u0022174\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/103/103020-e0a342276d4f3d45178772710899eadf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
