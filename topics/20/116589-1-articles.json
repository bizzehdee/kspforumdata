Just know that to actually orbit these planets it\u0027s gonna take a lot more time and resources than it takes to get to Jool and it\u0027s moons. Sarnus(Saturn) isn\u0027t too bad, but Uranus and Neptune are quite the hike. (Only 5 more years to go on my Urlum probe I launched 9 years ago!). But you can do it New Horizon\u0027s style and do a flyby in reasonable time periods (Currently doing a approx 5 year transit to Putto).\n\nEdit: This does end up creating 2 Pluto analogs (Plock/Putto) but that\u0027s fairly minor and they are in different orbits. OPM moves Eeloo into an orbit around Sarnus to work as an Enceledus analog.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T22:10:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kilmeister**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:09:59Z","Content":"I personally prefer OPM because the OPM planets blend better with stock planets IMHO.\n\nI do not believe they will work together as Sarvin and Sarnus sound like they share very similar orbits (and, at their close approach, it will break SoI and gravitation).\n\nAnother recommendation I have if you want to fully reinvent the experience is New Horizons, which I think is compatible with Kerbol\u002B and completely rearranges the system, including making Kerbin a moon of Jool (as well as graphically redoing everything to make it in a Kerbol\u002B like art style).\n\nAlso someone revived Alternis Kerbol, praise Kod."},{"CreatedByName":"NJP","CreatedById":147695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:18:04Z","Content":"I say create a couple new save files (If you know what you\u0027re doing) and try out both of them with totally different versions of the game.

In a new Science or Career save I think Kerbol Plus offers more because it has bodies across the system, whereas the Outer Planets will probably only become important in the late game so might be better suited to Sandbox or to adding to an established save. On the downside, Kerbol Plus I\u0027ve found to be finicky - the supplied download is fine but don\u0027t try and use it with a different Kopernicus version and don\u0027t install it through CKAN.\n\nAs far as memory usage goes, if you\u0027re using the Windows 32-bit version of KSP, you will probably have memory trouble if you try and load up on planets. There are ways to reduce memory usage but there\u0027s only so much you can do, to really load up on the mods requires 64-bit KSP. The Linux 64-bit version is fully supported but performance does vary on your hardware (nVidia graphics good, AMD graphics bad on Linux); it works excellently for me and I have an install with just about every planet pack I can find at once. 64-bit on Windows is currently available by an unofficial hack and results vary, it\u0027s great for some people and hopeless for others and nobody really knows why.\n\nAs far as other planet packs go:\n\nNew Horizons combines a system reshuffle with a bunch of new worlds. It\u0027s a good choice if you want a new experience right from the start of a new save and you\u0027re up for a challenge. It also has configs to incorporate Kerbol Plus, OPM, and Tran-Keptunian. On the downside it\u0027s not going to work well when added to an existing save. [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114092](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114092)\n\nIf you want wild, psychedelic worlds, the Boris pack fits the bill. [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70018](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70018)\n\nAsclepius is a one-off planet (plus a moon) orbiting between Kerbin and Duna. It\u0027s designed as a place to take spaceplanes to, with the not-uncommon idea of having the atmosphere mainly in deep canyons. Being just two worlds you can probably add it in alongside KerbolPlus, OPM, or another larger planet pack.
