And they have real lives, jobs, school wives/kids that take up their time. Because of that, it\u0027s not realistic to expect that most mods will be updated within a few days of an update to KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd, before beginning to use a certain mod, look at the corresponding thread for that mod on the add-on release and add-on development forums. Make a note of the mod authors name, and look at how active they are on the threads for the mod. The more active they are, generally the faster a Mod will be updated following a new patch. While I\u0027m not saying you shouldn\u0027t use some of the less active or popular Mods, just be aware that you take a risk of waiting longer following a patch for the corresponding Mod update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Mods you listed, I haven\u0027t used KOSMOS or IonHybrid, so I can\u0027t comment on how good they are. If you are looking for rocket parts, KW Rocketry is very good. As for Mechjeb, I don\u0027t know of any other single mod that does everything MJ does. If you are only interested in the data it provides, like delta-v and flight data, Kerbal Engineer Redux is a popular substitute. As for it\u0027s autopilot features, the pickings are slimmer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, check out the Community Mod Library thread \u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eforum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u003C/a\u003E for a very good list of mods of all types, along with a guide for what version it\u0027s been updated for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T12:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eokay... first off: your thread came off \u0026lt;to me at least\u0026gt; as rather pushy and whiny.

As mentioned, any mods that come in the form of parts are risky. If a new release breaks a mod than the ships with the modded parts will be taken out of the game and that might be disappointing when they\u0027re close to finishing a long mission. There are a lot of mods that don\u0027t come in the form of parts and those are a lot safer; they\u0027ll simply stop working when they break and that\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ is certainly a well supported mod that I wouldn\u0027t expect to break anytime some. Flight Engineer is another one, and I would \u003Cem\u003Ehighly\u003C/em\u003E recommend the Navyfish Docking Align mod as it will help you to make one of the hardest elements of the game -- docking -- a whole lot easier by feeding you the right information (you\u0027re still the one who has to do the docking though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon engines tend to be small and without a lot of power.
