I am using the pre-made \u0022RN Stock Luna 2\u0022 craft (from the Soviet Probes and Soviet Rockets mods by Raidernick), the craft has plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I am still unable to reach/impact the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but here is my understanding of how the real mission went:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Launched from Baikonur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Reached an altitude of about 200-300km (could not find an accurate number), before the main engine of the second stage ran out of fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Removed the fairing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Decoupled the upper stage, and lit it\u0027s vernier engines\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. At the right time it lit the upper stage\u0027s main engine as well (the RD-0105)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. When the impact orbit was reached (or in the case of Luna 1, slightly after) the engines shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Decoupled the probe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.

Set the Moon as target\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Wait until the inclination of the orbit is as close as possible to the one of the Moon (around 17.5 degrees, according to Mechjeb\u0027s Rendezvous Planner) and the moon is in a proper position (not too far behind or in front of what would become my transfer orbit trajectory)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Launch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Reach about 200-300 km, decouple, light verniers, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.

It turns out it is rather difficult to hit the moon directly without first making a parking orbit. After a few days of trying I managed to impact it by letting the Moon reach a point in its orbit when two statements are true:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 a. The relative inclination is about or less than 25 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 b. The moon and the Baikonur launch site are on the opposite sides of the Earth (not sure if that makes sense, I can upload a photo if needed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter both of those are true, I selected the Moon as target and launched roughly to the east, but with a heading of less than 90 degrees (specifically 70 degrees in my case), but how much exactly will depend on where the prograde target of the moon is on the navball (as long as it is in a heading of less than 90 degrees). Effectively the rocket\u0027s prograde vector should be directly above that target and slowly coming down towards it. After the first stage is out, the apoapsis should be at 200-300km and time to apoapsis should be about 3-5 minutes. After that I immediately create the node with Mechjeb as usual, tweak it from the map view (if it does not show a direct impact) and let Mechjeb execute it. (of course I first stage, to remove the used stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing all this should allow for minor radial burn, which should allow for a burn node with about 4500-4900 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-11T11:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2019 11:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Slav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
