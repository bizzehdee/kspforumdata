You can\u0027t really expect pro code without some education and for a lot of us this *is* our education ( even with a degree \u0026amp; years of writing in other langs ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also little documentation beyond the Unity manual about what to or not to do; there\u0027s reference to what tools are available but no \u0022please don\u0027t do that\u0022 other than ad-hoc collected wisdom. It\u0027s like we were given a car, we poked about at it with the contents of a generic mechanic\u0027s toolbox, wrote down what all the parts did \u0026amp; found out how to make it move, but nobody told us you\u0027re meant to use the clutch to change gear or what the rules of the road are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTHAT is one of the most clear explanations of the whole kit-and-kaboodle I\u0027ve read. Thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, this modding community . . . or rather, the Patron-Client relationship between Squad and its Modding community, are probably only about as mature as the analagous relationship between say Bethesda and its modders, around the time Morrowind had become popular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp till now, the relationship between Squad and its modders has evolved in an \u0022ad hoc\u0022 manner, (just as I would speculate it did for TES games initially, and most games which have active and prolific modding communities [with the possible exception of Minecraft, which seems to have been a geekfest right from the start]) and has yet to progress into a more \u0022managed and directed\u0022 mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is an interesting phenomenon from a Business/marketing/consumer psychology perspective, and it is not surprising if even the most innovative of game design studios don\u0027t quite get it because even those who DO get it only seemed to have figured it out by trial and error over the years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T16:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, this is moving towards politics of modding, and there\u0027s been plenty enough of that over the years. Simply - the game is built on an easily extensible platform, and a great many of the people who\u0027ve worked on it by now have come from the modding community, so it\u0027s inherently mod friendly. That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s ever been sold as a modding platform - and even if it *was* and there were formal docs, you would still find mods being written by new programmers which aren\u0027t necessarily well optimised anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSource has to be published publically, so if you think there\u0027s some bad code then fix it \u0026amp; submit the fix. If you don\u0027t know how to fix it and you\u0027re not prepared to learn, open an issue somewhere - most mod source is on Github which has plenty of support for peer review, otherwise stick it in the thread - and provide copious useful information. It\u0027d be nice if Squad provided a bunch of \u0022don\u0027t do thats\u0022 and perhaps some \u0022do it this way\u0022 for common practice and I expect eventually we\u0027ll get that, but most of the time I doubt things like heavy GC use or excessive CPU time in one assembly is anything to do with them directly; sometimes it\u0027s Unity itself, sometimes it\u0027s just bad code practice, and it\u0027s the job of peer review by modders to correct that \u003Cem\u003Eunless we want to pay Squad to do it\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mod for fun, so much that although most of the things I\u0027ve made are somewhere in public I don\u0027t generally make a noise because a) I don\u0027t want support issues, and b) usually I don\u0027t go the full 100%. Practically everyone else mods for their own benefit too - if they had to go through formal peer review and something like an ISO process just to publish a mod, who is going to bother?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-12T16:44:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2016 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T16:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteering us back towards the topic...
