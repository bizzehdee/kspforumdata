This last week I decided I wanted to try my hand add making some parts myself. Pouring over these forums and watching the tutorial videos has been amazingly helpful. It got me from having no idea what I was doing to finally making my first part.

But again, thanks everyone for all the help.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Josh\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T20:02:55Z","Content":"\nCongrats :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T23:38:22Z","Content":"\nAwesome model!

Congrats... :thumbsup:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI agree, the community was very helpful when I made my 1st part...There are LOTS of excellent tutorials and info out there, also.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had never done ANY modelling, or programming, and I was able to make a working GPS antenna for Figaro (Kerbal GPS), as my 1st part:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/tU2Oxhj.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hardest part was not the modelling or the texturing, or even writing the .cfg; but using Paint to actually piece together the texture from different elements...Especially the tiny blue image of Kerbin... lol\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen the .cfg file was really easy, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts quite a feeling after you finish your 1st working part, isnt it? :D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully your post will encourage other people to give making parts, a shot...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Ooops...sorry, did not mean for that pic to be so huge... See, I cant even Imgur very well, but I made a WORKING KSP part!... lol\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T04:32:05Z","Content":"\nAlso, welcome!
