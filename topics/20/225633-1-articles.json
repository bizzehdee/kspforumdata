Their accretion disks are strangely dim, which has allowed life to spring up near the 2 black holes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErflam - The first world out from the binary, Erflam is a lava world being shredded by the tidal forces. It has oceans of lava hot enough to melt tungsten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSarkas - The second world from the binary. It has a breathable atmosphere complimented by 3 moons, a small ring system and plains of salt with small puddles of water in them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJead - Sarkas\u0027 first moon. Jead is the shepherd moon of the rings and has a small equatorial ridge.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRaser - Sarkas\u0027 version of the Mun. 133km in size and in a similar orbit to the Mun, indirectly shepherding the rings from orbital resonances.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBlok - Sarkas\u0027 3rd moon, being a captured\u00A0\uA78CAyl\u00F3\uA78Cchaxnim. Blok is named after the fact that it looks like, acts like, and has the aerodynamic qualities like a brick.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHera - The third world of the system, being fully habitable! It is where the Kerbals now live. Hera has a moon with a breathable atmosphere and a recently captured comet. The 2 moons are essentially the Mun and Minmus, but better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSimimun - Hera\u0027s only major moon, and the first moon, being a large Mun-sized object with a habitable atmosphere, a small magnetosphere and a brown discoloration. Portmanteau of Mun and Similar.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCoture - An abnormally large captured comet with a blueish color. Has a small tail from the fact that it\u0027s layer of water ice is sublimating.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBinoc - Hera\u0027s trojan partner, residing in the L5 lagrange point. Other than that it\u0027s mostly unremarkable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBers - A Duna-like planet with no atmosphere and a blue tint due to it\u0027s surface being coated with copper sulfates. In a binary with Casre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCasre - Bers\u0027 partner. Has an anomalous non-boiling red fluid on it\u0027s surface, contrasting Bers\u0027 copper sulfate induced blue tint.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeaso - A gas giant with 9 moons and 2 trojan partners, making a total of 11 bodies under it\u0027s influence. It\u0027s orange-red color reminds some of Sarnus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nL/1993 W\u00A01 - The innermost object of Leaso, discovered during the winter solstice of 1993. Teeny shepherd moon that could easily orbit Gilly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHelk - The innermost moon of Leaso that has an actual name. Also a shepherd.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpado - The smallest round moon of Leaso. ~240km, the outermost shepherd moon.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConter - A retrograde moon of Leaso. Pretty grey.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nL/2002 H\u00A02 - Lagrangian partner of Conter, discovered during Harvest of 2002. Tiny little thing with a peanut-like shape.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCwas - Largest moon of Leaso. Keeps it\u0027s tilt in check and stops the moons from going on Apocalypse trajectories.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nL/2002 H 1 - Retrograde minor moon of Leaso, with a near- polar orbit sweeping between Cwas and Oren.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOren - 2nd furthest moon of Leaso. Tends to spin fast, making it oblate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHiight - Furthest moon of Leaso. Portmanteau of High and Sight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2154 Bradley - L5 partner of Leaso, with a small moon in the 10s of kilometers. Named after famed KSPtuber Bradley Whistance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n74012 Lowne - L4 partner of Leaso with plains of.. sand? Named after famed KSPtuber Matt Lowne.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlous - Oblate methane iceball with 2 moons. Dubious planetship, which on better days, leads to heated arguments and on bad days, portable boxing matches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nP/2013 C 2 - Large moon of Plous, discovered on Christmas of 2013. Half of it is methane ice.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nP/2013 C 1 - The first discovered moon of Plous, which was discovered during Christmas of 2013. Looks very circular for a 24km moon.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Ethe other stars will come soon, i just need to think!\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-04T18:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d advise that you hold off on planning entire other star systems until you make some actual progress on creating the mod.
