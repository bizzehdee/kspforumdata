I\u0027m about to embark on interplanetary missions from farming science\u00A0in the Kerbin system. I keep seeing all these images on the KSP wiki of terrain maps and other things like that. I\u0027m trying to find some mods that give me parts so that I may make these things too. I would like more parts to put on my interplanetary and latter interstellar (with the galaxy mod) ships and probes just because stock parts aren\u0027t enough for me. This game is so fun and I want to have more to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, toodles!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T16:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50701-community-mods-and-plugins-library/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T23:38:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a forum sub-section for discussions of mods, and your thread has been moved to it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T04:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the maps on the wiki are from a long-moribund mod called ISA MapSat, but the big-name mapping mod these days is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72679-105-scansat-v147-real-scanning-real-science-at-warp-speed-january-16/\u0022\u003ESCANsat\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 DMagic also makes the excellent \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/59009-105-dmagic-orbital-science-new-science-parts-v11-12132015/\u0022\u003EDMagic Orbital Science mod\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, which adds a bunch of cool new science instruments for probes and rovers (and some contracts to get you out there using them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
