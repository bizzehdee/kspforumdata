I set the Homeworld radius to 0 so that even Kerbals on Kerbin would need supplies. That part is working (as the four in this test base are all starving). I\u0027m using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Core (for the logistics containers), and of course then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Tools as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.25em 0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nThe base has a logistics container with 0 supplies. I created a rover and put a logistics container on there with 600 supplies. The UI indicates \u00220 vessels sharing within 150m\u0022 but the rover is all of 2m away. Even after a full day of time warp, nothing is transferring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.25em 0px 0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nA picture (or two) is worth a thousand words:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/Xu0cQ3d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/Xu0cQ3d\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfjohnny5","CreatedById":64610,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T18:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:0px 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nFor anyone else struggling with this, I figured it out. It turns out this functionality isn\u0027t part of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Core.\u00A0I made (what I thought was a logical) assumption that since \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Core included all the Kontainers that it would also include a basic implementation of Scavenging - so that you could resupply Life Support without all that cumbersome connecting of vessels on the surface.
