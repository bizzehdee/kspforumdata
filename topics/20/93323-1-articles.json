Scrapped, Decommisioned, Broken-Down, or however you may call it. Torn-off panels, broken windows, rust in some spots, dents, broken levers and buttons along with wires sticking out in the IVA view, maybe even the third seat in the Mk3 cockpit could be completly broken! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose would be the details i could imagine seeing on such \u0022forgotten and abandoned(by kerbals)\u0022 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
