Unfortunatelly it seems, this feature isn\u0027t planned and there is no mod available for this either. So I thought about another approach. (e.g.) Recolor some Kerbals with blue skin and yellow eyes, change their surnames to \u0027Eloa\u0027 and pretend them being from Eeloo or Laythe. This would be enough to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that leads to my question: Is there any mod that provides the possability of adding additional textures/skin colors for my Kerbals? Just replacing textures would just turn all Kerbals blue.
