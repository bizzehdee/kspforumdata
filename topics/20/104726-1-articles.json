The texture needs to have a very specific filename for it to be applied to the correct celestial body. No, these filenames do not always make sense, but you still need to name them exacty that way ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWhich filename you need to give your moon texture and where you need to place it should be listed somewhere in the TextureReplacer readme file or the TextureReplacer forum thread first post.\n\nDo note that just replacing the texture does not change the terrain - stuff like where the craters are, what the biomes are named, and so on. Those will still be KSP standard. The texture just makes it appear different from afar.\n\nIf you\u0027re generally interested in making things more akin to real life, check out \u0022Realism Overhaul\u0022, and especially \u0022Real Solar System\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:51:31Z","Content":"Install Texture Replacer by putting it in your GameData folder.
