Works in 1.8.1 I think but I haven\u2019t used it myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nXPC Revived- adds some moons to stock bodies, plays nice with OPM (Eeloo moons go to Plock instead), possibly not being maintained so may not be 1.8.1 compatible but works in 1.7.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDwarf planets plus- a bit like minor planets, adds various small bodies and an ice giant far from the sun. Compatible with OPM, but possibly not maintained or 1.8.1 compatiblr, works in 1.7.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJNSQ- rescaled and redesigned stock system, much harder than the stock system due to the greater sizes and distances involved but still feasible with stock parts and many mods. 1.8.1 compatible, has its own special visuals mod called Ad Astra but that only works in 1.7.3. Nearly 2GB mod and has a noticeable performance impact, but worth it if you want the greater challenge of a bigger system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrannus expansion- a second solar system around the star Grannus. Can be made the primary solar system and has a rescaled version for JNSQ too. 1.8.1 compatible, it worked when I tried it once but haven\u2019t looked at it too closely yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond home- new solar system as the Primary with what\u2019s left of the stock Kerbol system, I think the idea is that Kerbol ran out and either exploded or went red giant and affected the stock planets drastically. Not tried it myself but pretty sure it\u2019s 1.8.1 compatible and have seen some videos of it which look very good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternis Kerbol- moves stock planets around a lot, Kerbin becomes a moon of Jool! 1.8.1 compatible I think, haven\u2019t used it myself though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSigma Rescale- just makes the stock planets bigger, 1.8.1 compatible and you can pick from 2.5x to over 10x scale, though considerable parts or realism/fuel\u00A0mods will be required for larger than 3.2x scale. Might also work with some other planet packs but not with JNSQ as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal solar system- exactly what is says on the title. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s 1.8.1 compatible and you WILL need more mods for better fuels and rocket parts for it, many realism mods available. It\u2019s a lot harder than stock so don\u2019t make that jump without trying a smaller rescale first to get used to the differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T10:47:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix-D","CreatedById":9395,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-11T15:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPP works fine in 1.8.1.
