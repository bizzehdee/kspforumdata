I have tried looking for a 1.2 version of the mod forever, but I just can\u0027t find it! At first, I found someone who said that RoverDude had updated to mod to 1.2, and that the link is in his signature. But when go there, it\u0027s no where to be seen! Then I went to the end of the thread, and I found someone who had seen the problems with the mod and tried to fix it, and someone else tried posting a link to the download. But when I click it, there is a 404 page! BTW the link is\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/BargainRockets.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. So can anyone please find a 1.2 download for the mod, or at least update one? Seriously I\u0027m spending way too much time trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T00:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://archive.org/download/BargainRockets-1.1.1/6E7757E7-BargainRockets-1.1.1.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://archive.org/download/BargainRockets-1.1.1/6E7757E7-BargainRockets-1.1.1.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-18T06:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Add-on Discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
