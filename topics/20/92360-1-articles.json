Aerodynamics in particular feels way out of whack for what you get in return for your science points, with practical-use requirements from quite deep in other lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELong version\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting a fresh, modded game with loads of new ways to get science (DMagic, Station Science, etc), but only 10% science returns and 50% funding. I\u0027m hoping this will force me to make use of absolutely every trick of every mod, to explore every biome on Mun and Minmus, and be forced to head out to Duna and Eve with a ton of the tree left to unlock. Basically I want a long game, something I can do for an hour or two every night for months \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am however having problems getting it going (not surprising really, but I wanted a challenge). Having sunk some of my precious early points into aerodynamics and picked up a Fine Print flyby mission for the bread and butter income, I realise - I don\u0027t have landing gear. Seriously, I\u0027ve invented the jet engine before the wheel? I can build a plane that is FAR stable from take off to maximum, but I can\u0027t get it into the air. I can\u0027t launch vertically because I don\u0027t yet have a strong enough SAS unit to keep it oriented \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically I think I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E unlock batteries, giving me (TAC life support) time enough to go to the Mun, which should eventually give me science enough to unlock landing gear, and then get the more mundane Kerbestrial science points... but this feels very backwards.
