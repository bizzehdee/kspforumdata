I\u0027ve been getting more crashes since the last bunch of mods were installed and I\u0027m wondering should I delete all the parts I don\u0027t use in any sets? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do mods that are active in the VAB use up memory in the rest of the game? I currently have 3 VAB-based mods (subassembly loader, editor extensions, simple part organiser) I could do without editor extensions and simple part organiser but will it benefit me in the rest of the game to get rid of them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T17:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some discussion you may be interested in posted in this thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47292-A-BIG-request-for-all-modders-Texture-Size\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47292-A-BIG-request-for-all-modders-Texture-Size\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, KSP loads \u003Cem\u003EEverything Immediately\u003C/em\u003E when you start it, and it loads all the textures as uncompressed bitmats, there is no partial loading, and no degrees of quality, it\u0027s just all in all pre-optimization as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T20:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if I understand correctly, KSP has a 4GB RAM ceiling...Meaning even if you HAVE more RAM, it\u0027s only able to utilize up to the 4GB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T23:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, so, it\u0027s best to delete all the parts I don\u0027t use from the parts packs that I\u0027ve installed. That\u0027s good to know, I should be able to cut my parts count right down, cos I don\u0027t plan on using most things from the sets I\u0027ve installed, e.g. I installed the HOME kit and I only really wanted it for the cute pop-out greenhouses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
