I tried to rendezvous two ships on low Mun orbit (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E=\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E=15km) . Being new to P\u003Cspan\u003Erincipia, I wasted a lot of fuel tweaking around and ended up finding that I had only 174m/s to go home. I found that if I put all of the delta-v into a prograde burn I would reach an unstable orbit, where there might be some ways to leave Mun. But I failed to find such ways.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EDo those ways exist? Is there a\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0minimal delta-v for this transfer? If there really is one, then what is it?\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
