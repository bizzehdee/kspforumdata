The ISS has very large solar panels to power stuff like lab equipment, lights, computers, etc... So I was wondering if there is a mod that adds minor power drain to every part where it would make sense (or if it could be made), for example, the Mobile Processing Lab doesn\u0027t passively drain any power even though it realistically would. Command Pods and Drone Cores do not drain power unless \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on. Even stuff where the only power drain would be lights. More power hungry parts would have like 1\u00A0- 2\u00A0drain per second, less if its not as hungry. I imagine some parts like the Centrifuges (Stockalike Station Parts Expansion Redux) might take quite a bit of power. One part\u00A0alone is not a big deal, but bigger station could end up draining a fair bit of\u00A0power per second, and it would give more purpose to solar panels, and you would also need to make sure you have enough batteries to last on the dark side of a planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~Admiral\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-05T00:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, probe cores do draw power at all times and then more when running the reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs we are in the mods section, most life support mods include some kind of power drain for crew compartments.\u00A0 They also come with the need to feed kerbals, of course, and often detrimental effects when Kerbals do not have power to run the life support systems, which might not be to your liking.\u00A0 Some of these functions can be turned off.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E in particular can allow you to remove the effects for lack of power, lack of food, lack of habitation time, etc. while you could still run the components to simulate power drain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-05T01:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lab also draws power when it\u0027s in use.\u00A0\u00A0 It\u0027s actually just about the largest stock power usage except for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to life support mods, there is also a mod out there that adds a small power drain for internal lighting, but I can\u0027t recall the name of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
