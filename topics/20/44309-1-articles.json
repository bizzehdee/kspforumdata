So i decided to construct a station around Minmus with a geenhouse mod so I could produce fuel there for a rescue attempt, and future long distance flights from there . I built a rescue ship so I could transport fuel from the green house to the rescue ship then take it to the stranded Kerbs on the moon. When I first met up with the station I was able to transport fuel back and forth and even dump it. After some transporting back and forth , trying to figure what fuel was going where. It stopped transfering all together. I have tried reloading the game several times. Both ships have the transfer lasers on them, Everything is in the green on both ships, Cant\u0027even dump fuel. Even tried removing and reinstalling the mod. There are a couple of other mods involved. Be sides the green house. I have a stretchy tank on the station, and the engineer mod is running also. Any ideas ? The Kerbs must be starving by now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobbyroy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robbyroy","CreatedById":80662,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T10:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscovered my problem.
