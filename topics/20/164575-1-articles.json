I did dabble some with 1.x.x but never got around to updating the ReStock CFGs for later than .90.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a link to the last version \u003Ca href=\u0022http://partsbyemc.com/pub/ReStock90.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://partsbyemc.com/pub/ReStock90.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat needs to be added to the CFG files to make them 1.3 ready? The biggest pain was SQUAD changing file paths every release, along with fiddling with node locations on a few parts, which required twiddling the numbers in ReStock CFGs that used those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027d really be nice is for someone with a lot more knowledge of the inner workings of KSP to take over maintenance of ReStock. No coding or compiler etc required, just information and a text editor. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is ReStock? It\u0027s a pack of CFG files that references stock KSP parts and creates new parts by making changes to their size, often not scaling all dimensions the same. It also has parts combined from several stock parts, like the surface mounted 5-way RSC thruster and two sizes of liquid fuel drop tanks. ReStock 90 added even larger parts to fit with the Kerbodyne parts. The ThunderMaximus parts are HUGE, including a modifed version of the single to quad adapter which can mount up to nine engines in two sizes. That one is more than a simple resize. Extra nodes had to be added and their positions adjusted to make the engines fit properly. Unlike other parts packs or mods like TweakScale, ReStock only uses a bit over 100 kilobytes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany parts were added since I adopted ReStock from its originator, PolecatEZ.
