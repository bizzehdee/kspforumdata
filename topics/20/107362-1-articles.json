I know that you can do it with the Alt\u002BF12 menu, but I want something that makes it \u0022legal\u0022 or more aesthetic.\n\nBecause why not? You have an antenna and everything, so why not radio over to the KSC while you are on Minmus/anywhere else and ask if someone wants a plag flanted or surface science?\n\nI may think that there is already a mod for this but sadly I do not know it\u0027s name."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:28:08Z","Content":"It\u0027s still a WIP, but I have just the thing: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116002](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116002)"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:29:34Z","Content":"In response to both above posts... use his mod. I use it and it\u0027s flippin awesome. There were a couple bugs in first release, but nothing major and it seems to be working flawlessly now. It\u0027s listed in CKAN as CapCom. It goes really well with contract window\u002B. The best part of contract window\u002B is that it allows me to group contracts based on mission (So I\u0027ve got all my duna and ike contracts grouped together).\n\nEDIT: Oh, I almost forgot... contract window\u002B also has a \\*way\\* better scrolling mechanism than stock... that thing always gives me headaches.\n\nEDIT2: You know what... just download all his mods... they\u0027re awesome... all of them... seriously.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T17:33:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T07:54:56Z","Content":"Thank you both, this is exactly what I searched for.
