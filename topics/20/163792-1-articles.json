Instead, they all add planets of their own (some of which have many moons).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some rarer cases, there are packs which completely change up the positioning of the stock planets and moons, sometimes even making planets into moons and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of a good stock-compatible planet expansion, try Outer Planets Mod.
