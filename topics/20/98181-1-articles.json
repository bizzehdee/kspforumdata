KW already has sized IS fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@RainDreamer - Y\u0027know you don\u0027t need to have two fairing bases to make an interstage right? Just use the interstage base, attatch a decoupler to the base node then your craft to that. Then your free to do whatever you want with the fairing setup around your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if it\u0027s just a simple interstage you need you can enable clipping, then place the top node of the base ( the only node that decouples other then the fairing nodes ) on the same node your engine is attatched to on the fuel tank. ( beware: you MUST jump the tank to the engine with a fuel line before placing the interstage fairing because it will kill crossfeed. ) Set your sizes, place the fairings and your done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T18:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T18:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SmashBrown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SmashBrown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI tried procedural, but i thought kw looked prettier.... hmmm\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are indeed prettier, but don\u0027t function as you need.
