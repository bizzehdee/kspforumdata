I think I can get this to work on what I want to do. To give you an example of what Im wanting to do, with Waylands Eagle ship the MK 3 main engine is really off center and with RCS balancer you can center it with the offset tool. But I want to know by how MUCH I have to offset so I can save the change permanently to the CFG. With this I can tweak the node, see how much the balance has changed, then tweak again with-ought having to reload the database over and over again like I have been. Thanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
