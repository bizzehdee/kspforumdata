Unfortunately, the new version does not seem to fix the stability problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, this is a pretty massive gameplay issue; the only designs where the 6.25m shield is currently any use are extremely unrealistic ones (shields on both ends of the craft, delta-wings 20 meters behind the craft, ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost ships (such as the normal command pods) have two stable orientations, prograde and retrograde, with at least a 5 degree AOA stability range (i.e., as long as I keep the AOA lower than 5 degrees, it automatically rotates back to the stable position). None of my realistic 6.25m ships had _any_ stability range whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, the slightly conic shape of the 6.25m shield should cause a certain pitch and yaw stability, just as it works with all the command pods and other shields.
