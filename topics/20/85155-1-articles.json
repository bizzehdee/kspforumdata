It causes the capsule to spin around too much. I do have the KSPX LES and that works great, but it almost seem to be a waste to have a stock part useless. At this point the stock LES is almost cosmetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to edit some parameters like amount of solid fuel to try not to have the LES spin over and around so much when I activate the Abort button. I also tried to edit the thrust amount, but no go. With some LES these two tweaks can make most LES that don\u0027t work right function good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to know if anyone has tweaked around with the stock LES and got it somewhat functional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"therealcrow999","CreatedById":19331,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T19:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess there is no fix for this part, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
