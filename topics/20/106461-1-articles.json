Cant\u0027 even rememeber last time I played.\n\nWell, to the point, I read an article about a theorized and tested EM Drive that uses electromagnetic resonance to push the qunatum vaccum away from the craft and generate thrust. Simply put, it\u0027s an engine that generates thrust without fuel, only electricity, and it generates way more thrust than an ion engine, might have read the article wrong, but in it, they specified about 0.4N/10KW. How awesome it would be to launch a probe and have it maneuver using only electricity! on the article they also mention RCS thrusters using the technology so no longer you\u0027ll need Mono thanks on your probes, just put a massive solar panel and you\u0027re fine:cool:.\n\nAs we know kerbals love to innovate.\n\nHere\u0027s the [article](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/).\n\nThanks, let\u0027s hope my rockets still work:D"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:27:15Z","Content":"Meh.

One is used as a lift engine for a launch vehicle, another as an orbital engine for the launcher, and a third as the main engine for an interstellar probe.\n\nThe engines are based on YBCO superconducting cavities, and performance is predicted on the basis of the test data obtained in earlier experimental programmes.\n\nThe Q values range from 8 x 10^7 to 2 x 10^8 and provide high specific thrusts over a range of accelerations from 0.4 m/s^2 to 6 m/s^2.\n\nThe launch vehicle is an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Call-electric\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 single stage to orbit (SSTO) spaceplane, using a 900 MHz, eight cavity, fully gimballed lift engine.\n\nA 1.5 GHz fixed orbital engine provides the horizontal velocity component.\n\nBoth engines use total loss liquid hydrogen cooling.\n\nElectrical power is provided by fuel cells, fed with gaseous hydrogen from the cooling system and liquid oxygen.\n\nA 2 Tonne payload, externally mounted, can be flown to Low Earth Orbit in a time of 27 minutes.\n\nThe total launch mass is 10 Tonnes, with an airframe styled on the X37B, which allows aerobraking and a glide approach and landing.\n\nThe full potential of EmDrive propulsion for deep space missions is illustrated by the performance of the interstellar probe.\n\nA multi-cavity, fixed 500 MHz engine is cooled by a closed cycle liquid nitrogen system.\n\nThe refrigeration is carried out in a two stage reverse Brayton Cycle. Electrical power is provided by a 200 kWe nuclear generator.\n\nThe 9 Tonne spacecraft, which includes a 1 Tonne science payload, will achieve a terminal velocity of 0.67c and cover a distance of 4 light years, over the 10 year propulsion period.\n\nThe work reported in this paper has resulted in design studies for two Demonstrator spacecraft.\n\nThe launcher will demonstrate the long-sought-for, low cost access to space, and also meet the mission requirements of the proposed DARPA XS-1 Spaceplane.\n\nThe probe will enable the dream of an interstellar mission to be achieved within the next 20 years."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T10:22:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3-5-2015 at 10:17 PM, Nansuchao said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can find one in the Interstellar Mod.
