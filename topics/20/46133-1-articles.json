Really that would be the first step before we consider having realistic sized planets. But even then, you\u0027d have a really hard time playing without resizing every part to have sane amounts of delta V, and bigger parts = more wobble. Think NovaPunch 5m. Would not recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cartz","CreatedById":73435,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T18:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair chris, its more about tweaking the engines to have sane amounts of dV, and tweaking the fuel tanks to carry reasonable amounts of fuel compared to their dry mass. The parts don\u0027t need to be any bigger, they just need to be more realistically configured. The biggest challenge imo is better drag modelling... With planets being so much bigger, and aerobraking having so much more atmosphere available to it, the flaws in the drag model will become much more apparent. I do hope that someday somebody does this so that we can get an idea of what the scale of spaceflight is really like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T18:55:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t imagine you could resize the textures.
