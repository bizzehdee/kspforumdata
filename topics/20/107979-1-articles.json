It\u0027s not a 1:1 TKS, but it can be argued that it\u0027s more in the spirit of the stock game than even HGR\u0027s and Tantares\u0027 \u0022Kerbalized\u0022 crafts.\n\nYou are correct however, it is not updated yet.\n\nI\u0027ll leave a [link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542-90-SXT-Lack-s-Stock-Extension-N-1-and-Aero-update-SXT-20-15FEV15-KSC-v3) in case anyone reading the thread is interested in the mod. \n\n![MMVCXnJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/MMVCXnJ.png)"}]}
