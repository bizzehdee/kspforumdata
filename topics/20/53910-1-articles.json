These will generally happen on scene switch, but may also happen randomly. They\u0027ll only happen if you have a very low amount of RAM, or you have a lot of mods installed, though. So here\u0027s my tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Post your system specifications in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Install texture reduction packs for mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManually resize textures to a lwer resolution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelete the parts that you don\u0027t use a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand/or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eset your texture quality to half res in the settings menu, and reload the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the half-res feature should allow you to not crash when using a lot of mods. Won\u0027t work if you\u0027re already at half res or below, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also try this mod, which reduces memory load by a nice amount without affecting texture quality: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-22-Release-1-Active-Memory-Reduction-Mod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-22-Release-1-Active-Memory-Reduction-Mod\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you shouldn\u0027t post this thread in Gameplay Questions, as it\u0027s not a question about gameplay. This thread should be posted in Addon Support. Can we get a mod to move it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and it almost sounds like you\u0027re blaming Squad for your problems. Don\u0027t. They\u0027re not responsible for how the game works with mods. Oh, and a list of mods that you have installed would also help us.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"griffin247","CreatedById":58122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T18:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for yur comments will look into ur surgestions . and no i not blame anyone for my woes other than my silly self\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T18:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022griffin247\u0022 data-cite=\u0022griffin247\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethank you for yur comments will look into ur surgestions . and no i not blame anyone for my woes other than my silly self\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, alright.
