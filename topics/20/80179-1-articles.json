In space, especially, I sometimes have to right-click a half-dozen things to get the right-click menu (or to dismiss it). I thought 24.2 was supposed to address this, but it remains an annoying issue for me. Do others see this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed right clicking was a bit .. dicey, in the 64-bit version. Re-orienting the camera and clicking on a slightly different area of the part seemed to help that a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mister Spock\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mister Spock\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy other concern is stuttering -- I get a stutter every 15 seconds or so. Is this what people mean when they speak of lag? I sure hope it doesn\u0027t get worse as I build bigger ships and bases.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that too - even on 32-bit version, and also in historical versions of KSP, and it does seem to be caused by a big save. I also find the longer I\u0027m playing in a single session, the worse it gets. Exiting and starting again seems to help a bit, but doesn\u0027t cure it entirely...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyseman76","CreatedById":67018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T03:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI definitely have a crash or two and actually they have been on start up or from a large part count object collisions, I.E. me crashing literally. I have been able to play through quite a few sessions without crashing though so I am pretty happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the right click, I play in a windowed mode due to having a multi-monitor setup and find that it is not as pronounced as when in fullscreen but couldn\u0027t even begin to guess why. I do of course have to deal with the mouse button issue when switching to an outside window, but the work around of right clicking first is a small price I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not had any stuttering in my current build but I have had issues with it in the past even on 32 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an interesting side note my brother stopped by today and I put my entire mod collection onto a portable drive for him and he dumped it into his install and said things have been working so far. I figured none of the mod authors would mind a little direct family sharing ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
