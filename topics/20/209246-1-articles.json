I downloaded Burn Together mod from\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/BurnTogether/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/BurnTogether/releases\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0this link today (I am new to ksp and i could not find an other link).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI placed 2 stock planes (dove) on the runway and made leader 1st and follower 2nd.\u00A0 Everything was okay until 20m/s when planes pass ~20m/s follower plane started to wobbling left and right. I could take of that follower plane at second try but it was still wobbling in the air and it couldn\u0027t catch up me. I tried to change some values over burn together module but nothing changed (I could not figure out what damping is and what it does). I maxed out damping but it is too slow to keep up with me. Is this a bug or mod is trash? Can anybody help me please ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using 1.12.0.3140 version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mods i got that i thought Burn Together might need (maybe not) : Physics Range Extender, Firespitter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-08T08:00:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2022 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by nOtelite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hoozemans","CreatedById":198643,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-22T06:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking for something like this myself. BurnTogether appears to have been discontinued, last updated for KSP v1.4.
