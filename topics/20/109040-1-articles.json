Honestly i don\u0027t know if those numbers are available while that window is not visible\n\nWould be nice if it could show other similar instruments - pressure (redundant, as its just under altimeter, i know), gravity scan and seismic. But those are not that useful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAwesome bonus would be if it could highlight relevant thermometer on mouse hover\n\nI searched on curse and forums without any luck finding something that could do just that, if you know about any, please let me know. I even started looking into writing it myself, but lack of free time to even play games makes it difficult ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:30:42Z","Content":"I think NanoGauges has most of these?"},{"CreatedByName":"skipped1","CreatedById":103547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:27:24Z","Content":"Very nice mod, but i have issue with it:\n\nTemp worked only until i jettisoned few sensors, after that temp gauge stayed offline (red rectangle in top part of gauge) like it was missing temp sensors, even if i still had few other thermometers left.
