As it hasn\u0027t been released yet, I am still planning at this stage. I am currently drawing up all of the D/V values I will need to pull this off, and I have hit a wall. I have all of the numbers for the transfers and propulsive braking, and I know exactly how much of everything I need, except for two of the most crucial components, the Cargo Lander and the Habitat Lander. They will be transferred to Duna in the exact same way as the DTV-Capricorn (My Copernicus MTV replica), so no problems there. The problem comes it when I need to land these completely under their own power, and I don\u0027t know how much D/V it will take to do a completely propulsive landing on Duna (The drogues would auto cut, but I will probably leave them off, as Realchutes could really disrupt MJ\u0027s accuracy on landing.)

Oh well, I guess I will basically just have to make sure that it has ~700m/s then, as 1500 is definitely way too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
