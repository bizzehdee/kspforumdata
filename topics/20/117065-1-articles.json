It is pretty old, from before 1.x, but there the user attaches a winch to a moving arm, and with the winch he picks up a docking port, proceeding to dock several different things with that. Is it still possible to do that?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:29:05Z","Content":"KSP has a facebook page?\n\nAnyways if you\u0027re talking about\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tp6yj2k0Fpc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n then there\u0027s a part that mentions something very important:\n![YF8JASNl.png](http://i.imgur.com/YF8JASNl.png)\n\nThe docking port is not actually attached to the winch, so they\u0027re two separate vessels.

With this in mind I build a mobile gantry using a docking port to pick things up. The docking port was connected to the root and the IR parts connected the root/docking port to the body of the vehicle - been using it for a while without incident (of course now that I\u0027ve said something its going to blow up)."},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T02:27:23Z","Content":"So, whatever i build should be fine as long as the docking port connected to the IR part i actually the root of my vessel?"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T02:44:21Z","Content":"As I understand it - would be a good idea to do in a test game or make plenty of backups! \n\nJust want to reiterate - After hearing this from a source of unknown credibility I tried it and, to date, haven\u0027t had problems.
