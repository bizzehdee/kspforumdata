I saw that exactly once during ksp loading after i had installed a bunch of mods. It also said that it can be toggled on or off in the settings. The message was a standard ksp message and the text was orange. Any idea what mod this is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-28T09:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003Equick load?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Kerbalisation Tech","CreatedById":211297,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-28T10:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this mod also has an option for it:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022163039\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9593809121\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
