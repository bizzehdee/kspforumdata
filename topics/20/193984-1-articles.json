Maybe just an effect module that makes the part\u2019s texture darker when exposed to a certain temperature, with more heat making it even darker,\u00A0would do for a simple effect rather than actual burn marks and streaks of soot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remember correctly, the KV pods from Making History have some form of blackening after re-entry but I suspect they\u2019re a one-off.
