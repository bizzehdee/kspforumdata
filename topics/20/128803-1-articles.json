The most fuel load I\u00A0got to was 900 unit of \u00A0LQ fuel. So the range was just over the western hills from KSC (200km ?). \u00A0So, I\u00A0was thinking I need a deployable forward air base to land and re-fuel. Some thing like a land based aircraft carrier, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- needs to be relocate able to selected LAT/LONG and on the ground at ground level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- needs to auto load fuel\u00A0for the landed craft. not, a miner type of thing, and perhaps not a docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-not to big, say an 8x8m square with a H on it. May be a redone SpaceX landing platform??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to make one using the relocation gadget that says it will place you on the beach from the SPH. this keeps exploding on me, can not get the height right...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any thoughts welcome.
