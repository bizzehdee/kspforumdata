I have put the mesh where i wanted (collision mesh) in Blender, but when i want to put it on my rocket, the node (collision mesh), is the opposite way (one node is inside the part, on top and the other node is at the bottom in the exterior of the part and i can use only the bottom node). And if i put it on my command pod mk1, i cannot remove it from my rocket anymore and/or put it back in the inventory. This is the problem, the part link being below (LaikaTestCube).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Add tag means rename the object you are making in Blender ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do you use diffuse, specular and shading in Blender, or only one of them can only be use for KSP ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Do you use only material textures and i should not use world and brush textures (this two i don\\\u0027t know what they are for)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The collision mesh should be half buried (joined) with the main mesh (your build model) or not ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When i rename to node_collider, i rename only one time or second time (when you click your mesh, you can rename it a second time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The .cfg of you part of KSP is not automatically done from Blender or it must be done manually ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy part :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://depositfiles.com/files/i113ar02p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://depositfiles.com/files/i113ar02p\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
