Its just plain painful -- obviously not because its hard, but its just silly clicking and repetition. Doesn\u0027t even need a clever ship design, just repetition. I also don\u0027t want to just full-on cheat the science into my save; I want to know that I have actually collected each piece of silly biome science.\n\nI would love to have something to automate this. I\u0027m not familiar enough with the API to know the possible/best ways to accomplish it... maybe just add \u0022player has collected and returned 6 surface samples from KSC runway\u0022 to the current game, maybe add a part that will collect a sample of each applicable experiment (trivial biome, unlocked, not maxed).\n\nYes, its still cheating, but it would be great for just the really trivial science -- only biomes that can be walked to (without climbing! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)), only experiments that have been unlocked. No measuring gravity at science level 0, no VAB rooftop science without landing on it, no command pod 1 memorial biome until the VAB is upgraded.\n\nI don\u0027t think much is added to the game by driving a silly rover around KSC for two hours, clicking on parts dozens of times to collect data and reset; but yet, the science is \\_there\\_, and I am but a moth to the flame."},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:15:38Z","Content":"Like this? \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106004](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106004)"},{"CreatedByName":"stampy","CreatedById":142278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:33:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Like this? \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106004](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106004)\n\nInteresting!
