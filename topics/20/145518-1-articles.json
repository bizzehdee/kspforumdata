Is it possible to download the maps somewhere (or can anybody give them to me) and somehow put them into the mod folder so that I can start out with all maps loaded?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T19:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time I looked the data (or at least part of it) was stored in the save file so adding it to a game would require editing it into the persistence file. Actually just replacing the entire SCANcontroller scenario (in the save file) may be the easiest way - highly recommend backing the file up before hand. An alternate way to get this (scenario data) would be to start another game, hyperedit a scansatt probe into orbit of each body and time warp.
