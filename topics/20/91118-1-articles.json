This idea can be used by anyone, although a shout out to me would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Idea is simple, and kinda crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals have had a population boom! Help them by launching rockets that hold subjects...er...kerbals!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicly, Parts that hold kerbals cost money, but when launched with kerbals they cost negative money (AKA they give you money). Recovering a kerbals costs money(AKA you lose money) because (supposively) you have to build them/find them a house (or something like that:confused:).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a ship consisting of full hitchhiker cans, it costs negative money, and you get money. This mod would be intended to be used with TAC (or Snacks, or another life support mod) so that this would only be useful to get just a little bit more money for that Jool Mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading this, and I hope you get inspired!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
