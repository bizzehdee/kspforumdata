Maybe someone can help me with these...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) If I remember correctly, a few days ago or so I saw a mod-thread about an addon that allows to enforce connection of parts in the VAB/SPH only at the connection node markers. I am working on stuff within an internal cargo bay and its a pain that subassemblies and parts want to randomly connect at every random spot on the walls etc. I tried to find said mod again but I am unable to. Maybe someone knows what I mean... if I havent completly misread it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Anyone know of a mod that more or less allows what Kerbal Attachement System (since it it seems like its not working with 0.24 W64bit) did with pipes and / or strut connection in space? I dont need winches, cranes and whatnot. I enjoy building larger vessels in space and / or surface bases and just need something to connect modules and / or sturdy docking connections. I looked at quantum struts, but not really happy with it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could help, that would be greatly appreaciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this thread belongs here or in the Add-on requests and support section.
