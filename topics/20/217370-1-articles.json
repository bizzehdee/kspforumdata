Other options include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear Future Aeronautics has larger rapier-like dual mode engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMk2 and Mk3 Stockalike Expansion (2 mods by same author) offer engines plus additional fuselage parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOPT is a large mod (technically 3 mods) with new powerful engines. It also has several new fuselage profiles for spaceplanes. It\u0027s the least stockalike of the mods I mentioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-25T16:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second Near Future Aeronautics. Lots of good stuff in there. Mk2/Mk3 expansion is also quite nice, though the engines are largely that form factor so I don\u0027t find myself using them quite as much. OPT mod is amazing.. It offers a bunch of new form factors and a huge variety of parts. One of my favorite spaceplane/airplane mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have it, B9 Aerospace Procedural Wings is a must have for reducing parts. Any sized wings in just 1 piece. On my planes I would say it normally reduces my part count by around 5\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Aircraft Expansion (KAX) adds a lot of stockalike parts and a fair few engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never used it but Airplanes Plus is a popular mod that adds a lot of stuff as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
