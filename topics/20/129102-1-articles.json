Those must be a standard things to do, where\u0027s the best place to find out how to do things like that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I want to do initially is be able to get the\u00A0current list of contracts and be able to create a new custom contract and add it to the list of active contracts. I can\u0027t see anything about interacting with contracts in the above docs. \u00A0I want to be able to change tourism contracts so any info on how to work with the contract system would be helpful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T11:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0seems to be a contract configuration expert, and I know \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69310-inigma/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269310\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69310-inigma/\u0022\u003E@inigma\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0has also been doing some contract work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-105-contract-configurator-v191-2015-12-15/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022\u003ECheck this thread out\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T14:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never did a mod until cc.
