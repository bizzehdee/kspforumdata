As a software engineer myself and experienced with C# I always thought about developing a mod myself, but I never had a good idea what to do. Here I\u0027d like to propose one I had recently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a spaceplane that I flew several times already and that has proven very reliable over time. With the unlocking of new parts or the detecting of flaws in the original design that came up in certain scenarios I updated the original design a few times and then had to apply the same changes to all my cargo and passenger variants, littering my craft-catalog with many versions of variants of the same craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought something like \u0022I would love to have git to propagate my changes to my base vehicle to the derived ones\u0022 and came up with the following plan:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery saved craft get\u0027s a version number attached to it. Whenever a craft gets changed in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and saved again, you can create either a new version of the craft or create a derived craft (like one with additional fuel tanks / passenger modules ...). Derived vessels would point to their base vessels including the version they\u0027re based on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Old* versions of a craft get hidden in the vessel catalog, so they don\u0027t litter everything up. Derived vessels could get in an collapsible indented list underneath their base vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce a base vessel gets updated (so, a new craft-file with higher version number gets stored than the version a derived vessel is based upon) the derived vessel can be *rebased* and a new version of the derived vessel gets stored.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessels in KSP are trees, starting from a root node (the root part), with all the connected parts as child-nodes. It should be easy to comprise a diff between two versions of a vessel and apply that to a derived vessel. Possible conflicts would arise if in the base vessel something got attached where also the derived vessel attached something. Those conflicts would need to be manually resolved by the player, choosing either of the variants and/or fixing manually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think of that idea? Would you consider it useful to have or am I the only one building five generations of the same ship, improving it every time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-16T17:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2016 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Khazuar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T00:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re far from the only one building generations of and splitting sub-families from the same ship. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a very nice idea, and something a lot of the community will want, including myself, once they know it\u0027s out there.
