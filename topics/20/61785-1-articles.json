You have vacuum engines, first-stage engines, high-thrust, high-efficiency, dual-nozzle, tall, short, nuclear, fusion, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince there are mods to introduce extra realism elements to the design process (life support, heat management, communication, safe reentry, aerodynamics, etc), why not create a mod for designing engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand, it would allow the vast amount of available engines to be relegated to a \u0022Preset\u0022 list, freeing up the propulsion tab. It would also allow designers to make engines with just enough thrust, and most efficient at the altitude they are likely to be used at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, designing engines is REALLY COMPLEX. How deep do you go? Do you restrict the choices to big things like style and number of turbopumps, cooling cycle design, nozzle vs aerospike, and number of combustion chambers? Do you have a range of values for nozzle angles and sizes; fuel flow rates; valve reliability (tradeoff between failure rate and mass)? Then there\u0027s fuel choice, and fuel tank management. Choosing a gas for pressure-fed engines, not to mention arranging the geometry of parts for optimal heat release. Engine design involves fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, and material science. Would a mod ever be able to do it justice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkimming over the nitty gritty details of how such a mod would be implemented in the current game, is this what people are interested in?

Existing engine parts will be nozzles only and determine only the exit area, gimbal range, and cooling method (regenerative, ablative, radiative). Valves, turbines, pumps, and manifolds will be independent parts. Any part, including tanks, will receive arbitrary resources, and contents will change phase or combust as appropriate. Direction and rate of flow depends on the pressure gradient. Since each tank is a single space, separate tanks will be needed for each resource.
