The complaint is from users asking modders to help with the organization, distribution, and just a better system to maintain so many mods. Things can no doubt be better in that department and will continue to get worse as time goes on. As it is now and will continue to be, no benefit to the authors doing so because this is strictly a request from users. Like a UI improvement that people may complain about, or a feature that may be requested. It is a little extra work from the author, but its to help the overall user experience. Im entirely grateful for the work authors do, and continued amazement at what they can do, so please dont think Im being ungrateful. But nothing can, or will be done with people being stubborn and complacent. Users need and want a better system and this is entirely a user requested thing. With the \u0022you need to benefit the modders\u0027 attitude, yea nothing will happen because this isnt about benefiting them, its about creating a better overal experience for the people wanting to use their stuff.
