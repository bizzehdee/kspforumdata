It used solar panels as \u0027blinds\u0027 for the glass panels mod and I put a little makeshift conference table in the middle. Unfortunately, it had no functional purpose in the game beyond that of an elaborate dollhouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had an idea for something that starts by way of making the recruitment of Kerbals in Career Mode a bit more interactive (and thus save some cash, if you put the work in). It revolves around the placement of such structures (i.e. a collection of all your everyday / modded parts you put together in the SPH/VAB as normal, but that don\u0027t have wheels or engines and aren\u0027t moving) in each Biome (due to Kerbin et. al. not having actual \u0027countries\u0027 for them to be situated in). This will enable you, perhaps through the use of a few custom parts like a \u0027workstation\u0027 or somesuch, to build up some kind of reputation with the Biome that will make recruitment cheaper. Bigger (i.e. more parts, more costly) structures would enhance this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to make Courage and Stupidity count in more ways. Perhaps by having easily-scared Kerbals temporarily revert to tourists when subjected to certain G-Forces, speeds or distance from home a-la the USI Life Support mod. Stupid ones could cause other Kerbals to quit by starting trouble, or harm your rep / finances for some reason. A another certain blend could make one ideal for running one of these \u0027offices\u0027. Each game could randomize the likelehood of each Biome producing Kerbals with a particular stat balance. I could even look into the feasibility of making additional stats that aren\u0027t currently present. I haven\u0027t looked into it sufficiently, but I\u0027d also like your efforts to affect things like the price of fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m seeking is feedback on the current idea (would you play it? How would you tweak it to make it better?) and some inspiration for bringing something that will extend the fun into the infinite endgame. I\u0027d like a reason for these structures to exist on other planets and moons. Bases are currently useful as staging areas / pit stops and need attention if you have a life support mod, but what other reason could they have for existing and requiring a visit every now and then - what consequences could not meeting that need have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d appreciate any input you might have. Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
