And no, contract configurator is not the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really want to play career mode but spend 2 hours trying to find a hand full of coherent contracts by spamming \u0022decline\u0022 until\u00A0something useful pops up!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I start with a \u0022plant flag on mun\u0022 for example.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen cycle through some nonsense missions test solid fuel booster in orbit around X.. or test jet engine splashed down.. please someone put some intelligence into the RNG!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have selected a plant flag on mun mission offer me tests that involve the MUN!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso allow me to do multiple tests on the same part, I am not going to take 3 different engines there am I ?! So allow me to test engine X in sub-orbit, orbit and surface of mun for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to go to the mission control building. Pick a mission on offer and tweak it. Don\u0027t like the part? Change it. Don\u0027t like the location? Change it. Don\u0027t like the altitude of the orbit? Change it.. etc. Rather than having to decline missions repeatedly for 30 mins till i get a mission for the part i want in a location I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy latest discovery \u0022test fairing X on launch pad\u0022.

I had thought that you wanted better logic for contracts which Contract Configurator could provide as long as someone made a contract pack with better logic. However, it seems your actual goal is instead of having any kind of contract, you actually want to define your own missions and tasks and then get paid to complete them. Honestly, you may consider playing in Science mode instead of Career as that would remove the money requirement while still being progressive, then you could just assign tasks to each of your missions as you saw fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of a contract is that is some outside organization wants you to do something, and then you either solely accomplish that or design your missions around that in order to complete it along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are keen on simply defining your own list of things to do outright, then it sounds like what Squad is working on for Making History will accomplish that as they will release a mission editor along the Missions game mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corinthas","CreatedById":183616,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-18T15:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had a look at what squad are proposing\u00A0but I suspect it won\u0027t do what I want.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShame really because a chill game like that should not have me rage quitting.
