And KSP updates, and changes properties of that antenna, let\u0027s say reduced energy drain.\n\nWhat happens ?\n\nDoes the part on the craft stay the same, but every other craft launched with that part after the update uses the updated part ?\n\nDoes the part on the craft update nicely (energy drain changes, nothing else messes up) ?\n\nDoes the part on the craft revert to the stock updated part, losing it\u0027s RemoteTech properties ?\n\nDoes the part on the craft become corrupted ?\n\nHow are active crafts saved ? \n\nEach craft is a tree of references to parts (commandModule1 connected to largeSASModule connected to ... etc)\n\nEach craft is a tree of part definitions (commandModule { energyDrain : 0.2; energyCapacity: 10; ... } conncted to ... etc)\n\nIf I have no active crafts, and I\u0027m in a sandbox game, so I don\u0027t need to worry about science tree / contracts, is there anything that can break with a mod/KSP update ? (i.e start sandbox, fly to Mun, plant a flag on the Mun, return to Kerbin, recover vessel)\n\nIn other words, is there any data in a save other than crafts/kerbals/debris/flags/date that could be broken ? (an example would be Dwarf Fortress, each \u0022save\u0022, aka world, has it\u0027s own copy of the game data, or Skyrim, which has a lot of script data in save games)\n\nI\u0027dd like to understand this as to be able to make decisions as to whether keep my save or start a new one when KSP/mods update.\n\nKind of sucks when I\u0027m done setting up a RemoteTech satellite network, picked a spot on the Mimnus for a base, and bam, update. Do I need to start over ?\n\nPS: I realize that I probably would have needed a new save game for 0.90 -\u003E 1.0, it\u0027s a major update, but do I need a new save for 1.0 -\u003E 1.0.1 ? 1.0.1 -\u003E 1.1 ?"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:12:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I realize that I probably would have needed a new save game for 0.90 -\u003E 1.0, it\u0027s a major update, but do I need a new save for 1.0 -\u003E 1.0.1 ? 1.0.1 -\u003E 1.1 ?\n\nin my opinion the both devs (SQUAD and Mods) should not brake any game after 1.0.

Whatever a part\u0027s stats are when the game finishing loading, that\u0027s what stats it will have always, either on new vessels or on saved vessels, except\n\n2. Any data marked persistent will be kept on parts, for example resource quantities (so if you change a part\u0027s amount and maxAmount of a resource, that won\u0027t change any of that part in ships in your save or in .craft files).\n\n3. The same applies to module data: any data that isn\u0027t persistent will use the new values (and any removed modules will be gone, and any new modules will be added), but any persistent data will be loaded from sfs/craft, except\n\n4. If a module changes name (i.e. old antenna module to RT2 antenna module) the old info is lost and the new info is entirely default, so e.g. antennas may return to being not-extended."}]}
