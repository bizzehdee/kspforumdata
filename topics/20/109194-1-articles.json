There\u0027s something that will always be cool about driving across the Duna flats with nothing in front of you but sand.\n\nI want to ride in something cool though. Ideally I\u0027d like to fly a duna mission, unpack a rover, build it and then drive it, but I\u0027d settle for someone modelling this thing and I can take a crack at coding it myself. (I know nothing about modelling and just a little bit about coding).\n\nI had 2 concepts that I\u0027ve found for rover design that seem like they\u0027d be cool. \n\nThe first is a short-range rover, 2 or 3 person, 6 wheeled (though it could work with just 4) with a small trunk in the rear.\n\n![N7EZ8oq.png](http://i.imgur.com/N7EZ8oq.png)\n\n![EWOqri8.png](http://i.imgur.com/EWOqri8.png)\n\nThe second design is a little larger. 3 or 4 kerbals with a sealed bubble to use as a cockpit. This would be a long-duration rover for over-night expeditions. I\u0027m thinking we put a flatbed in the back for hauling samples and/or equipment.\n\n![EmQshIk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EmQshIk.jpg)\n\nNow, for a little extra fun:\n\nI also really want to recreate this concept art, so I\u0027d love for someone to take a crack at a motorcycle.\n\n![PPUxaMS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PPUxaMS.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve got ideas for how these can all work in my head, but I don\u0027t have the technical expertise with the modelling programs KSP uses in order to do them properly.\n\nAny modders out there up to the task?"}]}
