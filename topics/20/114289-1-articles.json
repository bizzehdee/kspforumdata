So far I\u0027ve been playing KSP completely vanilla. While I certainly havent done everything there is to do, I feel I\u0027ve gotten a good idea of what stock can give me (Built a minimus refinery, several trips to EVE and Duna, One trip to Jool and its moons). I\u0027ve learned to play the game completely without aid (no mechjeb help, minor help from guides), so I think I\u0027m ready to start with some mods. I\u0027ve looked into some mods and put together a (long) list of potential mods I thought would be cool / useful. Having some suggestions on which are good, which arent, which are out of date, and which I\u0027ve forgotten would be great!

My understanding is that they give you pretty much the same information. Mechjeb if you want the autopilots, KER if you don\u0027t. I use KER my own self but I\u0027ve always said I\u0027d install Mechjeb if I ever successfully takeoff to orbit from the surface of Eve...\n\nPretty solid list otherwise, provided you\u0027ve got a box that can handle all that at once. As far as FAR is concerned, there are sufficient differences between it and stock aero to make it worth your while (I use FAR myself but I\u0027ve played around in 1.0.x aero). FAR is still far and away more realistic. The stability analyses alone make it a nice mod to have, especially if you\u0027ve got plans to become a serious spaceplane jockey. Others I might recommend if that\u0027s the case are Kerbal Flight Data, NavUtilities and Dynamic Deflections. StageRecovery and Procedural Fairings are also a couple of nice ones to have - the latter especially."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T21:15:44Z","Content":"TL;DR: Get CKAN and take it slowly\n\nYou know how they say for a new player it\u0027s better to start with career mode instead of sandbox because you can easily be overwhelmed by the amount of parts, so having them unlock gradually helps new players discover the parts and what to do with each, etc. I would say the same applies for mods. I recommend you start with a set of essential mods, and then once you\u0027ve learned how to use them and what they do, start transitioning to other things. Also, it really sucks to install a bunch of mods, only to have your game bug out and then having to guess which mod is doing it, or having to uninstall and reinstall them one by one. Better to add them gradually. Especially for mods like Kerbal Attachment System, Infernal robotics, or the large parts packs. These should in my opinion by installed 1 by 1, getting to know each before moving on.\n\nMy list of actually essential mods:\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nMech Jeb\n\n... That\u0027s it. Play around with only these and when you\u0027ve seen what they\u0027re capable of, then move to a next set of mods, and so forth. I would go for:\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nHyperedit\n\nCrowd Sourced Science (if you do career)\n\nDistant Object Enhancement\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator / Navball Docking Alignment Indicator\n\nNav Hud (mostly useful for flying planes)\n\nHaystack\n\nTrajectories\n\nRCS Build Aid\n\nAfter that, I\u0027d go for KAS or IR. After that I guess it\u0027s a matter of personal taste.\n\nThen you have the visual mods, such as EVE and Astronomer\u0027s packs. These fall into a different category. Basically, if you have a powerful PC that can handle them, there\u0027s no reason to not have them. I don\u0027t because it seriously lags me up. \n\nOh and I almost forgot, do yourself a favor and get all mods through CKAN, thiss will make your life much, much easier.\n\nFinally, my critique of your list:\n\nUtility\n\nCKAN (Mod manager) - Essential\n\nMechjeb - Essential\n\nEditor Extensions - No idea what this does\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - Essential\n\nContract window \u002B - I don\u0027t find the need for this, matter of taste and only relevant for career\n\nDocking alignment indicator - I have the Navball one\n\nTAC Fuel Transfer - Not necessary, can do with stock tools IMHO\n\nStock Fuel Switch - Haven\u0027t seen this one\n\nPrecise Node - Unnecessary, Mechjeb has this\n\nTrajectories - Very useful\n\nRCS Build Aid - Very Useful\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - Essential\n\nActive Texture management (if needed) - \u0022If needed\u0022\n\nToolbar (for organizing mods) - I avoid it. I also have the Quick Hide mod that allows you to collapse the stock app bar so it\u0027s not in your way, and I prefer to have my mods here\n\nHyperEdit (for testing craft) - Very useful\n\nOther\n\nKAS / KIS - Take them one at a time, opens up a whole new dimension to the game\n\nChatterer - Nice to have\n\nQuantum Struts (needed with KAS?) - Use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement and say goodbye to struts forever\n\nFAR (needed with new aero model?) - I prefer stock\n\nPlanet Shine / Hot rockets / Better atmospheres - All very cool, they lag me up so I don\u0027t use them\n\nKSP Interstellar - It also adds a whole new dimension to the game. Take this one slowly. \n\nNear Future Tech - Same as above, but to a lesser degree\n\nSCANsat - Same as above\n\nInfernal Robotics - Same as with KAS / KIS\n\nScience Station - Same as with NFT / SCANsat\n\nTAC Life Support - Same"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T21:31:56Z","Content":"Thanks for the feedback everyone!
