Then make an engine with no thrust but that uses OX and LFO but has a ModuleAlternator that produces mixedFuel. Give it a storage space for mixed fuel and you would just have to premix the fuel. You could also create the reverse engine that uses mixedFuel and ModuleAlternator outputs OX and LFO so you don\u0027t tie up all the fuel in the RCS thrusters (running on mixedFuel). The downside to this is you would have to premix the fuel and demix the fuel which could get VERY annoying when you are down to 30 of each and you need engines and RCS. The plus side of this is you don\u0027t need mods installed that could cause crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T14:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat if one type of fuel is exhausted while the other one still have some rest? especially if we have different ratios between main engine and RCS port which both use UDMH\u002BN2O4.\u003Cp\u003EI would still lean to the generator way, and i prefer to use something like ResGen plugin so that it will only generate the intermediate resource when it\u0027s not full, thus won\u0027t cause constant wasting of the two propellants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes if you are going to write a specialized RCS Module in MFS that will be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was the whole point of \u0022By inputing the right amount of thrust/ISP for each\u0022.
