I use them, but I also have 2 non RSS/RO Ksp folders where this type of realism is absent.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Real fuel engines are ofcourse real life replicas, not simply by looks, performance and real life operating specifications. They are also a close to realistic simulation of the sound these nozzles create.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like real life sounds in my game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have mods like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50539-kerbal-sound-overhaul-project/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t use that one, but it is as far as I could find any sound overhauling in the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t add realistic engine sounds but does improve the sound quality of KSP in many other areas. Strangely enough the thread got little attention, I\u0027m not even sure if it works in 1.1.2. Maybe I\u0027m one of the few that cares about realistic sounds, and besides that specific mod that still leaves work to be done on realistic engine sounds.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want realistic engine sounds based on stock parts (stock engines)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could just turn down the \u0022spacecraft\u0022 volume button and go to youtube and listen to a real launch in the background. But that defeats the in real time simulation of in game sound and the luxury of having it added in the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENow you might think, realistic sounds for stock engines? Stock engines are unrealistic by default.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can agree to that ofcourse, and then you might think, what is the basis of a realistic sounding stock rocket engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, there isn\u0027t. But given that fact we have to be honest. The stock engine sounds are crap.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHypothesize however that by default squad used more realistic sounding engines. Maybe while we\u0027re at it, also more realistic nozzles. Not necessarily replicas like real fuels introduces but something based on realistic sounds, rockets and engine bells and then what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t that then be the basis on which to work on?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Stock engines are sci-fi, and the sound they produce is that of the very same typical vaccuum cleaner for each and every engine with some small variation in sound pitch/frequency and simulated Db.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn other words, I want a modder who wishes to propose and initiate a sound overhaul for stock engines. The basis of these sounds is real life rocket sounds. And the sounds given to each individual stock engine is based on the stock engines default function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncorporate this new mod to the Toolbar plugin. Or add a menu to the part settings so one can choose between different sounds in the VAB/SPH. Maybe use the Toolbar plugin so one can choose engine sounds before takeoff. Let\u0027s say you have \u0022mainsail\u0022 engine on the first stage then that engine is considered a 1st stage engine because of it\u00B4s specification and the fact it is part of your 1st stage. In this new mod the engine part has settings in the VAB/SPH, and you are limited to a series of sound settings mimicking real life engine sounds of various real life counterparts. This way you may choose between different real life counter parts of traditionally used 1st stage engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you attach a LV-909 let\u0027s say you are limited to real life engine sounds in the part settings for upperstage engines and probably produce little sound anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings me to sound in space, and more specifically, why there is sound in 3rd view on a rocket in space if not well above the dense parts of the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSound should be produced in IVA mode because of the atmosphere in the cockpit. Which also makes me want to suggest to add crackling noises in IVA mode when a engine is running in space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut not in 3rd view mode, no sound at all please. Maybe make it so realistic that sound is produced when you camera angle right behind the rocket exhaust, but not when you pan the camera anywhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs suggested in the last sentence I personally want the simulating perception of sound be perceived based on the camera angle. Where you look is where your microphone is.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd since KSP is a simulation and not a in real life rocket launch I want the effects of sound being produced as if you were watching it being recorded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I want crackles at launch and sound dissipation based on the distance you have zoomed out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStock KSP already simulates the latter, but it doesn\u0027t seem to do it right, but that may be just my interpretation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAnother suggestion unrelated to sound but also to stock engines.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn ksp the engine exhaust flames produce a very bright glowing untransparent white tail. You cannot see the engines unless you throttle them down below 25% thrust. Unless you install real fuels ofcourse and get to work with real life replicas. Yes, I use real fuels and only in combination with RSS. Remember, I want sound and graphical realism in the areas specified for stock, and this won\u0027t be related to gameplay realism.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere also shouldn\u0027t be condensation in space, and in combination with gas expansion the exhaust flames in space should be nearly invisible. The exhaust flames in space for stock however look exactly the same as they do in the atmosphere. As for condensation in the atmosphere, can Environmental visual enhancement introduce persisting condensation trails. Maybe use auto generated contrails based on the EVE cloud textures the dissipate over time in a natural realistic way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably going to be a performance hit. But luckily EVE has a detailed settings menu so you can choose to change the settings or put them on/off at your leisure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unaware of any mod that fixes stock sounds and visuals for engines except for real fuels which is intended for RSS. A mod I don\u0027t intend to use in 1/10 kerbin scale solar system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf a modder is willing to enhance the stock graphical/sound realism in anyway whatsoever I\u0027ll be very happy, and hopefully alot of other players aswell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T10:19:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 10:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T15:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncheck out Real Plume, it makes th exhaust gas more realistic making it expand with the diminishing pressure.
