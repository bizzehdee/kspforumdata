I\u0027d like to have a \u0022custom\u0022 tab generated that has the colony control center, etc, moved from the \u0022utility\u0022 tab to the OSI (mod-generated) tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the option to remove parts added by mods from the default tabs, or just leave them there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I can make these tabs myself within KSP but every time I research something I would have to go through and see what parts were added and go back through. As far as I can tell, I can\u0027t remove parts from the default tabs (there is only the \u002B for adding to new tab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m just lazy. Well, no, I am pretty sure that\u0027s it. But this would be a great mod, if I knew much about modding I would try and make it myself but I have no idea where to start. And it may already exist for all I know! If it does, please point me in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekhad\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T00:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, there\u0027s mods that could interest you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35018\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPartCatalog\u003C/a\u003E (not updated yet for 0.90)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFilter Extensions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106363\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPartManager plugin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92511\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPartArranger\u003C/a\u003E (not updated yet for 0.90)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and one other which can delete parts from a savegame (but I\u0027ve lost his name/links).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khadgarion","CreatedById":135658,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T05:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFilter Extensions is exactly what I was looking for.
