I\u0027m building supersonic planes and the mk 2 cargo bays are kind of ridiculous. I also feel like the hinge position\u00A0is limiting on wing placement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I\u0027m thinking of a mk 2 fuselage with the mk 1 section as a cargo bay with hideaway doors. So many mods have these nice \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E sections with fancy doors but they\u0027re never adapted to cargo bays... Unless I\u0027m just not seeing it. Lots of mk 1, but no mk 2. I have SXT, quiz tech, mk2 stockalike, KAX, etc... Nothing seems to fit the bill. I can\u0027t be the only one who thinks this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
