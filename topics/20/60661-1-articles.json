I have three satellites in synchronous orbit, set to target each other, Mission Control, and the active vessel.

As soon as you reach your destination, contact should be established by targeting the planet/moon from Kerbins satellites and targeting Kerbin from your mothership/com-sat before you initiate any probe activity. The width of the cone of your dish may be a problem here though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
