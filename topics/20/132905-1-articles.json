No CKAN updates are required. Everything that needs to be dealt with is handled on the CKAN end of things. All you have to do is refresh your copy of the metadata, which CKAN does on startup by default.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll you have to do as an end user is wait for all the mod metadatas to update.

It\u0060s better than when Kerbalstuff first stopped although it is not yet finished. One thing it relies on is mod makers rehosting their mods.
