(So all suggested mods must not break visibility and function of the eastereggs.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step is to have a full Solar System, but in Kerbal style while keeping all stock planets. So the most logical way seems to be installing Outer Planets Mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I want everything to look as good as it gets. But Im not sure how to acchive this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe OPM thread suggests Stock Visual Enhancements or Poods OPM Visual Overhaul. This seems a pretty good start, while i can\u0027t really decide which way to go.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso\u00A0Astronomers Visual Pack has configs for OPM. Which makes the decision even harder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, I then saw Parallax, which is a whole new level in many ways. And while there is a mod called \u0022Parallax for OPM\u0022, it seems thats just a patch to have them both installed together without the game crashing, but there seem no Parallax Configs for OPM included. So you end up with a beautiful inner system and have a total break in graphics when you reach the outer planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something for OPM on the Level of Parallax that I am missing or even real parallax configs for OPM?\u00A0 Or any alternate suggestions? Or even another mod to have a full (but Kerbalized (so not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)) solar system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make everything more challenging, it would be great if everything is compatible with Rescale / Sigma Dimensions. But thats no must, my alternative would be nerfing all engine by doubling thier consumption or so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-09-26T13:17:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2023 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Sep 26\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kergarin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xt007","CreatedById":197003,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-26T15:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepends on your rig and personal preference.\u00A0 OPM has a parallax configuration, both astronomers and spectra configs are compatible with OPM.\u00A0 I find spectra easier on the rig and less \u0022cluttered\u0022 imo.\u00A0 Astronomers is really about the eye candy above everything.\u00A0 I\u0027d suggest downloading the whole Spectra suite except 64k clouds, and parallax for opm.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kergarin","CreatedById":153808,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-26T18:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI din\u0027t expect Parallax for OPM to actually change the Outer Planets, since it\u0027s just 2kb in size, but I\u0027ve checked the config files after your post and it really does. But it does so by using textures from existing inner planets. Hale for example is using textures from Gilly. But doesn\u0027t that make them loose thier unique colors an apperance?
