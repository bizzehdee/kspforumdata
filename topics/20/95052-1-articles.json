The problem that I\u0027ve run into is that I can\u0027t exactly remember who is who, and when I get someone out on EVA to fix the wheels, I have to cycle through each Kerbal until I find my experienced Engineer. It is also annoying when I need that quick EVA report and accidently EVA my pilot, thereby killing SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI note that NASA had this same problem: Neil and Buzz had identical uniforms, but starting with Apollo 12 the Commander always had that red stripe around the arm of their space suit so that Houston could tell who was who on the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to have some similar mechanism for our Kerbals. I was thinking that part of the uniform could be a color that corresponds to their expertise. I\u0027m partial to blue for scientists, yellow for engineers, and red for pilots like the scheme in Star Trek: The Next Generation but the precise scheme is less important than them having one at all. If the top half of their uniform is colored, say, then there could be white stripes on the arm corresponding to the number of stars that they have. Or all-white uniforms with colored stripes on the arms for everybody with the number of stripes corresponding to number of stars (noobies might not yet merit different uniforms, say). But something to help me tell everyone apart in-game would be really helpful. Any ideas on how to do that or does anyone want to take up the torch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T22:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it.
