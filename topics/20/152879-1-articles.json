I want to use Antares Solar System, Kerbol Star System, and Kerbol Origins, but they conflict with each other. Can someone tell me or link me to a video that shows me how to alter the planet packs to work with each other, move planets around, delete planets, etc. Also, can someone link me to a video/txt. Document that has a notepad file for a planet/body to use as a template for my own planets I want to create, like binary planets that are VERY close together in a horseshoe configuration that share an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-03T20:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately that is an extremely complex request, and the resources you ask to be linked to probably don\u0027t exist.

As you can probably tell, I\u0027m new to the forums, even though I\u0027ve been playing KSP since 1.0.5. Apparently Kerbol Origins and Kerbol Star System just hate each other because even switching reference bodies from sun (which is now The All) to Kerbol still caused the game to crash. I think it\u0027s due to a retexturing of Cool because in Kerbol Star System, cool looks more detailed, but with Kerbol Origins and Kerbol Star System installed and with the main menu being placed above Jool, Jool reverts to the vanilla texture. Also I watched TheWhiteGuardian\u0027s tutorials and began to edit the placement of bodies. I accidentally added an extra 0 to the radius of Kerbol and got a HILARIOUS Result. When I get done editing the planet packs to get them the way I like them, I might post pictures of the pack (If that is allowable). And what you said about the planet idea I mentioned earlier is what I planned to do! The sides closest together will be EXTREMELY Hot, but the other side\u0027s would be (relatively) cool at 300F\u00B0-400F\u00B0 (enough to land on). Thank you for the introduction to the forums and I will continue to post about my progress on this discussion!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperTK_0421","CreatedById":172125,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T16:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20.8px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(251,251,251);\u0022\u003E\u0022Copying example stuff would be a start.
