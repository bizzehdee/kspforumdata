Run into random space ships with aliens on board... or land on duna and find an alien... etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just going to list out my train of thought: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWas thinking the mod could use texture replacer\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUse the existing astronaut-complex processes to create a new placeholder for an \u0022alien\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGive that alien, an alien head using texture replacer\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThen, stick that new alien astronaut on another planet... but call it an \u0022anomaly\u0022, just like the game currently does with undiscovered asteroids. Maybe the current process for rescuing a stranded Kerbal in orbit could be utilized for this too?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThen, work that into the contract system... For example: Maybe have an organization called \u0022Black-Ops\u0022, and a contract to go investigate an anomaly on Duna, and to bring back any evidence you find (Organic or non-organic). And when you get to Duna you\u0027d find a weird looking alien... and you could somehow convince it to return with you (or capture it)... and maybe even add that alien to your astronaut list... make it some kind of specialist that can be both a pilot \u0026amp; engineer or incorporate into MKS/OKS so that if the alien is inside a building that it becomes more efficient. Also maybe the alien could unlock some special branch in the tech-tree.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs an alternate alien contract, maybe you go investigate an anomaly in orbit around another planet and discover the alien on a spaceship... and then you could capture that spaceship and fly it home.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thinking out loud here, but you get the basic idea. If something like this already exists then pls point me in that direction. But if not I think that would be a really cool mod for one of our modders to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx and happy holidays!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
