I looked in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E folder and they were in the suggested mods, but there was a subfolder for \u0027new tantares\u0027 so I\u0027m guessing something changed at some point re tantares and now there\u0027s new configs. Does anyone have new configs for Tantares parts (specifically, Soyuz, TKS, and VA spacecraft)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, unrelated, but I see NO orphan node in my RP1 tech tree. Not, I see one and it is empty - such a node simply does not exist.
