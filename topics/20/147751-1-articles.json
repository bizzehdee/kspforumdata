I was wondering if anyone has made a mod that adds a mk2 Xenon tank? Even if someone just had the model files without the cfg, that would be fine. I could edit one of the existing tanks but it wouldn\u0027t be the same. Thanks for any help,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBenji13\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
