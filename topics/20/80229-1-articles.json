There are loads of people who will leave stupid comments. It also makes it harder on the modder, who now has to look to more places to receive feedback. The response from modders when asked about comments is overwhelmingly in agreement: no. The second reason is that even if we did have comments, no one wants to moderate them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe parallax effect also means mod entries on the 2 main pages are filled with 30-50% wasted empty space.

I can\u0027t go create a site called ghostbustershq.com or illithidgamingaids.com and not expect to run afoul of someone\u0027s IP.

They were, at times, somewhat contentious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end Squad clarified and/or relented on what we discussed;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Rowsdower is free to choose any mods he likes to feature on Modding Mondays. He wasn\u0027t actively in the discussion when calisker finally announced this so he wasn\u0027t able to confirm he\u0027d source mods from anywhere, but I\u0027m pretty sure he will. Outside of that, Squad \u0022firmly committed to supporting their official partner Curse\u0022 and reiterated that many, many, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emany\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E times. So any support of promotion of community-ran mod sites such as KerbalStuff is not likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The use of \u0022Kerbal\u0022 is going to be moderated due to their need to protect their trademark or whatever. We\u0027ll have to wait for their future announcements for specifics, but KerbalStuff was given the all-clear to continue using the name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs is so often the case with KSP-related drama, this came down to poor communication again, especially it\u0027s one-way nature. I suggested a few times that they could avoid this if they gathered feedback on potentially hot topics before they issue a statement or tease changes. I am somewhat hopeful this may happen. I also want to personally thank Rowsdower; he was very patient and listened to what we had to say, and took some additional feedback from me personally. He was very helpful and I have zero problems with anything he did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can promise you no one was angrier than I was with calisker\u0027s final post in that thread. I did let him know that I found it both condescending and insulting and tried to explain why. I won\u0027t quote him or speak for him (maybe someone will post the day\u0027s log again) but I will say I was not satisfied with what I heard on this subject and I can only let that knowledge guide me going forward. I guess the only warning I could give would be to take care when entering a discussion that your own viewpoints not come across as hostile or dismissive and hope for the best in response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end, I\u0027d say things were resolved well enough that we don\u0027t need to cause more drama. As a mod community we absolutely should continue to (politely) ask Squad to communicate with us more directly and constructively.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
