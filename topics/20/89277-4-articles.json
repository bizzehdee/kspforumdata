How much are your LVs costing, how much feels right to earn from contracts, etc. (My Vanguard costs about 1500-1600, a Thor-Delta about 2000, sounding rockets in the 300-700 range...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes on contracts, science, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

There is no super-easy way to disable contracts, and *certainly* no easy way to only temporarily do so.

It may well make sense to remove science from (some) contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Node costs need quite the workover. I am leaning towards basic orbital rocketry needing ~30 science, or at the very least 20 (remember, no Kerbin or KSC science). Orbital LVs, Stability, and Survivability should probably be in the 40 range (or maybe the same cost as basic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea here is that at the start, you really don\u0027t have much of a choice: fly sounding rockets until you get enough cash and science to escape the atmosphere, and to unlock basic orbital LVs. Now you can fly some early orbital missions, or keep flying ever-higher sounding rockets. Next, you have a choice. You can either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get larger rockets and fly a lunar flyby mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Get maneuverable probes with solar panels, and launch probes that can report science from (polar) orbit ad infinitum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Get Survivability and fly some human spaceflight suborbitals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have chosen a path and followed it enough, you can pick a second path, and finally you will have all three nodes.
