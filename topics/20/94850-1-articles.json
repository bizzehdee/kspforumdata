Currently it shows fuel in units that are not related to anything else. Why not show the fuel in tons instead? This would be more relatable, and it would make it easier to figure out the vessel\u0027s current mass (in an otherwise stock install). You know, if we need to do some impromptu dV calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Has this perhaps already been done? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If not, is this something that would be possible to do as a mod?
