I understand the situation when it comes to parts from organizations like Tetragon Projects or BahamutoD\u0027s Arms Corporation, but I\u0027ve noticed many software companies such as Mechjeb, KOS, Burn Together, etc\u00A0have been using their own proprietary computer architecture on their own proprietary hardware. I will acknowledge\u00A0that a lot of the companies are fairly liberal about their code, but the fact that we have to use proprietary parts that can\u0027t be shared with other players and the fact that we have to manually remove every part is irritating our engineers and our lawyers. So, I say we establish a common computer architecture based on some of the most commonly available systems that nearly every space program has access to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(In normal people language)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, its a pain to share .craft files when you have a thousand tiny computer parts for utility purposes from mods like Mechjeb, KOS, Burn Together, etc. So, we as a modding community should make it so all of the software are contained within probe cores so the probe cores act as computers that we can load software from mods on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T12:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse KerbalX, which tells you which mods are needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor, just share stock vessels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0something0","CreatedById":182790,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T19:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223397923\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528804952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse KerbalX, which tells you which mods are needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor, just share stock vessels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that its a pain to try to take off the tiny modded parts, especially when I often tuck it away in cargo bays.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T19:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223398170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528831755\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182790\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00220something0\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, 0something0 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that its a pain to try to take off the tiny modded parts, especially when I often tuck it away in cargo bays.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen share them with KerbalX.\u00A0 Anyone who downloads it will be told which mods it requires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0something0","CreatedById":182790,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T19:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223398174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528831987\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen share them with KerbalX.\u00A0 Anyone who downloads it will be told which mods it requires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut when modded parts account for a tiny fraction of mass, volume, potentially part count, and is not needes to fly the vessel, they shouldn\u0027t need mods to get the craft.
