Why do we have to \u0022fly\u0022 each ship to do this? That would make mission planning better and the tracking station more useful overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think a level 4 pilot should be able to create maneuver nodes without a comm connection to the tracking station, and also create nodes for networked ships with remote pilot assist. I don\u0027t think any probes should have this ability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course a mod that enabled node editing in the tracking station would need to enforce the requirement to have a connection from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to the ship in order to edit it\u0027s nodes, unless you have a level 4 pilot remote-assisting that ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
