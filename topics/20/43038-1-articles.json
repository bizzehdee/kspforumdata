KSP led me to this user-friendly game engine. But I have been dying to ask one thing. How in the world did you guys manage to make your wings work? You know, glide. You all have seen this when your spaceplane have crashed into the ground, but a pair of wings have survived and then soared off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on the Unity forums, I have started thread after thread and no one has a clue what I am talking about. I have tried to make my wings work in my Unity project, but they keep failing. How did you manage it? I would be so happy if someone could teach me the ways of the wing. And maybe even repay you (if it is so much of an hassle) with something that I could make, since I\u0027m an artist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T01:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SYRSA\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded additional info to the title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T23:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be a better idea to ask ferram instead of the developers.

But all it did was applying global drag to the wing no matter how I angeled it. I even dropped the wing from mid air and it didn\u0027t even glide off to one side.
