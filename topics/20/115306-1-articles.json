I really would like to have a more realistic fighter cockpit, that allows me to see the ground before hand.\n\nAs you can see in different real pics, the pilot has a real view of what he is doing in the air :\n\nhttp://wallpaperest.com/wallpapers/jet-pilot-in-cockpit_172162.jpg\n\nhttp://wallpaperest.com/wallpapers/jet-pilot-in-cockpit\\_172162.jpg\n\n[http://wallpoper.com/images/00/42/19/47/aircraft-pilot_00421947.jpg](http://wallpoper.com/images/00/42/19/47/aircraft-pilot_00421947.jpg)\n\nAlso, the pilot could see directly front of the aircraft in order to shoot with:\n\n[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/14/article-2278484-1792901F000005DC-485_634x356.jpg](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/14/article-2278484-1792901F000005DC-485_634x356.jpg)\n\nBut in KSP, the only \u0022correct\u0022 cockpit is the MK1, and it is front of the view, preventing to fly IVA or to shoot with gatling gun (thx to BD armory). It is very difficult to see the ground or what there is around the aircraft ...\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/rws5Z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rws5Z.jpg)\n\nMy question: is there any possibility to modify the mk1 IVA:\n\n- to reduce lightly the size (it seems there is an option in the menu but it doesn\u0027t work for me)\n\n- or to raise the point of view of the pilot (like a cushion under his ass)\n\n- or \u0022simply\u0022 creating a new IVA view ....\n\nThank for reading"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:03:56Z","Content":"This is a question best asked of the modders.

That\u0027s mostly because of the eye position of kerbals in contrast to humans, kerbal heads take up like half of their body height, there\u0027s at least 5 times more foreahead sitting above their eyes making it impossible to position them high enough under the ceiling without tricks. As a result, you can get the kerbal to barely peek over the ledge of a canopy, let alone see the ground below properly. I think everyone who\u0027s made an IVA has bitten their nails on that one at some point."},{"CreatedByName":"sha","CreatedById":137368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T13:19:14Z","Content":"That exactly the point, the head must be near the canopy.

Increased \u0022G-loading\u0022 during maneuvers forced pilots to wear tight, restrictive shoulder harnesses, and armor plating began to be installed to protect pilots from projectiles coming from behind.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Unfortunately, these changes denied a pilot the ability to twist around and look directly behind (known as \u0022Checking Six,\u0022 or looking at the \u0022Six O\u0027clock\u0022 position directly to the rear). Mirrors offered some help, but had a narrow field of view.\n\nOfficial purpose of cockpits: SSTOs\n\nSSTOs = Faster than Sanic\n\nBut there\u0027s [this mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84054-v0-90-v-25-Transparent-Pods-v1-2-2-for-KSP-v0-90) (scroll down to RetroFuture).
