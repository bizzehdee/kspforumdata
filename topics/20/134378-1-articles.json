And before you say that\u0027s not a ramjet, I present to you, the work of Ren\u00E9 Leduc, designer of the O.10, the first ever aircraft to be propelled solely by a ramjet engine. Yes, it had to be carried aloft piggy-back style atop another plane, and air-launched, the O.10, and all of Leduc\u0027s ramjet-powered aircraft to follow, the O.16, and the O.21, all spent 100% of their flight-time at subsonic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/McOJbmC6-04?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leduc_0.10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EO.10\u003C/a\u003E and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leduc_0.21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EO.21\u003C/a\u003E wikipedia pages for your perusal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few higher-speed ramjets to bridge the gap betwixt these and the hypersonic scramjets would make for a way to potentially get into orbit using only air-breathing engines from the launch-pad until entirely out of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T06:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFairly simple, just have a 0 flow multiplier at 0 mach in the velCurve and then increasing \u0026gt;0 at mach 0.3 or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
