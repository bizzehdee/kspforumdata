According to the book the MSL pressure is high enough to go without a pressure suit and too low to get enough oxygen without a mask. I think it said about 1/6th our own. Not sure about height though, I would assume you get to the 0.5% pressure mark at around, let\u0027s say 50 km? 60?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something that would be really interesting to play around with me thinks. Think of it: SSTO spaceplanes from the Moon would be super easy with RO. I wonder what aircraft would be best for the low gravity...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould somebody be willing to whip up a Kopernicus patch? Or if I can do it myself could somebody point me in the right direction?
