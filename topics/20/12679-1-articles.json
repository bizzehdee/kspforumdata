My name is OnyxAltair and I had a cool idea about a plugin/mod. I was thinking of having 2 new items and... DOCKING. The 2 items would be a stack parachute and a docking port. Instead of being able to transfer crews and all that, this plugin would just keep the ships together in an orbit (Or any other sides with a structural frame) Maybe we could also do something like the orbital construction mod of sending fuel to another spacecraft. Personally I am not the greatest at programming, and that is why I need help with the plugin part. I am better at part design thou but not crazy detailed parts. If you would like to join my modding team, just send me a message or comment in this topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Many thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E OnyxAltair\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T22:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m sorry, even with plugins, this is not possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T22:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\\\u0027s possible, just very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OnyxAltair","CreatedById":11920,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T22:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is in a way possible even in a rough idea. Say you get these three mods: Part gravity-orbital construction- and mech jeb. You can sort of use these plugins to dock because 1- part gravity will make sure that they dont fly waay from each other 2- orbital construcion would switch fuel and give fuel and 3- mech jeb would stop any spinning and part gravity again would hold it. Now I know that that wont perfectly dock but thats kind of the best way to do it at this point of time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Muka","CreatedById":7226,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-15T13:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart gravity doesn\\\u0027t works above 2x warp, so this was is no-go.
