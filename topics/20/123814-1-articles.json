Next thing you know you have 1/4th tank of fuel and your loosing it quick. Thankfully uou have some Kerbal Tape You fix the hole. Now you get eletrical issues. Your only on 2 battery packs now and you barley have enough stuff just to get to duna. YOu do what anyone could and would do. Take advantage of you being able to make it to duna andland there. Where you can get fuel and trade with merchants\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo My request is a mod where natural events can happen and there is merchants where you trae and get stuff repird this could also be usefull for clonies and possibly more fun.

But I think he means a Trade mod, where you can purchase supplies etc from other colonies. This would be a massive mod to have to make, and would take a lot of work. But if someone was committed it could be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you would have to set up the \u0022merchants\u0022 or colonies your self in order to buy. Would be a good multiplayer mod. However I don\u0027t really think it follows the kerbal spirit. It sounds like a new game to me. Squad?
