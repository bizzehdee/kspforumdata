As my craft hits the atmosphere the navball starts vibrating very quickly. My velocity plumits long before I hit the thick air and I get no effects. The craft will then fall as if it has its parachutes open on Jool. VERY slow. And just now.. I couldn\u0027t fall at all. This instance was a spent fuel tank I was trying to deorbit. Just started tumbling in place 23km up. Soo.. idk what going on here. This is new as of today. Only changes I made was adding KW sound effects to StretchySRB. My main culprits are that mod and maybe FAR.
