I would make it my self, but I don\u0027t know how to code or anything. so I request that someone else do it. the mod would be completely theirs as long as they say I had the original idea. the mod could include weather like rain, snow, storms, ect. also, parts to attach to satalites to predict the weather, and anything else to make it better. I hope someone can do this because that can make ksp more chalenging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T09:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Potato_King347\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Potato_King347\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe mod would be completely theirs as long as they say I had the original idea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod would be completely theirs regardless.
