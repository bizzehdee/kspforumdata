Both got me to remote planets, but it was pretty rough. Mechjeb\u0027s \u0022warp to phase angle\u0022 seems to disagree with with protractor, and when I use it to schedule interplanetary transfers it seems to randomly schedule burns years in the future even when I think I\u0027m already in a window. Once I even warped to the hour before the window to replot the burn (as it says to do in the mechjeb manual) only to have it put the burn another two years in the future. (Maybe there\u0027s a very slightly better window 2 years in the future?). I can get there with protractor too, and I love that I\u0027m more in control of the situation but it\u0027s hard to get the ejection burn right and I often end up needing to make a pretty large course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like this should be a pretty common issue?

Very, very flexible and allows you to put constraints on departure date, arrival date and transfer time; you can also have a look at the raw porkchop plot and pick a transfer manually.

I\u0027ve found it\u0027s not worthwhile to get too finicky about making your node perfect, the non-instantaneous nature of the burn will mean it doesn\u0027t execute it exactly anyway.
