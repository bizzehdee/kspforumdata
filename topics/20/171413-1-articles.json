You\u0027d use dataProcessingMultiplier to finetune the research speed you want; it has no effect on how much science you get in total. Just how fast you get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lab works by first converting an experiment into data.

Though they look like they work the same way, they do not; the former two are indeed a \u003Cem\u003Ebonus\u003C/em\u003E, and can never reduce the amount of data gained, only increase it; and the last one is indeed a \u003Cem\u003Emultiplier\u003C/em\u003E, and totally will reduce data gained. But only when you\u0027re sitting on the surface of your homeworld. Anywhere else, there is no way to reduce the amount of data you gain to less than the amount of science the converted experiment is worth.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo the only way to reduce the output of the lab is to lower scienceMultiplier, as you tried to do. However, there\u0027s a trick here. That field, just like researchTime, \u003Cem\u003Eonly takes integers\u003C/em\u003E. Try putting anything other than a whole number there, and it gets flat-out ignored. This, in turn, means that the lowest possible number you can assign is 1, which - combined with the paragraph above - means that the lowest possible output you can set the MPL to yield is the science value of the original experiment. In other words, the MPL, when nerfed to the lowest performance possible, will still double an experiment\u0027s yield (one copy returned home, one copy processed).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you made this change, you will probably realize that the lab suddenly slowed to a crawl. After all, you changed nothing about the rate that data is processed - you only changed the multiplier to the result of data processing. And so, even though the lab runs at the same speed as before, you get science way, way more slowly. You now have two options: 1.)\u00A0increase dataStorage, because the lab runs faster the higher the amount of data stored is; 2.) use researchTime and/or dataProcessingMultiplier to tune the speed at which data is consumed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with option 1\u00A0is that the lab may run properly if full, but takes forever to run completely empty. The problem with option 2\u00A0is that the lab finishes its assigned work in a timely manner, but if you also increase dataStorage, it will make the lab get very fast when filled to the brim. You will have to find a balance between the two that you\u0027re comfortable with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for what it\u0027s worth: we have an excellent repository of knowledge where you can look this sort of thing up.
