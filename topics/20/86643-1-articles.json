An optional rescaling of the Kerbol system to make Kerbin Earth-sized, and Kerbals human-sized... etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the sort of part and world tweaks that would enhance the simulation aspect of the game without turning it into a completely different game altogether, breaking carreer mode, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skeevy","CreatedById":110477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T13:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey already have that. Just install Real Solar System and the 10x scaled Kerbol system RSS mod. It scales the Kerbol system up to RSS sizes. From there, you\u0027d have to tweak part configs (or more realistically, edit some RSS MM configs) to make the difficulty how you\u0027d like it to be. All those RO mods you mention, do things like tweak the ISP to real levels, set limits on re-ignites, and almost all of the rest of the things you mention...though I\u0027m not positive on the mass and fuel flow....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T14:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably the easiest way to do this is to get RSS \u002B 6.4x Kerbin, Real Fuels, DRE, FAR, and any other realism mods you want, but not the RO resize scripts, and try it out.
