Some quick reading up online uncovered that (in stock at least) that fuel cells will only operate when the (presumably combined total?) battery charge is less than 95%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my queries are as follows, in Kerbalism:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Does it work the same way with the 95% threshold?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) if you start the fuel cell when you have more than 95% charge then put the satellite on rails by doing other launches/active vessels or space centre timewarp, will the fuel cell kick in correctly when inevitably the charge drops below 95%? Or do you need the fuel cell to be actively generating (battery charge \u0026lt;95%) before putting the satellite on rails?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Say the satellite had solar panels for perpetual charge. The satellite emerges from the darkside of the Mun with the fuel cell generating, but this is still on rails (not the active vessel). While on rails would the solar panels charge and the fuel cell stop generating as it would if it were the active vessel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help or additional info you think would be topical is greatly appreciated :)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-11T23:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027m not sure if you just leave the probe there, but your best bet is to use the programmed actions. you find them in the kerbalism menu on the top right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso you have a fuel cell and a chemical plant set to water electrolysis - without that, you\u0027ll run out of hydrogen and out of power. you set the system to start water electrolysis when battery charge is more than 20% and to stop it when battery charge is less than 20%. you can actually leave the fuel cells open all the time, won\u0027t make a difference. with this setup, by night you will run on fuel cells, and by day your solar panels will recharge your oxygen/hydrogen tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199088-lucy-in-the-sky-with-deadly-radiations-an-attempt-to-make-a-grand-tour-using-kerbalism/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3909509\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThis mission report of mine\u003C/a\u003E, at subchapter 6.2 - after all the musings on landing on Duna\u00A0 - contains additional commentaries and analysis on using the kerbalism programming\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-11T23:35:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2022 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
