New players and new modders are going to be ignorant, everyone starts out that way. Best way to fix that is with guidance. Perhaps if you have to school someone, maybe do it through PM first? Giving someone a public thrashing is not really... inspiring? Also if you had a community guide on how to communicate with modders then when someone went astray they could just be directed to the guide without the modder coming off as the heavy, because that\u0027s not really fair to somebody who gives so much for very little return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a lot of this is growing pains as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn closing I would like to say that I really admire Ferram, the amount of patience he exhibited for the whole lift debate thread was impressive.
