Some mods may already offer this. One of mine (Kipard Skylon) has this as an optional upgrade. I created it as I thought it was part of how SABRE works but I got pointed out by someone sometime afterward that LACE is very much not part of SABRE. LACE (afaik) also requires sacrificing LH2 fuel to provide enough coolant power to flash hypersonic IntakeAir into cryo liquid form.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs consequence of this, I made it so that Skylon\u0027s tanks could hold \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E or LH2 alone (B9\u0027s fuel switch) so if ever a player needed much more fuel volume or (through plenty testing) much less Oxidizer volume, they could achieve it without clipping Mk1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSee point #2. Part of why I created Rational Resources is so I can answer this fuel ratio problem with fuel switch (as an extras config) so I\u0027ll never have to think about changing the fuel ratio in engines. There will always be someone who will want to use your specific engine in a way it\u0027s not meant to, or anywhere outside of the edge case you made it for. And you\u0027ll get complaints about that. I know this from my WIP mod SABR3 Sterling. Some players gravitated to the\u00A0 discreet rocket nozzle part because it offered higher Isp than the RAPIER\u0027s closed cycle. I immediately foresaw this problem and I was glad I never let loose any custom fuel ratio configs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHigh EC demand to buff the Helium coolant loop\u0027s ability, or having the precooler (in-game) use a non-transferrable catalyst that gradually degenerates (instilling a half-life mechanic) due to the hypersonic plasma entering the intake are both good options to consider. Related, my SABR3 intakes use a novel method of producing a metaphorical catalyst resource (named \u003Cstrong\u003EMillPower\u003C/strong\u003E in my case, representing a converter\u0027s capacity to do the job at a given velocity) through its own intake module only when a certain minimum speed is met (see \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EmachCurve{}\u003C/span\u003E inside \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EModuleResourceIntake{}\u003C/span\u003E) and having an always-on converter consume this catalyst and IntakeAir to produce Oxidizer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn half-life: The SABRE heat exchanger spiral contains countless fine filament like structures or holes that physically stop and flash cool air at the particle level, so surely, the sheer heat will corrode this in due time IRL.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022REACTION_INFOGRAPHIC.5db1b929aedaf.png?a\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.50\u0022 height=\u0022678\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://img.intelligent-aerospace.com/files/base/ebm/ias/image/2019/10/REACTION_INFOGRAPHIC.5db1b929aedaf.png?auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;w=1200\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223810748\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593300879\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203722\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Weimaraner\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/27/2020 at 7:34 PM, Weimaraner said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA nice idea, OPT has scramjets, but they work in the same way as the rapier.
