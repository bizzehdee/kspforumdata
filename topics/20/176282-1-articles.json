I think those three go really well together and not only does it add extra challenges but the flight computer feature it has it really great (it lets you execute maneuver nodes, or manually set burns and activate stages/action groups at a set time, so you can program the FC when you\u0027ve got comms contact with the probe and then watch helplessly as it follows your instructions once it\u0027s out of contact and you can\u0027t do anything about it).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also really recommend IndicatorLights not only do they look nice but add useful information to parts,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested this is a fairly up-to-date list of the mods I\u0027m running with in 1.4.3 -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/katateochi/installed_mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/katateochi/installed_mods\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
