Absolutely love this game, and just out of curiousity I wanted to see who all still uses mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will admit I still use mechjeb from time to time. Although as I have gotten beter at rendevous and landing I only use mechjeb for certain things. My number one use for mechjeb is the Smart A.S.S. which I use pretty extensively for maneuvers and docking alignment. I use the landing guidance every once in a while when I need to put a lander next to a base or something else that I want within a 20 to 30 meter distance. I think the Smart A.S.S. is about the only thing from MechJeb that I would like to see implemented as a tool into the game though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T21:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just prefer the readout that I get from Mechjeb.
