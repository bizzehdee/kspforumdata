This seems to be a general problem with KSPIE, looking at the waste heat, MegaJoule and charged particle indicators you can see that the total capacity gets scaled up, for waste heat and charged particles in direct proportion to the time acceleration. The rate of change doesn\u0027t. Liquid Argon capacity stays the same, but production rate is scaled down. This seems very strange. Using HyperWarp or physics warp gives the same results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA minor comment: What does \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022mT\u0022 stand for in the atmospheric intake?

Specifically, I have a reactor out in Kerbin synchronous orbit with an attached laser generator and a medium sized dish. The laser is generating in the vacuum UV. I also tested far\u00A0UV and Red Light spectrums. Anyway the problem is that I later launched a double pivoted light mirror to relay the beam. The description of it says it works in \u0027the uv spectrum\u0027 so I assume the three\u00A0UV beams I tried would work? Well, I couldn\u0027t seem to get it to actually relay the beam. I did make sure to click \u0027relay\u0027 on the light mirror for that craft before switching away from it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs\u00A0a note, direct LoS with the reactor does work, it\u0027s only the relay that I\u0027m having trouble with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI launched a craft with an inline thermal receiver which was in LoS to the relay but not the reactor (the relay has clear LoS to the reactor) but there was no incoming power. In the network info panel it does show both reactors in the relay network though.

If you want highly efficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E and don\u0027t mind mediocre thrust, you could take a look at the \u0027Lightbulb\u0027 engine or the Open Cycle Gas Core Engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor radiators you actually don\u0027t need to worry overly much about getting the numbers green in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Those numbers assume 100% uptime on the engine/reactor. Most of the engines will generate little heat while idle, so the number of radiators needed is minimal. Some reactors do have minimum throttles though, like the molten salt reactor which is 30% iirc. Most of the fusion engines and reactors will run cool until you start thrusting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said, unlocking more nodes in the thermal management branch will passively improve all your graphite radiators by a significant margin. By the time you get to the last 2 in the line, even small numbers of radiators will give you green in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, excepting the most aggressively hot reactor and electric engine setups. So, if you want to make your life easier with heat, just plonking down some science on the next node of the branch will be a benefit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you still wanna try a reactor/nozzle combo, you could try something simple to start with. Take a pebble bed(which is the reactor equivalent to the timberwind) and stick a nozzle on it. 4 medium extendable graphite radiators should be plenty for that set up, though the pebble bed does get worse as it heats up, which is I believe unique to that reactor, but again it only becomes a problem if you\u0027re thrusting constantly or attach a generator to it that\u0027s being constantly used. Anyway, supply it with whatever kind of fuel you can. Some reactors and nozzles can\u0027t use certain fuel types, but I think the pebble bed and krusader can use liquid fuel. If not, just play around with the \u0027next propellant\u0027 button til you land on sometime good. For starting out, I\u0027d recommend looking for a fuel which is dense (unlike hydrogen, which needs huge tanks to get decent delta v), while still being reasonably good isp. If you look at the window while switching fuels you\u0027ll see numbers for expected isp and thrust. For isp, anything above 500 is decent for nuclear reactors. The Open Cycle Gas Core reactor will have much better isp but weaker thrusts than the pebble bed, generally.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo start out, I\u0027d avoid electric engines. They require more set up and unlike the other reactor and nozzle combos, they will murder you with heat and are very fussy to get working with good thrust. The electric engines are more for super efficient(high isp) propulsion, and generally suffer for thrust. In fact, that\u0027s a general maxim for most of the tech tree. Things with great \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E tend to suffer for thrust and vice versa.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a final note, attaching generators to reactors to make electricity will produce a lot of heat if that electricity is being used. Thermal generators are probably the worst offender since their efficiency plummets as waste heat accumulates (and it will no matter how many radiators you stuff onto the ship). Charged Particle converter is unquestionably superior in basically every way, but is harder to use because.. you need charged particles rather than thermal energy, which only comes in abundance once you start getting fancy with fusion reactors and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-26T21:41:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2018 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by xRei\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shifty303","CreatedById":186540,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-27T20:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI recently noticed the wiki mentions research multipliers for the science laboratory when\u00A0landed on various planets that are higher than when in orbit.

The trade of is that the maximum isp is limited 7000s (similar to gas core ) and it generates more wasteheat\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-28T15:18:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2018 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friznit","CreatedById":191545,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-28T18:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have sworn I read a reply to my request for help above.\u00A0 Some very friendly person took the trouble to give useful guidance on how to get started but the post seems to have disappeared.\u00A0 Unless I\u0027m going mad, which to be honest quite likely under the circumstances.\u00A0 Did this get moves to a more appropriate thread that I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Nevermind - forum\u0027s behaving differently to what I\u0027m used to!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-28T19:00:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2018 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Friznit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xRei","CreatedById":132801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-30T08:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223495402\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221543431199\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191545\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Friznit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/28/2018 at 12:53 PM, Friznit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have sworn I read a reply to my request for help above.\u00A0 Some very friendly person took the trouble to give useful guidance on how to get started but the post seems to have disappeared.\u00A0 Unless I\u0027m going mad, which to be honest quite likely under the circumstances.\u00A0 Did this get moves to a more appropriate thread that I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Nevermind - forum\u0027s behaving differently to what I\u0027m used to!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I replied and my comment got deleted.. for whatever reason.

You could aim for the Timerwind for example, which is a powerful rocket engine. If you want highly efficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E and don\u0027t mind mediocre thrust, you could take a look at the \u0027Lightbulb\u0027 engine or the Open Cycle Gas Core Engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor radiators you actually don\u0027t need to worry overly much about getting the numbers green in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Those numbers assume 100% uptime on the engine/reactor. Most of the engines will generate little heat while idle, so the number of radiators needed is minimal. Some reactors do have minimum throttles though, like the molten salt reactor which is 30% iirc. Most of the fusion engines and reactors will run cool until you start thrusting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said, unlocking more nodes in the thermal management branch will passively improve all your graphite radiators by a significant margin. By the time you get to the last 2 in the line, even small numbers of radiators will give you green in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, excepting the most aggressively hot reactor and electric engine setups. So, if you want to make your life easier with heat, just plonking down some science on the next node of the branch will be a benefit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you still wanna try a reactor/nozzle combo, you could try something simple to start with. Take a pebble bed(which is the reactor equivalent to the timberwind) and stick a nozzle on it. 4 medium extendable graphite radiators should be plenty for that set up, though the pebble bed does get worse as it heats up, which is I believe unique to that reactor, but again it only becomes a problem if you\u0027re thrusting constantly or attach a generator to it that\u0027s being constantly used. Anyway, supply it with whatever kind of fuel you can. Some reactors and nozzles can\u0027t use certain fuel types, but I think the pebble bed and krusader can use liquid fuel. If not, just play around with the \u0027next propellant\u0027 button til you land on sometime good. For starting out, I\u0027d recommend looking for a fuel which is dense (unlike hydrogen, which needs huge tanks to get decent delta v), while still being reasonably good isp. If you look at the window while switching fuels you\u0027ll see numbers for expected isp and thrust. For isp, anything above 500 is decent for nuclear reactors. The Open Cycle Gas Core reactor will have much better isp but weaker thrusts than the pebble bed, generally.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo start out, I\u0027d avoid electric engines. They require more set up and unlike the other reactor and nozzle combos, they will murder you with heat and are very fussy to get working with good thrust. The electric engines are more for super efficient(high isp) propulsion, and generally suffer for thrust. In fact, that\u0027s a general maxim for most of the tech tree. Things with great \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E tend to suffer for thrust and vice versa.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a final note, attaching generators to reactors to make electricity will produce a lot of heat if that electricity is being used. Thermal generators are probably the worst offender since their efficiency plummets as waste heat accumulates (and it will no matter how many radiators you stuff onto the ship). Charged Particle converter is unquestionably superior in basically every way, but is harder to use because.. you need charged particles rather than thermal energy, which only comes in abundance once you start getting fancy with fusion reactors and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s going on:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003EThe post got \u0022voted up\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EThat made it automatically jump up to the top of the thread.\u00A0 Since this thread is over 130 pages long and started nearly two years ago, naturally nobody looking at the recent-posts end of the thread thought to look back there, which means it seemed to \u0022disappear\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional discussion in spoiler, the upshot of which is that this particular thread is probably ill-suited to the tech-support forum\u0027s format, which causes problems like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forum software allows for two different types of \u0022format\u0022 for the various subforums.\u00A0 These formats could be referred to as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStandard \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(suitable for long-running discussion on a topic)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ\u0026amp;A\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(suitable for short, \u0022focused\u0022 threads where the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

If the awkwardness of the tanks isn\u0027t an issue, LH2 is always a solid choice. If you play around with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff that comes with the mod pack, LH2 is also fairly easy to create in situ, so that\u0027s another benefit. If you have mods that let you create vessels in orbit (Like Extraplanetary launchpads), even better, since then you don\u0027t have to care about lugging those huge tanks into orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if you want only density, stuff like kerosene, liquid fuel, HTP are all pretty good. Even monoprop. Some of the fuels come with better thrust even than LH2. I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and HTP a lot when I can get away with it though. The hybrid mixture fuels also tend to offer great thrust when you have a reactor/combo that works with them. That\u0027s your FUELNAME-lox fuels (fuel \u002B liquid oxygen), like hydrolox. The biggest issue with a lot of those denser fuels is that they aren\u0027t always compatible with some of the more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E/efficient reactor types, which tend to rely on stuff like noble gasses, such as xenon, krypton, etc. Many\u00A0of those reactors can also use Liquid CO2, which has decent density and thrust. Some can use HTP also. As you said, you kind of have to play around with it each time you design a craft. There\u0027s a lot of variables involved since many of the reactors and nozzles can only use certain fuels, and some of the tech nodes will unlock additional fuel choices later on(IIRC). LH2 is the gold standard since it can be used with almost everything and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is always excellent... if it just wan\u0027t for that awful density..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeware liquid Xenon, it\u0027s insanely expensive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor simplicity sake, I also really recommend the MIC\u00A0Fusion Rocket for efficiency. It\u0027s actually one of my favorite engines in the game.\u00A0It needs only 2 things in abundance: a small bit of power to run, and lithium for fuel. Lithium is pretty dense fuel, but\u00A0requiring megawatts of power to run does mean you\u0027ll need a reactor on the ship, but the requirements are small, so it doesn\u0027t need to be a big reactor. IIRC it\u0027s around abouts ~30MW for the unupgraded, 2.5m fusion rocket. The mod comes with a nuclear reactor that has a built in generator (it sits in the utilities submenu) which is often what I use early on in career mode for cheap MWs. The storage tanks you need for lithium are found in the fuel storage tech line. Another nice thing about this rocket is that it has upgrade tech nodes all over the place, so as you unlock more tech it\u0027s being upgraded passively all the time. It\u0027s efficiency is high enough that with enough lithium you can go anywhere in the Kerbol system with a moderate sized payload pretty easily, even before it\u0027s fully upgraded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuick note about generating electrical power: right click on the generator(or reactor/generator combo) and it\u0027ll show you what the efficiency is expected to be. The efficiency of the normal generator\u00A0starts really low, and as you upgrade tech nodes at the bottom of the tree, it increases. But importantly, you have to remember to multiply the maximum expected power of the reactor you\u0027re using (in GW or MW) by that number, and that\u0027s how much actual electricity you\u0027ll generate. So if your nuclear reactor says it produces\u00A0100 MW total output and your efficiency is currently 40%(0.4), expect\u00A0less than 40 MW of actual power. I say expect less because generators perform worse as temperature rises, and it very quickly will while it generates electricity. Upgrades help a lot though.\u00A0And as\u00A0I mentioned in the other post, the charged particle converter is much better since it\u0027s efficiency doesn\u0027t drop with temperature increases, but those charged particles are harder to get.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe moral of the story is that if you are using the normal generator for powering your engines, bring enough radiators to offset the at least some of the heat. For the MIC Fusion Rocket, something like 4 medium graphite radiators should be okay. If the generator starts producing less power than you need for maximum thrust with your fusion rocket, the rocket will automatically throttle itself down, so it\u0027ll still work, just less effectively. I\u0027d say a general rule of thumb is that you want at least twice as much expected power from your generator than what you need for the rocket\u0027s fusion maintenance. Maybe 3x as much at low tech levels if you want be to be sure that you can run the engine at max thrust near constantly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater on you can use the colliding beam fusion reactor which uses charged particles to make highly efficient electrical power. It\u0027s all in one so you don\u0027t need to attach the converter. It starts off large in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but upgrades will allow you to shrink it down. For mid-late game tech tree, this is one of the best\u00A0ways to get easy, carefree power.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if you want 30MW of power and you currently have 30% efficiency, then a reactor which makes 300 mw will have a max electrical output of 100mw/mjoules (300 x 0.3), and assuming heat drops the efficiency of the generator down to 11%, you\u0027d still have 33MW of electrical power. So take your MIC Fusion Rocket, include your choice of reactor/generator for power, 4 graphite radiators and a big tank of lithium. That\u0027s enough to shove a 2.5 command pod, a science module, a lander and some other crap to just about anywhere in the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso don\u0027t forget that you can time warp with many of the engines in KSPI to offset dealing with obnoxiously low thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-30T21:59:43Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2018 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by xRei\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
