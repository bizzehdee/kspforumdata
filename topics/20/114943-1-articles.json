(That is close up on a Kerbal, who\u0027s not in a vessel) So not EVE, or Orbital Enhancement, there was also a texture compression mod, though I can\u0027t remember the name, if anyone could point me to that I would be grateful. \n\n Also has anyone made an FOV slider mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T12:15:37Z","Content":"The texture compression mod is likely [Active Texture Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005).\n\nFOV adjustment is a stock feature, hold alt while using the scrollwheel."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:31:27Z","Content":"Mod question moved to the mod subforums."}]}
