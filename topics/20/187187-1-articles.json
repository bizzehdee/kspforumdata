How many times you\u0027ve waited several minutes and watched the date go slowly up even at the highest warp rate, because next transfer window was years away and you had nothing to do in the meantime?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, maybe it was just me, but I dropped too many career saves because of that - I got tired of waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I came up with a *hopefully possible* idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince everything goes on rails when in timewarp, I think it would be possible to just skip to certain time - yes, of course, the game would have to calculate the final position of every craft and planet, but I believe it would happen much faster, even if I had to wait a bit before it could skip. With the integration with Kerbal Alarm Clock, such mod would be more useful than I could possibly imagine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only question is... Is it even possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T16:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650487\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565795019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince everything goes on rails when in timewarp,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithin certain limits.
