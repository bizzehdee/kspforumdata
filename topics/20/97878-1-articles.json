However, due to the distance which I have been covering, such as from KSC to North Pole (where I am making a base), I find I run out of fuel just as I begin to cross the snow flats (don\u0027t know their actual name!). I am using Karbonite mod, so the actual fuel running low is not where the problem lies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual problem follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I (unfortunately) use MechJeb as a helper with my planes; I try hard not to use it for rockets. When I\u0027m doing long hauls such as those I mentioned above, I will set my spaceplane guidance to be at 355\u003Csup\u003Eo \u003C/sup\u003Eand at around 10,000m up. This means I can leave the game running and come back to it later on and still be mid flight. However, if I decide that I want to do it as fast as possible, by running at 4x speed, then I tend to overshoot without ever knowing about it. I\u0027ve had a little look into Kerbal Alarm Clock, but can\u0027t really see a way of accurately being alerted when I get to a certain ground location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy request:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod/ someone who can make a mod which will alert me/ pause the game when I pass over the top of a certain point on the ground. This kind of thing would be so helpful as it would save me having to frequently check where I was every 5 mins (approx.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould really appreciate a point in the right direction/ some feedback on this!
