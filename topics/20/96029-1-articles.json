Is this at all realistic? To me it seems that all a jet engine is doing is using a combustion process to accelerate the reaction mass through the engine by raising its temperature. The efficiency comes from not having to carry the reaction mass. It shouldn\u0027t make any difference whether you\u0027re combining onboard fuel with an oxidising atmosphere, or combining onboard oxidiser with a fuel-rich atmosphere. The latter way would end up with a very rich mixture and probably a great cloud of smoke, but should work well enough as far as I can see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would need doing to make this viable?

The exact reverse of taking in an atmosphere rich in oxygen and burning it with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. In both cases you\u0027re providing thrust by gathering in a gaseous atmosphere and accelerating it, using a small part of that atmosphere as one of the combustion reactants. The other reactant is a liquid you brought with you.

But if this has any feasibility in practice I have no idea... I do not know enough about the exact reactions/mass ratios in common jet engines, but I would guess that carrying the oxygen around with you while getting the hydrogen from the atmosphere would be significantly less effective, than the other way around.
