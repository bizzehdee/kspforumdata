If someone can provide a link for a mod which is similar or send instructions on how to change jool. (I am running ksp v1.12.2 with quite a few part mods and some planet mods which don\u0027t change the stock system and extremely basic knowledge in coding for ksp.) If anyone can provide help, it would be most appreciated.
