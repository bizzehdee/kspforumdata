The main braking method of an aircraft during a powered descent is its thrust-reversing mechanism, which are simply panels deployed into the exhaust shaft at low throttle (so the engine doesn\u0027t rape itself), and then throttled up again, being held in place purely through a simple mechanical locking mechanism and the force of the exhaust.

Given KSP\u0027s current model of aerodynamics, none of these can be applied without dirty \u0022hacks\u0022. The spoilers are probably the easiest, and the best to counter misuse with. A spoiler would be an animated part, which would (through control group) pop up and be \u0022deployed\u0022 therefore creating tons of drag. In KSP this suffices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, a spoiler has less to do with direct air braking and more with transferring the weight of the aircraft from the wings to the wheels (as to prevent it from taking off again). This creates additional drag (as the wheels are actually carrying weight now). The main braking method of an aircraft during a powered descent is its thrust-reversing mechanism, which are simply panels deployed into the exhaust shaft at low throttle (so the engine doesn\u0027t rape itself), and then throttled up again, being held in place purely through a simple mechanical locking mechanism and the force of the exhaust. I always carry drogue chutes on my spaceplanes, and my earliest spaceplanes were configured to even do parachute descents, as I wasn\u0027t the best at planning my aerobrake and managing to get the KSC runway aligned properly (in the sense of the length of the runway, its easy to hold course, but on an unpowered descent its hard to modify glidepath). The drogue chutes now serve the purpose of assisting in braking the aircraft once on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour understanding of how real-life aero-braking and powered descent works is absolutely correct, and the deployable panel is actually what I\u0027m referring to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps and slats would also be implementable in the same sense as a spoiler or drogue- just have it as a module that generates drag... The way KSP models it\u0027s aerodynamics and mass allocation, I guess it\u0027d be hard to \u0022relocate\u0022 the weight to the bottom of the craft- in particular the wheels...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T15:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried the stock drogue chutes as well as the normal chutes for horizontal decceleration. Both disintegrate after being deployed, when trying to make a Thrust SSC-esque vehicle. And yes, the aerodynamics of KSP are not suitable for this mostly. When you go at higher speeds, the vehicle will drift to one side, even with perfect simmetry, this happens with planes as well. The more thrust you have, the worse it becomes, even flipping your vehicle, which is not how objects moving fast on land work IRL. I believe this is due to the fact that KSP has no friction physics(which also explains why vehicles move on their own if you don\u0027t aply brakes to them, even on a perfectly flat surface.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T16:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just saying that I don\u0027t know of any U.S. aircraft that use this system.
