I don\u0027t ever want to build a ship with solar panels that doesn\u0027t also have at least one of the 1x1 static solar panels. I hate running out of electricity on a probe and not be able to extend the panels because I forgot to turn off SAS or whatever.\n\nThe other thing I need, if there are legs or wheels, is lighting! Landing in the dark is only slightly more dumb than having to wait months for daytime to arrive on whatever you\u0027re trying to land on, because your design lacks this critical feature. Very easy to get into orbit and make your interplanetary burn without them, which is actually a bad thing."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:14:35Z","Content":"Mod for the engineer\u0027s report: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126662-Extensive-Engineer-Report](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126662-Extensive-Engineer-Report)\n\nAlternative engineer\u0027s report: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63591-0-90-WernherChecker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63591-0-90-WernherChecker)"}]}
