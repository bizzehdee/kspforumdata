The problem is that in order to have the windows pointing in the correct direction to use on a plane/spaceplane I need to have the capsule in the same orientation as it would be on a rocket or lander. This means that when the plane is on the runway on its landing gear the navball centers on zenith (\u0027up\u0027 direction) unlike a cockpit which would have the navball centered on horizontal. This doesn\u0027t just mean that the navball is all wrong (and so I can\u0027t see the direction I am actually travelling in on the navball), but the roll and yaw commands don\u0027t work right either. So, is there an easy way (by editing the cfg file or something) to alter this behaviour \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I want to try this is that every cockpit I have tried has terrible visibility when trying to land on the runway in IVA mode, not much fun if you can\u0027t see where the runway is without heavily pitching down!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-27T16:05:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2015 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rivelin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETitle not quite right\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T16:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not going to be easy.

Installing Raster Prop Monitor gives displays in the IVAs of many cockpits and pods. These displays have a menu called \u0027Target Management\u0027 and in this menu you can set \u0027Reference Part\u0027 to any capsule/cockpit/pod/core/mechjeb-module present on the craft and it\u0027ll set the navball (both on the rpm displays and the normal cockpit navball) orientation according to the orientation of the part you select. This means the part you are flying IVA in can be in any orientation you want as long as you have another command part in the orientation to give the navball behaviour that you require. Awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course Raster Prop Monitor also solves my problem in another way by allowing the use of external cameras which can be placed to give visibility that the cockpit windows lack. This mod is brilliant!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
