Modded wings are not the solution for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you flying with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E activated? Set it to heading hold. Or try the Atmospheric Autopilot mod\u0027s fly by wire to see how well it compensates for the flight instability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes your plane have more wings on one side than the other, or other asymmetry? That could cause more lift on the left side to force a right tilt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a science part or other accessory on the right side causing drag?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, after covering that, here are some fun wing mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) B9 Procedural Wings. This allows you to customize wing shapes and other parameters. It\u0027s nicer than trying to build a big wing from many small wing parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) OPT Orbital Portal Technologies. It mostly offers entirely new spaceplane fuselage profiles and engines, but also has some beautiful scifi style wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
