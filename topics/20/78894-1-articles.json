No more cutting out the HL parts from B9, no more dumping 90% of some random part pack that I use 3 parts from, and no more quibbles about whether to use KSP Interstellar with extra awesome on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I\u0027m having trouble with is that I\u0027m digging around looking for more awesome plane parts. I\u0027ve got B9, Firespitter, Kerbonov, B9 Expansion, Lack Luster Labs \u002B their stock expansion kit, and yet I\u0027m still running into the \u0022I want this or that and I can\u0027t find it,\u0022 problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically: I\u0027m trying to find a pilot\u0027s seat with reasonable view (yes, IVA is needed, and no, the MK1 IVA is not an acceptable view, there\u0027s no side views...) that mounts to a 1m stack. I\u0027d prefer it to be slightly angular in design, but I could make something work if it\u0027s a bubble type canopy. Basic idea is this: if it looks like it should fit on a fighter plane, I\u0027d be interested. With 64-bit and 12GB of RAM, I\u0027m not too worried about installing parts packs for one part, and I figure, ask the community. Asking Google has failed because I don\u0027t know how to precisely word it in ways to produce the results I want. Asking the Forum Search never seems to work for me. When in doubt, ask the community. And yes, I want a plane pod, not a rocket capsule. I fly planes, I only crash rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
