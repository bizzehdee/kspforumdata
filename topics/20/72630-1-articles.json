What I want though is some pointers for a real beginner of ZERO knowledge. I have a VERY basic understanding of the correlations of tri\u0027s to performance and realise that a good aim would be to always minimize vertices while retaining the aesthetic goal. Outside of that I\u0027m a fish out of water and ready to learn! The main info I\u0027m looking for is of course anything relevant to modding for KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the latest version of Blender right now, is this the right tool for the job? I also have the free version of Unity, is this capable or do I need to invest in the full version before I can get anything into the game? How much of the process will be done on Blender and how much on Unity (at what point do I need to switch over)? Is there anything I need to do before getting started with either Blender or Unity to make sure it will work with KSP when the time comes? Of course I will be watching many tutorials for both but figured it would be a good idea to ask here for some good starting advice that\u0027s relevant to the particular game I\u0027m aiming to mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final request as well, if you can think of anything that could possibly be a solution to a problem I may likely run into in the future throw in any bullet point solutions you can. I will add them to a text document to refer to whenever I hit the wall. This seemed like a good way to gather some solutions without regularly pestering people for pointers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers in advance for any help you can give!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreatWyrmGold","CreatedById":107272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T22:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also interested in learning basic modding for KSP.
