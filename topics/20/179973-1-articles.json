The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E fore by throttle is a very nice feature..that I thought would be a great extension to add to rover wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve made a few bikes and rovers in my day and was always a bit annoyed by having to \u0027pitch down\u0027 to move forward. Now..i can easily remove the pitch aspect on reaction control parts to avoid this..but would prefer not too and just be able to go forward with throttle..like a gas peddle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this be pheasable without writing a plugin?? I wouldnt think it would..but would like to ask anyways..Im terrible with code..but good with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patching if its allowed/doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-21T15:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2018 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Jesusthebird\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaximumThrust","CreatedById":185090,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-23T03:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always set the wheels to the arrows, away from the pitch and yaw controls, so I can you both when I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the speed I use the MechJeb rover autopilot, which also have a great feature called stability control, very useful for low-gravity environments.
