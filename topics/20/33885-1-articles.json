What I\u0027m guessing is happening is that the dipole antennas on your Mun mission and in orbit around Kerbin are maintaining contact until their range is extended, and then you\u0027re losing connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple of options. Instead of pointing your Mun sat\u0027s dish at Kerbin, aim it explicitly at one of your Kerbin relay satellites. I\u0027d pick the one that\u0027s most recently come in to line of sight, to give you the longest operating time. Or, if you can get your intercept with Mun lined up and squared away before you head out of range, just stay aimed at Kerbin and let it go dark for a while. Once the Mun sat moves from Kerbin\u0027s SOI to Mun\u0027s, it should lock on to Kerbin automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
