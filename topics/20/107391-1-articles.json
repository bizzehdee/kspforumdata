I just hate how my science lab have ~0 science ready to transmit, then I go to Duna or something and between the burns I check and when I right click it spools from 0 to 499.\n\nBut the most annoying thing is when I have to operate a craft in the dark, drain 90% of the power, go somewhere else and it happens that next time (5-50 days later) I have to operate is still in the dark. Power is frozen at 10%, no matter that it did 5-50 rotations and took enough to fill it\u0027s batteries.\n\nPlease help me find it or let me know if the old version is compatible\n\nThanks in advance !"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:23:14Z","Content":"I guess this isn\u0027t really the right section for this question, since it\u0027s mod related, and there is a section for mods in the forums, but anyway, I\u0027m not a Moderator, so I\u0027ll go ahead and overlook that...\n\nIn any way, a quick google search brought up this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97921-Background-Processing-0-2-KSP-0-25](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97921-Background-Processing-0-2-KSP-0-25)\n\n[Moderator removed defunct website link]\n\nI have no Idea whether it works with 1.0, and it doesn\u0027t seem there is a version for 1.0 of it.\n\nIt\u0027s really not that hard to find the mods you\u0027re looking for.

I guess it should be universal as it is a dll that works with the engine. Hope it works.
