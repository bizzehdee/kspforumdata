How are plugin collisions handled? If somebody makes a part that depends on the Lazor system (for example), and distributes a dll with their pack, and the user already has that plugin in another mod folder somewhere, what happens? Does the game have a way of checking versions and uses the most recent version of the dll?

That\u0027s too bad. It would have been nice if we could have packaged everything in a self-contained directory, instead of having to make a release with a /Ships/ folder and then a /GameData/Packname/ folder and tell the user to install it in their KSP directory (which is going to cause nightmares for mac users, I think, because of the stupid way OSX defaults to replacing folders instead of merging them). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t messed around with plugins yet, so that question is still open\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T18:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei was perplexed by this too. i tried to get the craft to be mod-local such as GameData/*modname*/Ships/*VAB or SPH*/*.craft, and several variations, but nothing worked. ultimately i just packeged my mod to match the ksp folder structure all the way to the ksp root folder, and encased that in a master directory with the readme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EArchiveRoot/\u003Cbr\u003E |-readme.txt\u003Cbr\u003E |-KSP_Root/\u003Cbr\u003E    |-GameData\u003Cbr\u003E       |-ModName\u003Cbr\u003E    |-Ships\u003Cbr\u003E       |-VAB\u003Cbr\u003E          |-*.craft\u003Cbr\u003E       |-SPH\u003Cbr\u003E          |-*.craft\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen in my readme i said something like \u0027dump the contents of KSP_Root into your KSP dir\u0027. of course theoretically if you disregarded that and dumped the ArchiveRoot into your GameData folder, the mod should still work, just not the craft files. dont know what would happen if you took a mod intended for the new system and stuck it in the legacy folders, thats whats got me worried. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats what i did, im not sure what you are supposed to do. this seems like a way to make everything a mess if you ask me. chances are if you uninstall your mod you end up with a bunch of dead craft that dont work that you cant get rid of in game. mods, including example ships should only have one entry point into the game\u0027s directory structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot sure about #2. i have a feeling that mods will use the local instance of the plugin, even if there is a newer version of that plugin in some other folder. i wouldnt worry about it unless it causes a mod to not work, or makes the game unstable. ive been intentionally avoiding making any new plugins or using other plugins in my mods for a few versions now. there are some modules in mumech and other plugins that id like to use, but im not going to start doing any coding or using dlls till beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T18:29:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T18:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d advise against including top level like KSP_Root - it makes it very labour intensive to install multiple mods at once as you have to manually remove the extra folder from each one rather than just doing a mass extract and installing the whole lot in 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, readme files should either be named something mod specific or in a mod specific folder for much the same reason.
