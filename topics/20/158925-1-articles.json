I have spent the better part of this Saturday researching the various mods (\u003Cem\u003ESnacks, TAC Life Support, IFI Life Support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life support\u003C/em\u003E), and a bunch of mods that gave me some parts (greenhouses: from \u003Cem\u003EBiomass, Planetary Base Systems, MKS\u003C/em\u003E), and\u00A0I found that they all seem to make life a little too easy on the space explorers for my taste. Food (or supplies, snacks) grows far too easily, and its production uses very little electricity. Sometimes it is complex in terms of balancing, but it never seems to require loads of sunlight or electricity - which I\u0027d expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have suggestions? I don\u0027t mind a complex or simplified \u0022economy\u0022: both the Snacks mod (just 1 type of resource) or TAC life support (with its 6 types of resources) is fine. What I would like to find is a mod in which there are\u00A0either compact greenhouses that consume\u00A0realistic amounts of electricity for food production (meaning LOADS of electricity, forcing me to use stacks of Gigantors), or in which there are solar-based greenhouses with realistically low outputs, so that you have to build a lot of them (at least the equivalent of those stacks of Gigantors).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just cannot build a space colony in which all the food for my Kerbals comes from something no larger than a small shed, powered by a 1x6 solar panel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry if the text above came across as more of a rant than a question.
