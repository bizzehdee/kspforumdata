I recently started using mods but I was disappointed to see that there are no sound mods yet. I was wondering if it is even possible to modify sounds. I would really love to be able to add realistic rocket booster and engine sounds to the game, I think it would just make it so much better. If anyone can help me that would be just great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T12:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a lot of work has been done on them. The plugin system has access to huge amounts of the game (and can play sounds itself) so it\u0027s almost certainly possible, but it\u0027s also entirely undocumented so it takes a some trial and error to work out how to do things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T18:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve posted some information on doing it via a plugin here if that helps you any.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
