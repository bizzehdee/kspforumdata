Transmitting a set of temperature, pressure, gravity and seismic readings would use different amounts of power if it was all done through an efficient direct antenna like a 16/16S or split between that and a less power efficient relay dish like an HG-5 or an RA-100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod would have to either check each antenna in turn starting with the most energy-efficient and check if it was already in use, and if not use that value, but continuously update as it did so in case the antenna it was looking at got used for the previous experiment or a more efficient one stopped transmitting, or else just give an average which would probably be wrong. Just listing power requirements per antenna type would be simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Witch","CreatedById":202604,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-11T19:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it wouldn\u0027t necessarily be simple to do comprehensively, but I\u0027d be happy with (indeed prefer) a simple implementation of it: just show the EC usage for the antenna that the game would\u0027ve picked at the moment the science result window appears.
