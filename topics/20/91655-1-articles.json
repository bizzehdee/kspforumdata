This sounds really cool (and far more realistic than an Alcubeirre drive), but obviously I\u0027m not going to point my ship at Jool and sit there while it accelerates for a week straight. So I was wondering, would it be possible to make a mod enabling (like the atmospheric time warp) acceleration while in time warp. Obviously the physics would have to be disabled, but perhaps if it could be set to simply add velocity while in time warp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
