In one of them, when I click the warp to next maneuver button (circled below), the game warps to 60s before the maneuver. However, in another save, it warps to 10s before. Which mod or patch controls this? Is this something I can edit myself?

Do you do separate installs? If you have 2 saves in the same install, they should use the same settings.cfg file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way a mod would affect it is if you have a mod that adds timewarp levels. I\u0027ve seen faster time warp levels cause automated stopping of time warp lag behind the desired stopping time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-10T03:54:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2022 03:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ttikkoo","CreatedById":211701,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-10T03:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, sorry - yes, I meant separate installs not separate saves!
