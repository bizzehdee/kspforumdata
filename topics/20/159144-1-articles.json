I managed to get the wireless receiver to work but I could not figure out how to connect 2 \u0022Power Coupler\u0022s together(one on source and the other thr destination). I assumed it was similar to the pipes you can link between things. Anyone have experience with these Power Couplers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERoverDude\u003C/strong\u003E: I have a bit of experience. Power distribution requires an engineer. It will in turn allow any power coupler to connect to any power distributor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDowntown\u003C/strong\u003E: Hi RoverDude, love the mods bud. I have an Engineer working in the Duna PDU. My confusion stems from the 2 power couplers(one wireless[2km range] and the other wired? Sorry i dont have the exact part names atm). I can get the wireless one to work just fine. Its the other coupler that I cant get working. I also have \u0022linked\u0022 two vessels with a pipe. I assumed the wired coupler would work the same way but that isnt the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTalking about the wired Power coupler specifically\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Do i need a coupler on the power source as well as the consumer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.)
