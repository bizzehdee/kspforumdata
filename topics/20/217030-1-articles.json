Dived right in, installed almost a hundred mods that were reported as compatible, for my first playthough. Everything was going fine until the game started crashing. Before even looking at the logs, I discovered it was related to my log file... which was multiple GB in size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis led me to start carefully reinstalling mods and checking the log each time, it took me ages to realise that even on a fresh, unmodded install, there would still be some error messages (I don\u0027t know why I expected otherwise, from my own experiences using Unity). Despite this, I tried to address every new error that cropped up as I added new mods to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s been about a week now, and I\u0027ve not actually played the game properly again yet, and have come to the conclusion that a modded game without any new errors will require both a very exclusive approach to mod selection, and an inevitable limit on the number of mods installed. With that conclusion, I thought it was probably actually time to ask about this rather than keep muddling on through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you don\u0027t feel the need to spell everything out, you can keep in mind that I am relatively computer-literate and love playing modded games; My main questions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAm I right in thinking that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E is not always reporting mod incompatibilities accurately?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs above, but specifically: some might be incompatible and missing relevant metadata?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs above, but specifically: some might be perfectly compatible but just referenced to an older KSP release (especially if either from v1.8\u002B or 1.12\u002B, depending on the kind of mod)?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow much should I worry about errors if I am installing 100\u002B mods that are reported as compatible and working together?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre a certain number of warnings/errors pretty much inevitable with a heavily modded KSP install?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming Exceptions are usually something you want to at least double check on. How concerned should I be if searching doesn\u0027t lead to conclusive information about these errors?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGenerally speaking, what sort of errors are of least/most concern, and/or are there any good general guidelines to follow in this regard?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs above, but with regard to reporting bugs, and posting on mod development threads?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything, I\u0027m grateful that Squad hasn\u0027t hidden all this away from the user. If I can actually get around to playing again, and stop giving myself a nervous breakdown every time I see a new error, I am hoping to find the time to work on patches for some mods that seem to have a potentially quick fix. I\u0027ve already worked out that, at least a few errors, seem very dramatic to the untrained eye \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E, but upon further research are really the log (understandably) lacking the ability to differentiate between specifics or different contexts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any insight, and don\u0027t feel the need to answer all of these questions, or answer them utterly comprehensively. I am more concerned that, given my temperament, and without some answers, I will either just give up, or I will spend weeks getting my perfect modded game setup, decide to take a short break from KSP, and never actually come back and play the game (I somehow almost forgot how great it was).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lingfors","CreatedById":228873,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T06:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone working in SW dev, I would say STOP WORRYING ABOUT ANYTHING WRITTEN IN THE LOG FILE!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust play the game.

I certainly didn\u0027t expect KSP, and especially it\u0027s mods, to have no bugs whatsoever. Most games aren\u0027t as open as KSP on reporting minor glitches to the player via a log, especially if those are practically unavoidable, Unity centred bugs. KSP seems refreshingly forgiving; any other game I\u0027ve modded that threw up a fraction of these errors would either crash in short order, or even worse, add game breaking bugs that weren\u0027t immediately apparent, or delayed but inevitable save corruption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of the reasons I was a bit alarmed when I first looked at the logs. The fact that a lot of mod makers will have something along the lines of \u0022NO LOGS, NO SUPPORT\u0022 in big red letters on the first post, made me think the smallest error could be of concern, at first. Now I realise that those statements are far more to do with the common phenomenon in most games, of users reporting bugs, with little or no pertinent, contextual, or actionable, information included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying not to worry too much, but after installing a handful of mods, near the end of my currently planned selection, my exception/warning filtered log has suddenly ballooned to about 10x in size to almost, 20000 lines of errors from just loading into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and making one 3D scene change. In this case, I think I might revert the last handful of additions and see if there is a way of reducing this to less concerning levels; rather than find out something critical isn\u0027t working after playing for a couple of hours. For reference, the following error types seem to account for the vast majority of this sudden increase:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022

At the very least, I don\u0027t want that CTD caused by the log getting vastly larger than the KSP install itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027m mentioning errors in directly again, I don\u0027t suppose anyone is familiar with this one, which seems to crop up from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/Scattterer related mods installed right at the start of my modding step-by-step install process:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCannot find preset \u0027High\u0027 for pqs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- with a suffix of a planet name, or similar.

I think PQS is related to Kopernicus, but get the impression, is something that can be implemented in other mods without Kopernicus needing to be a dependency.

Everyone has their approach that they think is best. I\u0027ll try to sum up some of my experiences. For context, I typically have at least 3 separate installs, each has 90\u002B mods. I use custom planet packs and custom parts in all of them. I do have a stock install that I\u0027ve added only visual and QoL mods, but yawn, it\u0027s stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot investigating your own issues is, to me, the ultimate expression of consumerism. I download a free thing, and if it doesn\u0027t work I just pester the author of the thing with a \u0022good\u0022 bug report? That feels really selfish to me. That thing I got was given to me for free by someone who put a crap-ton of work into it, the very least I can do is not bother them with stupid pedestrian install issues they\u0027ve seen 100 times before. Sure, some people\u0027s relationship with their tech is very distant, and those people will always need hand holding, and that\u0027s what the rest of us in the community are here for. But if I have the capacity to handle files and open large text files and learn a little and take some educated guesses, then I say that\u0027s on me to do first, before asking someone else to spend their free time trying to help me. My opinion is that if I\u0027m going to push the game with mods, then it\u0027s on me to take care of what I am capable of before asking for help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing somewhat concerned about the state of your log file has advantages for you, too. It\u0027s faster to know a little and be able to fix a problem than it is to post a message to a forum and wait a day for an answer. It\u0027s worth it to understand basic mod structure and conventions, as you can not only help yourself faster, but other peeps, too. I can\u0027t count the number of times I\u0027ve looked over other people\u0027s logs and seen that they have a GameData folder inside their GameData folder, or they have unzipped a mod distribution file directly into GameData, or they have multiple module managers ... these are all things that are quickly/easily visible in the log, but difficult to guess.

Diving into too much detail probably isn\u0027t worth your time unless you\u0027re very familiar with C# and Unity.\u00A0 But there\u0027s lots of high level things in there, and finding LONG swatches of nullrefs written every frame is undoubtedly worth the few seconds it took you to look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor added fun, there\u0027s also an option somewhere to log exceptions to the screen.
