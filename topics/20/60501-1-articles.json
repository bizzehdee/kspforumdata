I had actually planned on doing a whole mod around radio navaids that would go from NDBs, to VORs, VOR/DMEs, and ILS. You would go park your navaid somewhere, and then tune it up, and use an HSI to plot courses around. But I didn\u0027t really get that far, and SteamGauges isn\u0027t done yet. So my next grand idea was an FMS that would by strictly lat/lon based (like GPS, but not requiring any satellite constellations (at first)). That one is still in the works, but will have to wait until after I get Custom Biomes up to speed.
