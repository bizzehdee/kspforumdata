After all, it would let me learn about the mods I haven\u0027t experienced gradually via science unlocks and experimentation, while providing some interesting new fun in general. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one problem. I haven\u0027t actually messed with too many mods outside of a couple basic ones like Mechjeb. So I humbly request the expertise of this board to come up with a good list of them for me to go for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequirements are basically: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Properly compatible with career mode, which is to say that they can be unlocked in the tech tree and are done so in a suitable manner (so not everything unlocked in the first node). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Compatible with each other too. So that it works with other mods on the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nothing TOO broken. Unless unlocking it is equally anti-broken. So I wouldn\u0027t mind getting parts that eventually let me get around anywhere with relative ease if said parts basically require me to have gone everywhere already and sucked up all the science to unlock. But basically, relatively balanced mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard good things about Kethane and that B9 pack (and saw comments indicating they are set up to work with career mode properly), so those two probably are a good start to the list.

This means there is a cost associated with vastly over engineered rockets - you need to be economical and efficient with your designs, and a crashed rocket is actually a set back.

It maintains a running total in a ledger, and when you recover vessels or parts, it refunds you the value of recovered components.
