Because reentry from interstellar was roughly 10km/s, and the stock atmosphere curves are balanced for a much lower velocity reentry, I was wondering what mod i can download or what i can change in the game config files to make the atmosphere curves realistic ie: not explode due to overheating 10 seconds into reentry. And no, I don\u0027t want the entirety of realism overhaul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"awang","CreatedById":138912,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T01:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealSolarSystem/blob/master/GameData/RealSolarSystem/RSSKopernicus/Earth/Earth.cfg#L162\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERSS Earth config file\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for the curve.

I added SMURFF at 0.5 lever to reduce the mass of returning pods, and then bumped down atmospheric heating to 0.9. Works great and feels right - pods with heatshields will come through fine, as will spaceplane parts with a proper reentry profile, but most other things will overheat and explode. I tried using RealHeat briefly, but it was conflicting with another mod and throwing lots of NREs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
