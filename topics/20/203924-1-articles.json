I don\u0027t want life support. Any suggestions would be helpful. (by the way: it only needs to be similar to ksp2 not identical.) \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: I found the mev heavy aerospace mod which has all the things I need from interstellar extended (torch \u002B daedelus drives) I got stockish Orion drive,\u00A0reusibility expansion for it\u2019s landing legs, and extraplanetary launch pads. Unfortunately there are no metallic hydrogen mods (that I know of).
