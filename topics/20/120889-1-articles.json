As for the amount of intake air, i am not sure of a way to do what you are describing directly, but take a look at the atmcurve of the engine. This curve determines the performance and efficiency of the engine at different altitudes, therefore different amounts of air present. As for modifying and generating these curves, take a look at FloatCurve Editor 1.0, it is a unity plugin that allows you to make floatcurves (thrust and atmcurves) for use in the config file of the scramjet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Floatcurve editor: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83246\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83246\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T20:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whizzkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SshockK","CreatedById":151130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T20:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whizzkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whizzkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is slightly more complicated than you might think, the characteristics of the scramjet engine depend on the thrust curve, which should mean that scramjets should have much higher performance at high speeds and altitudes, where the atmosphere is thinner.
