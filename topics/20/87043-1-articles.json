As a failed launch can be disastrous, cheaper \u0027test\u0027 launches would be insurance in case of silly, difficult-to-avoid building flaws. A test launch would probably have no Kerbals in it, even with a manned capsule, and could be launched at some fraction of the original cost. However, no contracts could be fulfilled in a test launch, the ship would not be persistent after the flight is ended (or some effect to that manner), and launches might be restricted to the Kerbin system, though that restriction might not be necessary. Potentially, this option could be enabled or disabled in the new difficulty settings, and the launch discount could be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would attempt this (learning C# is probably a good idea in general), but I don\u0027t have the free time or likely the aptitude. I feel this mod has potential to make the career more logical, and might convince some players to take the plunge into Iron mode without the fear of long-term enfeeblement due to a simple staging mishap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to any who want to try to do this, and to everybody who has already made mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T02:15:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NFUN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T02:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92973-WIP-Simulate-Revert-Launch-v0-10-2014-09-05-for-KSP-0-24-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDoes this fit the bill?\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T03:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much.
