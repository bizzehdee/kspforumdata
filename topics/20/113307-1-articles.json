Though, I had a couple of ideas that I think would be interesting to play around with in gam.\n\nFirst idea was a couple of parts, the first, and simplest, being a bulldozer plow. You attach it to the front of rovers, and with it, you can bite into the terrain of the Mun or whatever other place you land it on, and making new shapes and terrains, though the bulldozer plow would be used primarily to create flat places for landing things. There would also be perhaps large scoops to dig out alcoves in the sides of hills, or maybe even tunnel all the way through to allow a service road. Then you have dump truck beds that you could fill up with dirt, their appearance changing as they go, and then they could drive to a new location and dump the dirt there, allowing bulldozers and cranes the chance to make terrain there as well. It would be fairly difficult, as the rovers would be needing to move several dozen tons of dirt at a time, so rovers would need to be particularly beefy to handle the load. On top of that, it would allow a direct segue into the next idea I had: Bases.\n\nOkay, so, officially, bases are already a part of the game, but whenever I look at one, I just see a really large ship that has landed on the surface. There is no mechanic to place a building on the surface. What I am thinking is something similar to KAS, where you place parts and it builds up into a new thing, but more than that. You would unlock blueprints (not parts) via a tech tree or the similar, which would give engineers new abilities. You right click on them, select something like \u0022Set foundation\u0022, and then you click and drag the mouse to create a square foundation of whatever size you want, and maybe we have multiple kinds of foundations, like \u0022space concrete\u0022 or \u0022struts\u0022 or maybe something a little scifi sounding like \u0022ripple weave nanotubes\u0022 and they could have different stats, like supporting different weights, or having different resistances to seismic activities. But I digress. Anyways, as the foundation is being placed, it gives a listed amount of required materials (which would be it\u0027s own set of resources held in a nearby ship, and would probably include ore from the mining equipment) and a listed amount of time it would take to build it, such as \u00221 hour per square meter\u0022, but you can have other engineers walk up right click, and \u0022join work\u0022, splitting the amount of time down to smaller and smaller fractions, with little animations of them walking around the foundation and working away until they bump into another Kerbal and go the other direction. Also, the bulldozer and building parts from above could likewise lower the required time.\n\nAnyways, beyond foundations, you would build walls, windows, hatches, maybe even domes, each with their own variations and customizable details. Once that\u0027s all been sorted out, you could fill a structure with oxygen, and begin interior work, customizing it towards a specific task, such as making it a power plant, a habitation module, or a farm. These would be unlocked with their own blueprints, and require their own resources, requiring facilities to be above a particular size, and taking time as well. Once a facility is complete, it would have to be staffed, which you could do one of two ways: use Kerbal astronauts to work there, which would require potentially dozens of astronauts using up all their time to keep one building working, or you could ferry up civilians specially trained for such a task, but with the added caveat that these are not astronauts, comfortable to survive in a pod for months, and they would need facilities specifically directed towards them, such as apartments, farms, an administration facility, communications with home, entertainment, and whatever else we could dream up, each with their own Kerbals running them. We build this all up toward an extraterrestrial VAB, which is obviously going to be a massive building and require huge amounts of time and Kerbal to crew it. Maybe a fabrication building to emulate the R\u0026D building back home, meaning we could only build with parts we could fabricate, and unlocking new fabrication requires science. We\u0027d likely have a thing of one fabrication building per planet or moon, or a fabrication building can supply a VAB within 100 km of it.\n\nThird mostly builds on the previous idea, as it is based around the idea of civilians in extended journeys through space, but you could easily have such a thing via other mods or even in stock KSP, though not in large enough numbers for this to really make sense. But it would probably be very 3D-modeling-light, as it would just be a series of messages that pop up with an appropriate image displayed to the right. It would then explain that something has happened, such as a new generation of Kerbals being born off Kerbal, meaning you need to build more structures to accommodate them, or disease has spread through a civilian base and cut the population drastically. Maybe this is the reason for the administration building listed in the above idea, as politics becomes important, else civil disputes can escalate and give rise to new factions, that go off and build their own base nearby and begin competing for resources with you. Some of these messages would have actions for you to take, and they would be semi-random and numerous, each with it\u0027s own weights and triggers that affect all other possible eventualities, but this could give a base it\u0027s own narrative. I\u0027ve only thought about this idea in passing, though, and there is certainly a lot more than what I\u0027ve listed here.\n\nFourth, and lastly, is a very simple idea: Trains and monorails. This would simply be a less tedious version of rovers, allowing you to connect two bases, set a vehicle towards them which will get there in a few days, and then just send it, and go do something else, like launching a new ship.\n\nClearly, these four ideas could be summed up into a single mod, and, in my humble opinion, that would be the most kick ass mod ever, but it would clearly be a very time consuming undertaking. Thus, I decided to present them as four different ideas, to take and think about in their own right. If I ever achieve the expertise to make something like this happen, and nothing has been done in regards to it yet, I\u0027d gladly come back and give it a go, but that probably wouldn\u0027t be for quite some time.\n\nPS. This was a very long post, so I haven\u0027t checked for spelling or grammatical errors. Apologies if any exist.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T20:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**\n  \nChanged content to use default font for readability"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:55:22Z","Content":"Please don\u0027t force a small font size.

It originally looked normal from my screen, but I do everything from my phone, so that\u0027s probably the source of the issue. I just don\u0027t know what would cause fonts to shrink.\n\n1. It wouldn\u0027t have to be deformable terrain. Maybe it could generate static parts spontaneously on the planet surface, which act as part of the planet surface. For tunnels or alcoves, you could have it appear transparent and teleport anything moving through it to something like an instance.\n\n2. I hope someone picks up this concept.

Out of everything you linked, MKS looks the best, giving bases that feel more like bases. I\u0027m still not perfectly clear on what the survey stakes do. As for civilian population, it looks like an awesome idea, but how everything is shaped doesn\u0027t feel right. The width of these parts would create huge amounts of drag trying to get it out of the atmosphere, and everything being spherical results in non-perfect space usage. I assume you would just wanna go with domes for things like observation windows or farms. Really, your base would either look like the stuff in MKS, or construction equipment would be sent up and built elsewhere. I like the mod for the civilian aspects, though, that is indeed epic."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T07:02:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m still not perfectly clear on what the survey stakes do.\n\nPut stake in ground.
