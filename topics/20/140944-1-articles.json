But if your mission is only 14 days, it makes more sense to pack all the water upright, since the purifier themselves tend to be rather heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso for example, what I\u0027ve outlined above wouldn\u0027t work with USI. Drilling ice gives you water, which you electrolyze into H2 and O2, and send some of the water into the ECLSS and some to a greenhouse for the plants, and the greenhouse would make food and consume waste. You\u0027d also, almost certainly, have a water purifier on-board so you consume water a lot more slowly than any other resource - which wouldn\u0027t be true if you didn\u0027t bring a purifier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T21:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118211-comet-tail/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022118211\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/118211-comet-tail/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Comet Tail\u003C/a\u003Eunfortunately almost none of these things would work because RO does not currently support resource harvesting (not even the stock \u0022Ore\u0022).

I just think most people overlook USI-LS because the think it is easier, due to having only supplies/mulch instead of water/waste water, O2/CO2, etc...
