I was thinking an IVA that had the fully furnished aesthetics of the Mk1 Lander Can, compared to the bare bones aesthetics\u00A0that the Mk1 Command Pod we have now has. Do any modelers have some free time that they could invest into making a custom, 1 kerbal IVA for it, with the possible enlarged 3 kerbal IVA?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noob21","CreatedById":160756,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T22:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBumping this because I would really like to see someone make this happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
