Seems to change more or less linearly with speed up to a max around 53*, and seems not to matter much (or at all) which size of blade. Corrections welcome if you\u2019ve found differently, of course...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve searched a lot on the topic, many guides to manual pitch control but haven\u2019t found anything on auto pitch control outside of real-life mechanisms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like an excellent opportunity for a mod to provide an Automatic Blade Pitch Controller, which when engaged would\u00A0automatically set blade pitch proportionally to forward speed. This would greatly\u00A0simplify takeoff and stall recovery, where speed changes rapidly and the pilot is often stumbling to find the correct pitch manually before crashing... \u00A0Then disengage auto-pitch for landing (perhaps bound to landing gear deploy?), where manual control gives you\u00A0excellent control over approach\u00A0speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Can this already be done with some existing smart parts mod that can sense speed and control sliders in closed loop?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Would this need a gain control? Is there enough variation between parts to need it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I talked about maximum thrust, as I\u2019ve been looking for max speeds in my planes. But are there other modes of interest, like best efficiency?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Altitude? So far it seems that the same pitch angle for sea level also works well at altitude... but I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the controller needed altitude compensation as well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Advanced controls for feathering (min drag), braking (max drag), compound propulsion (ie props to reach altitude then light rockets etc), etc. \u00A0@Stratzenblitz75\u00A0 has found an interesting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOlMlRf9qvo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexploit\u003C/a\u003E using heat shields as props, and there are other supersonic builds out there that might have special needs...\u00A0Open to discussion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put this topic here since it seemed right for general mod musing, but if it\u2019s so specific to Breaking Ground that it needs to go in \u00A0the graveyard of\u00A0the BG sub forum, so be it...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-02T21:50:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2020 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-18T17:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis exists now!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002262446\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3213631474\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199464-111-pitch-perfect-08/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
