RCS is not exactly strong, and trying to get a craft to quickly stop without changing it\u0027s course to prograde (or retrograde?)\u00A0while docking to avoid a collision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint is, I was hoping for something that could increase the mobility of a craft via engines controlled by RCS. I can see this mod as not being a very logical mod, that it only works for a small niche of things, but I thought it would be neat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not found this anywhere, so I would want to request this. This is where the questions come in:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen planet mods, things that add new planets to the game, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what about a mod that brings in a Halo from the Halo games?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe gravity for dealing with a Halo would certainly be quarky, since there is no center to the Halo. Not even sure if these things have any real gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, how possible would it be to add a Halo structure/planet to the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully these are decent and not ignorant questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nippie1995","CreatedById":154866,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T21:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the mod for question number 1 would be Throttle Controlled Avionics.
