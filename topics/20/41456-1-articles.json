The reason for that is that I want to be able to continue playing my current world when an update hits. With most mods, you\u0027ve to wait until they are updated for the newer version of KSP - I totally understand that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s the matter with new parts like the B9 or KSPX? Do they need updates for newer versions or will they just work? With mods, I can just uninstall them and accept, that I loose the functionality provided by them, when a new version hits but if I have custom parts built into rockets floating around my world that would be much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it would be awesome if someone could enlighten me in this matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-joe\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T16:12:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by joedemo42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPure Part plugins normally work.. when it comes to plugins it becomes more of a problem since the api and codebase of KSP change... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally it takes a few hours to a few days until (the most common (MJ, B9, Kethane...) plugins are completely compatible with a new KSP release.. so you dont have to be shy of mods, but you should keep an eye when to update etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joedemo42","CreatedById":67869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027d say it\u0027s pretty (update)safe to use custom part packs like KSPX?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-joe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince i dont use that particular pack i cannot tell wether its usable or not.. but from experience i would say you are good to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept for .19 to .20 not much changed for normal parts during updates - and even back then it was easy to fix parts that werent converted by the mod creators yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust check your plugins if they use DLLs or not.
