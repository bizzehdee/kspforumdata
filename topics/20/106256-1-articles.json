If it looks like a real plane looks, then it will most likely fly like a real plane flies.\n\nMy main problem is that, while there are passenger plane cockpits out there, they tend to focus straight to airliners, or it\u0027s a one-pilot deal with no extra seats.\n\nMy request, thereby, is a 4 kerbal passenger aircraft cockpit/fuselage. Traditional pilot/copilot layout up front, reasonable visibility over the instrument panel, reasonable visibility from the side window. Two passengers, directly behind the pilot and copilot seats, each with a side window with reasonable visibility. Internal fuel storage would be highly appreciated, as would be a tail boom, if the size is increased outside of the standard 1.25m frame.\n\nUltimately, I\u0027m looking toward something like the Cessna Skylane. Yes, I know, the Skylane has a prop, and we don\u0027t have props. I am fairly sure Firespitter will be updated, and thereby have no problems with the fuselage simply having an attach node on the front. Alternatively, an engine in the tail boom along with a suitable intake at the front would be fair.\n\nI would do so myself, but I have no knowledge of 3d modeling, so I have to leave the idea up to the community."},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:28:00Z","Content":"Blender or wings3d ain\u0027t so bad once you get used to them (texturing totally sucks though that\u0027s why I just make expansions ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nanyway the closest thing that exists to what you are asking for is the [Kerbonov Kn-2 Cockpit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66502-Kerbonov-Kn-2-Cockpit-Module) by sam hall.
