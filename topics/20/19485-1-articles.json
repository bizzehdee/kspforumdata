I just recently got the mod and you can run your ships with ion engines. I do not know much about it but the ion engines are run by ion battery packs which I think (I am not sure) can be recharged with solar panels. If this is true then this would be ideal for interplanetary mission as you would not run out of fuel. The only downside is that the ion engine only has a thrust of 15.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviatorBJP","CreatedById":41772,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T02:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use an ion engine mod for my long endurance rescue craft. They hang around in my standard orbits of Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus waiting for an inevitable accident that strands my Kerbinauts. The batteries power the ION engines, and solar panels recharge the batteries (albeit slowly). Ion engines generate very low thrust, so they take patience to use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use two mods that have ion engines, and while they do not directly conflict with each other, they do not use compatible parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dishycourier","CreatedById":35171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-17T04:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour request is being addressed.

Trust me on this, it\u0027s all you need. I\u0027ve tried 24, 48, and 110. 24 is a good number, but for this one 48 is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETM-102: 24ish thrust.

What they tend to turn into is never-ending cheat machines for infinite thrust. I\u0027m having a lot of trouble when it comes to how much power the engines should use per thrust unit and how much power each battery should hold. While these parts would be compatible with MMI ingame (EE plugin, similar sizes), they aren\u0027t nearly the same set.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Libra00","CreatedById":29336,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T05:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlightly late here, but: There are a couple of mods that include ion engines.

It requires the Electric Energy plugin which it links to on the kerbal.net site. With the recent addition of the nuclear reactor (energy gain: 5, vs solar panels\u0027 ~0.3) it\u0027s quite a bit more viable, especially since I was having a LOT of trouble getting any kind of charge out of solar panels. Once in a while I\u0027d get a trickle charge briefly, but most of the time not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have really is, I suppose, lack of orbital construction. Trying to build an interplanetary vehicle that carries a porta-nuke, couple batteries, a rover (DEMV ftw!), and a lander by which to deliver the rover, I have a hell of a time getting it into orbit. I even installed NovaPunch and slapped a beefy 5-meter rocket under it and still ran out of gas with an apoapsis of around 45km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TG_bigboss","CreatedById":24189,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T07:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could take that ion engine from MMI and make a copy of it, then edit the cfg file to change the trust to let say 60? that is what i did and my probes i used to test out a flight before the crew did worked perfectly.
