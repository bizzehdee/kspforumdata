But one in particular did something I liked....it kept all the non-RP-0 parts in a separate folder and hid any part you hadn\u0027t purchased yet in R\u0026amp;D. This mod was awesome cuz it kept the clutter in the VAB away, but somehow that mod didn\u0027t end up in my new install, and I can\u0027t figure out which one did it. Anyone know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Figured out it was Filter Extensions i was missing.
