Frankly I find a lot of redundant things in mods, so much duplicated effort. Buggy functionality/parts. Sometimes 1 thing / part can ruin a whole mod or it is simply too complicated or tries to hard to do something totally unique, but I guess there is nothing for it. If I happen to hit on a brilliant unique mix of parts and plugins, it is a shame that the community at large is not compatible to such a thing being shared in a whole easy to use package.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T02:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about KSP mod packs I don\u0027t like is the version mismatches.

This meant that it was a derived work, and should keep the license in-tact.
