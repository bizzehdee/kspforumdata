Our Kerbals need some sort of EVA harness/tether/umbilical cable when performing spacewalks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, KAS can probably fill that role but it would involve setting up winches, wires and all the other stuff. Plus, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027ll have all the capabilities I have in mind...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking about a single part that would allow a Kerbal to attach a cable to his suit (or from his suit to the craft), letting him use his EMU freely without the fear of drifting off, GRAVITY-style. There could even be a function that would allow the EVA-ing Kerbal to reel himself back to the ship! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also \u0022ground\u0022 the Kerbal when he\u0027s in contact/proximity with the ship, allowing him to walk as if on the surface of a planet, or more accurately- crawl. Actual walking could also be implemented via \u0022magnetic boots\u0022 that would constrict a Kerbal\u0027s movement by making him walk slower and be incapable of running, while pressing the jump button would \u0022disengage\u0022 the boots- letting him fly off like normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... That\u0027s my idea... I\u0027m actually kinda surprised there hasn\u0027t been something like this already...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways...
