While i want ksp to have a working steam workshop i think is not possible for the moments, so if anyone knows any application that works as a mod manager for ksp that at leasts let me know what i have installed and all that please tell me D: .\n\nAlso extra question, is there any mod that adds more parts for making land based vehicles to explore a planet? or propeller planes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:43:19Z","Content":"one of them is CKAN:\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager)\n\nyou can save/import the modlist (up left button).\n\nther is also a plugin ( i don\u0027t use nor remember it) that allow to re-install the manually added mod.\n\nit\u0027s not the only one."},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T19:02:45Z","Content":"CKAN is awesome.
