When you build the hotel, you will get contracts to ferry tourists, 10 to 20 at a time.

You can use personal RT-500 recyclers in the station to bring that down to 216 supplies per day, for a mere 25ec/s. An 18t 3.75m supply tank can support that population for 70 days. Adding 5 PPD-F412M agroponics modules will cost you 21t and another 16.5ec/s, but will get your net consumption down to 38 supplies per day for the station, stretching your supply tank out to 394 days. To get this you will need a total of 6382 fertilizer. Assuming then that you launch your agroponics modules full of fertilizer, you will need to bring a 2.5m fertilizer tank with you (and some change) for an addition of around 5.5t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with this architecture, your support infrastructure will weigh around 50t total and need a constant 42ec/s to function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal part count for it is 57-58 parts. 50x RT-500 Recyclers, 5x PPD-F412M greenhouses, 1x 3.75m supply tank, 1x 2.5m fertilizer tank, 1x 1.25m fertilizer tank (optional).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor maintenance, you will have to do one re-supply mission per year or so, carrying 15k supplies and 6,400 fertilizer. Mulch is free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is possible to exchange ec/s and weight for part count total, by substituting the 50 RT-500s for 10 RT-5000s. This will make your colony \u003Cstrong\u003Ecompletely stable\u003C/strong\u003E, since your net consumption will be 156 s/d and your supply production will be 178 s/d.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn that case, your support infrastructure will weigh around 77t total and need a constant 204ec/s to function (much more difficult to do on Jool with a solar grid, but still tame for nuclear generation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal part count for it is 16 parts. 10x RT-5000 Recyclers, 5x PPD-F412M greenhouses, 1x 3.75m fertilizer tank. That is enough to last you for 925 days or about two Kerbal years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor maintenance, you will have to do one re-supply mission every two years or so after that, carrying 15,000 fertilizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps, cheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-07T07:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2019 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Dante80\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-07T15:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess indeed nuclear fuel is the solution for the energy.
