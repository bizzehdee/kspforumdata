Right now we design spacecraft in ksp which all basically have a fixed costs: \u003Cu\u003Eparts\u003C/u\u003E x\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ecosts of parts\u003C/u\u003E - \u003Cu\u003Erecovered parts\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0= cost of rocket launch. Now if we take the Saturn V as an example, a quick google search gave\u00A0me that it cost\u00A0about $1.16 Billion in today\u0027s money to launch 1 Saturn V. However\u00A0the development costs of the Saturn V were an estimated $60 billion in todays money.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat begs the question: Would it be possible to make a plugin that measures the time spend building in\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and have it cost 10\u00A0Funds per minute (for example).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis makes designing spacecraft cost money. Also,\u00A0if u launch an already designed craft u will spend\u00A0marginal\u00A0time in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E thus there will be none to barely any \u0022development costs\u0022. A slider could be introduced that specifies how much funds one minute would cost so the mod is adjustable to any player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward to everyone\u0027s toughts about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCapekerbinaveral\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T07:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is part of the idea behind having unlocking parts in the tech tree cost money.
