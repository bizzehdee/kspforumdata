One can argue that KAS kills docking, but it all boils down to how you choose to use the mods and how you make your own fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have MechJeb installed in my game, but I use it to take over tasks which I already find time consuming and boring to do manually without it. It\u0027s a great learning tool on how to perform launches and gravity turns though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy launch profile is pretty much standard and reliable when I do them manually, plus slow interplanetary burns sometimes take half an hour to perform, so I relegate these mundane tasks to Mechjeb while I go off to make a coffee or something. Rendezvous? I can perform that to 0.01m of my station when I do it manually. I\u0027ve accidentally smashed ships into space stations because of that sort of precision. So I sometimes use mechJeb on these mundane tasks too. Basically what I\u0027m trying to say is that I give MechJeb tasks that I\u0027ve already mastered and have no interest in repeating over and over again ad nauseum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing MechJeb can\u0027t do though, is fly VTOL SSTO planes, which is what I spend most of my time doing. MechJeb also can\u0027t handle horizontally oriented landings, and it can\u0027t auto drive rovers along a set route (it only has auto throttle and heading control).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, while most things in real life are automated like satellites and robotic rovers, it depends on how interested you are in roleplaying. Sometimes I download a new IVA cockpit which looks pretty damn neat, and I\u0027ll fly it manually for some immersion and general fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simon Ross","CreatedById":82582,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T20:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply us MJ for the stuff you have done manually so many times that there really isn\u0027t any challenge, ie...
