To keep things reasonably difficult, I\u0027ve been using TreeLoader to progressively ramp up tech costs at higher tech levels while keeping the starting tech costs almost the same (many thanks to Vim Razz for the idea, though their original post seems to have been eaten by the reorganization of the Add-Ons forum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now TreeLoader is reported to be completely broken with 0.25 (not surprising, since I\u0027m pretty sure it used EZGui), and the linear research scaling offered by the new difficulty sliders doesn\u0027t do the same thing (I\u0027d have to choose between impossible research goals in the early game and free tech in the late game).
