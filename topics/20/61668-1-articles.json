I\u0027d be resizing a radial RCS port for the model, but I want to make a stock-balanced part that takes electricity and intake air and produces thrust. I\u0027d like some thoughts on the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: How to make this balanced (since it\u0027s a small electric engine it should be fairly weak)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: How to make the part take in air from any atmosphere and only produce thrust while there\u0027s intake air\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: How to (if possible) attach a sound to the part\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T18:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing?

I don\u0027t know how to get it to work on any atmosphere, but you can make it work on Kerbin and Laythe by just copying over the MODULE from the jets. Sound seems like another copy/paste job, depending on how you wanted it to sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
