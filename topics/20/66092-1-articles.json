I\u0027ve put in hours of work and I\u0027ve never come close to another planet (Though I saw Sentar from really far away as I missed it). Only today I missed Dres by some margin, using Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I understand that you \u0027Transfer to another planet\u0027 and then once you get close you select \u0027Fine tune closest approach\u0027, but I\u0027m still missing by some margin.

Mechjeb can only change the craft\u0027s velocity to a certain precision in m/s; for a long initial transfer burn or early correction this margin of error can be the difference between an encounter and a miss. If you wait too long to do any fine tuning you may be too far off course to correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, course corrections from further away cost less dV but are less precise, closer course corrections are more costly but more precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually do a course correction about halfway through the transfer, then another to refine it further once I enter the SOI of the target (especially important if you\u0027re planning on aerobraking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemesis1-1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemesis1-1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight I\u0027ve got it.
