Then, a few hours later, I gave up, because it was way too difficult for me to figure out all the syntax and stuff, and I was having so many issues, and in the end, I was left with a glossy ball with the texture directly mapped onto it. So yeah. But, this also got me thinking: would it be possible to make a user-friendly editor to, at the very least, edit planets? I have very little modding experience, so I\u0027m not sure if this is possible, but if it is, that is my suggestion for a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be in game, but I just want it to be user friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe something like SimpleRockets2\u0027s Planet Studio could work! I, and I\u0027m sure at least a few others, would greatly appreciate such a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
