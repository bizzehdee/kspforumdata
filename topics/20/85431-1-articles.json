I love KSP\u0027s modding community and would hate to request to mods, but I was wondering if there was a mod/texture for alternate solar flares? I\u0027ve seen a few in picture threads and have no clue where they get them from. I also have a request for a mod that makes the mach effects more realistic or increases the length of re-entry effects (and I know increasing the length isn\u0027t entirely realistic as it isn\u0027t travelling at almost 10km/s). I don\u0027t really need these mods, however they would make for some nice pics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E.
