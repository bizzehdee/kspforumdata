Thinking of units as \u00225 liters\u0022 only works in the RealFuels context. If you stay stock, that breaks down as soon as you look at anything other than liquid fuel/oxidizer. If you map the apparent volume of RCS tanks to the number of units they contain, for example, you get a totally different result. Xenon gas tanks, again, a totally different result. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock values are chosen with playability in mind; the numbers are handwaved intentionally to make sure that the player gets to see numbers in the resource display during flight that are easy to work with. They are neither very small nor very large numbers. Just a few tens up to a few thousands - perfectly good everyday numbers that even a child has no problems with. As soon as you get into realism conversion mods, you\u0027ll immediately notice that the numbers you end up with while using them are anything but simple. TAC Life Support is a \u0027great\u0027 example: it started out with arbitrary volume units that were easy to handle, and then randomly decided to convert to real volume units. Now you specify the resource consumption of your Kerbals in numbers with eight decimal places, and some resources are present in amounts smaller than 1 unit while others go into the hundreds at the same time. The large storage modules meanwhile can post absolutely excessive numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is sort of a tradeoff you need to decide on making when you create a tank part. Do you go realistic for realism\u0027s sake, or do you go unrealistic for playability\u0027s sake?
