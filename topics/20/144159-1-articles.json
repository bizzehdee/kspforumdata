Kerbalism works in this way, but with many more aspects built into it as well - solar storms, crew sanity etc. If you\u0027re looking for realism in the purest sense, Kerbalism is the way forward. Otherwise, TAC. It\u0027s a good middle point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor streaming, I\u0027d recommend TAC. With TAC, your missions will only fail by your mistake (not packing enough LS), meaning there will be less failure and as a viewer, I\u0027d prefer to see success than constant failure for reasons out of your control. Kerbalism is certainly more likely to mess you up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T21:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou didn\u0027t mention it, but I\u0027ll throw \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support out there.
