Your in your space ship and your maneuvering thruster\u0027s are barely misaligned, maybe your CoG shifted slightly, maybe your thruster placement was off but either way you get a minute rotation when you attempt to translate.\n\nAre there any mod\u0027s out there that can look at the thrusters placed around a craft, and dynamically determine the best way to utilize them to achieve what the pilot is inputting with minimal undesired translations?\n\nI first started to desire something like this while attempting to design a VTOL aircraft using B9 parts. Despite the fact that it (eventually) worked, I still found it extremely difficult to translate and control in hover mode. I couldnt help but to keep thinking \u0022There really should be a computer that controls the thrusters for more stable translations\u0022\n\nIt would also be nice to have it be able to be able stop a translation after the directional key was released. Basically an \u0022orientation hold\u0022 that isnt permanently changed when you roll (as is with stock SAS).\n\nIdeas? One could make a very solid VTOL craft with these 2 utilities."},{"CreatedByName":"The Mechanic","CreatedById":119038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T15:54:54Z","Content":"[Throttle Controlled Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802) could be what you are looking for. It also has a \u0022kill horizontal velocity function\u0022. Only problem is that it doesn\u0027t work with jet engines, because of their reaction time when it comes to adjusting thrust output to the throttle."},{"CreatedByName":"The DigitalAlchemist","CreatedById":133218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T05:04:14Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027ve screwed with this mod for a day now, and I gata say it\u0027s pretty awesome. I really hope the dev of this mod keeps working on it further, there\u0027s a lot I feel it could be capable of, such as full real time control over the vehicle, extending it\u0027s scope to mono prop systems, and being able to hold relative velocity to a target. As is I\u0027ll be making heavy use of it. \n\nIt\u0027s a bit sloppy with really massive ships, but still performs wonderfully. The only thing I wish it\u0027d do is take control of a thruster\u0027s ability to gimbal as well. Perhaps hijack the trims or something to compensate for offset.\n\nThanks a ton for showing me this!"}]}
