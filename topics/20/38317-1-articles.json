I put Parts in the KSP/parts directory (Engineer Chip, Mumech_MechJeb parts, protractor, etc), I put Plugins in the KSP/Plugins directory (Engineer.dll, MuMechLib.dll, etc), I put folders in the KSP/PluginData directory (/engineer, /nodeselect), I put other stuff in the KSP/GameData directory (/HrmHaystack, /KWRocketry, etc). Are you saying that I should have just put all of these in their corresponding mod folders in KSP/GameData? Because if that is the case, I have zero issues with the data architecture.

For Chaterer (as an example) there is nothing in either the thread\u0027s OP nor the spaceport page that says to install it that way. Further, the manual that comes with the download says to put the whole RBR folder into Gamedata. Sorry friend, but you are definitely installing mods wrong. They will still function the way you are putting them in, which actually is plus points to squad for making it work either way, but now all mods can go into their own sub-folder in gamedata. A good way to tell if a mod is meant to be put into gamedata or into the basic game folders is simply to look at the contents of the downloaded archive. If the archive comes with a folder inside containing sub-folders with parts plugins etc. then the entire folder should be dropped into Gamedata. If it comes as a collection of folders in the archive it is probably intended to go into the game\u0027s root directory as you described. However in some cases this may not be necessary, so experiment with it a little bit. The TT multiwheels do require being in the root directory, but almost nothing else does now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways back to your OP question, .21 might throw off things like mechjeb because of the changes to the SAS and the new reaction wheel system. Mechjeb may be perfectly fine, or it may die horribly, there is no way to tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, most of the time mod development stops once it is clear that a new version is within a couple of weeks away, and the authors attend more to community questions and basically sit there waiting for the new version to release so that they can properly update.
