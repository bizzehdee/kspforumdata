However i was wondering if anyone has tried out dx11/12 commands with windows 10 now, and if they have found it to be an improvement over the opengl command?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:25:30Z","Content":"The unity game engine doesn\u0027t have any support for DirectX12 yet, so there is no command for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T18:25:24Z","Content":"The commands have very little to do with Windows 7, 8, and 10. Direct X is an API package and the differences between them are additive, not replacements (i.e. Direct X 11 has everything in Direct X 9 plus some new stuff, there are a few rare exceptions though). However, though the API is the same, the way it executes the methods in the API has changed, which is why the performance is much better in Direct X 11 for the same task. Long story short, it is unlikely to see any significant difference between DX11 on Windows 7, 8, or 10.\n\nAs sal\\_vager said, Unity has to \u0027know\u0027 about DX12 before it could even force it to be used, even if it does contain the same DX11 API calls.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T18:27:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:16:29Z","Content":"Thanks folks. Unfortunately i have discovered that the AA when using open gl has now completely gone, resulting in nasty jagged edges everywhere. Unless i have messed up the command lines somehow. I am thinking i may wait until the U5 update to play again, until then, i will be messing about with settings to see if i can remedy this. Also i cannot access the main menu settings anymore once in the full game, i cannot access the buildings, and i cannot click on the menu buttons... very curious.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe menu/building access problem lies within texture replacer. Could a mod please move this to support section please."}]}
