I am a fan of various mods but first of all I plan to set up a beautiful graphics. I browsed through the addons sections and noticed that some new visual mods have appeared during my absence. So, I am just trying to save my time here and ask you what visual mods pack should I install to get the best results?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, but now there\u0027s also SVE and I have no idea what are the differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goody1981","CreatedById":153740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-06T12:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m also after the same thing (I posted about 8 hours before you haha), but I haven\u2019t been away as long so can help you out a bit.\u00A0To answer your question, after looking around a bit today to refresh my memory I\u2019m pretty sure SVE = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B a few other mods bundled in (like scatterer, DOE, planetshine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m all about making the game look good too, my absolute must haves are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Real Plume (amazing mod, once you realise what engine plumes are supposed to look like in vacuum you can never go back)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Distant Object Enhancement (DOE)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Scatterer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Planetshine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Engine Lighting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Reentry Particle Effect\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and I have previously used SVE (which is beautiful) but found a new one called Spectra which is an alternative (they don\u2019t work together).
