In KSP, and particularly KSP \u002B FAR, the aero effects leave a lot to be desired as rockets that are designed and flown in a realistic fashion basically don\u0027t generate any significant aero effects during ascent. Essentially, we miss out on that wonderful breaking of the sound barrier because of the window for the aero effects being so small, and because of realistically designed/flown rockets not generating enough of the effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, granted, in real life the effect thats seen when you break the sound barrier only lasts a few seconds, but in KSP its hardly even there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T04:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo body? Granted I didn\u0027t really finish my post but I was hoping someone could shed some light on this. I know that one mod (atmospheric sound enhancement) did manage to affect via its .dll, but that mod is only somewhat working right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T05:23:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the most kerbal answer would be: if you want to see more aero effects, then go faster!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
