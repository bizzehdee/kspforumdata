The answer is yes. When you create your 3d model you just have the windows use one of the KSP Translucent shaders and then have the texture pic that is used by the mesh have a low opacity so that the shader can have it be seen through. Make sure that the mesh has an outer and inner wall that are facing in opposite directions. That is, say you make a glass pane 2 cm thick, The normals on all faces should be facing out from the mesh, so if you weren\u0027t using a translucent shader it would look solid from all directions in game. But with the translucent shader you will be able to see through it. The opacity level of your texture will determine whether it appears almost clear to being able to just make out shapes through it. I use this in my Hot Air Balloon because I wanted to be able to see shapes through it and the glow of the sun, so it seemed to be made of rip stop nylon. I have also used the shader, more see through in the bubble canopies of my Zelicopter and Oblivion Bubble ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I would say is, if you plan to use this for cockpits. The weight balance of your craft will be shifted by the weight of the kerbals in it\u0027s seat and kerbals fall out of command seats far easier than you might like. That is why I usually end up back in overlays. The weight stays at your world centre point and your kerbals can\u0027t just fall out from a small bump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-31T11:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224411504\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225580\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221722408442\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ColdJ\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, ColdJ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weight stays at your world centre point and your kerbals can\u0027t just fall out from a small bump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand... We can create our own customized command seat and try to avoid \u003Cstrong\u003Esome\u003C/strong\u003E of the drawbacks by manipulating some of the PART settings, like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    maximum_drag = 0.05\n    minimum_drag = 0.05\n    angularDrag = 1\n    crashTolerance = 6\n    breakingForce = 20\n    breakingTorque = 20\n    maxTemp = 1200 // = 2900\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaking this customized command seat incredibly resistant to torque and crash (and removing drag if inside another part) you may be able to keep the Kerbals in the seats on high G maneuvers and hard bumps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will lose all that marvelous instruments on IVA mods, however.
