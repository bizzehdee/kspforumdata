My preformance have gone quite a bit down after this (can only make rockets with around 2-300 parts). I quess this is because of the mods infernal robotics, deadly reentry, FAR and Ioncross Crew Support that change ingame mecanichs and adds things to be calculated by the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut are these the only mods affecting game preformance? Have a couple of mods adding a lot of parts to building as well (among others NovaPunch and B9).

They take up extra ram space. So, when you first booted the game without mods, it loads lightning quick... compare it to now, pretty slow right?
