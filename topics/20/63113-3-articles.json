And also they should be pretty easily fixed. By my understanding the navball is an actual sphere with the texture overlaid onto it; and the indicators are all quads, or 2D square mesh with a mostly transparent texture on them, which the game moves around the surface of the sphere. Due to that, it should be entirely possible to replace Their textures with something more amenable, specifically there\u0027s a trick from typesetting. If you have a dark colored font, and you wrap it in a couple pixels of a light color, that text will remain readable on any background. So for the indicators, if they\u0027re a light color like the pro/retrograde markers, add a pixel or two of black around them and inside the circle, and they\u0027ll be easily visible on white or black, on black the dark wrap will disappear, and on white it\u0027ll stand out. It may be necessary to make the marker a bit smaller in general to keep it\u0027s overall footprint the same, but this should make everything work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h7zP9yc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h7zP9yc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some of the geometry of the IVA navball prop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bBVfzWu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/bBVfzWu.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve hidden the base and the sphere because they make it harder to see, and moved the quads around , the selected two are prograde and retrograde, I assume DeltaV are towards/away the target, and waypoint is the maneuver node; I can\u0027t guarantee that the regular naveball works this same way; but I suspect it does.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T05:46:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
