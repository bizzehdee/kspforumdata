I miss too much... However, I don\u0027t miss that in Realism Overhaul I have to spend more than half of my time fighting the game code, tracking down bizarre and suddenly emerging compatibility errors, working out what needs to go where, finding the right patches, trying to balance about 50 downloads with 50 different sets of instructions and then of course getting sidelined by bizarre and often dramatic bugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m stuck in this limbo. I cannot get a stable version of Realism Overhaul after many attempts, but I cannot seem to enjoy the stock game either, or with a bunch of expansion mods. It feels like I\u0027ve gone from exploring someone\u0027s 50 year effort in model railway building to playing with a simple wooden train, but I don\u0027t think I have the heart for literally the 6th time to go through and try to get a stable version of Realism Overhaul again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard rumors that someone was going to iron out compatibility issues and meld the mod down into a guaranteed to work EXE install, like a proper total conversion mod, but I can\u0027t confirm that, or even really expect it considering that most people don\u0027t seem to have a problem with it... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is more just complaining than making a relevant thread though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
