This could of course be an even better improvement for heavily modded games which can take 5 minutes and up to load previously on even the best of PC\u0027s. So, do you think this will become the standard in the future?\n\nObviously this is more of a question for the modders, and personally I have no understanding of the complications of having it pre-converted, my skills begin and end at modelling and texturing so I apologize in advance if such a suggestion would be a huge complication to implement."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:54:54Z","Content":"Given you can save a dds file straight from a bitmap package it\u0027s now considerably easier than using the old proprietary .mbm format, so yes I\u0027d imagine so."}]}
