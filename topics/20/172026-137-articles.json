For one, the CloseCycle is technically a high-pressure oven made from glass. Its main concerns are instabilities in pressure and heat absorption from infrared light. Any complex performance mixtures like Hydrazine, which create additional pressure prematurely which would blow up the reactor. They are best used to solid nuclear engines which are a lot more resilient against pressure spikes. Secondly even if the above would not be a concern, the advantage in isp and thrust decreases as core temperature increases, so it\u0027s not really worth the risks as the gains are marginal. Thirdly, even without Hydrazine, its still an extremely\u00A0powerful engine, exceeding all stock performance engines. Its forces you to put a little more thought into your space voyage planning as Hydrazine is mainly mended to boost solid core / pebble-bed performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for your reply... at this point... which engines specifically\u00A0in KSPI-E can use hydrazine? the CloseCycle engine is indeed one of the best - if not the best - i have historically used since the early stages of this mod and heavily relied on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E processes that produce hydrazine precisely for that purpose.

I\u0027ll use the Positron antimatter reactor to power up a nozzle for propulsion -- then shut it down and use a free electron laser for replenishing the positrons. it will require a secondary reactor for that... probably a thermal power one\u00A0so it use the same thermal generator as the positron reactor. This is probably for the development thread, but one can extract positrons from cosmic rays. So just like you harvest solar wind or hydrogen, you can harvest cosmic rays and push them through a scintillator\u00A0to get a cascade that will yield a bunch of neutrinos, gamma rays and muons---- the last two will produce short lived e-e\u002B pairs. A strong enough magnetic field can separate them before annihilation. I am not aware of any engineering design that you can draw from, like\u00A0the free elector laser which looks inspired out of the linear accelerators at SLAC and their laser research.

In-lining the laser will make the ship too long to use an FTL drive other than the Interstellar one.. I tend to use roverdude\u0027s drives that have a finite warp bubble.

I might mistakenly include a part from a mod you might not have installed. Oh! and the tri-alpha has a built in generator. No need to attach a genny. Make sure you add lots of radiators.

Then I radially attached 3 fuel tanks of lithium hydride (625ish units each, these detached somehow without damaging the rest of the vessel, mission control is still investigating). Then I placed a bunch of radiators in strategic and pretty positions until I had more thermal management than thermal production. About 16GW worth, or 23 individual radiators. If you build up too much waste heat, your drive won\u0027t charge and your reactor won\u0027t be efficient. This means you\u0027ll slowly lose max power until you can\u0027t charge your drive anymore. Spam the heat sinks!

Maybe up the mass of your vessel a hair to help with heat dissipation? Also, gravity matters. Much easier to warp when you are far from a gravity well (planet) than when in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. It is reasonable to assume, however, that if your drive charges to full for 1.00C on the launchpad, it will do the same in space if thermal management is enough. I am by no means an expert or anything so I could be wrong about the the spamming of the radiators. I see you added till you were in the green. I usually go about a bit above. For instance the tri-alpha (in my game, ymmv, produces about 13GJ of power and I use 16GW of heat sink. This keeps power from dropping (too much) as heat builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-11T01:41:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2019 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by jhook777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded ps\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
