The Aurora here. I have just recently started an RSS install, but need some help. As one of those people that has to have some logical explanation for things, and lacks the ability to relax without one, I\u0027m stuck. I can\u0027t get past the fact that Kerbals don\u0027t belong in our solar system. I have tried to come up with a few theories to satisfy my self. Tell me what you think of the ones below, and suggest any you think are better. I just need a premise in order to be able to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EIdea 1:\u003C/strong\u003E There are no Humans on Earth any more. The remnants of civilization have almost vanished completely some how. The Kerbals have voyaged for years through interstellar space. Their small colonial transporter (Pod with small crew, cloning machine, DNA) arrives at Earth to set up a new Kerbal civilization. They come upon the remnants of human society and question what happened, much like how we do about the dinosaurs. They are intrigued by our rocket technology we left behind, as most of the Kerbals\u0027 knowledge was lost in the attempt to flee the Kerbol system (Details need to be worked out:D). The Kerbals begin using our technology to build there own rockets in order to explore and colonize our solar system, ultimately hoping to discover what happened to the only other known intelligent species in existence, Humans!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EIdea 2:\u003C/strong\u003E The Kerbals arrive from their interstellar voyage, but find the Earth still inhabited. The Kerbals find it difficult to assimilate with Humans, and eventually end up separated in their own territory on Earth, while the rest of the world tries to decide what to do with Kerbals. The Kerbals are rather disgusted with Humans, as they see genocide, war, corruption, greed and other sinful things they never even thought about doing. The Kerbals eventually make the decision that Earth is not for them, and decide to make an effort to leave Earth for good. The Humans, wanting to get rid of the Kerbals to prevent future conflict and regain lost territory, aid in this effort. The Kerbals are allowed to use Cape Canaveral and Human technologies to develop what they need to travel to space. This explains why their tech is near future, or modern. The downside to the Kerbal migration movement is that nations start to question the ability to colonize space for themselves, as the Kerbals can claim territory in space, yet Mankind cannot because of the space treaty.

The nations of the world, eager to have some of the Kerbals come to their country, offer the Kerbals pieces of territory for them to govern. Such as the USA giving the Kerbals a small state in essence, a territory maybe known as the Kerbal States of America. All of this in an effort for the Humans to get the benefits of Kerbals. The Kerbal territories become like colonies, in which the mother state gains from the Kerbal\u0027s incredible hard work and ability to do immense projects without issue. The Kerbal race begins to become divided from this, with places such as the Russian Federation of Kerbals or Kerbal\u0027s Republic of China. As the Kerbals fall into the jaws of Nationalism, they feel divided and competitive with one another, eventually feeling the drive to go back into space racing each other in the process. The nations of Earth just watch and gain as the Kerbals become reflections of themselves. I think it would be an interesting way to play. One day launching from Russia as the Russian Federation of Kerbals, and the next from Florida as the Kerbal States of America. This premise also goes well with some really neat flags I found!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T20:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhilosophy question: are Kerbals the playthings of man, or are men the playthings of Kerbals? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T23:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use regex\u0027s approach, and am eagerly awaiting someone replacing the kerbal assets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAurora","CreatedById":138888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T01:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use regex\u0027s approach, and am eagerly awaiting someone replacing the kerbal assets.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do that.
