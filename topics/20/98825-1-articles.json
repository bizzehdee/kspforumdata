That is a rather complicated beast, very fun, but very advanced. It\u0027s really something to add when you start getting bored with the game, it gives it new life. KW Rocketry is a part pack, so it should work fine. Part packs don\u0027t necessarily go obsolete with each version of KSP unless they heavily rely on plugins for various functions (like parts that require Firespitter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDelta V:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for an overview for newbies. Get something that shows you Delta V. I have no idea why the stock game doesn\u0027t have that yet. Delta V is a meter of how much effort it takes to accomplish tasks, like getting to orbit or transferring to another planetary body (typically expressed in meters per second or m/s). You can see the Delta V required for each maneuver node in stock but strangely it won\u0027t tell you how much delta V you have in your craft.

With Engineer you can see how much dV your craft has in each stage while constructing it, and how much it has left while flying it. One other thing, because the amount of dV required changes based on gravity and atmospheric resistance, most dV maps are for KSP are simplified to readings at Kerbin sea level. Engineer lets you choose the body, but in most cases you want it to say Kerbin. Though you will want to change to body to see your Thrust to Weight ratio so you can make sure your return craft will leave the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Tracking\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-90-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-2-3-0-(Jan-20)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock \u003C/a\u003E- enough said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the only two I personally consider absolutely required.
