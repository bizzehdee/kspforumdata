The next piece that I would love to see is an actual bridge. \n\nOnce upon a time however, I used to be a very talented modeler using 3DS Max. If some one could prompt me in the right direction that I could educate myself on the matter of making my own parts, I may be inclined to make a few parts myself that I would of course share. I actually see quite a bit of potential for these parts especially since there was never a lot of them to begin with."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T10:29:08Z","Content":"You should try the [Add-on Development](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/37-Add-on-Development) section, and more specifically the two sub forums with it. There are a lot of resources there, and you can always ask. Usually people developing mods frequent those places more and may help you better."}]}
