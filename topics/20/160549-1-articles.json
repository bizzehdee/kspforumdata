I pick what skins i want for my kerbals. Then go on a mission. But after going back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and going to the texture replacer GUI all the skins are set to a random skin from the skin pack i have installed. So i just use suit packs for texture replacer because they don\u0027t reset after missions. Does anyone know how to fix this auto revert glitch? Is it a issue in installation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
