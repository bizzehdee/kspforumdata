You can have this set up as a batch file, so that all you need to do is doubleclick a single file. Bam, stock installation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo re-enable all mods, simply use the \u0022un-prune all\u0022 list. Probably also best as a batch file, even though it is just a singular command, because it saves you the trouble of manually typing it into the command line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, keep in mind that just disabling all your mods doesn\u0027t guarantee an unblemished stock experience. For that, regardless of how you handle your mod disable, you\u0027ll also want to delete your Physics.cfg and PartDatabase.cfg files in the KSP root directory, so that starting up KSP will regenerate them with default values. If you don\u0027t do that, then there may be remnants of mod info left inside those files, and if they\u0027re responsible for your bug, you\u0027ll believe it is a stock problem when it is in fact not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You could of course include the deletion of these files in the disabling batch file...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gal20040","CreatedById":143824,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T07:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
