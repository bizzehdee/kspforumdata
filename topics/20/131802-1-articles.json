I am having two glaring issues with the Kolonization mod. These are issues that I have not been able to find any forums on or even videos on how to fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue #1\u003C/strong\u003E: The parts and modules that I have to build with look entirely different than what I am seeing in the creators website and on videos I have seen of people using this mod altogether. Meaning, I have paid attention to how many modules users have and I am seeing I have way less. I have a total of four modules and one or two bases\u00A0Furthermore, the modules don\u0027t have the cool colors and such, just simple black and grey. Case and point, I do have as many cool modules, bases, and other USI Kolonization pieces as I am seeing other people have in their tutorials, videos, and photos.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue #2\u003C/strong\u003E: With expandable tubes, when I am building my modules and ships, the expandable tubes do not seem to lock in place on the modules when you try to attach them to the doors of the bases. I am able to get them to turn green indicating they will be attached yet they don\u0027t \u0022lock\u0022 to the green dot and when I test connecting the tube to another module base it simply goes through the second module as if it\u0027s not even there. If I wanted (and I don\u0027t) to connect the tube to the top of the module it will \u0022lock\u0022 to the green dot, but not when I connect it to the doors of any of my modules or bases.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvice for both issues would be appreciated. I am new to the forum, I tried to attach images for both issues but did not see anywhere to insert a photo other than from another website link.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T08:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can hotlink images via the \u0022insert other media\u0022 button which is at the \u003Cem\u003Ebottom right\u003C/em\u003E of the editor window, not at the top like all the other buttons. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your problems, you should probably go to the UKS mod thread and ask for help there. However, I can already tell you this: you have an installation issue. One, you are missing parts; two, you are missing textures. This is a direct result of a wrong installation. You may have accidentally put a second GameData folder inside your first, or you may have decided to pull the mod out of the USI subfolder it is shipped in, or any other similar thing... This will break many parts, because parts look for their models and textures via hardcoded file paths. If you change the folder structure, whether intentionally or by accident, many of those paths will point towards nowhere and the part will fail to load (or lack its texture).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if you second issue is also related to this, but I would fix the installation first and then see if you can still reproduce it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-11T08:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2016 08:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
