Is it possible to make a mod which can act as a cheat sheet by providing all the major commands required for basic operations, or giving an in-game tutorial on how to do your first launch, orbit, docking, etc..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, even people with no programming knowledge will start using kOS and learn some programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-11T10:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u2019re already listed in the documentation. I haven\u2019t used kOS for years but i seem to remember writing the scripts\u00A0in notepad\u002B\u002B and the in game console was only used to run those pre-written scripts\u00A0so for me personally, the way it\u2019s done now is fine (although I don\u2019t use it as said above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there was also a site (maybe something on here) where people shared their kOS scripts (a bit like the craft files) and a lot of basic tutorial style scripts were distributed there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
