This is why the sent some radio signals to them because the higher amount of stars increases the chance for life. I read some article also speculating that since stars are closer interstellar travel would be easier and we might see signs of a civilization trying to colonize its cluster or an ongoing war between two species inside one. So it would be nice to have a mod that places you on a new homeworld in the middle of a globular cluster with many big giant stars, black holes, neutron stars, and any other type literally at your doorstep some as close as 1 light year and the grand centerpiece would be a black hole at the center for you to check out. Maybe a mod that places you in the area of a cluster but not inside of it so you have to fly to it yourself. Anyway I just thought it would be a good idea because it would make interstellar travel more easier and also give you a mini \u0022galaxy\u0022 to fly around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j5opuX2V0Qo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-21T10:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a lot of stars.
