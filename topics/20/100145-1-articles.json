FAR comes with a DCA (Dynamic Control Adjustment) option that limits the control surface movement the faster you go. I need a complete opposite of that - the faster you go, the more control you can exert. If I hold W/S most of my designs overreact and go into stall at low speeds as they have too much control authority but respond slowly (or not at all in high altitudes) at high speeds. Is there a plugin that does this? It would help me immensely.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T23:18:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theend3r**"}]}
