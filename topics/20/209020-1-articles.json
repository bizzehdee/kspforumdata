I downloaded the mod from curseforge, boted up my game and it didn\u0027t work. I tried changing the version of the game no luck either. I saw the mod had a seperate game data folder so I removed the contents of the game data folder and put it into the \u0022Kerbalized Spacex file, then put the entire file in the normal ksp game data folder, however still nothing. Any tips?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
