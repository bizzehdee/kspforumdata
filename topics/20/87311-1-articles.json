I really wish KSP would allow long-term, progressive science like with what NASA does. Send a probe to a distant planet, have it orbit, and then collect science. It takes a while to get a clear picture of what the probe\u0027s instruments detect, and science is a process of many repetitions of the same experiment to find an answer (if one exists). It would be fun if the game would model this for the player, or at least make it a bit more fun to discover new things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T17:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks plenty, those all look really neat. Yeah, the \u0022we\u0027ll never tie science gain to time\u0022 niggle from back when Science was first introduced was a sore spot. It basically rules out scanning surfaces with satellites for trickle-in science gain and such. It should be up to the player to decide if they want to warp through it to gain it all at once to 100% scan a planet. Hopefully they revisit this down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to trickle-in science with ground wandering with diagnostic tools would be great, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T17:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDMagic Orbital Science is cool.
