It worked great for a few months until I decided to switch over to the much less meticulous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E method of installation. I reinstalled and updated a few of my manually installed mods, including chatterer, via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E when I\u0027d switched over. After that, chatterer ceased to work. I\u0027ve reattempted getting chatterer to work several times over, to no avail. I can\u0027t tell if I\u0027m installing an outdated version of the mod, or if I have another mod obstructing chatterer\u0027s abilities. All help is appreciated, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
