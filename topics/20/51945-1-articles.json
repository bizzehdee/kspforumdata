As they are, they need to sit and make fuel for a bit to rendezvous with the tankers/refineries in Mun orbit. The first 4,000 unit versions don\u0027t have an onboard converter so they can\u0027t make fuel and don\u0027t carry enough to get back up to orbit after landing. They do work on Minmus, enough fuel to get down, tank up on Kethane then lift and rendezvous then refuel from the refinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo last night I tried my Kethane drilling rover with two heavy drills and a DROMOMAN\u002BInfernal Robotics docking arm along with a 32K lander with its two heavy drills removed and a couple of side mounted clampotrons added. (The rover turned out to not be able to reach the top mounted port, even after I took out the short girder supporting the port.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults were disappointing. Aligning the port on the arm and on the lander weren\u0027t too difficult. I positioned the camera behind the port and drove back and forth a few times to align sideways then used the arm for fine sideways alignment and to adjust for height and tilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems came from the ports not wanting to lock together. I had to nearly crash the rover into the lander and come close to joint failure on the arm before they\u0027d connect. That ate up quite a bit of time, so did landing over 3KM away from the rover. Not wanting to have MechJeb land ON the rover, when it got to just before the final descent burn I quickly aborted the landing then clicked land somewhere. (Need to develop a low profile, self sustaining, targetable beacon.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce connected I transferred all remaining rover fuel to the lander and jettisoned the rover\u0027s tanks and engines. (With Seperatrons so they\u0027d go high and crash land. I like self-terminating debris.) Tanking up on Kethane proceded same as with the drills on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last nail in this project\u0027s failbox came when the lander hardly used any less fuel getting back up to orbit than it did as an all in one with the two heavy drills. After making delivery and refinement of the 32K units of Kethane I crashed the lander then blew off some time driving the drill rover to destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking I should bring the whole operation down to a 10KM Mun orbit from its current 15KM orbit. Think that would make much difference in the rovers\u0027 and landers\u0027 fuel use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you go about mining Kethane? Everything on the same vehicle or leave vehicles on the surface to do the drilling and other vehicles to carry it up to orbit or do you refine it on the surface and carry the fuel and other products up to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spiritplumber","CreatedById":84232,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T10:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find it more efficient to have a \u0022gas station\u0022 on the surface, it cuts down on the number of landings and dockings.

I find the multi-role \u0027all in one\u0027 harvesters are grossly ineffective at doing anything but refilling their own tanks..maybe feeding a few smaller ships. For long term, mass harvesting operations I prefer to make several smaller single-role craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst on the ground in the Wellhead, small lander type craft with drills and decent kethane storage. These ships typicaly dont leave planet once deployed(they they are able to move, either via short jumps or skycrane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext in line would be the transport truck. The sole purpose of these is delivering kethane to the dropships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, of course, would be the dropships and planetside processing. At this point I either load the kethane into a ground based refinery (this is only done if the fuel made will be used on said planet), or it gets loaded into a dropship. These are small lander type craft that can carry a large amount of kethane up to orbit...they are tailor made for the planet they will be operating on/around. The dropships have just enough engine/fuel to touch down, make orbit, and redevs once...anything more cuts into overall productivity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne in orbit the kethane is transfered to orbital station, where its either processed into needed fuels, or later transfered to a larger facility where the fuel is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though it comes down to playstyle....you can mine kethane 100 different ways, and unless you are just down right horrible at craft design your gonna see a net gain from your mining ops.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T14:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, I don\u0027t ship Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E99% of what my spacecraft need is Fuel and Oxidizer. The vast majority of my dockings use less than 15 units of monoprop. The only ion drive spacecraft I use, I consider one-way probes, or toys. As a result, I tend to refine on the surface, and ship fuel and oxidizer to orbit. Kethane patches are huge, and if I decide it needs to be stored, I usually leave it in the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvaluable to my setup were two mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System (To allow Kerbals to connect the various spacecraft together)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer (To automatically pump fuel and oxidizer from one part of a spacecraft to another, and back)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the basic setup I wound up running over the Mun in 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.21/Screenshots/screenshot145.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot145.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Left foreground, the Wellhead. Left in place on the Mun, it used three large drills, and a single large converter, powered by three Kethane reactors to mine and refine Kethane. Kerbals stationed in a Habshack nearby used one of its three KAS Winches to attach to the Citrus-Class Spheretanker, shown in the background, whose spherical tank holds appoximately 3/4 the voulme of a Rockomax Jumbo-64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso shown: A flag being used in the capacity of \u0022low-profile, self-sustaining targetable beacon,\u0022 as per Galane\u0027s musing in the original post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not going to be using them in that capacity, it can be helpful to remember that if you divide the radius of the world you\u0027re landing on by 200 km, the result is very nearly the linear distance in meters of one second of arc Latitude. e.g, 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B00\u002710\u0022 North of target on the Munar surface is approximately 10m North of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.21/Screenshots/screenshot307.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot307.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Citrus-class Spheretanker uses paired LV-Ns as its landing and drive engines; as a result, it typically only used about 1/7 of its capacity to go from the munar surface to a 50 kilometer altitude orbit for rendezvous with the Depotsphere, as shown above. The particular depotsphere in the image holds about 6 Rockomax Jumbo-64\u0027s worth of fuel when filled. I never even came close to emptying the monoprop tanks it had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ultimate setup I wound up using over Minmus was different, primarily because I got tired of needing to make nine trips to fill a depotphere, and I had decided to send two depotspheres as part of the 20-ship Dunar fleet. Minmus\u0027 significantly lower gravity, and having to get twenty other spacecraft ready before the window made me decide to go with the \u0022Ship Kethane\u0022 option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.21/Screenshots/screenshot453.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot453.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is hard to tell from this viewpoint, but the Minmal Sphereminer has four Rockomax-16 fuel tanks clipped into its sides, which, if I recall correctly, turned out to be something like 4-8 times the fuel capacity it actually needed to perform its mission. It used four small drills powered by a single Kethane reactor to fill its 96,000 unit spherical tank Kethane capacity, after which it used its four LV-Ns to return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.21/Screenshots/screenshot459.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot459.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, it would dock with the nuclear-powered refining station, and fill up the storage depotsphere with refined fuel and oxidizer.
