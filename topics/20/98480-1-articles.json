Are the B9 parts more fragile than the stock ones ? I rarely had any survivors, while on the stock planes the pilots survive crash landings way better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T21:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear: You can\u0027t land a plane in one piece?

However, they are not impossible to land in NEAR or FAR. I\u0027ve landed 50 ton shuttles made from B9 parts before with FAR at 120 m/s airspeed. The trick is that you have to come in more horizontal than vertical, and also to have plenty of landing gears. The heavier the craft, the more landing gears you will need or the landing gears will buckle. My shuttles typically have five, one in front and four just behind the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
