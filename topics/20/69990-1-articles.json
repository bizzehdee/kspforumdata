I have an SSTO with a B9 Sabre M engine, with the SABRE M precooler attached, and the precooler always says it\u0027s \u0022offline\u0022. All my intakes are the \u0022DSIX Diverterless Supersonic Inlet\u0022, which attach radially. I have them attached to the wings, not the precooler, but the precooler is attached directly to the engine.
