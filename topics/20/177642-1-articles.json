I used to play on MKS mods, but I\u0027ve switched to Kerbalism at one point. And now, after scanning a Min or Minmus I still see bunch of resources coming from MKS(dirt, chemicals, and so on). Is there a way to get rid of those?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrmaybe the Scansat mod is adding those resources?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-18T11:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIk, these resources are added by the \u0027CommunityResourcePack\u0027 (which is required by Kerbalism and MKS as well).
