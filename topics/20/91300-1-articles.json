This would eliminate the abrupt and often violent deceleration experienced by the vehicle when the boosters suddenly cut out and allow you to jettison the boosters while they are operating at low thrust in order to maintain near-constant acceleration during separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince autostaging occurs when fuel reaches zero, and you\u0027d likely want to jettison the boosters shortly before that point, since the thrust output during the last few seconds would be too low compared to the dry mass of the boosters, perhaps the plugin could somehow trick the game into thinking they are empty when they are actually at about 1-5% fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not sure exactly how parts work in the game, but it would be nice if it could be applied to all boosters as a category rather than individual parts to allow easy support for add-on parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose also it would be convenient if this behaviour could be toggled as a tweakable while in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T04:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use HoneyFox\u0027s Engine Thrust Controller, or my Real Fuels, to add thrust curves that do more or less what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T04:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about a plugin auto-staging before the SRBs are empty but for the rest, I\u0027m all for since it\u0027s basically how real SRBs work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are usually dropped when their TWR nears 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf all the things SQUAD could be doing, I think tweaking existing mechanics to better reflect real life rocket stuff should take priority.
