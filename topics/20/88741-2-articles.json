But now, with this community tree, you will be defining what nodes are there for modders to use. The modder that peviously made sure that he has just the right amount of nodes for his stuff now needs to fit the same stuff into the potentially quite different framework that you\u0027re developing here. It also seems a bit naive to imagine that every mod out there has plenty of parts at its disposal. There is a mod that simply adds a fusion drive, for example. Nothing else, just a fusion drive and its constituent parts. Right now those get tossed somewhere into the upper end stock nodes, and that\u0027s fairly lame, so if the community tree comes and says \u0022we have a high-end node perfectly suited for fusion drives to be in!\u0022, then would you fault the author for wanting to put his parts into it?

Again, I think you\u0027re over-extending scope. This really is not a particularly hard problem space.

Given the audience is modders, I have a lot more faith in their ability to work with config files, and I expect that even if one messed up and put it in a black hole, that\u0027s something for the modder to address, hence no consideration needs to be added for this project other than to make sure we have paths to the stock tree.
