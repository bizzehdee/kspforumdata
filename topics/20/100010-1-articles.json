Even if only for a few quick launches and some basic aircraft stuff, it\u0027s good to at least get acquainted with Vanilla KSP.\n\nAnd when you do decide to start introducing mods, you gotta handle it like a 1980s French character in an action movie and go in slow and with aim.\n\nWithout knowing exactly what you want and why you want it, you ended up doing the worst thing someone can do and that is to handle mods like\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJUt_x0gwug?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\nNot every mods play nice with one another.\n\nNot every mods are lightweight and you have a limited amount of memory to work with.\n\nNot every mods are things you will actually need.\n\nYou just got into KSP so it\u0027s understandable but you should try to limit yourself to the bare minimum that you **need** (not *want*).

Don\u0027t make Module Manager patch in over 4000 patches people, let alone 7365 like I did.\n\nModule manager patches do not consume memory. Models do. You can patch every stock part in the game with 1000 separate patches each and it may take a while to load but it won\u0027t crash the game. On the other hand, loading a lot of new parts with new models will fill up the memory quickly.\n\nAn example of a patch is Ferram Aerospace Research. It adds new properties to the control surfaces in the game, but it doesn\u0027t add any new parts. While the plugin itself will consume some memory, this is a fraction of a single part model. So, if you install a lot of \u0022packs\u0022 like B9, KW Rocketry, OKS/MKS, etc. Well you are going to eventually hit a barrier there.\n\nAnyway, I thought I\u0027d mention that, however this thread is getting a little old so the guy you are replying to may not respond (just be aware).
