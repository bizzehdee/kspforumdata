It\u0027s more intended for sailing on the ocean lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effects you might want are usually part of a whole weather/aerodynamic system that can only be found in flight simulators. I play flight simulators and even for them they come stock with crappy weather systems for which you would want to download (buy) a dedicated weather system. Although they should serve KSP but even the stock ones are sophisticated code to develop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously a system of that magnitude is not to be expected and a simpler version might give satisfactory atmospheric effects also but I\u0027m merely stating it to where realism can go and where a simple plugin like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is stuck at and thus how far of a stretch it is to expect realism and the effects requested. But that is me saying it since my version of realism is that of a flight sim which ksp isn\u0027t to begin with.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, the weather systems are not dynamically generated in Flight sims AFAIK but are preset weather conditions or updated with real world satellite data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as the weather systems work in flight sims you have the same weather on kerbin all year round in preset mode. We don\u0027t want that do we? In the other case,\u00A0 Kerbin doesn\u0027t exist in real life and has no satellites around it so the dynamic of weather changes would be based on a algorithm based on nothing other then changing to a random weather type. It\u0027s possible, I\u0027m not against it but how is that then realistic?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat random system certainly provides problem as it will actually affect launches. Imagine a random gust of wind at the launchpad. Normally there is weather forecasting like in rl, now you just get hit by a gust of wind making your monstrosity fail at the launchpad. Now the mod serves as a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow visibility effects like you suggest in flight would involve stratus, cumulus and cirrus clouds on a planet with a Karman line 2/3rd the way which would look strange I think on a planet 1/10th the scale compared to real life even if it does add the effect you desire. A typical troposphere for Kerbin would be a much thinner layer so low altitude visibility would likely look like a very thin band of clouds or mist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, weather systems like in flight sims are potato killers. They cripple systems when they\u0027re loaded with effects like full cloud layers, wind effects, storms and maybe even thermal differences since weather dynamics are largely changed through thermals in the atmosphere. It will not be a problem for my computer hardware but the mod must be available for a large chunk of people to make it even remotely popular and thus attractive for a programmer to write. To make it doable you have to make compromises how realistic you actually want it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can get done theoretically and it\u0027s a splendid idea, but above are things that come to my mind when envisioning the idea. Besides that, it\u0027s probably possible to create something more realistic then current KSP, but less realistic then a weather system of a flight sim. But the question is, what is that then? Otherwise the weather system just consists of arbitrary values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut please continue though as I really always wanted something like this in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T10:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113009-theroundcow/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113009\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113009-theroundcow/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@theroundcow\u003C/a\u003E I was browsing through the mods pages and found this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8979464902\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161673-ksp-142-shipeffects-continued-1084/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may simulate part of what you want as for effects.
