You would then have a machie that, for example, uses karbonite and knowledge to make liquidfuel and oxidizer at a better rate than the machine that comes packed wih karbonite. So for example where the karbonite machine uses 10 electric charge and 10 karbonite to make 1 lf and 1 ox this new machine would use 5 electric charge, 5 karbonite and 1 knowledge to make 1 lf and 1 ox. Of course these are not balanced numbers but you get the idea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this even possible? Am I the only one that want\u0027s this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
