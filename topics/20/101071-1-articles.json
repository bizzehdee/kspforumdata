I noticed that Ionic drives have similar thrusts to RCS ports (only off by 1 thrust unit!) and it is much more practical, but there is no way to use an ion drive for control. (Other than using action groups, but ain\u0027t nobody got time for that.)

But incredibly efficient. My mod also includes a prototype pulsed plasma thruster RCS which are real and also extremely efficient. Try my PPT RCS thrusters on small probes that\u0027s what they are actually designed for in real life.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T07:07:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"}]}
