I\u0027m aware of the Adjustable Landing Gear mod but I haven\u0027t seen any response from its developer if he or she is working on it or not. Perhaps the game is still in a state that is unfavorable for that mod still. But anyway, making space planes just doesn\u0027t feel right without proper landing gear and I\u0027m struggling to cope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T15:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll wheels\u00A0are kind of broken right now due to problems in Unity, the next update, 1.2, should address them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not expect any landing gear mods to come out, or be updated, until some time after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no, there is no current ETA on 1.2, it comes when it comes.
