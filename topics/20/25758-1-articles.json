Some kind of weird bug were if I push the dock mode in KAS the miner explodes in a continuous explosion that is both epic and horrifying, I fooled around with it trying to prevent this, I turned off the SQUIDs tried, connecting to different ports the best I could get is the explosions stopping with the wenches and drills blasting off the miner. I tried replicating it on Kerbin but it won\u0027t happen there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
