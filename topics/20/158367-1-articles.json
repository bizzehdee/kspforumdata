Ideas in themselves are not covered by a license, that is used to protect actual work. Ideas are protected by patents (in general, meant to protect intellectual property), though have to meet requisites to be granted a patent (e.g. novelty, usefulness, non-obviousness). Indeed a number of ideas have been covered by patents in IT, and I would not exclude some in add-ons could be patentable too. But while our rules require a license be stated for any add-on (even a non-license, what is important is the author lets clearly know what rights he wants to grant to others, so his work can\u0027t be used without consent), there is no requirement to patent ideas, and so far no modder I know here showed to have made one. On the other side, a few modders have clearly stated what is in their add-ons is their own intellectual property, and so far I have always seen such statements respected in this community. On yet another side, it could well be an idea came from someone who we don\u0027t know about, but a modder found it and liked to implement it in his work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs suggested already, I would always give credit to the original author who first showed a specific idea (though, such idea could not always have the patents \u0022requisites\u0022, e.g. may not be a novelty if not within our community). And before using one idea, I would try to contact the original author and have his approval.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut because ideas are not registered unless patented (or at least there\u0027s a formal statement we could use to track one to an author), lack of evidence about ownership doesn\u0027t mean the idea can\u0027t be reused (contrary to all published works by community members, where property is evident in itself and lack of a license means no rights have been granted to reuse the work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T15:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStupid question, but how do you apply for a license?
