How can i go about making a new install of an older version without messing up the instance with my current career save.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy first foray into modding was well before i learned the ins and outs, and it was the very first KSP1 that i installed. I do not have much experience in the realm of computers and am probably over thinking the hell out of this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know that I cannot just rename the primary KSP1 folder and still have everything work like it should.. right? It would mess with that String Association with the Filepath?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I am thinking of PC meal moving all my mods and saves into a different Instance that i cloned.
