The probe properly decouples but the main rocket (the part above the adapter) wont come loose. When I click decouple, the screen wobbles for a few seconds then the main rocket sticks. I made sure the probe isn\u0027t too long and its not attached to the engine. Is it just not compatible with the new KSP update?"},{"CreatedByName":"DGKacey","CreatedById":123016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T02:56:50Z","Content":"KW didn\u0027t get an actual update to 1.02.

One thing I haven\u0027t tried is removing the interstellar visual enhancement mod. The reason I haven\u0027t done it is because its just a visual mod idk why it would have an affect on the parts. And apologies if I posted the same question somewhere else.
