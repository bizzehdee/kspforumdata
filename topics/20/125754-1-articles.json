I hacked a load of ships into orbit around Ike (quite big, fairly low mass, no atmosphere, pretty nearby planet), and crashed them into the planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrouble is, I put them into orbit at 10km, but they hit the surface at the altitude of whatever mountain they\u0026#39;re passing over, sometimes as high as 7km. This makes all the calculations useless!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want a nice smooth planet, with the whole surface at 0km high. I\u0026#39;m happy to use a mod, or mod it myself, if I can figure out how.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy first lesson is intended for Thursday 19 November 2015, so advice before then would be greatly appreciated!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T06:57:42Z","Content":"\nYou would use Kopernicus mod to create a planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114649-1-0-5-Kopernicus-Beta-%280-5%29-November-17[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry KopernicusExamples as a starting point\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://github.com/Kopernicus/KopernicusExamples[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere was a problem looking similar to yours\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/137234-WIP-Toy-Solar-System-0-01?p=2254673\u0026viewfull=1#post2254673[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis post looks like its solution\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/137234-WIP-Toy-Solar-System-0-01?p=2256907\u0026viewfull=1#post2256907[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Search \u0022deformity\u0022 value in your planet cfg file)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cosmo-goblin","CreatedById":153722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T22:34:37Z","Content":"\nThanks! This looks like exactly what I need - unfortunately I haven\u0026#39;t been able to figure out how to even start using it... Since I\u0026#39;m on time pressure here, I\u0026#39;ve come up with an alternate solution - I hacked my ships to an orbit 13 km above a 3 km high expanse on the Mun, as well as hacking Mun\u0026#39;s gravity to negligible. That way it\u0026#39;s an easy 10,000 m above the actual surface, and the ships more or less stay where I put them (since orbital velocity is so slow). This has the added advantage that they\u0026#39;ll stay in sunlight for the whole lesson!\n"}]}
