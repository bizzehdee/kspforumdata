the Single Step (\u0022A journey of a thousand miles begins with...\u0022) A-9 launcher was under construction while the pilots were flying contracts to keep them from retiring.\u00A0 This one, I\u0027m fairly certain is a bug, though it would take me more than a week to reproduce (start a career, unlock the appropriate tech, build a jet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the other situation, I\u0027m not \u003Cem\u003Ecertain\u003C/em\u003E this is a bug, but if it\u0027s as intended, I\u0027d like to know why this behavior occurs.\u00A0 I\u0027m running Kerbal Construction Time, of course (it\u0027s part of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u00A0 If I edit a rocket that\u0027s under construction, or completed and in storage, the completion date is set back by a more or less reasonable amount of time, based on how extensive the change was.\u00A0 Change the size of a payload tank -- hardly any effect.\u00A0 Upgrade an engine and change the tanks for the new propellant mix, big hit.\u00A0 By contrast, editing aircraft (specifically, ones that have been put back into storage with \u0022Recover Active Vessel\u0022 from the KCT menu for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) doesn\u0027t seem to have any level of \u0022this is barely any change.\u0022\u00A0 If I land the jet above, perfectly (zero damage), \u0022recover active vessel\u0022 to get it back in storage, then edit the craft, first, it loads in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E in nose-up vertical attitude (like a rocket -- and if I don\u0027t reset it, it\u0027ll then load \u003Cem\u003Eon the runway\u003C/em\u003E that way next time I launch); second, before I make a single change I see 0% progress on what had been a completed aircraft (in other words, I may as well scrap it and build a new one); third, clicking \u0022fill tanks\u0022 resets the build clock like a full rebuild, \u003Cem\u003Eand doesn\u0027t even refill the fuel.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Eexpect\u003C/em\u003E to be able to haul an undamaged airplane back into the hangar, fill up the tanks, and have that process take no more than a few hours after the recovery process completes -- not 120 days to build a whole new airplane, using the same parts, and without even filling the fuel tanks again.\u00A0 Obviously, the length of time is mostly due to having spent few upgrade points on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E -- but taking as long to check the tires and forget to fill the tanks as to build a completely new airplane certainly seems wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, something connected with contracts seems to have a bug related to FAI awards for airplane flights, and KCT seems to have a much uglier bug (in terms of playability), also related to aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m presuming I\u0027ve got everything installed correctly; everything else seems to work fine (except that there\u0027s no good reason researching the tech to launch crew to orbit ought to take 12-15 years of game time -- our history did it in six and a half years from the 1951 game start date, or about thirteen years from the first WAC Corporal launch, fourteen from the first A-4 tests, which are long in the past by game start -- but that\u0027s another issue entirely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
