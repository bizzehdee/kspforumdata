I can\u0027t think of anything player-driven in the game that would affect weather so there\u0027s no real reason to have the game itself simulate it in real-time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think our best chance of this happening would be someone who could work this project into their educational course or simply have an extreme passion for atmospheric dynamics. Which would be relatively rare I would think. Even on a small scale simulating weather would be a huge project to undertake, which is no doubt why no one has gotten around to finishing such a mod yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond simulation, there\u0027s also the graphical aspects to consider. I recall someone was making a graphical mod that let you simulate rain and even that was dropped due to the extra work on the game engine. We have to question weather KSP is even capable of \u003Cem\u003Edisplaying\u003C/em\u003E the weather with a playable framerate even if it doesn\u0027t have to actively simulate it. People already have trouble with just clouds.
