After you decouple, switch to that part, set autolanding, switch back to highest stage. Mechjeb will land in background in real time. Also looks cool.\n\nAs for a plane - HOLD ON im testing right now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"bartof","CreatedById":132556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:37:09Z","Content":"So I\u0027ve tested mechjeb. It cannot handle turning planes in atmosphere well - wobble a lot, doesnt control throttle, doesnt brake, only controls steering \u002B gear. I think writing such plane landing computer will be extremly hard because of aero forces. If we could edit mechjeb plane landing autopilot behaviour to somehow turn mostly by rolling it might work?\n\nEDIT: Mechjeb allows landing only on KSP and grass field. Definetly likes long planes, less wobble. No possibility to choose other landing spots (like eve).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T00:10:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bartof**\n  \n\\"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T07:39:45Z","Content":"Take a look at [Flight Manager for Reusable Stages](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292), it lets you fly both parts of the plane.\n\n(As an alternate, [StageRecovery](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677) would automatically recover it)\n\nIf you want help with the flying, [Pilot Assistant](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073) is pretty good."}]}
