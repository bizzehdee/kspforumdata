Would be perfect if it had a built-in aeroforce calculation lile the mod Trajectories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope you know any mod like this,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T18:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand you correctly, Trajectories already has this ability. Just choose the \u0022complete\u0022 option in the Trajectories window and it will show your landing site even for airless bodies. Sometimes the X is hidden by the terrain, so I frequently will use \u0022Body Fixed Mode\u0022 as well,\u00A0which shows what the trajectory would look like from an observer on the surface of the planet/moon, rather than from the vessel. That mode would then show the trajectory line hitting where the X is, even if you can\u0027t see the X.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuniboyyy","CreatedById":156671,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T08:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that\u0027s awesome.
