Trying to get back into the game again since its been a year\u002B since I played it. I tried to use that replacement for Kerbal Space Port on Curse site but it seems like a lot of the mods are outdated, or generally broken and Curse\u0027s layout seems unfriendly.\n\nWas hoping for a few recommended mods for simply giving more reason for exploring the solar system, more ways to science, and generally giving more purpose to visiting the existing planets besides getting science, taking off and leaving to never return. Maybe for example colonization, or the ability to mine to refuel vessels from said planets.\n\nI dunno what exactly. I\u0027ll be honest when I say I liked science career mode much more then the full career mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T00:44:12Z","Content":"You might try RoverDudes mods he has a whole list of goodies [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-8%29-2015-02-27](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-8%29-2015-02-27)\n\nEDIT- And KIS to help build things [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-2) and KAS [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29)\n\nAnd for Science maybe N3h3mia has a list of goodies [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112336-0-90-Kerbal-Environmental-Effects-Study-%28KEES%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112336-0-90-Kerbal-Environmental-Effects-Study-%28KEES%29)\n\nEDIT- And ScanSat for mapping planets [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-0-90-SCANsat-v10-0-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-Jan-29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-0-90-SCANsat-v10-0-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-Jan-29)\n\nEDIT- To make Ksp look better theres EVE [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements) or Proot Renaissance Compilation artworks remake [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76972-0-90-KSPRC-Renaissance-Compilation-artworks-remake-V-0-1-9-5-%2818-02-15%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76972-0-90-KSPRC-Renaissance-Compilation-artworks-remake-V-0-1-9-5-%2818-02-15%29) and PlanetShine [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96497-0-25-0-90-PlanetShine-v0-2-2-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96497-0-25-0-90-PlanetShine-v0-2-2-1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T00:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 12:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daggywaggy","CreatedById":140910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T00:57:57Z","Content":"Thank you for recommandations!
