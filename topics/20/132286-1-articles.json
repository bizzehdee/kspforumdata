As you may know, the KSP Nexus Site has been operational for some time, but\u00A0given the recent developments in the modding community regarding Kerbal Stuff\u00A0and as a fan of KSP, I\u0027ve been looking into how the Nexus can better support the KSP community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re looking forward to adding KSP functionality to the Nexus Mod Manager\u00A0and this can be done in relatively short-order.\u00A0However, we cannot justify doing so until we have a reasonable stable of files on the network. We\u0027re also working with pjf,\u00A0the author of CKAN, to investigate a collaboration in order to\u00A0provide easy downloads from the Nexus within CKAN, but again this will be fruitless without more KSP mods on the Nexus. We\u0027re keen to work with mod authors to ensure that we are providing the tools that the KSP community needs,\u00A0but to put things bluntly, we need the support of more KSP mod authors if we are to justify implementation of\u00A0KSP specific features to our services.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Nexus has been building a network to support mod authors since 2001. \u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ERegistration is of course free, providing\u00A0access to our file\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Erepositories and\u00A0forums.\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EWe are supported in-part by ads\u00A0because when you\u0027re serving 2 Petabytes of data a month,\u00A0pushing upwards of 10Gbps in bandwidth, asking for donations just doesn\u0027t cut it. However, our supporters can enjoy an ad-free experience for a one-time payment of a couple of dollars.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EUploading a file is a\u00A0fairly simple process that will provide several\u00A0features for user interaction like commenting and\u00A0bug tracking. Members\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ecan enjoy an established\u00A0infrastructure that already supports over 100,000 files from over 50,000 fellow mod authors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ECouldn\u0027t\u00A0we just arbitrarily upload the mods from the Kerbal Stuff torrent to our site? Sure, but the Nexus has a long\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0record of respecting the work\u00A0of mod authors and we encourage accountability within the network, which includes refraining from uploading content without permission.\u00A0By uploading your work to the Nexus, you\u00A0will help ensure that we establish an accessible and perpetual repository of mods for the KSP community. Don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m excited to see developments based on Kerbal Stuff\u0027s source, though again, as a fan\u00A0I feel it\u0027s my duty to offer what services I can to ensure the health of the KSP modding community and will do my best to accommodate your needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, take a look around and feel free to upload any of your creations using the \u0022Files\u0022 button at the top of the site: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nexusmods.com/kerbalspaceprogram\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nexusmods.com/kerbalspaceprogram\u003C/a\u003E.

If I may ask a few questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe KSP mod community is very keen on using explicit licenses to communicate the mod author\u0027s wishes on the use and (re)distribution of their work. I know the Nexus asks mod authors to add some words to a description page on the same matter, but it seems much more free-form. Is there anything inherent to the Nexus ToS that would somehow impede KSP mods to continue to use specific licenses, and such licenses to be respected?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI guess a question to both you and your peer \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110413-jadedcat/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022110413\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110413-jadedcat/\u0022\u003E@Jadedcat\u003C/a\u003E for Curse: is there anything that would prevent both Nexus and Curseforge to exist side by side, both being available as an option for mod authors to host their work? I am not asking for contractual particulars, just in general whether you see any obstacles to a peaceful coexistence.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMy third question is actually already partially answered... whether the Nexus could work together with CKAN. Even if NMM were to be adapted to support KSP directly, with the momentum and userbase CKAN already has, it\u0027s to be expected that it would continue to be relied upon by a significant part of the userbase. Letting them interface would likely be an important part of making this cooperation viable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t so much see the Nexus as a replacement for the official source, but as another community offer.
