When constructing any kind of orbital space station, it can dramatically increase your part count to add RCS \u0026amp; Monoprop to every piece that you send up to attach. What if you could make it where a kerbal on EVA could go out and grab ahold of a piece (by hand, not with a winch) and drag it to a location with his EVA thrusters, and then attach it to the appropriate node? This would enable you to add structural additions to a station without the need for additional monoprop \u0026amp; RCS thrusters. Plus it would also enable you to take parts off of one vehicle and construct another, all while in orbit. I\u0027m guessing it is probably impossibly hard to code, but it would be super useful for gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T02:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou kinda can, but you need a Kerbal for every ton of mass you\u0027re moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, you can EVA and remove the RCS parts and ship them back down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T05:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively you can use construction tugs instead of giving every module its own RCS and control system.\u00A0 I tend to do this even without KAS.\u00A0 Station bits are launched with no control systems unless they specificly need it for some reason.\u00A0 Launcher handles control until it reaches the proper orbit and the tug comes out to grab the part (launcher then deorbits).\u00A0 The tug is basicly RCS jets, mono prop tanks, Power and a probe core with lots of extra reaction wheels to deal with the off balanced thrust/COM its likely to have to deal with.\u00A0\u00A0 At most this approach adds 1 docking port to the modules part count due to the tug needing a port to dock to in addition to the one that connects to the station although you could use a Klaw if that was really an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith KAS like maverick said you could just send a kerbal out to pull off the RCS jets after the fact, just have the tanks wheels and prob core as a section that jettisoned after construction is complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
