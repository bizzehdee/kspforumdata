( hopefully there will be a minning mod to allow you to build something on other planets) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy program is based on a permant presence on the MUN, Munar orbital station ( mainly science and hitchhiker pods with some fuel, mono, kethane) with manned/robot landers that carry half fuel and half kethane and processors that land, mine, and fill their tanks then orbit the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the tankers, nuke rockets, launched with just enough fuel to get to the Mun ( the kethane mod gave me the idea that I can launch larger volume payloads if I simply don\u0027t fill all the tanks on the rocket) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen transfer to the mun, Orbit and have the fueler/miner meet them, fill them up and make a return to kerbin making several aerobraking orbits to save fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E when they get low on fuel ( I leave enough to transfer and brake to orbit at the Mun) I send them back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecurrent fleet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have 3 miner/processors ( went thought a few designs) all can be robotically piloted or manned. so I can send them anywhere to explore when needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a single mun orbting space station, just a few pods and hitchhiker containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and 4 refuelers , 2 with twin Lvn motors which act as tugs for the other 2 fuel pods that mount smaller rockets to make rendezvous with other ships, when they transfer the std rocket fuel pods dock to the rear of the LVN equipped ones. I use aerobraking to save a lot of fuel when I return to kerbin and they don\u0027t weigh much when they are empty so the fuel to move them between kerbin and the mun is much less. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have sent a few mission out so far and I plan to have kethane mining every where I can.

Whenever a launch a mission to anywhere - duna, moho etc I bring up the parts and the fuel tanks empty and then construct the ship in orbit or docked with the fuel depot - fuel up and then leave. It saves having to lift the parts off of kerbin along with the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it seems like a hassle then you could argue that it would be easier to edit the persistant file and add the fuel in yourself. I\u0027m trying to be more realistic - if we ever IRL get a permanent presence in space we will need to not have to rely on Earth to bring the supplies up - if we can mine H3 from the moon, water \u0026amp; iron from asteroid etc that would be more cost effective in the long run. Same with kerbal - if I can supply resources without having to ship it from kerbin then all the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong term I\u0027m thinking of exploring Laythe - if I need more fuel for the excursions it\u0027ll be better to source it more locally than to lift it from kerbin and then take the year or so long route of shipping it out to the jool system.
