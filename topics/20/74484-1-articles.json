Of the twenty threads that had posts after mine to do this, I believe only 2 or 3 were mods that released or updated, the rest were people talking about mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it is good thing that there is this much discussion going on as it shows the strength of our mod community. However, especially with Spaceport going down, there is no location where you can go to find recently released, or updated, mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another thread (which I can\u0027t find at the moment, it was a side-track to that thread\u0027s topic), there was discussion about doing something like this, so it has come up before and it seemed like people liked the idea at the time. With no one stepping up to do it however, it kind of just petered out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m seeing if people still like the idea and if so I will create the thread. Note that this thread will simply be a place for authors to post when they release or update a mod so players can see they have done so, I\u0027m not going to try and index or archive the thread in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, \u003Cstrong\u003Equestion for the poll:\u003C/strong\u003E Should I create a thread in the Add-On Releases and Projects Showcase sub-forum with a thread title of \u0022Recently released or updated mods\u0022 with an opening post as follows, and then submit a request to Squad to sticky it. I am open to revising the text in the opening post if anyone has suggestions, the yes/no in the poll is if you want this thread to happen, it does not lock in my example post that follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpening post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------(Start example post)------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERecently released or updated mods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the mod release and updated announcement thread.

A better approach might be to make a subforum where mod devs can make an extra thread for each mod only to announce updates, beside the usual thread for that mod.

A single thread might have the same problem that the release forum has, too frequent updates that would push everything off onto previous pages. A dedicated forum would allow for easier tracking of the mods you actually care about through subscriptions and/or signature links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow you would moderate something like that might be a problem though. Is it possible to allow only the original author to post in a thread? You wouldn\u0027t want to get updates on a thread whenever someone makes a \u0022great update\u0022 post (which will always happen despite any instructions not to do so), and forcing moderators to closely watch over such a sub-forum doesn\u0027t seem feasible. Locking a thread and unlocking only for updates by the author also doesn\u0027t seem like something moderators would like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T00:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) All mods battling for attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire point of this is that it gets attention on mods that would otherwise be missed under the discussion posts on other mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERestricting the thread to only be posted by mod authors when they release or update one of their mods, and the suggested format of a short post without screenshots or other media, is intended to avoid this \u0022battling\u0022 effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this would require moderation and so involvement from Squad by please see my closing comment about Squad\u0027s involvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Information I don\u0027t care about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis release and update thread is actually my attempt to remove the information I don\u0027t want. I care about what mods have been released and/or updated. While interesting, all the discussion is just chaff I have to wade through to find this out when I\u0027m trying to add new mods or update my existing ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I go away on vacation for two weeks, I get back and I want to know what mods have been released. At the moment, this information is buried in each mod\u0027s individual thread. For reference, to visit each thread in the Add-On and Development sub-forum that has a post in the past two weeks, I have to go all the way back to \u003Cem\u003Epage 14\u003C/em\u003E. It simply isn\u0027t practical to visit each of those threads so how else do I find out what\u0027s new and updated? At the moment, I don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Sub-Forum for mod release updates only\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that this would be a better solution, assuming you can automatically lock all threads in the sub-forum so only the thread author can make new posts. Otherwise this is a bigger burden on Squad to moderate and that is something I am trying to avoid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I made the opening post, I did not think this would be a practical solution. If it is and we can get Squad on board, this would be the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Squads involvement (New sub-forum, moderation load)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest factors in this is that for this to work it has to not be an additional load on the moderation staff that monitors the board. I am not a big enough name in the mod community to have directly talked with Squad before, but submitting a request to a mod to have a thread stickied seemed likely to be approved. The more involved we make anything, the harder it will be to get Squad on board, especially with the forum upgrade they are trying to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for moderating the thread, I was hopeful that we as a community could self-moderate and would only require mod help for people actually trying to cause a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Overall goal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal with this can be summed up with my example from point 2. I\u0027m away for X days/weeks, how do I find out which mods have released or updated?
