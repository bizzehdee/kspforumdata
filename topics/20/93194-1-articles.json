I want to use Better Atmospheres V5 and the Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack - Interstellar V2 but they both come with roughly the same folder structure, meaning obviously one would replace components of the other. Can anyone clarify whether I can use both in some way? Or is it either one or the other? And if I can only use one, which one you prefer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CapCornsnack","CreatedById":111302,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not so sure about using both at the same time, but I haven\u0027t tried it before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I prefer Astronomer\u0027s Visual packs, but they both offer different things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did is I tried out both and decided which I liked better, that is what I suggest doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T23:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a potato of a computer, use better atmospheres, if you have a top of the line gaming PC, use astronomers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
