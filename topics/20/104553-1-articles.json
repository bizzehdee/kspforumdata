I would like to have the craft automatically hold a certain pitch and heading, to avoid having to tap the \u0027W\u0027 key constantly during my initial ascent. I saw one of Scott Manley\u0027s older videos and his version of Mech Jeb\u0027s SMART ASS had this feature, but I can\u0027t find it. Is it gone? There\u0027s an option to hold a certain altitude, but that\u0027s not really useful for my purposes. Any help is much appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T00:24:01Z","Content":"There is nothing in stock that will do this.

Under the surface options of the SMART ASS I get options to point prograde and retrograde, up and down, and a couple others which I can\u0027t remember now (I\u0027ll try to send a screenshot later), but none of them are for holding a pitch and heading.
