I didn\u0027t think about it at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. I had a mission to Mun where I had landed and gathered quite a bit of science. The problem I encountered was during landing, my horizontal velocity caused the engine and fuel tank portion of the lander to break off. Everything else survived though so I thought I could bring up another mission with some of the KAS parts and simply attach a coms unit to the broken lander and transmit back the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed nearby and EVA\u0027d and took a Communotron 16 and stuck it on the lander, set it to talk to mission control (using remote tech also) but when I tried to transmit the science I gathered, it said I didn\u0027t have any communications device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why this happened? I assumed that as soon as I put the coms device onto the other ship I would be able to transmit without a problem.
