Realism means DIFFICULT. FAR is overall an improvement over a lot of things, but it also means you can\u0027t pilot your rockets in the same manner - and your building will be difficult. Trying to turn your rocket may result in failure to turn due to atmospheric forces... or it may result in the thing doing a flip and pointing the wrong direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Re-Entry is... harsh. It makes returning things VERY difficult. With the Mk1 pod, I lost a lot of earlier missions because I was trying to return things with it and it would end up pointing the wrong direction (Due to FAR, mostly, although it probably still would in stock), burning off all the parachutes, and then smacking into the ground. Attaching some of the B9 airbrakes to the pod has helped, but before I unlocked them... it was difficult. I ended up doing some wonky builds with Procedural Fairings and protecting radial parachutes on a strut with those... It worked! Don\u0027t judge me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC can also be harsh, but it\u0027s not difficult to plan ahead with. Nor is it very mass-demanding for smaller flights. Flights out to Mun and Minmus with just a 1m inline all-in-one container work fine. It can be hard earlier with power requirements so you don\u0027t freeze to death, but if you make sure you have enough batteries and don\u0027t stick around on the dark side of things too long you should make it just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech2 flips science on its head. you want to return things for some time, since it can be hard to get a proper connection without any relay satellites. And getting your relay satellites up can take some effort! Plus, limited range on communications means that you\u0027re restricted to Minmus and the Mun for some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all, though, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s made thigns a lot more fun for me. A lot more thought involved. There\u0027s another plugin in development that\u0027s meant to impose build times on rockets, but it\u0027s not quite to the functionality I\u0027d like to install it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T15:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERSS, FAR, DRE, RT2 and MFS are some of the ones I use, I would not vouch for RSS unless you like spending long amounts of time on ascent and in the VAB\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheJoseph98","CreatedById":81838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T16:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mmmmyum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mmmmyum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERSS, FAR, DRE, RT2 and MFS are some of the ones I use, I would not vouch for RSS unless you like spending long amounts of time on ascent and in the VAB\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are RSS and MFS?

It allows you to edit planets. By default it shuffles the planets in the Kerbal system around to represent the real solar system. This means it also scales up the size of planets (Kerbin is about 1/10th the radius of Earth). This makes it very hard to even reach orbit, let alone get anywhere. You need 16.5km/s of dV just to land on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMFS = Modular Fuel System. It allows you to tweak the fuel the engines use and the tanks contain. The fuel mixture you use determines the ISP, thrust and reaction mass density. This means you can build rockets with dense but innefficient Hydrazine\u002BLiquid Oxygen for your lower stages and use efficient and lightweight Hydrogen\u002BOxygen for the upper stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a DRE link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-0-22-Deadly-Reentry-Continued-v4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-0-22-Deadly-Reentry-Continued-v4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T20:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealism mods I use: FAR, Deadly Re-entry, TAC Life support, Realistic solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T13:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheJoseph98\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheJoseph98\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are RSS and MFS?
