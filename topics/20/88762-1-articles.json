Cumbersome, heavy and not at all great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is this: the colliders aren\u0027t very precise. Even without starting an engine pistons have the tendency to move a bit through the cylinders. When they\u0027re moving they bite into the cylinders, pulling and pushing them around and often the pistons suddenly fly through. Lowering physics delta time works a bit but the setting won\u0027t go any lower than 0.3. Come to think of it: Gears and drive belts/chains are a problem as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... is there a way to confine the pistons in a sort of \u0022magical bubble\u0022 so they won\u0027t collide or ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... is there a way to produce a model with moving meshes like the Infernal Robotics cylinders and still be able to attach parts inside it (piston rod - bearing - piston, and the top of the piston is essentially a rocket engine, for example) without violating certain principles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... anything else? Wait for Unity 5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been dreaming about this for a long time and it would be awesome to build reliable engines and other more detailed technical stuff! Imagine the cyclic/collective of a helicopter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
