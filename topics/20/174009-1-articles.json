Anyway, people keep saying \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is a must-have, so I gave it a go. And, sure enough, it has plenty of info during the building stage in KSP. However, when I\u0027m actually in-flight (or even stationary at the launch pad), the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E button is darker and seems to be not available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a massive help to know the remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E I have. Thus far I need to eyeball it, which is usually OK (I tend to over-engineer a bit anyway), but on a few occasions where I messed up a planned manoeuvrer I could REALLY use this... Does \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E not have this information? Or am I just not accessing this info correctly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Dear administrator - I\u0027ve figured it out. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E has a setting where I either need to put in an additional module on my rocket, or toggle the setting off.
