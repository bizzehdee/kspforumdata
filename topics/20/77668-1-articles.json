Similarly, I checked the research tree and they are not there requiring an unlock either (similar to the Engineer mod where you must research the parts from the first step research tree).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone could please explain to me the proper installation of MechJeb, I\u0027d be very appreciative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steampunked","CreatedById":22771,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T02:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENevermind... it\u0027s under flight control.
