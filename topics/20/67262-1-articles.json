I\u0027ve done everything in Kerbal that I thought was hard so it was time to switch. However, I deleted RSS again because it was causing some VERY weird glitches to happen. But I loved the size and the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth deleting a bunch of mods to keep it around (I tested it out, I had to delete almost everything to get nearly no glitching, and I can run TONS of mods on stock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wish Kerbal could be the size of the real solar system without glitching.
