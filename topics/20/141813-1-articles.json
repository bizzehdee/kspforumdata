And of course Nertea is busy maintaining more amazing mods than I would think is possible, so I\u0027ve been wondering (hoping) if there are any other mods which expand his selection of LH2 engines and tanks. Of course there is KSP Interstellar but that is very complicated and I don\u0027t really need everything it add, although I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve looked into it very deeply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there aren\u0027t any extensions, how difficult would it be to make some myself? I don\u0027t know how to make 3d models and import them into Unity but I figure I could probably make MM configs for existing models, maybe from other mods that I don\u0027t use. If so, does anyone have suggestions for this?
