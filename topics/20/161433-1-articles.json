My game was crashing a lot and I want this to be cleaner and I want to get more efficient with modding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, right now, I am manually installing a mod and I am seeing that some files from that mod\u0027s GameData file already exist in my KSP GameData folder. For example, I was manually installing Ven\u0027s texture revamp and saw that it included Module Manager 2.7.2 while I already previously had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E 2.8 installed. I was told to not add the 2.7 because Ven\u0027s will work with 2.8 but KSP 1.3 won\u0027t like 2.7. Good advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I am installing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E MKS and am seeing that a lot files in the Mod GameData folder that I either already have or in some cases have a more complete set of. For example, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E MKS comes with the Firespitter plugins, but I already have the Firespitter file and it has a lot more than plugins, in it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion is, is there a streamlined way of doing this or is that exactly the work that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E was made to alleviate?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0Is this a part of manually modding; going through these files individually? Because I\u0027m not sure blindly moving over GameData folders and duplicating\u00A0files are a stable way to play a game, not to mention, it leads to clutter which leads to the urge to clean install, sometimes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA more serious question would be, if i\u0027m dealing with these duplicate files, how do you decide which to keep? My logic would say that if it\u0027s already been installed through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s probably the newest version.... maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-02T00:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2017 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ItsSeanBroleson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GonDragon","CreatedById":174274,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T01:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the first thing should be actually\u00A0know\u00A0what are you installing. Some mods has dependencies, that means, they NEED another specifical mod to work. Some others, go a step further, and not only tell you that they need another mod to work, but also they\u00A0Bundle\u00A0that dependencie with the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, when you download a mod to install it manually, there is a posibility that you are, really, installing more than just one mod. At this point, you should think \u0022\u003Cem\u003EWhy there are so many folders in this mod, and why do I need them?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. If you took a briefly look at them, probably you can recognize that every folder belongs to an individual mod, and only one folder contains the mod that you actually are trying to install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, What to do?. First of all, read carefully the thread where you downloaded the mod. Some mods overwrite files of other mods for compatibility; All the mods that do such things, advice you about in his thread or in a README file. Second, check those folders, what mods do you have right now; It\u0027s more probably that a mod that comes bundled was outdated, than a mod that you installed by yourself. Third, install only what you need; If you already have the dependencies, and nothing should be overwrited for compatibilities purposes, install just the actual folder of the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
