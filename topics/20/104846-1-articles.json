It will take some time for me to update it too:\n\n-I have to see what changed in KSP stock 1.0\n\n-I have to fly Valentina around for the first night cause hey... you\u0027ll do that too. Take the girl out for a spin.\n\n-Then I have to load up .90 1.3 civ pop and see what breaks. \n\n- Regolith will need an update thanks to the stock ISRU resource system (hey.. it\u0027s regolith but stock!)\n\n- Once I figure out what\u0027s broken I gotta fix it (expect a night of fixing things)\n\nI suspect 3-4 days to update my mod for 1.0. Thursday I have no time for that thanks to the NJ government needing a jury so I suspect by friday I can get an update out.\n\nThat\u0027s my schedule. I can\u0027t imagine how other mods will go but I suspect the same song and dance for mods: KSP modded state gets released a week after the stock update."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T18:47:31Z","Content":"I would not want to be Sarbian right now, especially with MechJeb... man, I\u0027ll bet that needs a huge rewrite with the changes to aerodynamics and re-entry heat.
