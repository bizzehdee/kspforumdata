I would love to request a Stand-alone app to add specific parts from a mod to an install of KSP. The current method I use is very time consuming and I find that i switch in and out of a modded install of KSP with all my mods installed then look at the various part and compare them, then i have to track down the part inside the mod and add it to the KSP install i want to use the new part in. This method to add parts works fine but it IS super slow when you are trying to make a fresh install of KSP with a soviet theme or USA theme for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIngame there is the stock part calalog or the awesome Part Catolog mod and even the Simple Part Organiser mod. Outside the game there was Mod Admin app which was great for intalling mods. But nothing exsists that allows you to point an application to your mod downloads folder and preview the parts and compare them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn it simplest form the Stand-alone app would have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epreview part mesh with texture \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eread part.cfg and display part details as seen in game \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eability to do side by side comparison of parts \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Egroup parts by function \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Einstall part to definable KSP install path maintaining part folder structure and dependancies. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is my idea rough and ready for for you to have a think about. Maybe with a tool like the above I would see some more awesome mod packs like Flowerchilds Better than Starting Manned or parts pack authors could use this to preview their work easily without waiting for a single mesh to load in Blender. I know i would make the sexiest collection of parts I could find and keep my game from crashing every time i played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you do with a tool like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T16:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been in the same boat since I first started playing...I would be all for using an app like that. I know you mentioned KSP ModAdmin, and thats what I\u0027ve been using to selectively delete parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a great tool, and while it has a features to help with this, its limited in that, that is not the main purpose behind that app, and there is no GUI to preview the parts visually, OR to compare stats \u0026amp; specs....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SparksMcKool","CreatedById":124444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T18:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be very surprised if someone doesn\u0027t make a cool part viewer mod/app with .90 coming out soon and once we get such a tool we are going to see some very awesome KSP worthy mod packs. I have been very much inspired by Bob Fitch\u0027s projects and would love to do something similar for myself, but without a user friendly app I just do not have enough time to both play KSP and customise my install. I spend too much time playing this really amazing game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
