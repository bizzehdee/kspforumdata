Unfortunately my kerbal cannot hold anything in his inventory because his inventory volume is 1 L and every object is huge compared to that. Is this because he is a level 1? I tried looking through the save files to increase his inventory size but all I saw was max inventory which didn\u0027t fix the problem. I have read the user guide and looked all over the Internet and these forums for more information but I can\u0027t find anything. Everything is up to date. Other mods are Mechjeb, alarm clock, kerbal engineer and planetshine.
