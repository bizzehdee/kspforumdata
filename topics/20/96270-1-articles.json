I don\u0027t mind writing a MM config to move a few parts around to my liking, but I want to avoid rewriting the whole tech tree if someone has done most of the work already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to use something like FAR with the 6.4x Kerbol System to fix the aero model without making the game \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual enhancement packs would be nice as well, and it would be amazing if I could get this all to work without having to use the aggressive version of texture compressor so the textures still look good. I\u0027ve got a gaming PC (overclocked i7-3770K \u002B nVidia GTX 680 \u002B 16GB of RAM \u002B SSD) to run this on so the only performance limitation is really the 4GB limit for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer to avoid packs that add a large number of new parts (like KW Rocketry or NovaPunch) in favor of packs that a few parts to address a specific deficiency in the stock game. If there\u0027s a mod that adds an excellent replacement for a stock part I would consider deleting the stock part in favor of it or cherry picking parts out of a large part pack as long as they\u0027re stockalike parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStability is also important, I want a combination of mods that won\u0027t crash the game all the time. I know that I\u0027ll have to make some tradeoffs, I would prioritize stability first, features second, parts third and graphics fourth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe community mods and plugins library is a good resource but still misses a lot of good mods and the forum search is next to useless so I\u0027m reaching out to the community here to get a better idea of what\u0027s out there. When suggesting a mod could I humbly request that you include a link to said mod if possible? I\u0027ve had issues with CKAN for example where it only lists a short acronym of the mod and it was difficult even using a google search of the forums to find out what mod it was referring to.
