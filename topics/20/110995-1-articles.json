I have seen a few vids that I am sure the creator is somehow operating and maintaining more than once \u0022active\u0022 ship at a time. Sorry if this has been discussed a bunch, the search option turns up either 500 pages of useless info, or none at all. For instance, how are you suppose to use a mod like Laz\u0027s SpaceX, with returning main stages that require active operating as well as maintain the Main ships accent? \n\nThx to you if you answer my question\n\nDren"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T13:04:51Z","Content":"Check out [Burn Together](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75170) for piloting several ships at once\n\n[FMRS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292) for SpaceX-style recovery (or just [Stage Recovery](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677))"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T13:57:34Z","Content":"Some YouTubers also use kOS to let other vessels do something."}]}
