My primary concerns are as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Any additional parts have to look decent and not take up a funky buttlovin amount of memory. So no more 100\u002B part installs I have enough of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stable, MUST BE STABLE, no more random crashes or bugs caused by compatibility errors.

I haven\u0027t used it since 0.20, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer TACLS myself but I also created my own parts and customized it (a bit, it\u0027s solid as-is). Persistence across vessels is good and one of the big advantages is that the resource unit representations are in Kerbal-days, which makes it very easy to see, at a glance, how long you have left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Easmi\u0027s ECLSS looks pretty cool and should have some very nice parts, but I haven\u0027t tried it yet because it looks like it\u0027s still causing lag problems.
