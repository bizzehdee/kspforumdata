In fact, I\u0027m kind of surprised that I don\u0027t really run into many others having a problem with this, but I\u0027m hoping that someone knows of a mod or method to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the vanilla game, you can snap parts to an imaginary \u0022grid\u0022 of a sorts, when aligning them horizontally. I need the same thing, only for in the vertical direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried Editor Extensions Redux which has a feature called \u0022vertical snap\u0022, but it only seems able to align parts to the exact vertical center of their parent parts. I need much more freedom than that, pretty much like with the horizontal snap, where you can select the \u0022grid\u0022 (not sure about the terminology here) being 5 degrees, 15 degrees or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes any of this make sense? Anyone have any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-14T14:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse the translation and rotation tools.

This still makes them very difficult to snap so that they are precisely placed against each other, for example on rockets in an asparagus configuration. I had thought of using the \u0027V\u0027 in Editor Extensions Redux to align them perfectly and then snap them to their proper locations, but then that V-button doesn\u0027t do anything anymore for whatever reason. Of course, I have no idea why because none of these crazy settings are actually displayed anywhere, so I don\u0027t know if I accidentally pressed some key that does something that I don\u0027t know how to look up. *sigh*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, thanks anyway!
