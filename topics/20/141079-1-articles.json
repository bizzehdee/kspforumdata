The reason for that is because to be life supporting for Kerbals, a planet needs an oxygenated atmosphere within, say, \u002B/- 50% of Kerbin sea level pressure. It also needs temperature averages around 295 K, with a variance of no more than 50 degrees in every direction. Then there\u0027s gravity, which should be 10 m/s\u00B2 \u002B/- 6 m/s\u00B2 or so. Finally, there needs to be abundant amounts of water available, as well as dry land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kind of conditions are hard to produce. They can frequently only exist within the \u0022habitable zone\u0022 around a star, which typically is not large enough to hold more than two planets. And the further the planet is away from the middle of that zone, the less likely it is to be habitable, so the best result is for only one planet to be there. So having an entire solar system full of habitable worlds is extremely unrealistic, and KSP players in general like a fair degree of realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, even if you were to say \u0022screw science\u0022 and do such a planet pack for the heck of it, it wouldn\u0027t be particularly fun to play. The reason for that is because, again, the conditions for supporting life are vey specific. It will result in planets that are very similar to one another. You might as well ask for a mod that replaces every single planet in KSP with a copy of Kerbin, and every single moon with a copy of Laythe - that\u0027s the thing you can expect from an all-habitable solar system. Every planet just kinda starts being the same thing all over again, which is not fun to explore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re of course free and invited to make such a planet pack, if you feel that it would be nice to have. But the above two reasons are why nobody else has made such a thing yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-03T08:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2016 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Pirate","CreatedById":164926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T08:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222613858\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464911743\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151092\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TotallyNotSatan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, TotallyNotSatan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any Kopernicus planet packs where all planets are livable(such as Kerbin or Laythe)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there is an alternative. First Download a kopernicus planet pack you want, then Download HyperEdit, Install in Gamedata then Play KSP, Open HyperEdit Icon then Choose Planet Editor. Check the boxes of planets to have atmosphere/Breathable Atmosphere then Try it. I dont know if it still works or works with other planet pack,\u00A0but its compatible with KSP 1.1.2 though.
