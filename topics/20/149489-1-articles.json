It can easy run it on the lowest settings, and im fine with that, but i would really like to have some mods that improve my visuals. So are there any mods that dont take much\u00A0RAM and that i can run on low settings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T08:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are fewer visual mods than you think there are. All the legwork is done by a small handful of baseline mods. Many visual mods are actually just config files and custom assets for the baseline mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t lessen the effort that goes into making a good custom content/config pack. But it does mean that your selection is limited as far as actual functionality providers are concerned. For example, if you want clouds, you must install Environmental Visual Enhancements. This is literally the only mod that offers this capability; every other mod you see that adds clouds does so by shipping a custom config file and custom cloud graphics to be used by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E. I mean, you can use Kopernicus\u0027 internal tools to produce something that looks somewhat similar from far away, but there\u0027s no real replacement for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee also my post in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/147286-what-are-the-best-and-most-compatible-add-ons-to-make-kerbal-look-better/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters I\u0027d try \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, and perhaps some of the minor mods I listed in that other thread. If that\u0027s too much for your system, then you\u0027ll probably have to run without visual mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-10T08:35:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2016 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
