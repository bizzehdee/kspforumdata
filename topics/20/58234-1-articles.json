And after I finally get the game to not crash It tells me the craft ive been working on for over a month cannot be loaded because the Romfarer.Camera is missing. Except that its not.. I even re-downloaded it. I don\u0027t understand how this happened.. I haven\u0027t even touched the Romfarer folder.. oi... This is just problem.. after problem.. after problem. I find im screwing around in the subfolders more then playing the game.. maybe its time to take a break. Ah well.. reguardless wth is going on with this camera part not loading?

Do you still have the individual craft files? Can you still load every single one of them, or is there a conflict as well? If it works i would search for a difference in the saved sfs. But that would require having a save / saves where each and every part for your broken vessel is also on a working vessel (maybe on the launchpad). Anyway, debugging sth like this on installations with lots of mods is a pain. Have you considered simply removing the problematic part from your save? Would it be possible at all?

Both the return module and rover had the camera on it.. and there gone. So yes I should have the craft files. Though the mission is well under way and the craft has since separated in to its according pieces for a land and return. The rover and ascent stage have landed and the CM/return stage is in orbit.

Suddenly the Lazor camera didn\u0027t work, and would delete crafts. I assumed it was due to Lazor Systems not being updated to 0.23, so I rolled back to 0.22 and then reloaded the last quicksave to get the vessels back again. I\u0027ve not attempted to update mods or the game since then because I\u0027ve been away on holidays, but yeah I chalked it up to Lazor Systems not being updated.
