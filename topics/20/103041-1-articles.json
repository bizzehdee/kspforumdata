However, then my engine just shuts down, even if it is controlled by kOS.\n\nAlso kOS doesn\u0027t seem to have Attitude control. What am I doing wrong?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nKamik423"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleLostRobot","CreatedById":71172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T17:34:20Z","Content":"was in the same boat.\n\nYou need to enable the \u0027RT\u0027 config value (its a radio button on the right roughly in the middle) in the main kOS window."}]}
