I *think* a CSV should be somewhat easy to export from KSP and I think if nothing else the ability to view SSTO and other aircraft would be awesome but even regular launches to orbit would be useful.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am not sure how the program is on new terrain/smaller planet but I imagine it might be possible though I couldn\u0027t\u00A0find anything in the docs, if nothing else it might be worth contacting their support as they are said to be helpful.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tacview.strasoftware.com/product/about/en/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tacview.strasoftware.com/product/about/en/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
