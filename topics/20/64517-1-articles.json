Your probably wondering why I gathered you here. (The smarter of you will have read the title and already know.) Basically, does anyone know of any ATV parts? They don\u0027t have to be up to date, or for that purpose, I just want some parts that look like an ATV. (I can put in all of the modules myself, so It just has to look like one.) Why you ask? Because AEIS Aerospace as the most perfect solar panels, and I want a relica-ish ATV for my orbital construction and resupplying space stations in the future. (I started a new career using TAC-LS.) It doesnt have to look lke the one used for the ISS, just something along the lines of an automated resupply vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny Ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Thanks.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T12:24:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYogui87 made one, it\u0027s in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/esa-european-historical-pack-v03/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis European pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit looks the part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dcOpvie.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dcOpvie.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T20:00:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay.
