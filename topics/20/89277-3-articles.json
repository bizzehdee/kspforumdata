Every data point you gather on what space is like drives your development of future technologies, because you know what you\u0027re going to encounter, what hardships you will have to overcome. Even if your discoveries don\u0027t directly apply to \u0027making a rocket engine that pushes harder\u0027, the science points you in the direction of how much you have to figure out how to rad-harden your avionics, or whether the out-gassing and arcing will affect your OMS engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, compare the progression of how we envisioned spacecraft throughout the development of our flight into space. They start out fanciful, like the aircraft of yesteryear, and quickly (as we discovered what space was actually like, via satellites, short hops into space, trips to the moon) they became more austere, more fit to the task. We learned what technologies we\u0027d have to develop, used data gathered to predict whether the technology would work, and sent it up (a little up, and mostly sideways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the current science model is actually a very good approximation of that progress. And the contracts help reinforce that (meaning, often you get the part test contract before you have unlocked it.

I have been going with the assumption that the plan is to support RO and its associated mods, at least in some fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had assumed that the first few nodes were considered closest to completed since they had been renamed. Then I saw that the Explorer was available right from the beginning and thought perhaps nothing was really ready yet but the contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill after finishing the first few nodes I decided to look at the whole tree and offer feedback on thoughts I had as I was unlocking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will repeat an earlier question as well. Is there anything in particular you are looking for feedback on or help with? I saw in one of the .cfg that it said FIXME, but it didn\u0027t look to me like anything in particular needed to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JRA","CreatedById":121964,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T17:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to alter the starting \u0022launch new vessel\u0022 contract so it does not give 5 science?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is exactly enough to open \u0022EarlyOrbitalRocketry.\u0022 I think it would be better that the 5 science needed for that be tied to the sounding rocket contracts. Perhaps, the first 2 or 3 sounding rocket contracts could just give money, and then a later one could give 5 science?

Disable science on the \u0022Launch New vessel\u0022 contract. And, don\u0027t give any science for the sounding rocket contracts either. Instead, have the player rely on getting probe reports for the various flights. it would only take some combination of probe reports from \u0022LandedLaunchPad, FlyingLow, FlyingHigh, and SpaceLow\u0022 to do it. A player could easily get a SpaceLow report with the first node sounding rocket tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least i was able to. It took a bit of practice, but not too hard.
