It is unwieldy on launch and requires extra efforts for stability. It cannot reliably house vehicles with long manipulator arms or even slightly unbalanced weight without etxra RSC . Yet it contains enough fuel to finalize the orbit (so leaves no spent stages in low orbit), burn to Mun and land there. \u003Cem\u003EAnd, of course, aside from this, I am very grateful to the author of the thing itself\u003C/em\u003E, regardless of how it handles.

The module in the middle (far) is the main battery, delivered separately. I plan to land another 2-4 Cuttlefishes around the main battery. In a more advanced version, they\\\u0027d be connected to it with cables. The loads will be modules for the base - I am learning how to move stuff around. In fact, one of the cuttlefishes I had to cart to the place from over 6 km. It slipped out of the claw only twice : ) My average speed with the truck you see here and the fish was about 10 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T21:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027ll be really nice when docking is implemented.
