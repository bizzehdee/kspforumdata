However, its low thrust prevents me from using it on larger rockets.\n\nI tried using tweakscale, but it has not subdivisions between 1.25 and 2.5m.\n\nI\u0027m interested in creating an Advanced Aerospike engine by switching the regular aerospike engine\u0027s ParticleFX from yellow to blue. I can already work the .cfg file settings, but have no idea how to change particle colour.\n\nThe other, more difficult project I have in mind is a nuclear aerospike. It looks like the LV-N, but the nozzle is replaced by an inverted Shock Cone. Blender flies right over my head, so I guess I should request this. Unless someone can tell me how to replace just part of a model with another without using blender stuff..."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T03:40:01Z","Content":"Why not just edit the file the way you want ? and the size where you see \n\n    scale = 1.0 and right below it add the line rescaleFactor = * \n\n would play around with the # in a test install and start the changes just in .5 to you get the size you want like \n\n    PART{// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters// comment line - ignored by cfg parser// empty lines, or lines without a \u0027=\u0027 sign are also ignored// all other lines are split at the \u0027=\u0027 sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it\u0027s own parameters (again, see docs)// each assignment must be in a single line.
