It was only designed to fly to the Moon and back, not to other planets like in KSP. Also, our solar system is quite different than KSP\u0027s version. So, my plan is to re-implement the AGC with modifications for KSP, removing all unnecessary functionality and implementing KSP-specific functionality ie circularisation burns, Hohmann transfers etc. I plan to reasonably faithfully recreate the DSKY (including its verb/noun interface, multiple background programs etc), with added KSP features such as buttons for staging, lights, gears, pause etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill keep working on this slowly, will post some code and circuit diagrams when I\u0027ve got something to demo.
