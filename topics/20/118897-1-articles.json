(I never got why you can\u0027t actually do that.) This would make for very interesting and unique designs and very good stuff, and it could make rockets look alot nicer by relying on two fuel tanks on the same height in the same place being different stages, theres alot of good things that coud come from this, but I\u0027m no modder, so if anyone can make something like this, it would be amazing, and I would also like to know who agrees with me that it\u0027s and interesting concept. Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pseudo Gold","CreatedById":136827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T12:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone could pull this off, you\u0027ve potentially got a whole new branch of fuel tanks.

The \u0022top\u0022 and \u0022bottom\u0022 ends could automatically fillet and of course the stack mounting nodes so you can nest things *coughenginescough* inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also something that I\u0027d like to see in the game.
