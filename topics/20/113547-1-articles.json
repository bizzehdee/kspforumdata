I suggest for someone to make a plugin which allows users to toggle the fairing spread that occurs when hovering over/near fairings in editor. Now this might sound silly but keep reading. Currently if you want to see what the fairing looks like, you need to zoom out to the point that details are lost completely, and move your mouse to the far corner of the screen (meaning you cannot edit the surrounding parts).\n\nIt seems as though there isn\u0027t a mod that does this yet and I\u0027m sure many builders would find this option very, *very* useful when trying to perfect fairing shape, match parts to fairings, build engine nacelles, build nosecones, fuselages, and all the other ingenious things people do with fairings.\n\n![w788YxB.png](http://i.imgur.com/w788YxB.png)\n\nOn the more serious note though, *please* someone make this a thing. I have little doubt it would become an important tool to builders.\n\n- Avera9eJoe\n\nEDIT: I would even be happy for a plugin that just plain removed the spread. It would be more useful in my honest opinion.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T22:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T10:17:04Z","Content":"Neither of these are what you asked for, but they\u0027re the closest thing I know of:\n\n[Stock Fairing Tweaker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122107)\n\n[Stock Clamshell Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124031)\n\nAlternatively, there\u0027s [Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512) or [Zero-Point Inline Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94427)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T12:54:11Z","Content":"Good one, agreed."}]}
