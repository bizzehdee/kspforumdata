For example, if your parent part is crew pod (and it\u0027s likely to stay with the ship all the time until you destroy\\recover ship), your dV will be correctly shown. But if your core part is, say, last stage of your launcher (you save payloads as subassemblies and then put them on rocket), there is two main bugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First, MJ will not show dV for your payload (Can be fixed by using SelectRoot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Second, when you decouple \u0022core\u0022 part, it won\u0027t show correct dV calculations (Try to add another stage to your ship - in most cases, it may help)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T23:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmmmmyum, sorry.
