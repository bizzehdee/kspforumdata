Specifically, I want to utilize Extraplanetary Launchpads to colonize Laythe, and use it as a launchpad to explore the Outer Planets mod. Does anyone have any recommendations for other mods I should use? I\u0027m already including Karbonite and KAS, and maybe remote tech. Any other good mods I\u0027m overlooking?\n\nI\u0027ve tried a few modded installs to figure out which ones suit my playstyle in science mode, and i have these recommendations:\n\nKAS - Great\n\nKarbonite - For colonization it\u0027s a must\n\nRemote Tech - I got somewhat bored with launching satellites all the time. Many like it, I find it more of an added restriction that was boring to work with, as satellite launches don\u0027t differ that much. It\u0027s a good mod, but not for me.\n\n**In addition, I can recommend these**\n\n[TAC Life support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667-0-90-TAC-Life-Support-v0-10-2-25Jan-No-Win64-Support) - You\u0027ve probably heard about it already \n\n[Deadly Reentry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-0-90-Deadly-Reentry-v6-5-3-Beta-Mar-6-2015) - You probably already know about this\n\n[FAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-90-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-6-12-27-14) - Same as above, plus they combine really well. FAR makes some things harder, some things easier, but all things a lot more fun.\n\n[Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-0-90-Procedural-Fairings-3-11-manual-shape-controls-%28December-17%29) - A must if using either of the two above\n\n[Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-90-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-1-1-1-15-15) - Good to have with FAR as your craft won\u0027t break apart as easily.\n\n[RealChutes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-0-90-x-Wenkel-Corporation-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-v1-3-12-03-15) - Makes parachutes more realistic in a good way. They won\u0027t insta-deploy and tear your crafts top off\n\n[Action Groups Extended](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-0-90-%28Jan31-15%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing-Now-kOS-Support!) - Allows you to edit action groups post launch, as well as a bit more advanced than regular action groups. Really useful for mothership-like crafts\n\n**In addition, i recommend these utility mods:**\n\n[Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-1-Updated-03-07-2015%29) - Self explanatory. It\u0027s awesome in its simplicity, design, and it makes docking a lot more intuitive\n\n[Enhanced Navball](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524-0-90-Enhanced-Navball-1-3) - Self Explanatory\n\n[Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-90-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-2-3-0-%28Jan-20%29) - Allows you to set alarms for things you need to pay attention to, such as maneuver nodes approaching, transfer windows, SOI changes. A must if you have a system with many things going on at the same time\n\n[TAC Fuel balancer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25823-0-25-TAC-Fuel-Balancer-v2-4-1-10Oct) - Useful for large crafts, as it simplifies and to a certain degree automates fuel pumping. The thread says 0.25, but there\u0027s a link there for 0.90 as well\n\n[Trajectories](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694-0-90-Trajectories-v1-1-3-%282015-01-25%29-atmospheric-predictions) - Atmospheric landing spot prediction\n\nAnd with a lot of mods, you\u0027ll benefit greatly from [Toolbar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863-0-90-0-Toolbar-1-7-8-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar)"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:08:51Z","Content":"Moving this over to General Add-On Affairs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m pretty much going to second MKS/OKS (which is also by RoverDude like Karbonite) and everything on jarmund\u0027s list (except Action Groups Extended, but only because I\u0027ve never used it). Life support, reentry heat, and better aerodynamics all both make for a more realistic experience while providing interesting new challenges to overcome."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:10:11Z","Content":"question, what kind of save are you making?
