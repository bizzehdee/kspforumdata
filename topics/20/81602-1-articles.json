The recruitment centre shows the Kerbals who have returned to Kerbin (initially shown as MIA but strangely end up back at home).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor clarity, this is the mod list I\u0027m currently running:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14694053/KSP/mod%20list.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022mod%20list.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny one else had this issue? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to land on the Mun, but I\u0027m scared that I\u0027ll have no one to pilot the Command Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/579030606683935426/9709F2019715BABA9140EB84A9A0A00B703797DC/\u0022 alt=\u00229709F2019715BABA9140EB84A9A0A00B703797DC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fatal_Gam3er","CreatedById":115908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T17:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou probably have an out dated module manager, or life support\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrospud","CreatedById":36799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T00:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, ok.
