Like a packaged mini-robot arm dedicated to self-maintenance. Yes, please. Even if there is no visual animation to it at all (to save on complexity/effort making the part); just something that allows the rightclick menu options that an EVA engineer gives, within a certain range of the part - enough for a reasonably-sized rover. The part could be unlocked in the higher tiers of R\u0026amp;D automation and be fairly expensive, as a more sustainable contingency mitigation than simple redundancy of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A bit further along the line, personally I would like Kerbal Krash to be relevant to this too, or any mod that adds damage generation/repair of some kind. Ideally \u0027repairable damage\u0027 should be a standardized attribute that can be handled by a ModuleRepair() for example, which would by default be part of both the engineer Kerbals and the AutoFixer part, and make the damage/repair system available to (other) modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
