I am trying to make some High quality mods but i can\u0027t make anything other than a mid quality delta IV ICPS stage and it looks fairly horrible. If someone would like to help me create KerbCorps models that would be AMAZING. I am only good at the Side of the Modding that involves Unity3d studio.\n\nIf there is a modeler that needs help programming, note that there is at least one programmer that needs a modelers help. \n\nThanks in Advance,\n\nAgent"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:38:30Z","Content":"Do you want to help me make a heat radiator mod?
