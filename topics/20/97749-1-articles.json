NEAR is basically a nerfed FAR (go ahead and ask Ferram about it). If you\u0027re looking for uber-masochism mode, I\u0027d suggest using RSS (Real Solar System) and DRE (Deadly Re-Entry). That will scale everything up to proper-planet size, give you a bunch more launch pads to launch from, and, well, turn Kerbin into Earth, Duna into Mars, Eve into Venus, etc. You can also get texture packs for RSS, though I wouldn\u0027t recommend running more than the 4K textures in 32 bit KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you\u0027re running with RSS, you will more than likely want a \u0022big parts\u0022 pack so that you can get into orbit without murdering your CPU through excessive part count. I\u0027ve found the SpaceY Lifters mod to be a pretty lightweight large-part pack that can fit alongside FAR, RSS, Mechjeb2, DRE and the 4K texture pack in a 32 bit install without busting the RAM budget or relying on texture-reduction mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
