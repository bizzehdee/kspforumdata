I can generally run KSP fine provided that part count don\u0027t go too high.\n\nI\u0027ve generally avoided mods focusing on aesthetics, as I\u0027ve always preferred function over form. Now that I have pretty much settled with a list of mods I enjoy using, I think it\u0027s time to see if I can extend the visual appeal, so I have a twofold question:\n\n**What type of mods add the most to memory consumption? Parts with textures?**\n\nMemory is not really an issue for me, as I\u0027m running linux 64 without any issues, I\u0027m mostly just curious about this. However, CPU and GPU, to a certain extent, is an issue.\n\n**Which beautification mods can you recommend that do not really cost much in terms of CPU and GPU cycles?**\n\nWhile I cannot remember the exact names, I hope you know which mods I\u0027m talking about here.... the ones in particular that appeal to me:\n\n- Distant Object enhancement\n\n- Ambient light \n\n- Any other recommendations, preferably potaty-friendly ones?\n\n------\n\n**For the record, the mods I already use are:**\n\nAction Groups Extended\n\n**\\***Deadly Reentry\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nEnhanced Navball\n\n**\\***FAR\n\nHyperedit\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\n**\\***Kerbal Engineer\n\nKerbal Flight Indicators\n\nJoint Reinforcement\n\nMechjeb\n\n**\\***Procedural fairings\n\nRealchutes\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer\n\nTAC Life Support\n\nToolbar\n\nTrajectories\n\n**\\*:** Up for re-evaluation vs stock once 1.0 comes out:\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T09:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T10:42:13Z","Content":"Textures hog memory (so parts and planets mainly), everything else is fairly negligible by comparison (plugins \\*can\\* scale up to be insanely huge, but that generally won\u0027t happen)\n\nRE: Beutification\n\nVens Stock revamp is better stock parts (with reduced memory usage if pruner used) with no impact on framerate."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:33:30Z","Content":"I\u0027d throw in EVE, Planetshine and Distant Object Enhancement.
