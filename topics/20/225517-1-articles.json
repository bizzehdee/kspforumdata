The colors for Parallax terrain are super desaturated and have very low contrast, even when I use a completely black influence map (which in theory should let 100% of the planet\u0027s colors through). For example, Duna is a deep red, with very high contrast and saturation. But when I zoom in, it suddenly has almost no color at all. Is there some kind of setting that can add the color back in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
