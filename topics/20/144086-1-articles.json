The SSMEs were designed to give out 2090kN of thrust in vaccuum, that\u0027s 100% of the nominal power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, after quite a few flights, the engineers had collected enough data to realise that the SSMEs were strong enough to get pushed further, to 2170kN, without any risk for the duration of a flight, and that this enabled greater payloads. The launch sequence was modified so that the SSME now used the 2170kN of thrust, of 104.5% of their original maximal thrust. Instead of setting the 2170kN to be 100% and confuse everyone and probably cause one or two shuttle losses (space disasters often happen for pretty stupid reasons), they kept the original 100% and wrote down 104.5% for the launch sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrottling the SSMEs to 104.5% became part of the nominal launch procedure because it was safe. The engines could be pushed even further (remember that to increase the thrust of the rocket engine, you just need to increase the propellant flow), up to 2280kN, or 109% of the nominal thrust. But this was dangerous: as the engines were not designed to sustain that much thrust, it could damage them and cause the loss of a mission, so the 109% throttle was not used for nominal flights, but kept for emergency procedures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to KSP: having more than 100% throttle in KSP would make no sense. Since engines are essentially perfect and never fail, adding a failure possibility when going past 100% would feel a little strange. If KSP had part failures, then this would be great but just having engines failing when pushed too hard, meh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mod increasing the maximal throttle limit past 100% and adding a failure probability should not be to hard to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T21:10:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
