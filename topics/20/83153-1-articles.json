I have seen countless times how higher settings really does give you the edge in this game, from actually seeing your base thanks to having lights that don\u0027t lag your flight, and being able to see your shadow while dropping down onto a foreign surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not looking for miracles, just things to hopefully make gameplay a bit more on level for the rest of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFirst example\u003C/span\u003E, perhaps a landing laser: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To anyone who\u0027s seen Wall-E, and has witnessed the hilarity a laser pointer can do even to an AI, I\u0027m sure everyone noticed that the laser was serving a purpose in helping find a suitable place to land, or at least outlining the landing zone for the on flight navigation. In the case of KSP, I\u0027d suggest something similar to project 3-4 easily visible dots onto the surface at very slight outward angles, and maybe one in the middle, that way as you get closer to the surface, the points slowly grow closer, giving you a visual representation on your landing sight, speed relative to the surface, and how far you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not a modder, but I have dipped my toes in code before, so I have no idea if this has been done already, or if it\u0027d really make a difference to have on a lower end computer. I know someone is going to suggest just using lights, but for me lights love to eat up my frames, so I try to avoid them myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, since this is suppose to help low end players, bells and whistles are not necessary. Perhaps just give it a penalty of slight extra electric charge use. Sounds simple to me, and I\u0027d love to hear any other thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESecond\u003C/span\u003E: a \u0022Glowing\u0022 ring for docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now this is a fun idea I\u0027ve bounced around, as I personally love using Scott Manley\u0027s idea of using the small radial battery\u0027s bright green light ends to sort of mark out docking nodes. This could simply be a slightly bigger part to attach behind a docking port, so as to make docking areas visible, or maybe a modification to the ports visual to make the connecting ring always visible... Hell... Maybe make the light toggleable but without the glow so it doesn\u0027t kill frames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it, a lightless glowing part. simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I have for now, I don\u0027t think these parts truly give unfair advantages to those like me who love the vanilla game so far, but any suggestions to add to this or input about this would be wonderful. Mind everyone these ideas are based on their singularity and simplicity, and just because you can make your own landing laser in something like the laser mod does not count, as the entire mod is pretty large as far as I\u0027ve seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T08:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor landing there is a better altimeter if you switch to IVA.

When you\u0027re playing at low detail (Which also makes the altimeter impossible to read, a really unfortunate issue as you\u0027ve pointed out) you can\u0027t see shadows, or you\u0027d have no need for this laser idea in the first place. It\u0027s not only implemented to show distance, but it gives you a very binary idea on what you\u0027re closing into. if you\u0027re landing on the mun, and there\u0027s a small crater you hadn\u0027t accounted for, the closest laser will change from it\u0027s predicted visual path, making it skip to the side in your current perspective, this should be more than enough to alert you to the slope, and give you time to make a small lateral adjustment, and save from an unfortunate dipping leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, that just gave me an idea, make it so landing gear can project this \u0022dot\u0022 based on it\u0027s orientation. That should make it even more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
