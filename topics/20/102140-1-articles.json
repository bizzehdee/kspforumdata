It obviously depends on the weight, size of the fairings and also on the speed you are going. Using FAR you can switch on the aerodynamic pressure colors I believe. It will show you whether your fairings are exposed to high aerodynamic pressure or not. You can also use the temperature (wich deadly reentry) as an indicator."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:23:12Z","Content":"That\u0027s a little hard to tell without knowing how draggy the payload is; in older versions of FAR you almost didn\u0027t have any drag until 35km, but the latest ones have a fair amount of skin drag at high altitude. Only real way to tell is do some trial launches \u0026 test, really. You\u0027re likely to always be fine above 55km at least, I\u0027d imagine."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:56:47Z","Content":"On the whole, I\u0027d call 50km. This is the point at which most of my SSTOs can cut thrust and coast without losing more than a few hundred metres of apoapsis. \n\nThere IS still air drag past this point, but it\u0027s very small, usually in the order of a few fractions of a kN, unless your payload is very bulky and angular with a lot of exposed nodes. On the KSC screen, open FAR options, and turn on drag display for the right-click menu; this will help you assess how much difference fairings make, though you\u0027ll need to do a few trial runs first.\n\nIf the question relates to \u0022can I dump the fairings while I\u0027m still burning to save weight\u0022... probably not. Unless you find you\u0027re still burning the rockets beyond 50km, you might as well wait until you clear the atmosphere completely."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T15:06:44Z","Content":"It depends on the rocket. Most of the time, the fairings are so lightweight that you don\u0027t really save anything by jettisoning them early. I usually take such fairings to space and jettison them before orbital insertion.\n\nSometimes I launch giant monsters, and the fairings may form a significant fraction of the payload. In such cases, I prefer to jettison the fairings as soon as dynamic pressure falls below a predetermined threshold (usually 500 Pa or 1000 Pa)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T15:11:46Z","Content":"Generally I\u0027m cutting thrust low enough in atmo that by the time I\u0027m out of the regime where FAR models significant skin drag, I\u0027m coasting to space anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T16:18:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It depends on the rocket.

Just watch for that number to get low enough. You don\u0027t need fairings anymore when Q gets negligible.\n\nIt would actually be interesting to know what Q values are safe enough -- I just wait for it to get \u0022really low\u0022 but I haven\u0027t run any experiments to see how low is low enough. Does anyone have any data points on what \u0022Q\u0022 value causes extended solar panels to break off, for example? If the dynamic pressure is low enough that solar panels don\u0027t disintegrate, it\u0027s probably safe for most things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T16:21:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky**"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:38:42Z","Content":"As said before, throw them away at 50 km at least. 68 km is the height of atmosphere, so if you want to have max efficiency, then use 68 km."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:41:57Z","Content":"KSA dumps fairings at 45-50km, as that\u0027s when our rockets are still under thrust and thus ensures the fairings are not only separated but completely removed from the vicinity of the craft"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:14:32Z","Content":"@thread move: I thought it would have been fine where it was before, but okay."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:28:52Z","Content":"I tend to cut mine in the mid-30s, but that\u0027s not for drag purposes; it\u0027s for extending antennas for RemoteTech.
