Small shipments got into a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E container, but as soon as a shipment grows to require a 1.25m container I use a fairing instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turn on fairing interstage nodes and generally attach one part per node. If the parts are small I\u0027ll use cubic struts to group multiple parts around one node, avoiding visual overlap on the parts so I\u0027m not \u0022cheating\u0022. I don\u0027t need decouplers because an engineer will grab each part from the fairing and reattach it elsewhere via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fairings often end up much smaller and a little lighter than the smallest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E container with enough volume to hold those same parts. Reading through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E thread and others, I think the blame lies with many parts having too high a volume compared to their visual appearance. It\u0027s not a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E bug or bad container config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComments?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-06T20:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223731961\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579885112\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201293\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadJohn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/24/2020 at 4:58 PM, DeadJohn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the blame lies with many parts having too high a volume compared to their visual appearance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are probably correct.\u00A0\u00A0 The Tac Self-Destruct mod (in a previous version - fixed in 1.8), the little destruct charge took up over 300 liters despite a physical size of around 25 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm (my guess anyway).\u00A0\u00A0 And I know I\u0027ve run into other parts that I was shocked I couldn\u0027t fit into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E containers and ended up just surface attaching to something else for deliveries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
