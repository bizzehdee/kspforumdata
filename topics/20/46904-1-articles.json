For example, I have a base understanding of orbital physics, but I work a fairly demanding job, and don\u0027t have much time to be able to learn and do all the calculations myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m suggesting a \u0022Launch Window Calculator and Mission Planner\u0022, which will help you build your rocket and plan the mission. For example, you tell it you want to deliver your Stage-0 Payload to a Space Station. It tells you how much Delta- V you need for the rocket, and adjusts it as you build the rocket. Then, when your getting ready to launch, it will tell you a range of the best time to launch to intercept the object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that can say \u0022Oh, you need to get X about to a 100km orbit?

Yes, you might have to use external tools for that, though Kerbal Alarm Clock or MechJeb will kind give you this information as well. To get to a space station you can circularize at a low orbit and later use a Hoffman transfer. Delta-V? Hm, aren\u0027t you trying to build rockets with much delta-v anyway? At least that is how i started, especially as long as i wasn\u0027t very much aware of orbital mechanics^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure squad will improve their tutorial a lot to make the game more friendly for new users. Also while it takes away a lot of fun, using MechJeb \u0026amp; its maneuver planer can teach you a lot without reinventing the wheel.

Assuming your craft is fairly normal, you could use the Ascent Guidance part to get your ship into orbit, at which point you\u0027d target another planet and use the maneuver planner to transfer to that planet. For most targets, you might need to adjust your inclination to match the target at this point, I\u0027m not sure if MJ2 handles that automatically. Upon arrival at the other planet, you would use the maneuver planner to set your periapsis, then set your apoapsis. And you\u0027re in orbit of another planet, assuming MJ2 didn\u0027t get squirrelly on you. Sometimes MJ2 does the wrong thing, and in those cases, it really helps to know what is supposed to be happening so that you know when to abort an execution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on which you catch onto faster, piloting or navigating, you can also set MJ2 up to create the maneuver nodes that will execute those maneuvers (except landing and takeoff, those aren\u0027t done through maneuver nodes for the most part) and then execute them by hand, or set up the maneuver nodes yourself and let MJ2 execute them. I\u0027d recommend continuing to push on learning both, you\u0027ll get a better feeling of accomplishment out of it that way. Eventually you may get bored with one or the other, at which time you can go back to letting MJ2 handle that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigrou","CreatedById":48635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T09:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you only need launch windows and dV, look at Protractor, a far less \u0022intrusive\u0022 mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T18:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are things I would always do by hand anyway, like transfer burns out of SoI which I do in one go rather than hopping out to solar SoI first.
