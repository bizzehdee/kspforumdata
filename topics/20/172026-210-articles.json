KSP-IE is special to me because it got my kids interested in physics, especially nuclear and beam power, without physics cheating or parts working magically good. But in the past, I gave lousy advice a couple of times because I included KSP-IE with other mods such as Near Future and similar mods. They all worked well with KSP-IE, but not most people on the KSPI-IE forum don\u0027t have Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters, for example. This time I was getting all data from all biomes; the ONLY mods installed were KSP-IE and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support. Not having life support makes the game too easy, I think. I also powered all ships using beam power, making the ships much lighter and cheaper than including a reactor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me begin where the stock tech tree ends. Normally my ships, I received a lot of beam power, then powered the Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters, which worked very good-almost too good. I needed an alternative using only KSP-IE. First, to use any beam power, I needed a beam. I found the low-tech Multen Salt reactor to be one of my favorites because it is also one of the longest-life reactors. A 5-meter molten salt reactor with an Inline Wrapped Phase Array Transmitter using the Infra-Red wavelength(the highest frequency in the early beam transmitters) is a great place to begin. One placed in a high Kerbin polar orbit can supply ample power to all within the Kerbin gravity of influence. The best combination of high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and high thrust early using beam power I found is the Thermal Turbojet. The thermal turbojet uses a wide variety of propellents, but I found plain Oxidizer to work well, and Ox is easier to mine and refine than other propellants such as CO2, Carbon Monoxide, Neon, Argon, Xenon, etc. The Thermal Turbojet is a thermal rocket that requires a thermal-type beam power receiver. Relays are also needed to get power to all sides of Kerbin and Mun. I use two relays in the perpendicular polar orbit and one in the equatorial orbit around Kerbin and Mun, which works well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a spaceship to reach Duna with a miner for mining ore and refining, a rover for getting science data from Ike, and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane for flying across Duna. The spaceship had a molten salt reactor with a Double Pivoting Phased Array Transceiver transmitting IR, which gives plenty of power and a small enough spot size for a small rover or spaceplane to receive. The spaceplane had a thermal turbojet that could use air and oxygen as a propellant. The plane also had large elevators, airbrakes, and wheels for control in thin air and rough landings. If you are higher tech, you can build a powerful X-Ray transmitter in polar Kerbol orbit near the sun getting loads of solar power from a large Blanket solar receiver. A large enough X-Ray transmitter can then beam power all the way to Duna and most planets with a small usable spot size. However, X-Ray can not relay, so make sure you stay in line-of-sight. The highest frequency that can relay is Vacuum Ultraviolet. It is possible to build a Super-Size vacuum ultraviolet transmitter that can transmit power to most planets with a small enough spot-size to be usable while still being able to relay and cover all areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used the same spaceship to enter all biomes of Moho and Dres, and even Eeloo with extra fuel and living space and a miner providing a refuel for going home, but Eve was more of a challenge. I needed a spaceship with a stronger beam transmitter, and the spaceplane used on Duna was not strong enough to escape Eve\u0027s orbit. The Eve spaceplane needed a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ATTILA thruster while receiving enough power to be powerful. I tried many propellents, but simple monopropellant seemed to work best. The ATTILA is also an electric engine requiring a lot of energy received in the form of electricity. The added power and electric engine also required large graphene and titanium heat radiators. The plane was also heavier than the Duna plane, which needed two thermal turbojets to get a high enough speed before using the ATTILA to reach Eve orbit. Once flying near the Eve surface, the more heavy plane has no trouble flying at low speed with easy landings. After some practice, the plane could also take off and land off the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool and its moons required a different starship because I wanted to level up lots of Kerbals, which needed lots of living space and a powerful transmitter to send power to all the moons. By then, I had a Quantum Singularity Reactor, which gave lots of power for thrust and beam-power transmitting in Vacuum Ultraviolet. I tried many high-tech engines, but the simpler Plasma Nozzle attached directly to the singularity reactor gave a good combination of power and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E when using a hydrogen propellant and a fuel. Ironically, the more high-tech plane used on Eve did not do well on Laythe because it was too fast and heavy. The more simple Duna plane did nicely. To mine and refine hydrogen, you need the All In One \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but that requires regolith, which is not on all moons. Tylo was also a challenge because the heavy gravity and lack of atmosphere made it difficult to land and maneuver after landing. After my lunar lander landed, there was not enough fuel left to hop to all biomes, so a rover was needed and stay on the ground. The same rover used before did not climb Tylo hills well, so larger, more powerful wheels were needed- even if a powerful beam was available. After landing the rover, there was not enough fuel to get back into orbit, so after visiting all Tylo biomes. I needed to drive to the miner refinery, which refueled my Ox tank on the rover, then I had enough fuel to reach orbit and dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s about it to getting all Biomes from all bodies. After finishing Duna, Ike, Eve, and all Jools moons, any remaining planets or moons will seem easy. I already finished getting data from many biomes in the stock game, but that required a LOT more refueling because of the lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and weaker engines, even when using the \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENerv \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003Eengine. Escaping Eve required landing a HUGE rocket, and Tylo required a large rocket to take off and land and refill for each biome. Instead, reaching all biomes using KSP-IE was fun and easy after I knew what to do while using real science.
