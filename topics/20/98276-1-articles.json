I am trying to use Near Future Propulsion, B9 and just about anything RoverDude makes to create a transport system. The goal is to mine karbonite on various planets, use large transport vessels to drop off supplies and pick up the karbonite at those planets, then move on and deliver the karbonite to a refinery/space station/orbital shipyard where fuels, metals and other resources are created from the karbonite and new ships launched. I try to use engines that have a low fuel consumption rate but high electric charge use. One example is the LF-9 Magnetoplasmadynamic Engine. Another choice is the insanely powerful HX-HPD. I have even tried the nuclear GNR-3750. However I can never hit that TWR sweet spot.

Your plan sounds awesome. I play stock so others may have better advice on NFP but my advice mainly is to not get discouraged. Even a mun mission is quite a feat for a new player. A couple bits of advice just to get some principles down is to think a lot about staging. You\u0027re going to need a range of engines to get various payloads out out of the lower atmosphere and into orbit. It takes a lot of experimentation to find that spot for your play-style. The next bit of advice is to think about orbital construction with docking ports. Most of my big interplanetary missions require a few launches, getting components up, docking them, and then using a refueler to top them off before making the transfer burn.

It surprised me, since I already knew a few things about how orbits and rockets worked, and didn\u0027t make a lot of the typical \u0022newbie\u0022 mistakes. Rather, I had to get a feel for how the parts worked, what was structurally stable \u003Cem\u003Ein KSP\u003C/em\u003E, how the stock atmosphere behaves, and so on. So don\u0027t feel bad if some designs aren\u0027t working, despite knowing a lot about what you\u0027re doing already. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely agree with using Kerbal Engineer, since just having the thrust-to-weight ratio, burn time, and delta-V numbers available helps A LOT when planning a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Engineer, I\u0027ll usually plan for my rockets to have about 5km/s of dV in the lifter stages (you technically don\u0027t need more than about 4.5km/s, but ~10% safety factor is really useful). I\u0027ll also tune the engine thrust to get somewhere between a TWR of 1.6 and 2.0 on the pad (usually more like 1.6 to 1.8), and ideally keep it under 2 until 15km or so of altitude. Working with those numbers during the design phase in the VAB, it\u0027s fairly easy to get a lifter that works on the first try, including large ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, it\u0027s OK to use high-thrust but low-efficiency engines in the lower stages. This is what they\u0027re meant for, and they\u0027ll be dropped relatively early in the flight. So make sure you\u0027re using the high efficiency engines in space, but high thrust engines at the pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part may not be necessary info in this case, but could help newbie readers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I can\u0027t stress enough how important it is to have a good launch profile. In KSP\u0027s stock atmosphere (version 0.90 and earlier), you want to go straight up until about 8km-12km altitude, and then start your gravity turn, by gradually tilting to the east (a little extra free velocity from the planet\u0027s rotation). By the time you hit the upper atmosphere, you should be going almost horizontal. The lateral (horizontal) velocity is energy you get to keep in orbit. Any time you\u0027re going straight up, you\u0027re spending fuel on fighting gravity. But early in the launch, you need to get out of the thicker part of the atmosphere, so you want to go straight at first and get out of the high-drag environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people start out going straight up, and then at apogee they\u0027ll tilt over and burn horizontally. This works, but is less efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your TWR is too low in the middle of this atmospheric transit, you may find it hard to keep your trajectory going upward sufficiently. TWR can fall below 1 on a later stage as long as it\u0027s well after you\u0027ve started the gravity turn and have built up some velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAlmightyOS","CreatedById":105590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T20:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone.
