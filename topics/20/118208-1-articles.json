It is really helpful as early phase of a career game can easily become somewhat grindy:kiss:. Honestly, I enjoy struggling the difficulties. But as the game continues, it became rather boring as I can easily collect money from my existing stations, science probes, ground bases. At this point, I feel like there\u0027s no reason to play the save anymore as it becomse another sandbox save which I had already played several times before.\n\nI know there are other mods which extend end-game experience by suggesting alternative goals, or forcing me to take care of my ships by causing part reliability issues. But that doesn\u0027t change the fact that the late phase career game becomes sandbox game.\n\nI think this balance breaking issue may arise from the fact that a player can run numerous missions without any cost, except for the first launch. If there\u0027s a mod which charges a player regularly for the ships out there, the problem can be solved easily. I think the charge should be determined by currently tracking ship\u0027s number, each ship\u0027s SOI and situation, manned or unmanned, etc. \n\nIt also makes sense that for every new ship in space, there should be numerous, dedicated ground staffs to support the mission. If you hire more, you should pay more.\n\nAs I\u0027m not a modder, I cannot make this plugin by myself. So if there\u0027s anyone who is interested in this idea, please consider make it a working thing. Thanks.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:18:21Z","Content":"Life support sort of solves that - you have to keep supplying each base with food - but again, there are end-game options that eventually make that go away."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:56:05Z","Content":"[Kerbanomics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104000-0-90-EvilCorp-Kerbanomics-v0-1-8-Kerbal-Payroll-and-Loans%21) has a bit of this in it. You have to pay regularly for crew, but not for vessels or other things like that, and you get funds regularly to help pay for things (essentially, it replaces contracts). The author appears to have gone missing, so I\u0027m in the process of continuing it and will be posting a thread sometime soon to discuss ideas for the future, one of which will likely be having to pay for currently running missions.\n\nI don\u0027t know how far people would want me to take it, but I think it\u0027d be cool if you could dedicate certain amounts of funds for managing each mission, and if you don\u0027t put enough funds in they \u0022shut down\u0022 the mission. So a probe might no longer be controllable after you stop paying for the ground crew. Or you can\u0027t transmit science from a Mun base if it\u0027s not being funded anymore.\n\nI want to take the budget aspect of Kerbanomics up a notch, as right now it\u0027s basically nonexistent."},{"CreatedByName":"JWS","CreatedById":136190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:51:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Life support sort of solves that - you have to keep supplying each base with food - but again, there are end-game options that eventually make that go away.\n\nYeah. I\u0027m using TAC LS and OMKS right now.

I\u0027ll try it out. Thanks.\n\nIt\u0027s nice that you are interested in this idea. \u0022Shut down\u0022 idea seems cool. Is it possible to make a probe into \u0022Unknown obeject\u0022 which cannot be tracked unless a player restores enough funds level? \n\nAnd about the budget, I think it is reasonable that each building should require fixed costs for their own. And upgrading those buildings should also increases the costs. If so, you can\u0027t just launch a eeloo science probe and do a time-warp for 2 years, as you\u0027ll end up bankrupt before it reaches its destination. \n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll look forward to your continueing the Kerbanomics mod in the future.

Alternatively I can pretty easily make it so you can\u0027t control it when you switch to it (like RemoteTech does, or like what happens in the Stock game when a probe doesn\u0027t have power). Or I could just delete the craft entirely, but then you can\u0027t add funding back and regain control of the craft at a later point. I would want to add some penalty for cutting all funding for a long time and then adding it back, such as permanently \u0022losing the signal\u0022, but the whole feature is still in the air at the moment.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And about the budget, I think it is reasonable that each building should require fixed costs for their own.

I still need to think of where the funds you get each quarter come from (the Kerbal government most likely) and what controls how much you get (reputation for sure, but probably also # of active missions, and completing government issued contracts [or just any contracts?]) so you can\u0027t just timewarp forever and keep getting money, but instead have to actually do things to keep getting funds.\n\nWhen I\u0027ve got a thread up for it, I\u0027ll make sure to post back here.\n\nEdit: Here\u0027s that thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131505-1-0-4-Kerbanomics-for-1-0-Looking-for-Name-Suggestions-8-13-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131505-1-0-4-Kerbanomics-for-1-0-Looking-for-Name-Suggestions-8-13-15)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T02:03:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13**"}]}
