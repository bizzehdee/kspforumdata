I would like to make the kerbal\u0027s in the portraits at the lower right corner of the flight screen invisible (because reasons). To be clear, I would still like the portrait frame and backdrop to be there, I just want the seat to look empty even if they are populated. I am aware that kerbals are treated sort of like other parts in the game, with regard to textures and models. I would even be happy with swapping them out for something else that is so tiny it is barely visible, or even re-scaling them to be tiny. I just want to make sure not to affect how the camera works in IVA though. I also don\u0027t need them to be invisible anywhere else in the game, just in the portraits in the flight screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
