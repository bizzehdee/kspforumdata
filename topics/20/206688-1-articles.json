After a lot of attempts I have a design that survives reentry (even the antenna, the worse part!) and floats down with a kelvar chute from Real Chute. Everything\u0027s fine... until I reach around 16 km of altitude, at which point the pressure reaches 4000 kpa and my entire probe promptly explodes. Which seems fairly realistic, except that as far as I can tell absolutely every part in my inventory, from flimsy solar panels to structure metal beams, has a pressure limit of 4000 kpa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I could always switch off the part pressure limit but that would be a little sad. Is there any mod or other setting I could use to have parts capable of resisting to those pressures? I could not find any mods compatible with 1.12...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-01T08:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealism Overhaul does change maximum pressure limits for (some) parts to 10MPa (100atm, more than Venus\u2019 90atm at \u201Csea\u201D level), however it\u2019s mutually incompatible with SMURFF.
