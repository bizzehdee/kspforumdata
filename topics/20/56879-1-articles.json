Hope you are all having a great holiday time. My question is in regards to modded planets. I have done a search on the forum and can\u0027t seem to find anything, but is their plugin data on how you could add your own planet to KSP as a mod? Wanted to get some info before I moved any farther on the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magion","CreatedById":97022,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T15:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is that possibiltiy.
