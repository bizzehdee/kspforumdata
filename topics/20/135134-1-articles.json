Well, the rings were implemented by a small code added to their Kopernicus script files (the configs read by Kopernicus that contain all the info about the planets that Kopernicus needs). They are made with a small and simple texture, but you cannot collide with them. So don\u0027t worry about passing through them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
