Look up the module manager syntax or use other config files as a template to adjust the prices of the parts. It will be up to you to decide what is balanced. It is super easy to write such a file, all you need is a word processor like notepad or word pad or notepad\u002B\u002B or something like that."},{"CreatedByName":"Vist","CreatedById":146781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T01:23:32Z","Content":"Hi PringleMan,\n\nAh, got it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo it maybe as simple as\n\n@PART[b9\\_\\*]\n\n{\n\n @cost = cost/100\n\n}\n\nIf I wanted to divide the cost of all B9 parts by 100? :\u0022\u003E\n\nI should probably go to the appropriate forum section for this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
