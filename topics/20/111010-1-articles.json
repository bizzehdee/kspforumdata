Plenty of mod makers also have donation buttons, though none of that entitles you to get anything from them. That said, I doubt it\u0027s worth it -- paying a developer\u0027s salary multiplied by the amount of time required would get pretty expensive (and since they probably can\u0027t drop everything and work on the mod anyway, it\u0027s not like the work would get done faster than it is already), and offering a substantially lower amount would be insulting (for some interesting real-world examples of undersized financial incentives having the opposite intended effect, check out Freakonomics).\n\nYou\u0027re probably better off trying to convince other mod makers and users that we want the same things that you want.
