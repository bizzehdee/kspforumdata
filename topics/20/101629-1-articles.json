No im not talking about Kerbal Foundries. Will there be a mod that will be just like Kerbal Foundries that does work for 64x and wont destroy my saved builds or my saved games? Please let me know. If you are the maker of a mod that makes hover parts please PM me the mod and I will love you forever.

We\u0027ve noted you\u0027ve had problems with KF in the past and will try to help with whatever we can, but don\u0027t expect an easy or immediate fix.\n\nI am not personally aware of any alternatives to Kerbal Foundaries that provide the hovering devices that you specifically seek.\n\nAlso, please only post one add-on request per thread.
