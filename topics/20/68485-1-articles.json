I do have the SDHI-mod, but the problem is that it\u0027s just too small, and poor in resources - in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I\u0027ve been trying to scale the stock MK1-2 pod. I found that if it\u0027s scaled to 1.5, it\u0027ll have a base of 3.75m. Now, here\u0027s something I tried in the \u0022part.cfg\u0022 file for that pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --- asset parameters ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emesh = model.mu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escale = 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ErescaleFactor = 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does work, at least in the editor (the mount points become all wrong, but I guess that\u0027s fixable too). It looks pretty good, even the textures are scaled without much trouble. Now, the problem - once I launch it, it becomes its old, small self again. Why is this, and how can that be fixed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, resources.

I find that very strange.
