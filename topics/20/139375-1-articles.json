I\u0027d like to have the choice between waiting for a while before i get my Kerbals ready for the next flight and zooming manually in a jet to get them back sooner for another mission. I assume the time would be shorter the closer the landing zone would be to KSC, so I\u0027d try and hit at least the right hemisphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf not, it\u0027d be awesome if someone made that mod (it could be just a simple plugin, but what do I know?

It makes it a bit more meaningful to land in one place rather than another.
