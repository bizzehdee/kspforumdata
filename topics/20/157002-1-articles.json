After a month passed (in ksp) Enviroment changes,ice caps grow or vanish,mountains have snow on top or completely lack it. I don\u0027t ask for weather, i am asking for dynamicly changing\u00A0textures. For example-we have texture for summer grass (it is green(obviously) and then after a month ,it changes and turn into something slightly yellow-ish and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalKore","CreatedById":165574,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-27T21:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin has no axial tilt, so no seasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
