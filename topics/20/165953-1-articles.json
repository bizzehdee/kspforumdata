If this is the case then Mods just delete the topic and let me know in a message so I know better in the future. It is just a simple crash log review haha. I am not positive where the issue is stemming from. I have installed the mods all by hand and I feel that I have followed the ReadMe.txt as I should have. I did post a topic in (Modded KSP Support) thread but I have not caught as simple as a whisper in there.
