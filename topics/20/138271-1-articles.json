It\u0027s only for 1.0.5 right now (but if you\u0027re jumping between versions then you have to use the 1.0.5 version at some point) but I can get it working with 1.1 pretty quickly probably.

It lets you unlock the tech tree for free, in whole or in part, even without upgrading the R\u0026amp;D center. If you want only specific tech nodes then there are a few restrictions with what you can unlock (the max science limit per R\u0026amp;D level still applies then, but it doesn\u0027t if you unlock the whole tree). I also recommend opening the debug menu with Alt-F12, then holding Alt for a few seconds until the \u0022give funds\u0022 and \u0022give science\u0022 buttons appear to give yourself some funds or science to help you get started.
