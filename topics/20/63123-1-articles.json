Essentially something that works like the basic flight computer of remotetech (which can do this) but extends its functionality with more autopilot things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried out MechJeb and kOS so far, but both seem to behave in a such a way, that despite there are pre-programmed commands sent to the vessel, when the vessel goes out of remotetech radiorange, it stops executing these commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I purposefully not put an antenna on a vessel to test this out. I activated ascent autopilot with MechJeb. When the vessel got out of radio range at about an altitude of 2000m, the main engine immediately stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith kOS I wrote a simple ascent program and tried the same thing. Again, when the vessel left the range of the Remotetech radio, the main engine immediately shut down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know a mod which effectively extends the functionality of the basic RemoteTech computer with things like programmable ascent and stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why kOS shouldn\u0027t be able to handle it.
