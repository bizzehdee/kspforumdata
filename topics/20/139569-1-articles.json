If no breaking is applied, they roll on and on without any friction affecting them. You can even gather magic momentum by simply applying reaction wheel force...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike other mentioned, we are waiting on Squad team to get back from their well deserved vacations an properly fix them. But is there anything that can be done in the interim? I tried tweaking the in-game wheel related parameters namely, friction control, spring strength, damper strength and braking force without much improvements. So I am asking here: Any modder working on or testing wheels parameters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at the \u0022GearSmall.cfg\u0022 file from the \u0022[KSP folder]\\gamedata\\squad\\parts\\wheel\\landinggear\\\u0022\u00A0 we can spot a lots of parameters. In the main section: breakingForce=50, breakingTorque=50. Then some \u0022Module\u0022 section as well which seems to be related to suspension and tension properties: ModuleWheelBase, ModuleWheelSuspension, ModuleWheelSteering, ModuleWheelBrakes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the \u0022frictionless\u0022 problem, the dancing suspension makes them nearly impossible to use for an aircraft...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T01:47:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t find it right now but GoSlash27 had a MM file that was suppose to help - 112GearFixer.cfg I believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Found it - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138567-112-basic-landing-gear-fixer/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELanding Gear Fixer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-14T01:49:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2016 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galenmacil","CreatedById":118681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T20:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for pointing that out Wasml!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
