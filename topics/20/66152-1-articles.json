It was originally made sometime around .18 iirc, the screeshot gives you some idea how old it is. I know other mods add comically large SRBs and massive 3m tanks/engines but I always like these and thought it would be a fun way to learn. Also, most of the other mods add a ton of parts and I know for me at least, I don\u0027t need all those engines and structural pieces, pods and the rest clogging up my VAB menus and eating up RAM. Two 3m engines, two tanks, a massive SRB, 3m decoupler and a 3m - 2m adaptor is plenty for everything I\u0027ve needed to do. The standard stack (everything below the 2m decoupler) can put 50 Tons or about 1.4 orange tanks into a 100km Kerbin orbit all day long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0CYwD3E.png\u0022 alt=\u00220CYwD3E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never done anything in the way of modding but by looking at config files for stock parts I\u0027m stumbling my way through. I\u0027ve gotten the parts working by wrapping the \u0022Part {}\u0022 brackets around the whole file but now I\u0027m trying to figure out what values to add for the new parameters and how to balance whats already there. There are three main parts I\u0027m trying to figure out the balance for. The SRBs, the first stage engine and the second stage engine. I\u0027ve added all three to the \u0022Very Heavy Rocketry\u0022 TT node but I\u0027d like some feedback on the other values I\u0027ve chosen or have yet to chose. To that end, I organized all the stock engine data into this spreadsheet and invented a single metric (engine factor) to compare the performance of engines since it can be hard to keep track of all the different parameters. My version of the engines have a higher EF than any of the stock engines but they seem to be in line with the trend of larger engines having higher and higher EFs (see the graph)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ch0y2SH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ch0y2SH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to try the parts out you can find them, a subassembly of the standard stack and test ship \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x5fqqloh8kydegb/WrAUyOz-2i\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what license Bobcat has on those parts, it would require investigation before free redistribution like this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Ideal Gas Lawyer","CreatedById":60804,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure what license Bobcat has on those parts, it would require investigation before free redistribution like this\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would I go about contacting him or her?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Ideal Gas Lawyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Ideal Gas Lawyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow would I go about contacting him or her?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe has a forum account.
