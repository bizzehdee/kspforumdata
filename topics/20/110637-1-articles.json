I thought there must be a mod out there that puts a mark on a planet (in map mode) of where your flight path intersects the planet surface, taking into account the planet\u0027s rotation.\n\nie imagine an X in the middle of the circle in the following image (not my image, taken from [here](http://mykspcareer.com/2013/09/landing/))\n\n![landburnretro.png](http://mykspcareer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/landburnretro.png)\n\nI couldn\u0027t find such a mod. It would be nice if there was one.\n\nI know some coding, but not in c#. But if someone could give me some pointers, I could try making something like this on my own. It would be fine if it just used a \u0027sea level\u0027 surface altitude, ignoring the planet\u0027s surface terrain.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:19:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mdg583**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:22:35Z","Content":"You mean, kinda like the cross you can put on a planetary map in [SCANsat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-1-0-2-SCANsat-v12-0-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-May-5)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Juicy**\n  \nfixed url for scansat"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:28:17Z","Content":"There is MechJeb and one more will keep looking for it as, I can\u0027t remember the name.\n\nEDIT- Forgot about Scansat doing that.\n\nEDIT- Here it is Trajectories [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694-1-0-2-%28FAR-only%29Trajectories-v1-2-0-%282015-05-15%29-atmospheric-predictions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694-1-0-2-%28FAR-only%29Trajectories-v1-2-0-%282015-05-15%29-atmospheric-predictions)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:40:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"mdg583","CreatedById":126889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T04:02:59Z","Content":"Thanks very much!"}]}
