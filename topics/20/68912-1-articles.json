Since then, I\u0027ve uninstalled Alternis in favor of RSS (which is gone now so I should probably get Alternis back). During the time Alternis was installed, a TON of asteroids spawned around Kerbin and remained stuck in Jool orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IOP22n4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IOP22n4.png\u0022\u003E. Which is great, because now I can have some fun at Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently asteroids spawn jusst fine around Kerbin, and later get stuck in sun orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this has implications on creating asteroids where you want them.. maybe if you replace some celestial body with Kerbin, go track some asteroids, and put it back, we would be able to direct asteroid belts (I kinda want tons around the Mun). Naturally that might break some saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, regarding kethane, I tried adding the resource generate option to PotatoRoid in the persistent... does anyone know if this is the right method to go about having the kethane resource spawn in asteroids when the asteroid spawns? I saw someone edit the size of asteroids this way, but I\u0027m assuming newly spawned asteroids would go back to however they regularly spawn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to create a plugin to 1. increase the mass (by a multiplier, so they will still be different masses) of procedurally-spawned asteroids, and 2. add kethane to these newly spawned asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve been trying to do is to make a config where each new asteroid either does or does not have kethane based on some percentage (say, 20% have kethane). Furthermore, to make the amount of kethane related to the size of the asteroid (more mass = more kethane), with some random variability around the mean for deposit size. The problem is, I can\u0027t really figure out how squad procedurally generates asteroids from the code, so I don\u0027t know how to target the asteroids...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would seriously appreciate some help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(would this be better in add-on dev?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T18:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty cool.
