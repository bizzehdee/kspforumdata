It helps (but shouldn\u0027t be mandatory) that you do not have Community Resource Pack (and, therefore, no mods that have a hard dependency on it). It is not a resource library (that it would compete with CRP or Classic), it only controls the placements of resources. The issue of \u0022too realistic\u0022 and needing to write configs to support planets is the point of \u0022rational.\u0022 The completely random, default placement of resources is treated as irrational and is deactivated, leaving no resource loadout (except Ore) for unsupported planets. Resources are then arranged on planets based on what the planet would be presumed to be primarily composed of. Example: It is \u003Cstrong\u003Erational\u003C/strong\u003E that you can\u0027t get radioactives and heavy metals at ice planets. But it is also \u003Cstrong\u003Erational\u003C/strong\u003E that ice planets will be full of Nitrogen or water, with a good chance of Ammonia, which is welcome by Kerbalism players. It is \u003Cstrong\u003Erational\u003C/strong\u003E that a volcanic planet would have a lot of Gypsum (a Sulfur compound used in-game) and Carbon Dioxide and would lack in cryo substances. I don\u0027t go out of my way to find every planet mod out there and write configs for them. I handle popular and recent ones (mostly on request) then it\u0027s up to the owner of whatever other planet mod to do the same.

I like Classic Stock because it doesn\u0027t have the sheer width of a vast array of resources for every niche use case like CRP and real life. KSP gameplay is simple by nature... But I like CRP because real resources bring real data that I can do math and come up with interesting and specific results on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your detailed response, I really appreciate this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI probably won\u0027t be using Rational Resources simply because I\u0027m really bad with config files and screw it up a lot, and I have a lot of celestial bodies to make configs for (~80). I also can\u0027t ask you or someone else to do them for me, seeing as the systems are entirely procedurally generated with Infinite Discoveries and therefore nobody else has the files for them. Otherwise, I would\u0027ve used Rational Resources since I knew it supported Classic Stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I installed Pathfinder, I did a bit of testing and I think it works for my uses. I\u0027ve also installed Buffalo 2 and DSEV.
