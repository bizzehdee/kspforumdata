I became very excited, as I had been waiting for such parts for a while now, however, the thread died down very quickly,before anything was ever released \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. After waiting a while (a month), hoping that the thread would be revived, I realized that that was very unlikely to happen. So I decided to ask the community, full of amazing modders as it is, for such a rover delivery pack instead! The pack should be at least slightly stockalike, be compatible with FAR and Deadly Reentry, and feature several parts dedicated to constructing rover delivering systems such as skycranes, capsules in which a rover could be held during reentry with attachable heat shields, etc. I would appreciate it greatly if someone were to look into this.
