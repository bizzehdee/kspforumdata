It doesn\u0027t have to be full fledged physics, but something simple would be useful to have \u0022passive return missions\u0022 that take 10-20 loops to lower before finally actually entering lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T00:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP turns off physics when not on the vessel or on rails time warp, however this might be able to be done based on altitude.
