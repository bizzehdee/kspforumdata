The plan is to have fun building infrastructure, so I\u0027m looking for things that will play nicely\u00A0with an orbital station or two, crew and cargo shuttles making runs, miners, tankers,\u00A0etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - what do people like and dislike about these mods?\u00A0 Strengths, weaknesses, things you wish you had known before devoting dozens of hours using a mod you ended up uninstalling? \u00A0The goal is to learn from others\u0027 experiences and make a well-informed decision. \u00A0If things go well on the Mun, then we\u0027ll look at colonizing Duna and possibly Laythe. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for your replies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit -

a lot of the fun bits, but a lot fewer parts and simpler resource processing. \u00A0Some folks start there, then migrate to UKS (or just stick with MKS-Lite).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note - usually folks that get overwhelmed with UKS are overwhelmed because they are trying to do every single thing at once and use all of the parts... which is bad. \u00A0As a gameplay mod, it\u0027s more of a marathon and not a sprint. \u00A0And the new updates which give bonuses and rewards as you grow your colonies is there to encourage slow steady colonization, not \u0027launch it all in one go and poof -
