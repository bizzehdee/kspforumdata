It doesn\u0027t assume you have used blender or unity before like others. I would love to see a better edited version of it but it beats all other tutorials for covering the basics.

Quite a few affects can be achieved by modifying the .CFG files rather than programing new coded modules. The .CFG files are not well documented but after a lot of experimentation I found you can do a lot of things with them you would assume you need a module for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been programing as an amateur on and off for many years. I did programing at university although that was a while ago. I\u0027m not the best programmer and I\u0027m not the worst but programming for KSP is very hard. Learning to program when you have to treat other bits of code as black boxes is very hard. Programming of KSP is not a good place to start programming and not an easy place to program in. I have managed to get some bits of code together which is why I started learning modeling so that the whole thing could be presented as a whole package. The modelling has taken a couple of months to get the hang of and even now I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not doing some bits right or in the most efficient way. I dread to think of what I would have programed if I was learning programming at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Niv200","CreatedById":103280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T10:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks yall! great video clockwork!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T10:56:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 10:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Niv200\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
