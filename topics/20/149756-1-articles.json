I\u0027d like to remove them so I can play KSP without having to wait for all the mods I have installed to be updated. Is there a simple way to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T06:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really.
