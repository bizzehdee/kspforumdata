It starts with USSCS Nostromo hauling a big load of cargo (uranium iirc) to some place.\n\nWhat I would like is a type of contract that tells you to transport **Ore** from **X** to **Kerbin** only!\n\nSince there are no in-game colonies there\u0027s no sense hauling ore to different planets for profit and that\u0027s what we have now in stock. In my opinion taking ore from Jool for a joyride all the way to Eve makes no sense at all. Who with sane mind would pay for something like that?\n\nAs always, if there\u0027s already a mod that does exactly this please post a link.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T15:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:55:18Z","Content":"Well, at least the contract should specify something like \u0027Create an ore depot with a refinery in Gilly\u0027s orbit with at least N tons of ore\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T14:01:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, at least the contract should specify something like \u0027Create an ore depot with a refinery in Gilly\u0027s orbit with at least N tons of ore\u0027\n\nWould be good too.
