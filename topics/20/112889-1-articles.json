This is a shame, because I want to make a Saturn-Workshop/Skylab for my AAP challenge submission. The old Smart Parts mod had development put on hold. The WetWorkshops by NovaSilisko isn\u0027t updated for a while, and WetWorks is also not updated. The Smart Parts version is the best, as it allows conversion of any tank.

Download and install [Lunaran Wet Workshop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61167) (Thanks for that hab136)\n\n2. Open the wet workshop mod and remove the plugin folder\n\n3. Open the configs in the wet workshop mod and remove the module named ModuleWetCrewTank\n\n2. Download and install Smart Parts\n\n5. Enjoy!\n\nWhen playing just add the fuel valve from Smart Parts and that will remove the fuel inside the part. I realize that this isn\u0027t really an optimal solution as the Kerbals can still go inside while still fueled but hey it\u0027s something at least.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T12:11:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by weeble**\n  \nFound a way to get it to work"},{"CreatedByName":"Thraken","CreatedById":137960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:16:37Z","Content":"Thank you weeble for the instructions. I had been using Lunaran\u0027s Wet Workshop, but it seems to loose the connection nodes once the fuel drains. \n\nI think that I will try to add Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer resources to the Skylab cfg from Klockheed Martin Special Parts, and then the same instructions you posted to make that into a wetworkshop."}]}
