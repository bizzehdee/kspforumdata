Right now I\u0027m trying to build a huge mobile kethane tanker/converter, but I\u0027m having a devil of a time with the structural panels as flat mounting points. Right now, I\u0027m running a pod, an adapter, and an I-beam backbone. But the panels are being persnickity. So I\u0027m wondering if there are any mods out there that can provide a stable backbone, AND mounting points for the tanks. I don\u0027t want to go with a tanker-truck design, and I don\u0027t want to spend hours on end placing panels on the I-beams. So if there are any mounting points that can do both of what I want, my engineers will thank you profusely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T02:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe B9 aerospace pack has some flat panels that you can use. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malachai","CreatedById":61407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T03:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, thanks for making me bite the bullet on the B9 pack.
