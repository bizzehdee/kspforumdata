I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible, but if it is I would very much like to see a caves mod, perhaps with procedurally generated caves though that\u0027s optional. It would be a fun challenge for rovers and even more fun for VTOL pilots, or heck even for pilots with very manoeuvrable ordinary planes. Anyone think it\u0027s possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T07:44:12Z","Content":"Dunno about caves, but I would like to see more canyons, ravines, precipices and other steep challenging surface elements.
