And which one would you really miss?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Raster Prop Monitors: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For nice IVA flights and on-board cameras. I really love the functionality and the depth it adds without destroying the vanilla ksp experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. ScanSAT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The possibility to give real function to satellites and evaluate terrain, pick landing spots and identify anomalies is really fun and adds in a subtile but useful way to the gameplay. And it works hand in hand with Raster Prop Monitors, so you can view the scan-data in IVA when you have a link to your satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Procedural Fairings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Procedural Fairings are probably the most versatile procedural parts available. You can not only build different types of fairings but also improvise hull parts, aero-shells and heat-shields. Those few parts allow for wide variety of cool and creative ways to improve your ship designs. I use procedural fairings on every rocket launch and most vessels carry heat-shields, station modules and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one Mod i would terribly miss, but the above are definitely the 3 of choice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachement System - EVA with a purpose.
