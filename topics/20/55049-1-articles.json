Adding an actual celestial body sounds like it wouldn\u0027t work, but would it be possible to treat it like another ship, putting it into the persistence file as normal, and using an add-on to hide it from the ships list in the tracking centre, affect gravity, show predicted trajectory changes, simulate atmosphere etc.? And if someone wanted it to be a star, could it be made to stay in a single place, like Kerbol, and not be affected by Kerbol\u0027s SOI? Maybe, since it would be like a ship, it could just be as if it was thrust keeping it away from Kerbol. I would think that it would be a combination of in-game add-on and separate program, the program to convert maybe a height map, image file and config file containing mass, atmosphere height etc. to a part/ship with a file the add-on will recognise, and the add-on to make sure that all the in-game simulations to do with a planet being there are performed. Would all this be possible, or would it be too hard or downright impossible?
