That version dates from November 2013 and is hopelessly outdated.\n\nIf you bought the game from either SQUAD or Steam updating to KSP 1.0.X is totally free. And what you\u0027re asking is probably already available for that version."},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Kraken","CreatedById":102655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T08:38:54Z","Content":"Unfortunately, almost no modder is going to put in the effort to make a variant mod part for an obsolete version of KSP. The latest version of KSP is 1.0.2, which can be bought on the steam store or [https://kerbalspaceprogram.com](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) if a copy of ksp is not already owned.
