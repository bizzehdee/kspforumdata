Mercury and early Gemini were battery powered, but later Gemini missions and Apollo were powered by fuel cells that slowly combined hydrogen and oxygen to produce power and water. As well, the lunar lander starting with Apollo 12 and later actually carried an RTG.\n\nIndeed, fuel cells and RTGs are somewhat easier than solar cells in terms of power generation.\n\nAnyways, an easy way to make it more difficult would be to just move the parts to a higher tech node, to sort of force you not to use them until later on. Probably easier than making a module manager hook for incompatibility."},{"CreatedByName":"DennyTX","CreatedById":92389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:36:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E IMHO anyone who would find this kind of restriction challenging and enjoyable would just as easily choose not to attach certain parts to certain types of vessels\n\nindeed....\n\nbut there are a great difference between \u0022be able, but force yourself not to use it\u0022 and \u0022do not be able\u0022..."},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T01:08:35Z","Content":"\u003E One problem is that there are no stock fuel cells.\n\nThere are, actually.

They\u0027d be in some kind of \u0022tech\u0022 tree, that you\u0027d then have to unlock over time with points, earned, for instance, with science.

With incompability we could restrict carry all science onboard simultaneously\n\nAgain, just don\u0027t put them all on the craft. In the case of kerbal, really there are only a handful of science experiments in the first place, several of them about as complex as a tube filled with stuff stuck on the side of the craft. If we had so few experiments that were so light, we probably would cram all of them on to a ship and send them off.\n\nWe don\u0027t do that in real life because science experiments don\u0027t work like that in real life. In the real world, science experiments can weigh almost a full ton to investigate a single idea, and trying to quantify the number of science experiments that could be run in real life is like trying to throw a dart at a dart board with the accurate number of grains of sand on the beach while blindfolded. Just...not possible. So many variables, ways to test, and things we don\u0027t even know you can test for yet.\n\nWhat I WOULD like to see is a progression on the tech tree that improves the transmit value of science as you get higher. Perhaps increasing the transmit multiplier conditional on if you have processed it in a lab. A trained scientist in space can write a report and include photos of an experiment just as well as a trained scientist on the ground can. And while early on I would justify not having good SSTV or digital signals for data transmission, thus denying the ability to really send files and requiring a verbal description of the samples, later on in the tech tree it just doesn\u0027t make sense."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:25:28Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know, this sort of restriction is what the tech tree is for."}]}
