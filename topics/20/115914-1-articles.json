With the release of [Historian](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122062) mod many people encountered a strong need to change the mission flag for screenshot purposes. We usually forget to set the mission flag during construction in VAB, and in some cases it\u0027s impossible. For example after launching a rocket with two vessels designed for different mission or constructing a ship via KIS addon.\n\n*I know how to do it via save editing, but that\u0027s a time consuming workaround.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T21:52:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**\n  \nanswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:01:45Z","Content":"Have you tried In Flight Flag Switcher [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127902-1-0-x-In-Flight-Flag-Switcher-Switch-flags-on-the-fly-%E2%80%94-literally](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127902-1-0-x-In-Flight-Flag-Switcher-Switch-flags-on-the-fly-%E2%80%94-literally)!"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:11:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Have you tried In Flight Flag Switcher [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127902-1-0-x-In-Flight-Flag-Switcher-Switch-flags-on-the-fly-%E2%80%94-literally](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127902-1-0-x-In-Flight-Flag-Switcher-Switch-flags-on-the-fly-%E2%80%94-literally)!\n\nHeh, how could I miss such a jewel )) Thank you MeCripp."}]}
