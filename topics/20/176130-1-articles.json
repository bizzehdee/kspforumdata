In general we can make a distinction between 2 type of star packs, the ones that put Kerbol at the center of the universe and the one that makes Kerbal orbit some back hole.\u00A0 The later is more realistic but suffers for more technical problem as most mod still assume a galaxy with at the center the sun. Another distinction are the distances user, ranging from 1/1 to 1/10000. A 1/1 scaling result in lightyear distance. This is the most changeling as you your vessel need to achieve very high speed to bridge the distance within a reasonable amount of time. A big problem with this kind of distances beside the long distances are the inherent limitation of the Kerbal similation because due to floating point issues vessel can spontaneously rip themself appart when these distances become too large. How much is too much is unknown but it star to become an issue at more than 2 light years from the center of the kerbal\u00A0 galaxy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
