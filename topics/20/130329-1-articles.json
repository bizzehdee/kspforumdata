Why !? Well I havnt inspected Rover\u0027s LS system, which is also a game-play system of kolonization; yet. I did inspect the earlier versions as I was looking at ways to \u0027process\u0027 resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also used the \u0027Kethane\u0027 and BIOMASS mods. After inspecting the BIOMASS mod, it seemed to have more difficulty but with resource processing that seemed, and still seems, \u0027unrealistic\u0027; but game-playable KSP-Style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP-Style...converting ORE to Fuel for space ships; getting BIOMASS from waste products and converting it to FOOD; making it longer to process as a means of difficulty (I believe, maybe along with some other resource bits; I dont know I never bothered to inspect the difficulty ratings in the \u0027CFG\u0027s\u0027 as they were too hard to read for one (just because I dont use Notepad\u002B\u002B) and too much CFG spam as I call it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried to reconfigure BIOMASS on my own, at first with some difficulty (pun!); then I completely removed the difficulty settings and DLL; thank you (!); this method still works. The reason for doing this was that CFG\u0027s being altered caused a BIOMASS mod issue otherwise; without the difficulty settings, one can freely modify any of the BIOMASS CFG\u0027s to their own liking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, instead of BIOMASS to Food, I have about 10 different resources to make food. Also BIOMASS useages of microflora and nutrients are different than mine; I have my own terminology for BIOMASS, microflora, etc; nutrients go to make fertilizer which is part of the 10 nutrients that all go together in the hydroponics Greenhouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a brief look at MKS or UKS or USI whatever its called...I saw \u0027DIRT\u0027 added to the Community Resource Project resources (also a USI product); well in my honest opinion, \u0027DIRT\u0027, which is an organic material, cant be readily found in space, and hydropnics without dirt is more efficient, and but more nutrient heavy (and water heavy !); also \u0027DIRT\u0027 is essentially fertilizer (not per se); they also use \u0027MULCH\u0027; I have not looked at the processes but I do know how to plant potatoes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a stickied post on remixing MODS quite by accident; I hope to add my MOD somehow, but in order to do it I would have to use someone else\u0027s \u0027NON-Process\u0027 part models to house the resource processes in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see other people making part models for other modders\u0027 resources (and processes) so I know it can be done I just havnt had the time to look at this venture, and next week I plan on trying to make my own kolony buildings to house my resource processing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy resource processing is straight-forward and could use the STOCK resource converter; altho the best way to do this, the STOCK resource converter is very archaic to use; but it \u0027CAN\u0027 be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Rover said, Tac-Life is more concerned with limited survival supplies; Kerbals must plan their space stay based on Tac-Life survival rates; which are also unrealistic as far as storage of the resources.

Now unfortunately I cant use any of it\u0027s converters, or BIOMASS old converters for that matter; this may have to do with Unity update; their really needs to be mass resource conversion; now it seems to be gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter Me ! So there is the RSS or Real Solar System, which I hope to get into at some point, and now the Galactic Naberhood (sp!); so I figured why not realistic resources ! Elements, chemicals, substrate, minerals, stuff that was the start of the resource game, and that I kept and have now re-added all of them back into the CRP (Community Resource Project) resource configs ! And not just those, but many others; raw drillable and scannable resources readily available on planets and moons; everything out there needed to make fertilizer for hydroponics, water for drinking, and oxygen for breathing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTac Life was, and still is, the best place to start a resource game; I just went further with it having to figure out my own resource processes, and I do it with only \u0027CFG\u0027 files; no C\u002B Programming !!
