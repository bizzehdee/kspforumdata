I was able to skid along the runway and limp into the air, fly to the island runway, reach 7500m, make coordinated turns, land where I wanted to. \u00A0I even landed a couple of times without exploding, and if you get it JUST right it might even be possible to take off again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m looking to do might start with a\u00A0Module Manager patch that reorganizes the very early tech tree assignments to make planes like this possible from the start. \u00A0So that would include a cockpit, engine, a fuel tank, and a control surface - the girder and basic fin are stock start techs. \u00A0Or perhaps you start with just the command chair for a really Wright Brothers-style contraption for your first couple of flights; maybe a radial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank config\u0027d for liquid fuel. \u00A0That leads to just enough science data - from flight and nearby biomes - to unlock the caveman rocket parts (Mk1 pod, Flea, parachute get pushed to Basic Rocketry) and slightly nicer plane techs. \u00A0Perhaps take some local survey contracts for funds? All the early rocket parts get pushed back a node, so you can develop the plane to rescue your kerbals before flying the rocket. \u00A0Then plane techs keep pace with rocket techs, so as you unlock the Hammer and fly farther, you get\u00A0the fixed-wheel gear and windscreens and aero tailcones,\u00A0liquid fueled rockets come along with Juno jets and pressurized Mk1 pods, etc. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod parts should be as minimal and stock-alike as possible (I\u0027m not going to be making new parts). \u00A0Is there a propeller\u00A0somewhere that\u0027s more low tech and WW1-style than that\u00A0KAX A7 AeroSport engine? A tiny control surface with more Basic Fin styling rather than the stock spaceplane aesthetic? \u00A0Does this make more sense as a tweak to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112627-12x-ett-engineering-tech-tree-dec-22nd-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EEngineering Tech Tree\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0than stock? \u00A0Maybe start with a post on the Challenge board for playtesting? \u00A0And I\u0027m sure that many players would find this amount of\u00A0recovery time and effort to be wasted gameplay - that\u0027s fine. \u00A0This would be for someone who likes flying, hilarious new plane design challenges, and a bit of head canon and roleplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll ideas and feedback welcome! \u00A0Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-13T08:00:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2017 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-13T08:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrelevant thread from 2015:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106901-alternate-start-propeller-planes-gt-jets-gt-rockets/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
