It uses the KSP ScienceDefs.cfg, meaning you can use the existing experiments or create your own. At the moment the GUI is kinda ugly, but it works. I am missing a storage module, so for now you can store infinite iterations of the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlans:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1:I plan to make an ExperimentConversion module, that allows an experiment result(configurable) to be turned into another experiment result(configurable). Both input and output experiment should be either stock(transmit alowed) or with no transmission allowed. It is supposed to be used for E.G. a surface sample analyzer that turns a surface sample into a surface analysis(which could then be transmittable) But at the moment I am facing some problems creating an experiment result without adding it (with 0 data and science) to the R\u0026amp;D Archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: I plan to implement experiment based requirements for new technologies. Like \u0022Mun dust refinery\u0022 technology requires a certain amount of science collected in surface samples from Mun, before you can research it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not planning to make alot of parts (I am a terrible 3d designer), but I hope others would use the mod for making new part packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny comments or suggestions for extra features?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards RCSub\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCSub","CreatedById":82870,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T15:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust found that KSP also creates these \u0022empty\u0022 entries in R\u0026amp;D archive that I mention in plans 1.

The part of the tech tree mechanism that arms to be lacking is the ability to require a certain kind of science to unlock a node. As it stands now, research on the moon would be able to unlock the \u0027make fuel at jool\u0027 node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it may require some plug in programming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thought for your conversion problem. What if you make the soil and atmosphere samples as defined resources, similar to intake air, instead of an experiment. So you land and start collection. Then you define your experiment part to require soil as a resource for operation. If you make it require 5 units per second and take 20 seconds to do the science, you turn 100 units soil into a science experiment result and bypass the need to convert zero value science to a different experiment. As a resource, soil would have mass, so there would be an advantage to processing it in place instead of carrying it back to orbit, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get everything else working but need a plugin to check whether an experiment has been performed before allowing a part to function, let me know and I\u0027ll help! I can also help work part models once you get everything working mechanically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T18:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by artwhaley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
