I played with it a bit. At the time it lacked patched conics. That meant that my orbits just changed ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)! On your final point with the \u0027invisible planets\u0027, it wouldn\u0027t work. Full stop. This is due to many reasons. The main problem is the way that KSP (and most/all games use gravity). In real life, everything with mass has its own gravity (Yes, you too! On a different topic i decided to calculate my escape velocity once. Spoiler alert, it is really small!). Due to this, if you reached the centre of the Earth, managed to hollow a large amount of space out and the heat didn\u0027t bother you at all, you would be effectively weightless due to the fact that all of Earth was pulling on you evenly. You would be floating! In games though there is a set spot of the centre of gravity. Since gravity decays at a rate like light (if you double your distance from something, the gravity affects you 1/2^2 as much as before. If you get three times further away it is only 1/3^2 of the strength. I think ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)), When you get closer and closer to this \u0027invisible planet Lagrangian point\u0027 the gravity gets stronger and stronger. Eventually, if you pass directly through is you would accelerate to ridiculous speeds. Additionally, Lagrangian points are just points where the gravity is in equilibrium. Additionally, on the Kerbal side of things, imagine the Lagrangian points of the Joolian System ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif).\n\nNow, I am definitely no expert on this! I am just a high school physics student who hasn\u0027t been taught this but had to find and self teach my understanding of astrophysics etc. and I therefore would be wrong in many parts. I would appreciate people telling me if I have anything wrong and telling me what is right instead ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)! Now, onto my Munar mission whilst listening to 80\u0027s music!"},{"CreatedByName":"edrobotguy","CreatedById":58949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T10:15:33Z","Content":"... and they are possible without solving the n-body problem.\n\nWe just have to accept a few limitations. First, the physics of the Kerbal universe are slightly different than our universe, so we need to work within those rules. Second, we\u0027re going to have to change how L1, L2, L4, and L5 work a little bit, and forget about L3 altogether. So, they aren\u0027t exactly Lagrange orbits, but they\u0027re Lagrangey. \n\nSince the orbits of the planets and moons are on rails and well-characterized, the L4 and L5 type orbits are **easy**. For an L4 or L5 orbit of Mun, just put your satellite in the same orbit as Mun (the same semi-major axis), *just outside Mun\u0027s sphere of influence*. From the point of view of the surface of Mun, the satellite would appear to orbit an invisible point just ahead of or behind Mun, once a month. The closer you can match the orbital parameters of the satellite with the orbital parameters of Mun, the closer it would appear from the surface of Mun to be hovering at a point in the sky. \n\nIf you wanted a little more realism in your L4 or L5 orbits, just put them 60 degrees ahead of or behind Mun in its orbit. Or, take advantage of this quirk of KSP and place a station just outside Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and match the semi-major axis of Kerbin; any subsequent ship making the same maneuvers would end up within a few hours of rendezvous with the station.\n\nL1 and L2 type orbits are trickier, and require constant attention and frequent station-keeping. They again involve the edge of the sphere of influence, but this time in a direct line with the parent body. In this case, the satellite is constantly crossing back and forth between the sphere of influence of the primary and the secondary. The pain in the ass factor is large, but these orbits are possible."}]}
