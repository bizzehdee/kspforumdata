I work with solar panels for a living installing natural gas well controllers that my company builds. Solar panels work exactly like the way they are working in the real world. You see solar panels are composed of a sort of filament that is long and winding and goes from one end to the other. While improved designs have been worked out to reduce the effect very slightly, if you cover even a small tiny amount of that panel with a shadow, it cuts off the rest of the filament behind that point and you severely lose the panel\u0027s performance. The closer the shadow is to the connection point, the less you get (as is the case with your battery which is blocking right at the connection point from the looks of it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve gone to a field site with power complaints from my customer to find out that the panel was installed under just a sliver of shadow from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree_%28oil_well%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echristmas tree\u003C/a\u003E. The panel barely functions and the whole system dies once the battery runs low. So you say that would be an improvement, but if you want to maintain realism, it\u0027s working correctly now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T04:00:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T05:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every interesting - reminds me of christmas lights ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think the \u0022sun over the horizon\u0022 problem is a game engine issue a mod can\u0027t touch.

Here is a panel I have in my office, this is for our smaller controllers (the big ones on end stand as tall as I do!) You can see the silver filament bridging the solar cells. It travels in a single line around the panel forming a positive and negative connection at the top (the two upper silver bars, covered by the stickers). This is standard design, if the sunlight is broken, it loses most if not all of it\u0027s performance because that path is broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Alshain/media/IMG_03381.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Alshain/IMG_03381.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IMG_03381.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said there are improved designs. Some panels have two (or more) filament paths where they make two connections that merge into one near the connection point. This way half (or more) the panel can be covered and still get about 50% of the output. Multiple units (or arrays) are typically bridged by wire, so if the unit is an array all the panels getting sun will output normally and only the one covered will fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a disclaimer I\u0027m not an expert in the subject, I don\u0027t work for BP or any solar manufacturer.
