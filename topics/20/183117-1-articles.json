multi-player game (or mod), the basic idea is to enable people to use and interact with vessels and stations which were created and launched by\u00A0a different user.\u00A0 So far, I\u0027m thinking about a centralized server which would store vessels and the date/time the vessel was saved.\u00A0 Players would play their games, and when they want, they would export a vessel to the server.\u00A0 Then other players would automatically connect\u00A0 to the server and download all vessels there, and, at the appropriate time, spawn the vessels in the game at the same location where they were when exported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several technical issues to be solved, one of which is, for player A who has advanced beyond player B, and player B exports a vessel, how is that vessel imported into player A\u0027s save.\u00A0 Obviously there are server-side issues, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is intended to be a discussion about this idea.\u00A0 Please don\u0027t say \u0022It\u0027s not true multiplayer\u0022 because it isn\u0027t multiplayer.\u00A0 I\u0027m using the term \u0027multiuser\u0027 until a better term can be

Consider players A and B playing on a server. At year 1 vessel Foo is launched in to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E by one of the players, after which the saves are synced. The following day both player A and player B are playing at the same time. Both players decide to fly Foo. Player A flies Foo to Duna, while player B flies Foo to Eve. Upon the next synchronization Foo is now in two different places.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a second case, player A timewarps to year 20 and flies Foo to Eloo,\u00A0and saves are synced. Now if player B interacts with Foo before year 20, player A may not be able to\u00A0fly it at year 20, even though player A already did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow is this handled? One potential solution would be to assign ownership to vessels, and only allow the owner to interact with the vessel. Ownership would then be transferable, only when no potential conflicts exist.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
