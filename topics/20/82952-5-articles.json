A spectacular improvement to playability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame for the realism overhaul stuff - after getting bored with a generic asparagus staged kerbal rocket, needing a \u0022good\u0022 design makes the game far more interesting.

I spend far more time adding and removing packages (all on on the RO \u0022approved\u0022 list by the way), to get a game the doesn\u0027t crash, where all the parts work etc. I\u0027ve finally given up. I\u0027ve probably spent 10 hours trying to get reasonable set of RO packages after kerbal 25 came out and I still haven\u0027t succeeded. (is it 64 bit? Maybe the 8192 res pictures for real solarsystem? Or maybe I\u0027m using the wrong module-manager dll - some packages have newer ones than others. KAS add=ons seem to reliably break things. there are 2^n possible configurations to try). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are working sets of packages out there -and it is just frustrating that I can\u0027t get one.
