What is a clockwise and counterclockwise orbit?? You mean retrograde orbit? retrograde orbit is more than 90 and less than -90 inclination. Type in 180 for a total retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that also mechjeb sometimes doesn\u0027t update correctly, type in the inclination then try changing the altitude (just write the same one), altitude change should update the whole ascent autopilot. I\u0027d prefer there is a separate update button so you are sure it works, and also this would prevent changing altitude while typing in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T23:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume you mean retrograde, so that would be a \u003Cstrong\u003E180 degree\u003C/strong\u003E inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justadude","CreatedById":59374,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T23:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for your replys. I have tried the suggestion given and it doe not work. I always launch into a prograde (left to right )orbit, regardless of what I enter when leaving the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. I do believe it works correctly when launching from kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
