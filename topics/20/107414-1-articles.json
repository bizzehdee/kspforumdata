Of course I could add quantum struts and reaction wheels, but I was wondering if anyone has heard of a method to simulate gravity in the VAB? I think this would be cool. You could see how your craft would behave on Kerbin, Eve, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T22:40:39Z","Content":"This would basically require physics to be enabled in the editor."}]}
