I am doing an extended grand tour and wanted to use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/167133-131-dwarf-planets-plus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EDwarf Planets Plus\u003C/a\u003E pack in my mission, however there is one issue I have run into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmong the assorted dwarf planets, there is the ice giant Morbheana (pictured below), which has no moons. How does one visit a planet in a grand tour if it has no moons and no surface?\u00A0I was going to reach out to the mod\u0027s creator in hopes they might have a small moon or two planned, but found they haven\u0027t been online since June. I would make a moon myself, but I feel like making a moon for my own mission would be cheaty (and besides I suck at it), so I figured here would be the best place to ask for someone to make a small moon for this lonely gas giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf one of you readers decide to make one, I would like to request that the moon be visually unique (Could have a stupidly large ring or be a bright color or something). Something I think would be cool would be a mini Duna of sorts, complete with a thin atmo, wacky colors and unnecessarily large ring, or a giant giant mountain. Also if you do decide to undertake this and make a moon thanks a ton!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a picture of Morbheana from the tracking station:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IW45mqK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022574\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IW45mqK.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-07T14:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost mods are created from a player wanting some feature, finding it doesn\u0027t exist and then making it themselves.\u00A0 Many modders start with no prior experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a perfect opportunity to learn how to create a moon...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoshTheKerbal","CreatedById":204687,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T01:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created KerbalUniverse and I am currently working on another mod.
