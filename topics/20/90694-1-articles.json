When you have a lot of mods installed, the stock toolbar tends to stretch out pretty far. To free up a little screen real-estate, the messages app (which I believe has no use outside of career mode) should not be displayed in science or sandbox mode. If there actually is a purpose to this app outside of career let me know, but I couldn\u0027t find any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be fairly simple to do, as I know it\u0027s at least possible to \u003Cem\u003Ereplace\u003C/em\u003E a stock app (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60227-0-25-0-KSP-Alternate-Resource-Panel-v2-5-2-0-(Oct-10)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlternate Resource Panel\u003C/a\u003E can do this), and the contracts app doesn\u0027t appear outside of career as a stock behavior.
