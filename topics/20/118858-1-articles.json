Think the Sensor block from Space Engineers. Something enters it, and it triggers. Leaves again, and it un-triggers. Perhaps this could be integrated into Smart Parts, if kOS can\u0027t detect it. Maybe a cunning coder could look at solar panel occlusions and derive the position from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per usual, if this mod exists, please link me to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T07:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart Parts has a proximity sensor now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T17:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. After perusing the thread, I have found that this is nearly exactly what I want. I was hoping for something that would detect anything, not just a transceiver. Ah well, it\u0027ll do.
