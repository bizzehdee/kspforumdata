I want to keep the resolution the same and high quality (even though i know reducing it also reduces the blockiness). I have two ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) does a vertex height 16 map (in kopernicus continued) work to reduce blockiness and\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) does making the terrain bumpier help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfinally, is there a pqs mod or something that can round things off better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(also what compression do you use to save 16-bit heightmap)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
