It would open a window with all of your ships current stages. \n\nOn this Window, you select your destination. Let\u0027s say you want to go to Eve. You select, Eve, and it\u0027d show either a green or red light depending on if you have enough Delta V currently on your ship to make it there and back again. \n\nYou can also break it down stage by stage. Say you want Stages 1 and 2 to get you into Orbit. Under the first final destination of Eve, in the next bracket you\u0027d click \u0022Kerbin Orbit\u0022, and then Stages 1 and 2. It\u0027d then calculate the total delta V of stages 1 and 2 and give you either a red or green light. \n\nLet\u0027s say for this example, it gives you a red light. So you know your ship has a total amount of delta V required to get to Eve, but stages 1 and 2 don\u0027t have the delta V to get you into Orbit like you\u0027d like, meaning you\u0027d have to burn into stages 3 or even 4 to get into Orbit. Now lets pretend you fix this, so both lights are Green. \n\nNow you want Stage 3 to get you from Kerbin Orbit, into Sun orbit, you do the same, so on and so forth. through the stages, and selections, of each \u0022waypoint\u0022 or stage in the flight itself to get from kerbin to Eve, and back. \n\n------------\n\nOf course this wouldn\u0027t be a fool proof, or a fail safe. If you fly the ship wrong, make bad burns, etc. the ship may still not get you from point A to B and back, but it would help while creating a ship to see the lights Green or Red depending on stage, and destination, etc. etc. letting you know you \u0022Should\u0022 if flown right, have enough Delta V to get you to where you want to go.\n\nIt would also help beginners know if they are flying their ship wrong. If they keep getting Green lights, but are not able to actually make it do what it should, they know they are doing something wrong somewhere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T02:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena**"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T05:11:18Z","Content":"Or you could use KER to get the dV and look it up yourself.\n\n![UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T06:09:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or you could use KER to get the dV and look it up yourself.\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png)\n\nOr you could use the dv, to make the program, and have a nice little visual in-game to let you know as well, which was exactly what I was referring too. \n\nOr let\u0027s go with your mentality, and remove all the visuals entirely in the game, make it a spreadsheet, where you stack name plates ontop of each other, and then the game tells you if you made it there and back ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T06:13:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T00:32:37Z","Content":"This would actually be a pretty easy way to make a dV indicator that Squad could digest putting in."},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T01:40:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This would actually be a pretty easy way to make a dV indicator that Squad could digest putting in.\n\nI agree, and making it like a series of green lights for your destination and the ship itself, with additional information of what your dv actually is, etc. would do wonders to help new people, and give the ship builder even more flash."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T02:14:03Z","Content":"\u0022Screw delta-v .... build and launch... sort out the problems later\u0022\n\nJeb, said at KSP HQ day one, hour one\n\nNever ignore the master."},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T03:02:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not very good at scripting, and know very little about the Unity engine itself, otherwise I probably would do this mod. \n\u003E What the mod would do is actually pretty simple, and would be extremely helpful to new players, and make it easier for old players. \n\u003E \n\u003E It would be a button you click on the toolbar during construction of a ship.
