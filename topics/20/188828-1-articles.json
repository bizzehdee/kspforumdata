Even if I disliked it, the idea of contracts involving investigation of offworld ships wreackages is appealing. I don\u0027t think -a priori- it would be difficult to implement, but I have no idea where to start modding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBasics:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Being able to use scanner arms in \u0022feature parts\u0022 that would be special semi-destroyed parts in ships (engines, tanks, capsules).
