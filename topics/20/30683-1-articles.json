Now however - with half as many mods - it won\u0027t even make it to the title menu. I\u0027ve spent hours making sure any mods that aren\u0027t specifically .20 compatible aren\u0027t installed. I\u0027ve even gone so far as to edit part.cfg\u0027s and re-arrange directory structures into the new system on mods that aren\u0027t updated yet. I\u0027m at least 15 hours into trial and error at this point. I was really excited when I heard .20 was going to fix memory problems, but it\u0027s made the problem worse.

How much memory are you running on your system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my tricks to get more mods to run and get faster loads was just to remove any parts I didn\u0027t feel attached to, such as fairings, redundant parts, etc. Sounds like your problem is a bit worse than that though.
