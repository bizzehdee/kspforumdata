You have a choice of different tech trees, some of which put probe parts at the beginning for a sounding rocket/plane based start as you\u2019ll find in RP-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also contract packs that replicate some real life missions in the stock Kerbol system which might interest you, different propellant types (e.g. cryogenic hydrogen and methane rockets) and so on, but the much smaller scale of the stock system makes it inherently easier to get around as even with the terrible fuel tank mass ratios, stock parts are overpowered for the stock system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest trying a combination of KCT, Kerbalism (with the full config for part failures, life support, radiation and science) and Probes before Crew and see how you get on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mateusviccari","CreatedById":188698,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-28T20:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also get the\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/197734-191-1101-kiwi-tech-tree-overhaul-130-17-december-2020/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E kiwi tech three\u003C/a\u003E, along with its recommended mods and the ones @\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#000000;font-size:18px;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0026amp;referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fforum.kerbalspaceprogram.com%252Findex.php%253F%252Ftopic%252F204066-making-the-game-harder%252F\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:inherit;\u0022 title=\u0022Go to jimmymcgoochie\u0027s profile\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ejimmymcgoochie\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Esuggested.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
