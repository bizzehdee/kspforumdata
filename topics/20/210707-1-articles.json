With a sequel coming up,\u00A0 it will be interesting to see what gets improved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original mod was good, but the variety was a little low. Also, there were\u00A0 no space-based weapons or items, apart from that one missile (if you were going to add 1 thing specifically for space, why not add more?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the features I am most excited about adding to BDarmoury will be colonies. The potential the has is massive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, it will be possible to set up colonies, then go to war with others. This may add an interesting aspect to the mod, especially if unique mechanics are integrated to facilitate this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that is harder but wayyy cooler is extra structures for colonies that are military focused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAA guns\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmmo storage depot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong-range (perhaps interplanetary) Missile silo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort to medium range missile battery\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what could be added for interstellar travel integration, but it would also be interesting. It could allow for grand conflicts across multiple systems, with many Kegadeaths of casualties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this to work, the tech tree must have a decent progression path for weapons/other equipment (unguided rocket goes to laser guided goes to active radar missile that impacts at retavitlistic speeds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if there is anything you would want for BDA 2.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-20T23:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes! \u00A0I would love to be able to battle and simulate an interplanetary war with my friends.

This way it\u2019s easier to tell which part of a planet is yours and you don\u2019t just have a bunch of colonies scattered everywhere.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA way to capture a colony and transfer all of it\u2019s kerbals to my agency. It would be a bit tedious to have to make a new colony for every single won battle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn easier solution for launching and managing many different crafts. If Intercept isn\u2019t lying about their new physics architecture, some of the battles that\u2019ll occur (especially on smaller moons like Gilly) are going to be MASSIVE. \u00A0Keeping track of many different planes, ground vehicles and possibly even spacecraft is going to be necessary. \u00A0This is assuming there isn\u2019t already something like this in stock.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA way to assign and maneuver different \u201Csquadrons\u201D. If I\u2019m going to go to war, It would be ideal to be able to use tactics. Winning via sheer numbers can get a bit old after a while. This would probably be really difficult to get to work with spacecraft, but it\u2019s definitely possible to be able to do this with aircraft and ground craft. I think a similar thing that the Command \u0026amp; Conquer games use would be cool, though being able to set a strict route for craft to follow would be a nice addition.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore documentation and a more intuitive, self explanatory UI/UX. I think this is self explanatory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe great thing about early access is that it would really help modders iterate on their mods before multiplayer and 1.0.
