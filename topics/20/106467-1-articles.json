The pool of recruits refreshes on occasion.\n\nAlso, you could do a search and replace on your persistent.sfs file. Search for gender = Female and change it to gender = Male\n\nThey\u0027ll still have feminine sounding names but you can either change those as well or embrace it as truely neutral to gender. If Kerbals are androgynous, they should not consider Valentina (for example) to be any more feminine than they\u0027d consider Bob to be masculine.\n\nAlso, I think the females look less female than the males do male.
