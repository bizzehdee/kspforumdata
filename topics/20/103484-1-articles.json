What would a mod that implements a chance of a kerbal kid being \u0022born\u0022 on that colony? \n\nIf a male and female have lived on a colony for x # of years and that colony is a sufficient size. Of course the kid would be nothing more than a number and name on a display box, but it would add an interesting thing to the game no doubt. The implications of it would be rather fun actually. \n\nConsider: \n\n1) The mod which makes Kerbals need food, water, etc. Having a few kids born on a colony could result in that need growing. Resulting in you having to update your colony with either more modules, or move those kids from the colony to KSP (Perhaps a contract?) \n\n2) If you kept the kids checked in the background, you could also have it procedurally generate them into a working KSP member in the future. Say 21 years in the future, the Kid who was born on the Eve Colony is now mature enough and has gone through the training to be either a scientist, engineer, or pilot. Which one he/she is is randomly chosen depending on the parents, and what they were as well as averaging the parents stats. \n\n3) For Immersion sake, it would help give the illusion and immersion that Kerbin isn\u0027t just a planet where Kerbals pop up out of holes in the ground, which is of course ridiculous. (Sorry had to throw in LOTR, kudo\u0027s to those who caught it.... you nerd.). \n\n4) It would help to grow Colonies past being just \u0022Pods\u0022 with kerbals in them. New Modules such as a nursery, eatery/kitchen, sleeping quarters, school module of multiple different grades, etc. could also be built on the colony, creating a larger structure more fit towards the futuristic idea\u0027s we have of truly colonizing another planet. \n\n5) KSP turns KSG(Kerbal Space Government). With the implimentation of several colonies, suddenly you could make another mod that results in each Colony having special \u0022focuses\u0022. Whether it be \u0022recreational\u0022 (Just chilling and living, which would have the highest birth probability), Scientific focused (virtually no birth probability), Or even Educational (Very large specialized modules which train the \u0022Teen kerbals\u0022 in space flight, and KSP specialities giving them a big boost in stats upon gaining age 21). This could also allow you to give colonies special focuses, boosting specific things. (Such as giving a Colony a science focus would increase the science output of that colony, but also increase the power generation, likewise, setting a colony to \u0022recreational\u0022 would boost the birth rate etc. but also the food intake. If you use the mod that allows you to build ships in orbit or on other planets, you could even set a colony to \u0022production\u0022, which could decrease the time it takes to build ships, with the added cost of extra energy as well.). \n\n6) Let the birth of the Interstellar KSG Commence!: If a mod like this really took off, you would see players with 5\u002B colonies, with transport shuttles setup between them even with the mod that allows for ships to be built in orbit or on other planets, resulting in a completely self supported Interstellar Kerbal Civilization. \n\n7) (Sorry I keep adding new ones) IF it did get this far, soon you\u0027d need kerbals with other specialties.. Such as teachers to help train the new teens into a proper KSP member who\u0027ll create wonderful explo.. err.. advances in kerbin adventures. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T00:34:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena**\n  \nupdated the name"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T00:35:42Z","Content":"That actually would go well with the generation ship idea that RoverDude has mentioned.
