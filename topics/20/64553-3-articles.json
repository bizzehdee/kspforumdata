At least from a user\u0027s point of view, yes, we have a cohesive set of core features - a text field describing the mod and a big red button to start the download. \u003Cem\u003EPractically everything else is pure gravy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a user, I\u0027m not at all fond of all the extra krep and requirements some folks are trying to burden mod authors with. Whatever feature set is implemented, anything beyond a basic text field should be completely optional to avoid raising the bar on mod developers. Now, that may sound odd because raising the bar is certainly desirable... but we don\u0027t want to even unintentionally discourage the guy who comes up with a simple reskin or .cfg change of a Squad part, he may be the next Majjir or Ferram or Sarbian. Make it simple, make it accessible, and let the forums sort the good from the bad. For Replaceport to succeed, it\u0027s not enough to simply work where Spaceport doesn\u0027t, the inertia of the simple solution of hosting your own files has to be overcome as well. If it\u0027s not as easy and straightforward for the developer to use as it is for the user - \u0022KSC, we have a problem\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T16:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022psyper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022psyper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou missed out the 3rd\u003Cp\u003E3. why aren\u0027t people using this Nexus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen people slatting Nexus because of A, B, C. and others saying they love it because of A, C, D. and others saying they never heard of it - me included.

This new project is yet another initiative with no stated time frame, and many of us frankly have no confidence that Squad will get the job done. Bringing this news only makes it harder for us to motivate the creation of a community platform since a Squad solution will always feel right around the corner. I have some experience with this feeling: I author Kethane, a resource mining mod. Many of us resent Spaceport\u0027s continued existence because its inertia makes establishing a superior alternative more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a deeper problem, though. The modding community has long tried to have some influence on Spaceport, or some transparency in its development process, to no avail. I\u0027ve requested many times that Squad have detailed discussions with modders about what we want out of Spaceport. I\u0027ve communicated specific requests (e.g. change of uploading terms) on behalf of the community, and they\u0027ve come back with assurances of resolution followed by long silence. (It\u0027s particularly bewildering because most recently, \u003Cem\u003ESquad approached me\u003C/em\u003E about the modding community\u0027s grievances, and yet no public action has been taken.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom its inception, Spaceport was a Squad project to further Squad\u0027s goals. That\u0027s fine; it\u0027s Squad\u0027s duty as a business to work in its own interest. However, it\u0027s become clear that the modding community needs to look out for itself and its interests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think it\u0027s not worth Squad\u0027s time. Let us handle it. Spend your resources on building the game. If you want to help now, a few people are curious about Spaceport traffic statistics. If you want to help us later, you can help me recoup my server costs. In the meantime, I ask that Squad follow up on its prior promises to the modding community before getting involved in a new undertaking. (I have documents for your reference if you require.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, feel free to get in touch.

We don\u0027t have anything to share at this time, other than we will be looking at this thread for what people want and see how much of it will work on the updated portal. \u003Cp\u003EI also want to stress we have been quiet about SpacePort because, well, we just haven\u0027t had anything new to share. We all know it\u0027s not fitting our needs but were still trying to fully understand what we want and need. Developing, producing and publishing the game takes a lot of effort so we do appreciate your patience when things remain in flux for far too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I know about Spaceport is that it is an utter pain to search and that craft files seem to rule the day.

I think we should avoid that at all costs. My reasoning is that because those mods are popular, they don\u0027t need all the attention. But because they are features all the time, they \u0022steal\u0022 attention away from other mods that might be new, but just as interesting. That of course is frustrating for new modders.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it\u0027s useful for new players, or players who are new to modding. \u0022Most popular this month\u0022 might be better. In any case, I think multiple such indexes are a good idea. This kind of feature is quite easy to duplicate with different flavors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs far as these concerns go, I think Spaceport has the right idea. Every mod should be packaged in one file, .zip only, no rar, tar, or anything else.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree. As far as I know, .zip is the only archive format supported by all platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trueborn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trueborn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s my stab at first and second tier feature sets. The required features are required just to have a working system. The major features are what makes it better than spaceport. I think all of these make it past the \u0022minus 100\u0022 check.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally agree. We could go back and forth on the metadata requirements, but I\u0027ll agree that every mod should have a name, date, author and version. What you\u0027ve outlined is a great starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy main problem with the Mod Nexus is the fact that it has a mod manager; unlike most people here I really don\u0027t think that a mod manager is a good idea\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t like mod managers. Moreover, Nexus has been around, and yet there are just two mods there.

Negative requirements are important. Consistency with statistics and uploads is fairly easy to accomplish; it just means not screwing up caching.

Most mods are very easy to install anyway, but sometimes, there\u0027s something else.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is getting at a few issues simultaneously, but this is an important takeaway: the site should have a machine-friendly API.
