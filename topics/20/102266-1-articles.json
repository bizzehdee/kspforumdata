Let me be clear however I am not a modder and I am just an extremely grateful consumer. This community gives so much and creates truly remarkable things!. There are tanks, stickers, new ways of doing science, transports, colonization, space station building. There are mods dedicated to space shuttles and replicas and historical rockets, models of rockets that could and shouldn\u0027t be. However at least in my looking there are no mod packs dedicated to just engines. Not mod packs or part packs that just so happen to feature engines that act like real life ones. I am talking about a mod pack of just engines. No tanks just engines! I am talking about making a pack that features some of the most important engines throughout history and putting them into an engine pack. I know that all of the engines in game are designed to resemble or act like real life engines. Im talking about making a kerbalized F-1 and saying ok thats the mainsail. Im saying lets make a stockalike f1, stock alike rd-180, stock alike lr-87, stock alike rl-10s. stock alike merlin engines, j2, all of the important engines that are used to day or were used extensively throughout history. Not just american but Russian, Chinese, european. Listen I know there are packs out there that do all of this. Yes you can point me towards KW Rocketry, Nova Punch, Bobcats Soviet Engines, KSLO, Bobcats Soviet Pack, Launchers Pack, FASA, I\u0027ve play with them ALL! I am just looking for a pack that encompasses them all, but just the engines and just the important ones and most versatile. The other issue is if you want something resembling what I am asking for you need to install 30 mods and be a rocket scientist to use them. So Im not asking for a Realism Overhaul or RSS type deal. I like KSP as is I just wish the engines were more realistic and diverse. \n\nSo my question is can someone make a stockalike pack of historical and modern engines that look and feel like the real things, but work for peoples needs in KSP? Again please I know about most packs, I have been playing KSP and been on these forums for a very long time. Im just curious and I don\u0027t have a super computer that can handle 40 mod packs of different engines, tanks, and utility parts. Just the engines thank you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T19:41:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Niemand303**\n  \nset a prefix"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T18:43:27Z","Content":"Ven\u0027s stock revamp has a nice selection of different formfactors of stock engines with custom improved models.\n\nThe only engines that are lacking in stock game are monopropellant ones, besides that OMS engine.

Lets say for example you want to start a career game with MKS/OKS and Karbonite. They are large but pretty managable mods. Now you want a diverse selection of engines, so you pick rla, fasa, and kw. Along with the dependencies of those mods the dependencies of mks/oks karbonites. Some realism and helpful mods like trajectories, real chutes, dr, tac life support, and all of a sudden your gamdata folder is 20-30 mods deep. Thats really my point, there are a decent selection of tank mods like fuel tank plus and even kw, with a simple engine pack you cut your gamedata folder in half. A strictly engine mods gives you alot of dversity to pursue other things instead of a whole pack like kw or nova or b9.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I hope this gets somewhere it would be nice and there are some good open source engine one is a F1 and the Altas V but there isn\u0027t much IMO for lander engines.\n\nYea I know Snowhite is working on great little stockalike pack with some nice engines but again I am just looking for a pack of engines.

See I am moody when it comes to ksp. I can wake up and wipe my save folder clean and start from scratch with a different vision. Like I can install, FASA, CSS, ISS, Raidernicks, probes and stations, and do completely historical and replica missions. I could be in the middle of building the ISS, I will wipe it clean because now I want to start a career with colonization in mind. Then I want to build super station around laythe. And undoubtedly everytime I get caught up about how to do these things. I personally think I am pretty good at designing things and making them functional and looking good however my issue is getting them there. I either over power things (the kerbal way) but more often then not I am underfueled and lost in space.

I don\u0027t think you quite understand what I am talking about. I apologize if I am not being clear. I am looking for a STOCK ENGINE pack. For example I am not looking for an engine to work exactly like and RD-180. However I am looking for an rd-180 that looks and has comparable thrust of an rd-180. Efficient like an rd-180. The feel of the real thing comes from the performance of the engine (rd-180) being able to launch a multitude of kerbal payload into LKO. Then a rl10 engine that is extremely efficient that looks like an rl10 but as I said not a replica, but close enough for avid fans to know its an rl10 to finish the journey into orbit. Essentially allowing players to create an atlas series of rockets. With proc fairings and other mods combined with this engine pack you could create anything. But as I have said a few times now. No such pack exists that features strictly engines. Or engines that are truly comparable in both performance AND style to real life ones. Yea KW might have an engine that looks like a J2 however it is far to big and powerful to be versatile. FASA has these engines but they are exact replicas. AIES might have an engine that looks like and lr-87 but its nowhere near powerful enough to be a main engine. Even if you tweaked all of these things and made a super folder of reconfigured mods now you have to worry about memory, and even if you trimmed down the mod packs to just the ones you wanted it could still push the memory limit for people with weak computers. Besides that, all of that work could take a very long time and is inconvenient.
