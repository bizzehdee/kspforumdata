How well do these two mods work together/integrate? I\u0027ve not been able to find a definite answer one way or the other but searching (forums and Google) seems to suggest that there was, at one point at least, some form of integration between them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T20:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast I checked (0.25) they worked fairly well together. I think you have to turn on RT features in kOS for them to work together though, which I remember being pretty easy. How they worked together was that you needed a connection to start or stop a script, but kOS could control everything (from the script) even when there wasn\u0027t a connection, which is pretty much how you\u0027d expect it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exitalterego","CreatedById":4564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T22:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks magico.
