When all anomalies in each body have been discovered and investigated, the engine will be available and the location of the new star system will be revealed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, the players will be able\u00A0to build a vessel and try to reach that star with plenty (some?) of new worlds to discover. Won\u0027t be easy, the new engine is only good at travelling in deep space\u00A0between star systems, first reaching the edge of the Kerbol system is needed, and once in the new star system, the ship must reach the celestial bodies by normal means. So \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E would be almost a must.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, thats the idea. I think its not the first time something like this has been proposed, i dont know if with all this plot or not. Anyway, this \u0022Story Mode\u0022 couald add many many hours of gameplay to game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral Mods would be needed, at least:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- kopernikus, and a new star system;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Scansat would be useful for detecting anomalies;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Contract configurator could give some hints or goals in order to achieve that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Future Tech or at least the implementation of the Exotic Engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if modders find this interesting, do something with it!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
