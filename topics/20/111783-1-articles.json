I have a question about mods (again ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)) This time I\u0027m curious about environmental mods; mods that create a more realistic environment for a more immersive gaming experience. I have already downloaded OPM and Chatterer. I was wondering if a mod like the Astronomers pack has been developed for 1.0.2 yet? I looked in the mod inventory, but to no avail ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). Any suggestions?
