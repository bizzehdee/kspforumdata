I\u0027m not sure if its making me do stuff because its the less effective but easier way to do things, or its glitchy.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-17T15:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of things to keep in mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDo you click on \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port on your ship you\u0027re docking with?
