I know there are plenty of Life support mods like Kerbalism and Snacks and TAC life support already but I think my suggestion is a little different but a little more complex too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFood System\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with ksp 1.11 and the new cargo features I think food/snack (stackable) supplies should be transported via cargo/inventory, have their own mass and quantity lasts for a certain amount of time depending on the number of kerbals onboard and duration of mission. Food can only last for 18months maximum before expiry or turning into expired food. So if food is stored (from launch date) and no kerbal is on board to consume it for 18months, it will turn into waste and will not be able to be consumed by Kerbals anymore. Kerbals can survive without food for 2-3weeks (random values between those) before dying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaste Management\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the amount of food ,water and oxygen consumed and duration of the stay and number of kerbals on board is the amount of waste generated. Waste cannot be recycled apart from H2O which can only be recycled at 90% efficiency and O2 at 40% efficiency.\u00A0 Waste is CO2, Waste Water, Food packaging and Expired Food and those are stackeable cargo/inventory items. Waste must be stored. At full ship inventory/storage, no resource can be consumed and no waste is generated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOxygen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO2 is a consumable resource that is available in limited quantity depending on the command pod/storage container/other pressurized units. It is consumed over time depending on the number of kerbals on board and duration of mission. Kerbals generate CO2 waste that can be recycled back to O2 at 40% efficiency and require electric charge to recycle. Oxygen depletion will result in Kerbal\u0027s Death after 3 minutes. Oxygen can be generated with Electric charge and Oxidizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPressure\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommand Pods and other pressurized compartments have to maintain pressure. Cabin depressurization will result in pressure suit O2 consumption which is not recycled and rapid cabin O2 depletion. Vessel impacts on pressurized compartments can result in cabin damage and rapid depressurization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater Recycling/Production System\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater/H2O is a consumable resource that can be recycled at 90% efficiency and when consumed will generate waste water. Depending on the duration of mission and number of kerbals is the amount of water consumed. Water can be generated with electric charge and liquid fuel. Kerbals will survive without water for 2-3days (random value between those)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTemperature Regulation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals can only survive at a temperature of 238.15-288.15Kelvin. Temperature regulation in pressurized compartments requires electric charge , radiators and heat exchangers. Temperatures below/beyond the limits will result in Kerbal\u0027s death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T00:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are great resources on how to get started with modding,\u00A0 I\u0027d highly recommend looking through that and then let us know how it goes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R_Skoklater","CreatedById":205968,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T05:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223912326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611188960\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113874\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goldenpsp\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, goldenpsp said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are great resources on how to get started with modding,\u00A0 I\u0027d highly recommend looking through that and then let us know how it goes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey , thank you.
