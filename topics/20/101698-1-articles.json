So, with my limited experience and the many guides on this forum, I think I can make some parts for fun.\n\nSo I threw together this mood board on the ideas I\u0027m thinking of:\n\n![iAs1hV8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iAs1hV8.jpg)\n\nMost of it is taken either from concept from NASA or real life space station parts. A common theme is octagons, which I like.\n\nSo, if this page takes off, my project is go, but in the mean time:\n\nWhat do you think of the idea?\n\nThanks,\n\nRhyunix\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T15:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rhyunix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:20:18Z","Content":"I\u0027ve always wanted more structural parts, I haven\u0027t seen that many realistic ones, mostly only stock-alike ones.\n\nWhile I don\u0027t play for realism, i\u0027m sure more structural parts would probably be useful for those that do.\n\nI like this idea. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T06:03:29Z","Content":"Near Future Construction\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-90-0-25-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFPropulsion-0-90%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-90-0-25-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFPropulsion-0-90%29)\n\n[0.24.1] Speedy\u0027s Hex Truss System \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86388-0-24-1-Speedy-s-Hex-Truss-System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86388-0-24-1-Speedy-s-Hex-Truss-System)\n\n[WIP] THSS - Tri-Hexagonal Structural Strut\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24849-WIP-THSS-Tri-Hexagonal-Structural-Strut](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24849-WIP-THSS-Tri-Hexagonal-Structural-Strut)\n\n[25/03/2014] Octagonal Truss Set \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69759-25-03-2014-Octagonal-Truss-Set](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69759-25-03-2014-Octagonal-Truss-Set)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T18:29:16Z","Content":"Thanks Kerbiloid, this is helpful, since I didn\u0027t know what mods had done what- personally, none of them have fully covered what I\u0027d like to see, but near future has some designs which are similar- I\u0027ll go ahead with this, but I\u0027d like to see if anyone else would like this"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T18:41:48Z","Content":"Goodspeed Aerospace also has hexagonal trusses, although I don\u0027t know whether it still works in 0.90.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72567-0-23-5-Goodspeed-Aerospace-Parts-v2014-4-1B](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72567-0-23-5-Goodspeed-Aerospace-Parts-v2014-4-1B)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T18:21:33Z","Content":"Interesting mods, but many use hexagons, **and I want octagons!!** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnyhow, I will add concept drawing later\n\n\\*apologies, edited octagons in the first post\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T15:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rhyunix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T18:22:57Z","Content":"like those!
