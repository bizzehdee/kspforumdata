It was very handy for helping me to design landers. That was from a previous install. I have since reinstalled the entire game with all my mods I like and Mechjeb doesn\u0027t seem to have that capability anymore? Maybe I had a older version of Mechjeb before? I\u0027ve got the newest one right now. 2.1.1 Any input would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T15:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it\u0027s Kerbal Engineer that does that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T21:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, KER for that. It\u0027s the only reason I keep KER installed.

But im sure the delta v values for other planets and moons were in the mechjeb delta v window. It just had left and right arrows to toggle through all the bodies. I just cant figure out how to make it work again. I might try KER. Really like mechjeb. I\u0027ve played through career mode a few times without it, but once I discovered it.......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowsutekh","CreatedById":55189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T08:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t start a mechjeb vs. anti-mechjeb argument.
