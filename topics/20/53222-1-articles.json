The video window has two size options, microscopic and small. The Lazor \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edocking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cam has a wider range of screen sizes (and it\u0027s written by the same guy) so obviously the Lazor CAM could have a larger screen and/or more size selections other than two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is, is this possible with the CURRENT release of the camera? Is there a config setting to do this? Is there a simple and well known \u0022hack\u0022 to change this? Or do I need to ask the author?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at the .CFG file and didn\u0027t see anything obvious, so I\u0027m guessing the needed change is inside a binary file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or info will be appreciated.
