So im making a request for a planet and moon I can colonize. I want a planet between eve and kerbin. I want it to be a desert planet with mountains and such but also sandy minmus like flats. I want it to have gravity like the mun so its easy to land and take off. If you could include resources for mks and karbonite idk if thats hard to do. And if it could have a Duna like moon that would be awesome with similar gravity as minmus. Im not sure if this is something hard to do. To whoever decides to take this on let me know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you happy planet making.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
