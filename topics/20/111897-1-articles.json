But it works for polar launches too.\n\nRockets that work with these settings: Usually 2 stage launchers (2nd stage makes orbit), control surface fins on first stage, starting atmospheric TWR 1.75 (1.5 to 2.0 TWR should work) The higher end of the launch TWR range tends to start being too steep to be efficient. SRB assist on the first stage doesn\u0027t seem to cause problems.\n\nAlso, Attitude Adjustment settings (helps stop rocket wobbling):\n\nAuto Tune: OFF\n\nTf: 0.35 for most 3.75m and 2.5m core stages, 0.25 for most 1.25m core stages. Some 2.5m core stage launchers I have (really simple ones) don\u0027t wobble with 0.25 Tf. You want it as low as you can get it without it starting to oscillate, because higher Tf is \u0022slower\u0022 to respond.\n\nThat\u0027s about as much info as I can remember at the moment about my ascent AP settings without actually firing up KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T03:54:52Z","Content":"You are not alone. This spinning thing is something we all initially had trouble with in the new 1.0\u002B aero until we learned to engineer better rockets.\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty.\n\nI also recommend piloting by hand at first in the new aero. You will spin more but it will happen faster, and you can get a better feel for what is working and what is not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T03:58:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"OgreMagi","CreatedById":103767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T05:54:04Z","Content":"I watched the scott manly video about rockets in 1.0 and that seemed to help. He mentioned that fins will help and hurt. \n\nthey will keep you straight but they can limit your ability to change you angle. I am finding that I can launch rockets without fins or mech jeb but it is a grind as each rocket is effectively a custom job to fly/pilot wven with minor changes making the game less fun to play . \n\nSSTO\u0027s everything I have seem shows that you have to get bigger ( larger craft) to use them effectively. I tried lower mass sstos and I am still getting problems. Rapiers seem the best compromise with the new atmosphere physics, but you end up with less Dv in orbit. \n\nHas anyone tried the ore/mining /fuel production yet?

I can\u0027t help but notice in everyone of these types of threads people are turning way to late. No matter what the rocket is you need to turn sooner. I start at 350m-400m with my lowest twr builds. That\u0027s why people are having so much trouble flipping. By waiting so late to turn your gaining way too much vertical velocity. So when it comes time to turn your rocket has to fight against that velocity to change its vector. And you flip. Turn sooner while the air pressure is low.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T12:47:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T13:08:37Z","Content":"I stopped using mechjeb for ascents as I find it easier to do simple and actual gravity turns.

Launches are a lot easier now that you don\u0027t have to turn the rocket manually, just do 90deg angle at 100m/s and keep flying prograde for the rest of the ascent.\n\nRockets flipping come from design errors and a too big AoA."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T02:36:16Z","Content":"Mod-related question moved to the modding section."}]}
