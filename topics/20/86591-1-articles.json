I played 64-bit in my 0.24 career mode and went mod happy but I am trying to only use 32-bit for 0.25 and I am having some difficulties. It keeps crashing because I keep going mod happy. It\u0027s a bad habit. Is there a good list of mods that would fit nicely in 32-bit without crashing? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T03:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s so hard to answer this question because it depends on what you like which none of us know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it keeps crashing, start by making sure all \u003Cstrong\u003EPLUGIN\u003C/strong\u003E addons are up to date and have been updated to work with 0.25 or confirmed compatible. Plugins shouldn\u0027t take much memory though so if it still crashes, you could be out of RAM in which case you can either trim your part mods or install Active Texture Management which will scale them down at the cost of appearance (slightly, I can see the difference but I have a big 1080p monitor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the culprits for RAM overload are B9 and NovaPunch, because they big textures and a lot of parts. Other smaller packs combined like FusTek or KWRocketry can add up quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T03:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are loader bugs that make TGAs take up 4-6x what they should.
