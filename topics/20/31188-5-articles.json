Most mods actually make the game harder or have balanced parts so its not cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as others mentioned yes it may be cheating but its still a singleplayer-game so its okay to do it as long as you dont pretend online to have achieved something you actually cheated to achieve. Also you should consider that by using programs like Mechjeb you actually loose big parts of the actual gameplay. Pretty much like playing a Singleplayer-Shooter with an Aimbot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also i only consider MJ as \u0022cheating\u0022 when it comes down to the autopilot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you should always consider one thing - once you cheat chances are a game will get boring fast since one thing is true in gaming \u0022the path is the goal\u0022 - also chances are that by cheating you will actually loose the interrest in doing such things ingame on your own because they will at some point only seem boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont see why people are arguing that there is no cheating in single-player probably some form of self-protection. There were times when cheating in SP was even considered fun (big head cheats etc.). Anyhow as i said and will say again as long as you do it in SP and dont pretend to be able to do these things without cheats online i dont see a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i think cheating offline and online has similar effects on the person doing it - its about instant reward and accomplishments even if those are not real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would never cheat in KSP because i know that by doing so i would probably loose a lot of interrest in the game due to the new mentality like \u0022Why should i spend hours of playtime to build my space-base\u0022 when i could just autopilot or even \u0022beam\u0022 them there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is it is somewhat boring or even stupid to waste time but it still also is fun - and most important once i start doing what i just said the game will be boring pretty soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Autopilots for me are a no-go. On the other hand i would be interrested in \u0022real-autopilots\u0022 that have to be created by the user for every single space-rocket they create. I think testing the best settings for your rocket and tweaking it not to mention getting it to go to orbit in the first place is probably a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T14:23:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceHole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeriki","CreatedById":3039,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T16:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find mechjeb to be key for setting launch paths and gravity turns (can place a target on your navball that will move to follow the gravity turn you set) you dont have to use its autopilot function, its also great for timing for launch windows, and the deltaV stats in VAB. B9 and the firespitter pack arent really cheaty, in fact getting those big B9 parts airborne can be a challenge. Kethane gives me a reason to set up mining expeditions and planetary exploration programs. KAS gives me the ability to make cranes to load things onto my reusable ships, and to transfer fuel form ship to ship without having to dock (docking on land is a pita). The Hooligan lab mods are fun, the airships can be a bit cheaty but you can make some interesting ships with them, the firespitter pack adds TONS of atmospheric plane parts (propellers and all sorts of funsie things. My favorite mods are the bobcat HOME pack, its what i picture colonization to look like, I also cant wait for the DEMV re-release, sexiest rovers ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T17:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need mods to cheat, just turn infinite fuel on.

There is a set of rules in the game that you alter to gain an advantage. Althogh i agree that cheating online and cheating SP is completely different. Also i agree that the definition of cheating is a bit of a problem since doing it SP without showing online etc. actually lacks the \u0022immorality\u0022.
