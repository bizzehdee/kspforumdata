I\u0027m pretty new to Kerbal and find it is a great bit of software. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m have Mechjeb installed and I\u0027m aware I have to place the Mechjeb part on my craft. Once that\u0027s done, how do I activate Mechjeb. I\u0027m certain I\u0027ve seen the likes of Scott Manley use it whilst building the rocket to determine things like Delta-V and other useful stuff. How do I do this? Is it Mechjeb or another mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T14:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a menu button stuck to the right side of your screen.
