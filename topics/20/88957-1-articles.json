These bugs are on Unity\u0027s part (the game engine software of which KSP runs on), and not on either Squad or the mod authors. Either which way, players have a tendency of blaming the mod, and then the mod authors include code to disable the mod on x64 Windows, simply to eliminate the griping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs right now, KSP on x64 Windows is unsupported, and is very unstable. KSP x64 on Linux, however, is very stable, and the mods that disable themselves on x64 Windows \u003Cstrong\u003Edo not disable themselves on x64 Linux\u003C/strong\u003E. So if you\u0027re a KSP addict, then it pays to install a Linux distro such as Ubuntu or Fedora.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T20:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat isn\u0027t true.
