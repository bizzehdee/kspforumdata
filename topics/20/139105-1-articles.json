Specifically, there is a battery that cannot tolerate more than 850 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with an enormous amount of radiators it still overhearts. It seems to me like radiators just don\u0027t radiate stock heat, but only radiate \u0022MW\u0022. But is wierd because there are two radiator modules on every part \u0022Radiator\u0022 and \u0022Active Radiator\u0022. Surely if there were two kinds of heat and two kinds of radiators, one of them would radiate stock heat right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother wierd thing is that the KSP interstellar wiki says that when thermal rockets are running they will dump all heat out the back with the propellant, but that clearly does not seem to be the case. The heat is negligible whenever this rocket is off, and when it is trusting, the ship overheats until that sensitive part explodes in 3 mintues regardless of radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running KSP 1.0.4, Interstellar, and Deadly Reentry and about 1000 other mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l6ajoNA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022l6ajoNA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T11:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy a so old version of KSP?
