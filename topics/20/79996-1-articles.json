I\u0027ve got some projects that can\u0027t really utilise Gigantors (due to their tendency to break up in think atmosphere) or stock RTGs (which produce maybe 1% of output I need for my design to run).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that KSP Interstellar adds a bunch of really powerful devices - but I don\u0027t quite feel like installing a mod only to utilise a couple of parts and omit the rest - I don\u0027t really feel like playing Star Trek when I\u0027m still to make a kerbed landing outside Minimus. I\u0027m looking for an output of around 100-200 e/s - of course, doesn\u0027t have to be a single part, but the less, the better. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone has any suggestions? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T16:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-24-32-bit-Near-Future-Technologies-%2824-07-14-some-packs-bugfixed%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENear Future\u003C/a\u003E Electrical is probably your best bet.
