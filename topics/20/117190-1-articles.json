I can\u0027t seem to find anything on the subject. I just want Kerbol to look nice when I\u0027m in orbit with some god rays or similar instead of the flat looking stock sun. Any help would be appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT: I found that KSPRC adds new sun flares, but you have to install an outdated assets file. Has anyone updated it? Also, Better Atmospheres has a sun flare dds file, but it doesn\u0027t work no matter where I put it. If it\u0027s not possible for now, I\u0027ll just wait until those mods are updated for 1.0.4. Just thought I\u0027d try.\n\nEDIT#2: I took the sun\\_flare.tex file and updated the shared assets 9 file manually with Unity Assets Explorer and got it to work. Looks really nice ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T23:41:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gampersnaz**"}]}
