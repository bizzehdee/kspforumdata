There was a mod ages ago that let you mess with moving the Kerbals around to sort iof script custom animations, but I can\u0027t remember what it was called to find it. I\u0027m sure the source would have what I need if it was ever released.\n\nAny pointers either way?\n\nCheers!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOoops, I meant to put this in add-on dev. Mods: please?"}]}
