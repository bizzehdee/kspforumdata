Mods that use the tech tree either add parts to existing nodes or make new nodes that would include their parts. There\u0027s \u0022vacant\u0022 nodes in the stock tree for mods like B9 and MechJeb so they don\u0027t need to add to the tree. If however you\u0027re using a mod that re-organises the stock tree (like say VetTech) that can lead to problems with the tree displaying properly when also using mods that add nodes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, problems when it comes to the tech tree usually result in things not showing up properly on the tree itself and parts not being loaded into career mode. If the game outright crashes, it might just be a memory issue. There should be a crash log in your KSP directory.
