Another thing that could be implemented is planet specific abundance of resources, for example duna would be mainly iron rich, the main resources of laythe would be sand and gems, which could be processed into glass and perhaps eventually used to make simple solar panels or something. There could be a whole array of different parts for processing different resources, metals and glass and such would need a smelter, collecting trees would need saws and such, water would need scoops and boilers(steam power), I don\u0027t know the stuff that goes on in my head is questionable, somebody, anybody consider it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-17T15:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2014 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by noobsrtoast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madlemur","CreatedById":116597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T20:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOw.
