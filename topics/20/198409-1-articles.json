I was trying to figure out how we could play KSP in some way together during the pandemic short of Dark Multiplayer and had the thought (as I\u2019m sure many of you have)\u00A0of having one player act as mission control while the other flies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack before KSP left early access I tried Telemachus on my own to simulate a mission control type setup. However, when I looked into recreating this now, I found that Telemachus and its new UI setup, Houston, are out of date/abandoned. While they still work to some degree with the current version of KSP, large portions are missing and I experienced what I believe is a memory leak issue tied to Raster Prop Monitor cameras that I used to stream video to the Houston UI.
