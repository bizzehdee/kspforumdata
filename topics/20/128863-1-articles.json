It would be useful to have a mod that simply highlights a part with varying intensity based on how much stress it\u0027s under, with a very light highlight meaning it\u0027s getting pushed just a little bit, and a very dark highlight meaning it\u0027s about to break off/explode. This would also be useful for things like landers and probes inside fairings, to make sure they\u0027re secured tightly and to be able to know when they are starting to wobble more easily. If there is a mod or in-game function that already exists and does this, please let me know. Otherwise, I\u0027d appreciate if someone would make this! Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
