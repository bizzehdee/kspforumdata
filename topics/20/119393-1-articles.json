And then I started thinking about how an anchor still counts, despite the fact that the vessel is so far away from the ground still. The only difference is the relative height of all the parts. So what if I just told the vessel to be landed but with a really large \u0022height\u0022 equal to the altitude, and then flipped it to flying once it fully loads physics. And guess what.
