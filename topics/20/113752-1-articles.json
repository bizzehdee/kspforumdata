It worked well enough. I also have heard of [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager)and [Tinker Time](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85865-Tinker-Time-Self-Updating-Curse-com-Mod-Manager-for-KSP).\n\nWhat mod manager do *you* like? Why? What are the pros and cons of each?\n\nThanks and happy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:10:40Z","Content":"I generally prefer CKAN, as it supports automatic handling of dependencies (i.e. if a mod you\u0027re interested in requires another mod, the second mod is also automatically installed)."},{"CreatedByName":"DanJourney","CreatedById":116043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:59:31Z","Content":"I think I\u0027ll give CKAN a try first.
