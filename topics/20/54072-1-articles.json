And using RAM eating mods like KW,NP,B9,Kosmos, etc. There is way, for those who do not know, to reduce or get rid of periodic crashing or startup crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using NovaPunch and KW Rocketry, download the Texture Reduction packs for them. Then Delete the fuel tanks from either Nova, or KW considering the fuel tanks a pretty much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor B9, download the texture reduction and delete parts that you do not need, use, or want. Same thing goes all the other big mods like Kosmos and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this has helped me run KW,NP,KAS,KOSMOS,B9, and other small mods.
