For a long time that was the most powerful rocket engine ever built. IIRC it\u0027s still the most powerful \u003Cem\u003Esingle chamber\u003C/em\u003E engine actually used on a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back in the 1960\u0027s an even larger engine was on the drawing boards and prototype pieces were being built for the Aerojet M-1, designed to be run at 1.2 to 2 million pounds thrust. The turbopumps alone produced 75,000 and 27,000 horsepower for the hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. The turbopump exhaust was used to cool the lower section of the bell, exiting through nozzles around the bottom and contributing 28,000 pounds of thrust. Who needs closed cycle when the exhaust of the fuel pumps is *that frigging powerful* on its own?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(rocket_engine)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(rocket_engine)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut alas, the Saturn rocket won out over the Nova for the race to the Moon and funding for the M-1 got diverted to Saturn and other projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
