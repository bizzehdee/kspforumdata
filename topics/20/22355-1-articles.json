What kind of a mod are you planning to create? If its a .cfg edit, all you need is Notepad (Windows) or its Mac equivalent (TextEdit seems to come with Mac OSX, so it should work so long as you remember to keep the file extension). You can mess with the settings in there and just save. In order for them to apply, you have to restart KSP. I wouldn\u0027t recommend posting the .cfg edits on the Addons board, as there are some on the forums that may be a bit, harsh, to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ll be doing an entirely new part, you\u0027ll need to pickup a 3D modeling software set. I would recommend Blender, as its free, open source, and quite powerful. However, there are other options (albeit paid), from 3DS Max to Maya to CAD, etc. It\u0027ll probably just be easier to give you a list of things you need for this, as its getting pretty late here where I\u0027m from, and I have school tomorrow, so - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3D Modeling Software\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity3D 3.5.6 (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://unity3d.com/unity/download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://unity3d.com/unity/download\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.16 Unity PartTools (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15998-0-16-PartTools\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15998-0-16-PartTools\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage Editor (Photoshop, Paint.NET, GIMP, etc. For textures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned earlier, its pretty late, so I can\u0027t do much at the moment.
