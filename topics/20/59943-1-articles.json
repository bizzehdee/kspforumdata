I have looked up some documentation about the API, I\u0027m familiar with C# so I should be able to create a plugin. Before that, I would like to collect some ideas and feedback. I also will need a bit brainstorming to find a good formula to calculate the science earned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe basic idea\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive players a fun challenge to deploy rovers and drive them around in order to gain science points. All within the spirit of doing science the Kerbal way. The faster, the heavier the vessel is, the more science it will create. Bringing Kerbals to join the ride is also encouraged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving long passages on time warp is boring, so the distance traveled and the average speed will play a lesser role (but won\u0027t be neglected).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this also works for tiny unmanned rovers, the goal would be to encourage building big fast vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all about building badass monster trucks of Kerbal awesomeness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe part\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a placeholder (and the fact that I am utterly useless at modelling and texturing), I will use an existing science part and clone it, probably gravioli detector or something. It has to be light and small. It will be unlocked in the science tree along the first wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience gathering\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player activates the part, which will start \u0022recording\u0022. Activating will only work when the vehicle is stopped. It will drain electricity based on the vehicle\u0027s mass. This is in order to let it scale without creating multiple parts for small and heavy vehicles. A flat electricity drain would penalize small vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe item will record some driving parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pondering if the recording should only be stopped when the vehicle is stopped and if it resets or shows an error when the altitude over terrain is above a certain value, based on the gravity of the celestial body where all this took place. Then jumps would be allowed, but lander transfers would be voided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the recording is stopped, a science value will be calculated based on several parameters. Just like with any other (reusable) science part, the data can be sent back with a penalty, or processed in a lab for less penalty, or brought back to Kerbin for maximum points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to make this data non-transferable to the manned capsules. You will really need to bring back the part for maximum effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe formula\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to find a good formula that is both balanced (effort-result) and hopefully not exploitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should include the following parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- maximum ground speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- total mass of vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- traveled distance and average speed. I would tie these together, these should be not so significant because of time warp. Distance would be calculated from start and end location, endless driving in circles shouldn\u0027t be encouraged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- passenger bonus for each live Kerbal on board\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not want to give a flat science limit on the result, as this would discourage improving vehicles once the \u0022perfect rover\u0022 has been built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it should not be a way to \u0022cheat\u0022 science points. The points are also dependent of the current location (biome), I want this to scale just like the other experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would try to reward people who max out either of the parameters and also those who can mix them perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal thing would be a monstrous-dragster-Kerbal-bus. If you can deploy and drive such a thing, then the science would be well earned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny comments, additional ideas and formula proposals are welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELordFjord\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T13:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFjord\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LordFjord\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe faster, the heavier the vessel is, the more science it will create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this also works for tiny unmanned rovers, the goal would be to encourage building big fast vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all about building badass monster trucks of Kerbal awesomeness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds strange to me. The amount of science should depend on the number of scientific instrument the rover carries (not it\u0027s weight) and the distance travelled (not it\u0027s speed). That seems more logical, and it would still encourage to build big (because they have many instrument) and fast (because you must be able to go far in a minimum of gamer\u0027s time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody would put more weight on a rover just for the additional weight : we add weight because we need one more feature, or more power, or anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight should always be seen as a problem, not a solution.
