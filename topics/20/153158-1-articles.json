Or if you want more of a change, New Horizons not only adds new celestial bodies, but also rearranges the Kerbol system entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for parts mods, there\u0027s quite a few great ones:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMark One Laboratory Extensions - adds a bunch of low-tech stuff based on the US\u0027s Gemini program. It\u0027s great for career because it allows for more variety with the beginnings of the tech tree. And the Buffalo MSEV is a mod by the same author which adds in a bunch of great parts for building rovers and other things. Also by the same author is Pathfinder, which is pretty great if you want to massively expand \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E functionality.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome incredible parts mods are the mods made\u00A0by Nertea (Near Future stuff, Kerbal Atomics, Cryogenic Engines, Stockalike Station Parts Expansion), and\u00A0mods by Necrobones (Modular Rocket Systems, SpaceY and SpaceY Expanded, Fuel Tanks Plus, Color Coded Cannisters, Lithobraking Exploration Technologies). With all of those parts mods the possibilities for what you can create in the game are vastly expanded. They\u0027re great mods for both aesthetics and functionality.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Inventory System and Kerbal Attachment System are must-have mods. In case you don\u0027t already know, these two mods have a combined functionality of giving kerbals inventories, and the ability to directly interact with things whilst on EVA. If you have them both, there is also Surface Experiment Package, which adds \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E-assembled science experiments which are deployed on the surfaces of planets and gather data over time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDMagic Orbital Science. Exactly what the name implies, it basically adds a lot of science equipment primarily for use in orbit (though there are a few surface-specific experiments too).\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScanSat, Tarsier Space Technology, and CactEye-2 Orbital Telescope give increased functionality to probes. Scansat is particularly useful if you\u0027re going for rather exhaustive exploration of a celestial body, CactEye adds telescopes that work well with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (they can be upgraded by a kerbal on EVA), and TST adds telescopes that don\u0027t need much maintenance but are still quite useful.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s also some smaller mods that are quite good for adding functionality and filling niches. VX Series II Engine Pack adds a bunch of great engines, both for atmospheric and vacuum uses.\u00A0Planetary Base Systems is great for making surface bases. It\u0027s also good for other purposes\u00A0if you\u0027re creative enough. If you like planes, try Mk2 Expansion and Mk3 Expansion, as well as MkIV Spaceplane Parts - they give enormous variety to what can be done with plane parts. Modular Pod Extensions provides useful expansions to the Mk1-2 command pod. Universal Storage is good for making compact designs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also know of some great utility mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou probably know of Kerbal Alarm Clock, but I\u0027ll mention it in case you don\u0027t. It lets you add alarms for in-game events like maneuvers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMechJeb adds a huge amount of information displays as well as some optional autopilot features. Its delta-v readout is particularly useful for designing spacecraft with efficiency in mind.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEditor Extensions Redux is one of the most useful tools available for spacecraft construction. It adds a vast amount of extra functionality to the vehicle editor in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinal Frontier provides achievements for kerbals. It\u0027s quite nice for tracking which kerbals have done what things.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGPO Speed Fuel Pump is an easily-configurable fuel pump mod, for when fuel lines are inconvenient or just too many parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTRP Hire makes hiring kerbals work better.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTrajectories shows approximations of atmospheric entry trajectories.
