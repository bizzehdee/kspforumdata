Its also pulling a B9 right now and is only updated by community work (thank God for permissive licensing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future is focused more on extending the stock progression to include some more endgame stuff while also keeping stock gameplay at the core. It changes up how you design craft late-game and what not but the gameplay still feels very much like stock KSP, just with a lot more high-end options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T04:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally prefer Near Future Technologies over KSPI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t change gameplay much and in-game information is enough to go by (just read carefully).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels are real useful and pretty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe batteries are nice and the capacitors change gameplay a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crafts are great. the two and six seaters can change your progression nicely (I like using the six seater instead of using the transport cans).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsion is varied and interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-root","CreatedById":112842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T07:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already checked out both of them.

Its main topic is the construction of self-sufficient planetary and orbital bases through the use of in-situ resource utilization, something we\u0027ll likely see attempted IRL within the next 15 to 30 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt plays well with Near Future Technologies (to the point where they share some resources and support the same custom tech tree) and adds an aspect that isn\u0027t really covered by the base game at all. On the other hand, it\u0027s a fairly large and involved mod, and works best if TAC Life Support is also installed... which is a major gamechanger for manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T08:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see, I\u0027m using near future, b9, KW rocketry, ksprc, dmagic orbital science, scansat, antenna range, deadly reentry, NEAR....
