Developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation.\u0022 - Wikipedia\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe general idea is that, developers would upload the mod to a repository, and give out the address to this repository, sometimes with a general username and pass: anon anon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis address and login info(if used by that provider), would be put into SVN clients which would download the repository to the client\u0027s machine. once done, future updates would simply be performed by clicking update in the windows context menu (the right click menu), which would update the appropriate files according to the repository that has been set by the mod developer. The power of this tool cannot be understated. All the mod developer has to do once they update their mod, is update the repository with a simple click, and then tell people to update their versions, also with a simple click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine all the mod makers on this site and how quickly they could distribute updates to their mods, when a new version of KSP comes out. Imagine how quick YOU the player could update ALL of your mods, with a simple CLICK of the update button, each repository would check it\u0027s respective addresses for updates and update accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more having to hunt down the newest update on the forum, no more waiting for the developer to upload it to space port just to get a code fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one and done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are alot of gaming communities that use this, Garry\u0027s Mod for example to great effect, and I was wondering if KSP Modders have thought of using it. Heck even the KSP devs are using it, have you tried the patcher tool recently, reminds a lot of SVN to be honest. I think the modding community would be served well by using SVN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust something to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T17:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubversion is primarily source control software, and it\u0027s sub-par at that.

As Majiir already stated, storing binary files in a version control repository is a crap idea. As the internal layout of a binary is not amenable to delta based storage, and thus causes the size of the repository to increase rapidly. In addition to this, it excludes any users who are not technically savvy enough to employ version control software for updating. There are better, more general solutions in the mix, which will emerge as the KSP Network (specifically the SpacePort) and Modding Support (the recent addition of System.IO) both mature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T13:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei tried doing this with mods i made for other games. it doesn\u0027t really help out all that much for the lone modder. now if you were part of a big mod team it kinda makes sense. it can manage all your configs and your code base. art assets are more troublesome though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
