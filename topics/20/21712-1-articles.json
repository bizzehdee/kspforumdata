Specifically. both of the \u00223 meter to 5x 1 meter diameter\u0022 couplers have the value for stackSymmetry set to 1 in their .cfg, and changing that to 3 instead ends up turning OFF symmetry, instead of doing what was expected by setting 4x symmetry. Why would it do that? If anyone knows something about stackSymmetry that is not covered here, please post it so that the rest of the KSP modding community can better understand it, and so that we can have hex- and octa-couplers that actually work the way the tri-coupler does!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T22:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking in the dll that\u0027s actually a property of the general part class rather than the child strut class, which doesn\u0027t actually contain any new properties.
