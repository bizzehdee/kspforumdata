I just really want to see how creative a modder can be with this! (what I imagine is something similar to the ion engine with the electricity...as you burn, you use it up, but, as long as you leave a little left in the tanks and let ship sit, the fuel will slowly begin rematerializing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T20:41:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sampa**\n  \nTitle change"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T19:04:30Z","Content":"That is...quite a funny idea.

This would also allow for conservation of mass. Use the existing community resources Waste and WasteWater (and maybe CO2, ElectricCharge), and converting to LFO to squeeze a little extra deltaV out of manned missions. You wouldn\u0027t be able to make very much, but it gives you something to do with those waste products if you aren\u0027t recycling.
