I mean if you look at the crazy things people have built AND fly in stock, there are lots of options. I personally am not very good at it for the reasons you just said, and it\u0027s much harder to cobble together a wing out of premade pieces which is why I recommend you use procedural wings if you intend to do any flying. Of course, if you intend to do that you might as well drop stock altogether and throw FAR, AJE and DRE in there and get a much better aerodynamic simulation going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, here is a plane built in stock.

I honestly wish I had better advice, but I used to hate flying and building planes in stock. With the aforementioned mods, I honestly have gotten addicted to just flying around Kerbin. The best I can offer is flying tips which the most important is learn to use trim (alt\u002Bdirection) and use CAPS LOCK to use the precision control. You can get pretty good and consistent control over your planes this way without trying to brute force it by using SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S1gmoid","CreatedById":124382,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T05:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I already have FAR and AJE installed.
