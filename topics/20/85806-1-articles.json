It\u0027s already possible to make a decent miniature TB2 replica using SP\u002B parts. All that would be needed to make this happen properly would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A tweaked version of something like \u003Cem\u003EFine Print\u003C/em\u003E to add rescue/firefighting/etc contracts. Rescue is pretty much just a delivery/retrieval mission, of either grounded or flying objects; firefighting is aerial bombing and/or ground delivery; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A few simple part additions and/or Kerbpaint maps to make creating TB replicas easier. Most of it is already there; particularly with FAR in play, TB1/2/3 replicas aren\u0027t that hard. The existing ST-ish mods should give some hints on how to do this in a way that doesn\u0027t annoy the Anderson family lawyers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Most of the TB2/4 based episodes were essentially \u0022deliver part A to location B before time C\u0022.
