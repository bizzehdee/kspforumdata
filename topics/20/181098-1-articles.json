When not deployed, it\u0027d be fairly smooth, just cylinderical, but the skin would open into short aerobrakes to provide a little drag, just to re-orient a rocket, not to stop it on their own. The part should be able to be deployed in the upper atmosphere and remain extended all the way down without blowing up. I\u0027m just being fussy because I don\u0027t like putting big unnecessary lumps on for the normal aerobrakes when I really don\u0027t need them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Quick edit: Ah yeah, it\u0027d be nice to be able to install it via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-04T11:51:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2019 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by LjSpike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
