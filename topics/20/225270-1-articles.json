So it welds the parts for a craft in a way that it\u0027s useful for that craft, without further worries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to create reusable consolidated subassemblies explodes the complexity of the solution exponentially - because someone would need to code support on the Weld Tool for every possible combination of MODULEs and PARTs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are welding 3 parts, each part have 3 possible variants.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrently, the Weld tool just ignores the problem, applying the current selected variant of each part and letting KSP trying to handle the mess.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe alternative would be to create a dedicate code that would carefully combine the different VARIANTS into all the possible combinations, or 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 variants.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou ware welding 2 stairs. Each stair has a ModuleAnimationGeneric tied do a named mesh from the part\u0027s mu file.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSo you have multiple copies of that meshes, all of them with the same name\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ModuleAnimationGeneric doesn\u0027t knows how to handle multiple meshes with the same name, the WeldTool would need to find a way to create a new mesh, renamed, and then update the respective ModuleAnimationGeneric.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are welding a stair and a spotlight. Both use ModuleAnimationGeneric but for different purposes (one interpolates a mesh, other a texture)\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo you want them to be animated at the same time, or you want to have many toggles, one for each?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you have a stair and 2 spotlights, do you want 3 toggles, or want to consolidate the spotlights into a single one?\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you want to animate them separately, you have the duplicated named meshes problem again, and additionally.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd I will not even think on talking about the Robotics.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so goes on. It\u0027s a hell of a work for too few gains in exchange - it\u0027s easier and more effective to weld the \u0022dumb parts\u0022 together, and let the smart ones be operated as single parts normally. The real gains are on welding the dumb parts, as they are - by a mile - in greater numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is to combine welded parts with \u0022smart parts\u0022 into subassemblies if you need reusability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-04T07:03:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2024 07:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 4\u0022\u003EJuly 4\u003C/time\u003E by Lisias\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHit \u0026quot;Save\u0026quot; too soon\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-04T07:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your replies. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/229307-kspnoobusernametaken/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022229307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/229307-kspnoobusernametaken/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KspNoobUsernameTaken\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/187168-lisias/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187168\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/187168-lisias/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Lisias\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027ve understand about the issues with the welder issue and variants.\u00A0 In parts that I\u0027ve made that incorperate a piece with a variant I\u0027ve cut the variant down to the one that i want in the cfg file.\u00A0 Nut it still leavss the variant \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E info.\u00A0 It certainly doesnt work for parts wi variants or even multiple of the same part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want bendable rockets, but if there was ANY flex then this where it should be.\u00A0 At sepereting points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thought was that for surface attached parts it would leep those as separate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didnt think it would be simple, but I\u0027d thought I\u0027d ask anyway.\u00A0 Thanks again for taking the time to reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
