Playing on the real solar sytem is aweome, but it took quite a bit of effort to set everything up, so I started thinking about creating a \u0022realism bundle\u0022 to make it really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started documenting my setup and checking licenses. Mostly it looks possible, so if there\u0027s some interest I\u0027ll try and package this up. I\u0027m thinking of calling it \u0022Simple Earth Scale Install\u0022 - SESI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal would be a single zip file you extract over a vanilla KSP install to get RealismOverhaul \u002B required mods. I\u0027d try and keep it to a fairly minimal (but sufficient to be playable) state, then users could add their own mods if they wished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see jamis tried something like this before, but it went defunct: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67668-Mod-bundler-for-Real-Solar-System-%282014-03-25%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67668-Mod-bundler-for-Real-Solar-System-%282014-03-25%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have a much simpler approach - just bundle up the exact changes in a working install, rather than presenting an installer and trying to pull things down automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main worry would be things going out of date, but if it\u0027s useful I\u0027d aim to make it easy for anyone interested to help maintain the collection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think this is worth pursuing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
