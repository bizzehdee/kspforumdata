In fact, the only mod I know of, that adds radiation in any form is \u0022Interstellar\u0022, but it is far from optimal. What I\u0027m looking for is a mod that simulates Radiation, and Magnetospheres, causing damage to equipment and possibly Kerbonauts while in space. As a side note: maybe intergrate it with Dangit? A simulation of Solar Flares might be too much to ask for, but just thought I\u0027d mention it so as to not exclude it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know of any mod like this, or willing to make one?
