It\u0027s one of those brilliant but hackish mods. Basically what it does is it removes VAB, because technically the VAB doesn\u0027t have lights it just has the illusion of lights. The problem comes when you want to turn the lights back on you need to make sure you save the craft first. The reason is that to restore the lights it simply reloads the scene and the craft, so if you made changes while the lights were off, they get lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For any programmers reading this I over simplified on purpose)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-25T01:01:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2014 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T17:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the replies. That looks interesting but it seams the guy never made it better or is just hard to mod.
