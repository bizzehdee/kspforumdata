This action would only affect prograde or retrograde vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo change radial vectors, you would perhaps hold shift and drag the P/A marker, which similarly would restrict prograde and retrograde changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, to alter inclination, simply drag either of the two I markers, which also would restrict prograde, retrograde and radial vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo often I\u0027ve become frustrated trying to make minute adjustments to the nodes six axes and its position along the orbital path, whose interface allows for anything but. It just made sense to me that maneuvers should be determined by the desired output, not the guesstimated input parameters. Some people might argue that this is not in the spirit of KSP, which is why it would work best as an optional add-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t I just use MechJeb? Well I do, but sometimes I want to plan my own maneuvers, and MechJeb doesn\u0027t allow for some of the more obscure varieties of maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T13:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool idea.
