Thus better inside views and panels, also if possible 1st person view for the kerbals to and cameras for seeing things like docking or placing stuff. And if you know a way to have IVA the default view or just disable 3rd person in flight, I would love to know how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso two side questions any mod out there that allows building in space, thus making shipyards in orbit and on other worlds but without being to overpowered thus requires resources or something to make stuff? And also what would be some good mods that would help add more parts for ships and stations, but not be overkill to gameplay thus make it to easy to do things early on. Oh and almost forgot anything that can extend the number of hotkeys, since IVA limits me from right clicking and using a lot of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you list a lot of mods, please tell me if they all work together or not and if possible that have a texture reduction pack or something include to (you know so game doesn\u0027t overload)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I plan to get so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETac life support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal attachment system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Most likely) B9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Most likely) interstellar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImproved nav ball\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking camera\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einfernal robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekerbal engineering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(maybe) KW Rocketry *forgot if it parts are overkill or not*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T07:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ivankesja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T07:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI play about 90% IVA ever since installing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-25-RasterPropMonitor-putting-the-A-in-your-IVA-%28v0-18-3%29-8-Oct\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERPM\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98583-0-25-KerbQuake-continued-v1-2-1-Reactive-Camera-Shakes-while-IVA-2014-10-29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbquake\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERPM integrates with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-0-90-SCANsat-v8-1-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-Dec-19\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScansat\u003C/a\u003E too so if you have scanned the planet you can see the terrain and biome maps in the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s9zTbjW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s9zTbjW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I haven\u0027t finished the scanning yet in this save\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RpgIitP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RpgIitP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the cameras were added as part of the RPM mod but I\u0027m not 100% certain about that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rJFdBid.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rJFdBid.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivankesja","CreatedById":13108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T07:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForgot about RPM possibly because I never had time to use it before, but that kerbquake mod I like the looks of because it reminded me how IVA does lack of sense of motion and force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T08:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ivankesja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ivankesja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EForgot about RPM possibly because I never had time to use it before, but that kerbquake mod I like the looks of because it reminded me how IVA does lack of sense of motion and force.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt adds a lot to the immersion, one of those mods that once you get used to playing with it installed you can\u0027t go back to the way it was, hopefully squad will consider integrating both RPM and Kerbquake at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thesonicgalaxy","CreatedById":71406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T08:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ivankesja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ivankesja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EForgot about RPM possibly because I never had time to use it before, but that kerbquake mod I like the looks of because it reminded me how IVA does lack of sense of motion and force.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to grab \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProbe Control Room.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivankesja","CreatedById":13108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T09:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah was wondering where that mod was, thought I found it with advance interior prop systems but that was only a mod that enhanced the looks it seemed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T11:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes KerbQuake still work?
