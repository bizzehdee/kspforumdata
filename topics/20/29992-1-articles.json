I thought there may be an issue with syntax, so i replace the standard mechjebcore with the mechjebar202 in the .cfg files of the items in the hope that would cure it, no joy. What changes need to be in place and where to add the functionality of MJ to the standard command vessels? Thank you for any assistance you are able to render.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T14:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really just config editing. I believe Mechjeb 2 is a .cfg module (check a mechjeb 2 enabled part), then copy the bit from the module area if it is and simply past it into the pod\u0027s config. Hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T14:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESend a Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T13:04:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 01:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dr_jt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamekEisenfaust","CreatedById":59979,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T13:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFound out I was editing the wrong files. With the filesystem changes in .20, the modules are in a different directory, not parts. The file on spaceport does work, as long as you put in the correct directory.
