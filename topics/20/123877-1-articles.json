The alarm would play when there is no fuel left behind the configured decoupler. I really want this to be on the tweakable in the VAB/SPH because I want it saved with the craft or subassembly. EDIT: For the visual alarm, you could just change the decoupler staging icon color like Chute Safety Indicator does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith drop tanks, you don\u0027t have the engine shutting off to cue staging, and you don\u0027t really have the fuel meter either since that is listed per engine, not stage.
