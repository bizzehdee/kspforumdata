But not much is known about it. I tried to find out more with this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112727-Landing-Strut-Specs-and-what-they-can-handle](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112727-Landing-Strut-Specs-and-what-they-can-handle)\n\nWhat we need is a mod like Engineer or RCS Build Aid that Will look at the craft mass/CG and Give you info about landing on a given planet for each attached gear. How fast, how much mass each gear gets at rest maybe with a curve for impact speed that show at what point they likely would fail.\n\nMight also see about data for rover wheels as they have travel and mass limits also. Not just speed limits. Haven\u0027t looked at the new aircraft gear yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:15:58Z","Content":"I like this idea but I\u0027m not sure how predictable it is. I don\u0027t know for sure, but I don\u0027t think KSP has proper traction or torque simulations, so coming up with a mathematical formula for predicting stuff like that might be quite a bit difficult.\n\nBut if someone figures out a way, I definitely support the idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T01:18:42Z","Content":"I see no need for traction modeling. If a micro landing strut will break with 50 ton craft on Eve, that should be computable. And in that example, 3 gear properly placed in relation to COM, should work up to a given landing speed. The data is there. Just need someone who decode the meaning for sure and then create the code to make it easier to use for all."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T01:24:57Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t mind this either - I have no idea what that stuff even means!"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T03:54:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see no need for traction modeling.
