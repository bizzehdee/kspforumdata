With just solar panels and batteries you shouldn\u0027t really need more than a radial or 2 unless you\u0027re building a big Microwave solar power plant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T06:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Interstellar add the Thermal helper button to your toolbar in VAB.
