Is this going to be fixed soon? does anybody else have this problem? just wondering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T04:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sleipnir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sleipnir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E goes full power yawing/rotating until it hits the target point on the Nav. ball and then has to do it again as it flies past it, just like the stock ASAS does). it happens with all my ships, any size any design. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you\u0027re not having enough torque and/or RCS, that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t stabilize--either that or your ship is really really heavy--lighter ships with good torque don\u0027t have this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sleipnir","CreatedById":58380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T04:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like you\u0027re not having enough torque and/or RCS, that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t stabilize--either that or your ship is really really heavy--lighter ships with good torque don\u0027t have this issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never had this problem with the older mechjeb though.
