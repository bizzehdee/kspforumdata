Transmitting a surface sample up to a lab is not really possible, in any way that would not make it just more practical to transmit back to KSC.\n\nAnd in this game, even thermometer readings have some sort of benefit to having physical access to. I like this - it gives an in-game design challenge. However, it is not really realistic nor does it either work well with the \u0022transmit to an orbiting station\u0022 idea."},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:57:44Z","Content":"You\u0027re right, but I didn\u0027t mean being able to send 100% data to another vessel, as that would be akeen to beaming up an entire soil sample into orbit.

You can give the science lab data, and it will slowly turn this data into science over time, that can then be transmitted to KSC. Being able to transmit data to a given science lab rather than KSC seems like a great idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T17:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by abowl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:56:47Z","Content":"Maybe more science(and data) could be given short range than sending it all the way home. This would be great for rovers to collect and send the science between base and orbit ship. It would also be good for those one way probes. \n\nIt would be also good to have something that would reset the experiments like a mini-lab that only cleans them."},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T13:27:21Z","Content":"Sorry to bring this back up... but has someone worked on something like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:16:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What benefit can a small remote lab give you that the massive resources of a fully stocked R\u0026D center back home can\u0027t, when both would get exactly the same data?\n\ni agree totaly, imagine a surface sample where you grab rocks, what do you want to do more in the orbiting lab than a kerbin lab with a transmitted data? with a physic data ok, you can analyze them maybe even better in low gravity and discover undetectable thing on ground. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nbut more, it\u0027s a gameplay mechanic, it gives you a bonus if you do harder things. \n\nwhat i think interesting in your suggestion could be to transmit and store the science data to a lab when we are not in range of Kerbin but without a bonus, with mod like Remote-tech or antenna-range.\n\ni wish someone will develop your request however, own his gaming style.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T18:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Skalou**"}]}
