There is no UI yet for unloaded ships and deaths are unpredictable ( I once managed to keep Jeb alive without O2 on a trip halfway from the mun to Kerbin somehow).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC works great but the models are quite the eyesore. It also has a slightly more complex life support system that might turn other people off (I like the O2/CO2 system in the other 2 mods, it gives a nice and simple time limit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EECLSS is by far the prettiest and user friendliest. But it has severe performance and balance issues. Giant 2.5m tanks that don\u0027t hold enough O2 for a trip to minmus for example. And your framerate drops in half if you have more than 10 spaceships out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I\u0027m using TAC, but I deleted all the tanks and use a combination of Spherical Fuel tanks and modded small radial tanks to store my supplies\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T05:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve only used Ioncross and TAC.
