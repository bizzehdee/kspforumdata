The problem is I have no idea what is going on with the mod, the download links are all gone yet I\u0027m able to find a link to the \u0022source code\u0022 from github. it is 48mb in size so I assumed this was the mod itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen adding it I can see it loading the resources in the loader when you start the game up but nothing changes I don\u0027t see any new planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas this mod in violation of terms or something? Why is it so hard to track down, if someone has a link to the working mod please share it with me I\u0022m quite interested in it. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T07:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"velve","CreatedById":112979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T08:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh....didn\u0027t see that one thank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
