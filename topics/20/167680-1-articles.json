For example, probes need to have heaters installed or else they will drop below the magic -60C and not be functional until warmed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA way of implementing this would be to have all parts with a reasonable amount of electronics having a tag, like the probe cores or batteries, and a plugin watching for when they get below a certain temp, using the stock heating system. When they get below a certain point, the plugin renders them unusable until they are reheated. We could have like a base plutonium heater, and electrical heaters, and both be separate parts, and have them apply heat, like nuclear engines. The electric ones should be toggle-able, so you can disable them near the sun or during reentry or other heating events. It should be made in a way that we can choose not to have them if we are in atmosphere, like Kerbin, and they are heated enough by the environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
