Even if it only brings collaboration to 50% of them, it\u0027ll still make life much easier and more pleasant for players who are using a suite of mods that do play nice. And while I can\u0027t talk for others, it would certainly influence my decision on whether or not to install a mod if I knew that it wouldn\u0027t work well with the other mods that I already had from the suite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, it seems that the thrust here and in the Tree Modifier mod is towards the tree.cfg defining the nodes and their interconnection, and the part files defining which nodes they want to be in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving this community project as a base would actually make it \u003Cem\u003Eeasier\u003C/em\u003E for people who want to create their own completely independant trees, since it would make it possible to target the parts in various nodes with catch-all ModuleManager scripts to push any \u0022other\u0022 parts into spots on their own tree after they had moved all the specific parts they cared about. This has been the biggest problem with custom trees in the past - you not only have to play with the creator\u0027s tree, but also with pretty much exactly their set of other mods, or else parts are missing, or weird nodes appear past the end of the tree, or stuff is in bizarre places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project could at least help focus on a baseline that could help reduce that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, and working additively (no rearranging, renaming or anything) from the stock tree also somewhat ensure that any combination of mods should in theory be playable. The only (partially) forced dependency I can foresee occurs when you might add up all the costs of the new nodes; it\u0027s quite likely that you might want more science equipment to max it out more easily.

This Tech tree should force parts to tech or leave that liberty to other mods?

Having a deeper tree ingame (and justification to actually go beyond the Mun for science) will certainly be a plus, but it doesn\u0027t address any of the fundamental issues with stuffing lots of different mods into the same progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Well, there is one in that list of issues that it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be addressing, and that\u0027s how to deal with potentially empty nodes. Imagine a mod that adds content to the very high end nodes. Such a mod would play great when combined with other mods that populate the other nodes, but what if it was the only one that a player installs? Or in a different scenario, a player might have a whole bunch of mods installed, but by sheer chance, there is one tech tree node that doesn\u0027t have any part added to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, KSP supports setting nodes \u0022hidden if empty\u0022, but the node in question could have children - other nodes that rely on it as a prerequisite. If you hide it, then all nodes depending on it will never be reachable, even if they\u0027re full of parts. If on the other hand you never set any nodes hidden, then installs with only one or two mods will have a potentially giant field of mostly empty nodes... and a confused player, who isn\u0027t sure if it\u0027s worth researching them, because he can\u0027t see if there are any more nodes containing actual parts behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision of how to handle this will inform the tree design to a significant degree. For instance, you could request of modders to not add any parts to nodes that are unreachable without other mods installed (essentially saying \u0022you must add parts to all the nodes along the way to the highest node you want to use\u0022). That works well, allowing you to set all nodes as \u0022hidden if empty\u0022 so that the player only gets to see the part of the tree that\u0027s actually in use in his specific configuration. But depending on how the tree itself is designed, this could make a lot of mods unable to use it. Like, Interstellar has a large number of parts... but does it have enough low-tech parts to open the way to all the high end nodes that it needs? The answer to that depends less on Interstellar, and more on the number of interposing node steps and cross-connections that you specify in the community tree design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, using the subtree approach as Nertea suggests, you would define certain \u0022entry nodes\u0022 for each subtree. You set those entry nodes as \u0022hidden if empty\u0022, and stipulate that if a modder wants to use any node in that subtree, he must put something into the entry node in order to make the subtree accessible even if his mod is the only mod installed.

Your worst case scenario there is having two of us move the same stock element, but again given the audience and scope, I expect that will be a weird edge case solvable by a simple conversation (tbh I don\u0027t know if even NFT moves anything around in stock - USI does not, and I don\u0027t believe KSPI does). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest bet is to be careful on scope and not over complicate things. This is just scaffolding for people to use responsibly, and the number of people that would actually need this can probably be counted on one hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t think there needs to be a limit to the depth since these are in support of mods that will by definition already need to fill in that tree. I think the right answer is \u0027if your mod is going to use this, you can\u0027t leave any gaps between your parts and stock, nor gaps in your tree. i.e. common sense, and issues that would pop up the second they tested their mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would think the simplest solution to this problem is to make the tree extensions fairly shallow -- say, never going more than one or two nodes away from the nearest stock node.

Later branches could obviously be bigger and more complex since they would likely be designed with one or two specific addons in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut having some more variety early in the tree would be nice for some of the more optional type of parts (the resource scanners you mentioned, additional science parts, command pods, etc...); things that might not necessarily make sense at the end of the tree, but that might make the early nodes too crowded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would advocate not making any assumptions for any mod out there whether it\u0027s TAC-LS, DRE, etc. - those ones remain best served by working in stock nodes because in most cases, people simply don\u0027t have one of the few tech-extending mods installed.
