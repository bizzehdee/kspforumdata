I haven\u0027t looked into it but I was going to try somehow copying the section of code that defines the ore to xenon or the ore to liquid fuel module and paste it in only making it an ore to argon gas converter. Would this work? Or will that just give me errors? thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T13:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do that they will make what ever you want as long as you have a Resources file for what your making\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EricSan","CreatedById":127599,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T18:43:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep!
