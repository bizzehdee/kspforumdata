I want to bring a fission generator to replace solar panels, knowing that it has a finite life time due to using enriched uranium as its fuel source. This is why I want to bring extra enriched uranium, so that I can extend the lifetime of the generator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I look at the containers I have available, none of them appear to have EnrU as a storage option, and the closest I can get is uraninite. I\u0027m guessing I can refine this somehow, however it\u0027s possible I don\u0027t have that part of the tech tree unlocked yet, and I\u0027m also concerned about the weight it would cost to bring an entire refinery up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy questions are essentially as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs there a container that has EnrU as a default storage option? The containers from SSPX and other mods I have don\u0027t allow it as an option.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs it possible to refine Uraninite (or whatever material is required to create EnrU) in space, cost effectively?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf so, what is the part I need to do it?\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre fission generators a viable long-term option to replace solar panels?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve attached some screenshots below to show the specific container and generator I\u0027m trying to use as well. I haven\u0027t played around much with fission generators or RTGs and am trying to learn more about how to use them effectively as well.

(should be called nuclear storage container or something identical). If not in the same technode, they should be spread across a few stock technodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining was just a suggestion if your willing to deal with the hassle, but effectively yes, you would need a vessel that can rendezvous with a mining base and a ship in orbit. but for interstellar trips, as I mentioned earlier in this response, id actually suggest going with far future techs fusion reactors. FarFuture features two different scoops (1 for atmosphere, 1 for exosphere) that can gather various resources, including the necessary He3 and Deuterium that FarFutures Fusion reactors require (it also gathers antimatter, for the antimatter engines, but its very slow). It also features a bunch of high efficient engines that run on fission, fusion, and antimatter technology. while keeping the same relatively simple systems of nearfuturetech. (I play with near future and KSP Interstellar, Interstellar is very fun but from my point of view, much more complicated)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: also it is entirely possible to create a multipurpose ship, your ship, depending on its size, could just feature the mining equipment itself, land, and leave, assuming it has powerful enough engines to do so. If its large, could feature a detachable vessel that can head down, do the mining, and return to its mothership. for OPM though, just large enough storage will likely do you well enough, I visited Plock in one of my saves, took something like 40 in game years, didnt land on it though, just orbited\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-21T13:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2022 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by FusionNexus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
