Just figured I\u0027d see if anyone knows of something like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my idea is to have a space station already in a geosyncronus orbit with the kerbal main station, and you could build ships at the one already in orbit, assuming that you could first get a rocket to it. (this could also just be done on the moon.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it would have the same ship building system as the main base, except for one difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be cool to have to ship all of the parts and fuel to the station that you want to use to build it. So you could dock ships at the station/base, and deconstruct them and add them to a parts list on the ship builder in space. You would also have to get all the fuel by taking extra off of supply rockets that you send up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to build a rocket out there, you would have to send supply rockets with all the parts/fuel that you want on them, which would allow you to send lots of different rockets with parts up to the station, then build new rockets out of their parts. And you could have fuel storage there so you could store as much as you want out in space, assuming you can get it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas something like this already been done? Seems like it would be a lot of fun to have to send up every individual part that you wanted to use, and would lead to large rockets of just supplies coming off the main planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T00:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this mod may be related to what you are talking about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/9283-0-16-0-Plugin-Orbital-Planetary-Construction-V9-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/9283-0-16-0-Plugin-Orbital-Planetary-Construction-V9-3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leanier","CreatedById":5382,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T01:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes that looks great!
