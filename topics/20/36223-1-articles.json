These drills, even the smaller ones, are some of the most power hungry gizmos there is....aside from ion engines maybe. Here is a little tip. The included kethane generator can run 3 of the big drills at about 80% its max output. Even with the loss from the generator burning it, those 3 drill will pull in a massive amount of kethane per minute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as was mentioned before you want to try and keep your drills close to the ground, more so for the smaller one. I am not totaly sure how the depth of a deposit is determined. I did find out during off-shore testing that it is possible to \u0027miss\u0027 with a drill if its to shallow or at the wrong angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your just starting out you should also really read this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35664-Kethane-Usage-and-Proper-Fuel-Routing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T20:48:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KhaosCorp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InF3RNo","CreatedById":72307,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T14:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, the electricity problem it was, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
