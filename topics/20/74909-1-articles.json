Sadly, as handy as this little mod is, it only seems to work in Sandbox games, so these weights aren\u0027t available in my Career games. Try as I may, I have been unable to contact the original author, and the parts included in the mod are relatively simple and straight forward, so I went ahead and modified them so that they were integrated into the Tech Tree (along the Construction path), and I uploaded them to my website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings me to an interesting question, however... How valid is it for me to pick up work done by another author to update or modify with the intention of sharing it back to the community? I was not able to find any license information for this mod pack, and the models and textures are extremely simple (something most novices could knock out in minutes). There is also no code involved in these parts, just simple text .cfg files. For the most part I don\u0027t plan on making it my habit to take over the work done by others, but this was something that my son actually asked if I could do and I figured if I was going to do it anyhow it was worth sharing for others. It was also a good opportunity for me to get my hands dirty in some KSP mod basics, since I am an enthusiastic programmer and game tinkerer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, hope these parts are useful to some of you, I know they can come in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-13T05:05:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2014 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T05:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, if there\u0027s no license listed with the parts, it\u0027s best treated as under \u0022All Rights Reserved.\u0022 In that case, you\u0027d need the author\u0027s explicit permission to modify the code for anything other than personal use or upload it anywhere yourself \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eor at least to share it here on the forums or through any of our official channels\u003C/span\u003E.
