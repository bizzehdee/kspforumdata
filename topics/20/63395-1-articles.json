I had created a huge Kethane infrastructure to support the Deuterium powered Impossible Innovations Fusion Torch engines, which has served me pretty well so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombining Kethane with Interstellar just seems like a no brainer, but modding kethane to convert directly into anti matter pretty much makes most of Fractal_UKs work pretty much moot(IE Kethane -\u0026gt; Antimatter pretty much trumps, all the other resource trees he has.) . And the guy does work hard. It\u0027s just I already have this infrastructure and I\u0027m not going to abandon it, I worked too hard, too long and been in too many fights with the wife over it to just give it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will admit, when you pair it up with other mods that have resources, it starts to get a little on your nerves though, mining for Kethane, Deuterium, Lithium and if your using the extra planetary launch pads mod, you gotta mine your metals for your rocket parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the grand scheme of things people consider Kethane to be the magical resource that for whatever reason converts into everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s really up to you, but I use Kethane, it it\u0027s really cool and an awesome mod to begin with, and the fact that Majiir develops it in such a way that allows it to hook up to anything that needs resources is really generous on his part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if Fractal is reading this, I say you should Make a Kethane Reactor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
