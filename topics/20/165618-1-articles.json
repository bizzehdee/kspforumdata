His textures are gorgeous. However, I\u0027m also a huge fan of WildBlue\u0027s M.O.L.E. mod. Unfortunately, because the MOLE mod is designed to fit certain parts from stock (namely the Mk1 pod and heat shield), it is clunky (if not impossible) to use both mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am curious about is if it is possible to use Module Manager to create an \u0022alternate\u0022 version of the Mk1 pod and heat shield. Essentially, have a mod that tells the game to create a Mk1A pod and Mk1A heat shield using the vanilla/Squad stats and textures. If someone could tell me if such a mod is possible, I would be most appreciative. If someone could point me to some good resources for figuring out how to make the mod, I would be ecstatic. If someone were to make this mod for me, I would extend my virtual hugs and eternal thanks (since I can\u0027t actually hug you on the spot)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T09:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make copies of the cfg files and change their file names then edit various parameters in the files.
