I really love it, but I have major issue with radial decouplers and boosters. When I decouple my boosters, they tend to collide with my rocket and damage it. I can more or less solve the problem using separatron, but it is unreliable, and separatron tend to be destroyed during ascent because of FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T17:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has nothing to do with FAR.

At that moment Krakensbane minimizes the floating point errors and they start behaving normally again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T17:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022haltux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022haltux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eseparatron tend to be destroyed during ascent because of FAR\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou were meant to say Deadly Reentry, I guess, in which case - ascend slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solution: put radial booster lower on decoupler. Decouplers should push boosters above their CoM, forcing them to spread outward faster. If you\u0027re using struts then you\u0027ll have to use separatrons because struts kill the ejection force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carter","CreatedById":18177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T18:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put radial mounted parachutes at the bottom of my boosters once, just one per booster, facing outwards. Not at the top, and not in the middle, all the way down by the nozzle. This had the effect of hauling the nose away from the craft and it would gradually accelerate away from the main body before completely turning end-over. It was actually very pretty. Since I\u0027ve installed Real Chutes I\u0027ve been having trouble replicating this, I may need to crank the pre-deployment altitude way up, but Real Chutes just doesn\u0027t seem to do that instantaneous tug upon deployment that stock does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething to try, but I don\u0027t do it anymore now that I\u0027m learning how to tweak Sepatrons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T08:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks to all for your answers.
