I even think that the first samples should give 300% of science, I believe you will agree with me that the first landings on the Moon, Venus and Mars\u00A0gave the most amount of data about the planet, only when new experiments were brought to the surface in the following landings did we find out\u00A0anything new. The purpose of this proposal is to limit the biome hopping.
