It was launched on May 28, 1971, and arrived in December 2, 1971.\n\nHowever, once it landed and began operation, transmissions were cut 14.5 seconds later for unknown reasons.\n\nThe lander carried a little Prop-M rover that has a 15 meter umbilical.\n\n![Mars_propm_rover.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Mars_propm_rover.jpg)\n\nI would really like to see someone make a mod out of this, I think it\u0027s a very neat looking lander.\n\nCheers! And I hope someone makes it!"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:34:02Z","Content":"Should this be in The Spacecraft Exchange?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:35:15Z","Content":"OP mentions that he/she wants someone to make a mod out of Mars 3."},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T22:27:52Z","Content":"Yes, I wish for someone to make a mod out of this."}]}
