Let me say that I am very near my RAM limit with the amount of mods I have installed on this save, and I have confirmed that my current config is unstable on 64 bit, so that is not an option. I would simply like to add one more launch site, and if possible, have it operate much in the way RSS handles its alternates. I do not wish to have to run RSS to have this ability, and it seems to me that Kerbtown is too bloated, and Extraplanetary launch pads is probably not what I am looking for. Someone must have something for this, but google has not been my friend in this matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T16:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehyperedit? you can put rockets anywhere on Kerbin with that, as long as you know how to build a tower for it.
