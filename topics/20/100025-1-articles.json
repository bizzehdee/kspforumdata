So, my question is, is it possible to automate the reentry of a craft which isn\u0027t focused? Obviously you\u0027d have to set up the craft first in order to reenter and land safely.\n\nI know theres a mod called routine launch automation or something like that which automates launches, but what about the other direction?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T18:54:08Z","Content":"You could take a look at [**StageRecovery**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-25-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-1-%2810-7-14%29).

So the craft is still technically removed without landing, but you should receive everything as if you had recovered it from the surface (assuming it would have had the ability to land with parachutes). The only difference really is that you can\u0027t go focus on the craft after it \u0022lands\u0022 so if you wanted to gather something at the landing site, that has to be done manually.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T19:46:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
