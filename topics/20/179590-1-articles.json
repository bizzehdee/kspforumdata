I\u0027m interested in building a tall multi segment vertical tower on one of those. The base would be a massive heavy ore loaded thing to provide a steady anchor to build on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-07T00:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI highly doubt it, but it might if the vessel can be flown using only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0 But I\u0027m pretty sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E docking module was written for zero g environments, and may not like the fact there is constant acceleration in one direction.\u00A0\u00A0 It might not even engage because the target is landed.\u00A0\u00A0 I dunno, but it\u0027s worth trying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might have more success if you use something like the Docking Alignment indicator mod.\u00A0 Set your vessel to Radial Out, with the docking port on the bottom, and fly it like a Kerbal on EVA.\u00A0 Use the indicator to get you right over the target and slowly descend.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-07T03:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try the Translatron Keep Vert mode with SmartASS in Surf Up. It can act as a hover hold.\u00A0 Use the Speed control in Translatron to raise your altitude and set it to zero and it will hold your altitude. Make sure Kill H/S is unchecked and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to move\u00A0around and it should be pretty easy to dock.
