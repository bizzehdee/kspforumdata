I have spent a few hundred hours playing and think im starting to figure some of this stuff out. I have pretty much explored all of the Kerbol system and was interested in trying out some other planets. I have done a fair amount of reading but I am lost as to how to do this. I found Kopernicus in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E but it has no box to check to add it to the game, same with the Beyond Home mod. I went to the forum page for Kopernicus and downloaded the latest version and added it to my game but when I started the game I got a message that it wasnt compatable with my game version (i have most current) and not to open any save games so I removed it and went back to forum page to read more but I am still lost. Any help would be great. Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotty65","CreatedById":208267,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T14:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Im getting there. Foxxo posted a similar question a few hours before mine and through that post i think Im getting there. I have the correct version of Kopernicus on now, working on getting the correct version of Paralax and beyond home is downloading now. Hope this works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T14:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah... it depends on whether you\u0027re on KSP 1.8.1, 1.9.1, or 1.10.1, as currently, there are basically seperate versions of Kop for each, and you must run the correct one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLikely, you\u0027ve found out that if on 1.10.1, you should be running R-T-B\u0027s Bleeding Edge fork. Then, just the latest versions of Parallax and Beyond Home. Just be aware that the Bleeding Edge fork, *is* called that for a good reason... So you may run into bugs and issues... but at least you\u0027ll be on all the correct versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-21T14:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2020 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotty65","CreatedById":208267,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T16:12:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat worked, thanks for the help.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
