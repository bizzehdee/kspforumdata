I\u0027m looking for something like what I see in RP-0/ RP-1 where there\u0027s a chance for engine failure, but repeated uses of an engine make it less likely to fail. I can\u0027t find anything current that doesn\u0027t depend on real fuels, other than Oh scrap, which may not be up to date, but seems to have the down side that if you use the stage recovery mod or land and recover your spent stages/craft, the engines start to fail from being used too many times. I don\u0027t want that. I\u0027m just looking for a simple failure mod that improves reliability over time, without having to worry about how many times an engine might get re-used. I\u0027d appreciate any pointers toward any mods like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T12:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you looked at \u201CDang It!\u201D?

I tried building my own config that just removed the life support systems, which is really all that I don\u0027t want, but once I removed the life support rules from the config, I kept getting Kerbalism screaming at me that I needed the community resource pack installed to use Kerbalism, even though I do have it installed, so I have no idea what I was doing wrong. I like the research and even the radiation eviroment of kerbin, and I\u0027m curious about the part failures but I\u0027ve absolutely 0 interest in any life support mods.
