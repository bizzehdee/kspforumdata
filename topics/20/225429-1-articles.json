Is it possible to make functional volcanoes, using a combination of things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and Kopernicus? Adding a glowing surface for lava is easy enough, but how about adding heating effects? I know it\u0027s possible to make lava \u003Cem\u003Eoceans\u003C/em\u003E, like in the Kcalbeloh system. But those work based solely on altitude, similar to Jool\u0027s killsphere. Is there a way to have a localized heating effect to make the volcano functional? Is there a way to add an audio effect for it as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
