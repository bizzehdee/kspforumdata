Before too many mods get fully updated, you could go through and delete all of the mods that are definitely not supported anymore. Most mod authors with mods from October are going to have to re-write their entire OP anyways, might as well just start fresh. That would dramatically cut down on the old data that has to be backed up, and help limit some of the confusion with old mods that do not exist anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
