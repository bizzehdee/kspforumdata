Because I\u0027ve never really done this before, I want some suggestions for mods. I\u0027d rather it if you avoid part mods, unless they add directly to the career experience. I\u0027m largely asking for suggestions of mods that improve the career mode, like contract mods and improvements to the stock mechanics, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T16:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is good.
