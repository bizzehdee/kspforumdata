The reason why is that I am absolutely terrible when it comes to controlling RCS thrusters. I can never get RCS thruster movements right, and all my efforts usually just make the situation worse. That is why i use mods like Mechjeb to do my docking maneuvers for me, because otherwise i would never be able to dock things.\n\nHowever being able EVA in space is very important, not to just get EVA reports for science, but also to fix problems with the spaceships; and they are the only way that space stations and very large ships can be built.\n\nIn the real world astronauts have some kind of rope or something that are attached to the ship or station and also attached to their suits, and this prevents them from floating away.\n\nI was looking for something like that in a mod for Kerbal Space Program. I heard that Kerbal Attachment System has something that I could use, but I have no idea of how to go about using it. I would really appreciate is someone uploaded a video or a series of photos showing how the things in that mod could be use to secure kerbals during EVA."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T21:14:08Z","Content":"If using Kerbal Attachment system, while you are hanging on the side of the capsule grab the end of the KAS Winch (Any of them will work) \n\nNow then, what I suggest you do to correct your docking issues is practice. when you hit R to turn on the RCS pack the kerbal will orient itself to galactic up, and if you get turned around point the camera at where you want to face and hit \u0022space\u0022 now then, short taps are key. If you think you\u0027re moving you are, if you know you\u0027re moving you are going too fast. the WASD keys correspond to the appropriate cardinal directions. W = forward, A = left, S = backwards, D = right. Shift and ctrl move up and down, they work the same as the throttle (Shift for up and CTRL for down)\n\nNow, for ships there\u0027s another set of controls IJKLHN These work a little different. J/L are the same, but I/K are up and down respectively, and H/N are forward and back respectively. The key to aything is short taps."},{"CreatedByName":"OpenWorldAddict","CreatedById":110661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T21:36:46Z","Content":"The problem I have with RCS is that you have to be very light on the keys to control it exactly, but that is very hard for me, especially when using a keyboard. If I was using a joystick, that would be another matter, maybe over time with practice of tiny movements I may be able to use it better, but tiny movements with the keyboard is impossible for me. Many times when I have a deficiency that inhibits my enjoyment of the game, I turn to mods to help me out. I do have disabilities caused by stroke when I was an infant, and that means that my hand-eye co-ordination is not perfect, and that effects thing like this.\n\nUsing RCS thrusters is a kin to anything that requires fine-hand movements (or the ability to move your hand in tiny controlled increments), which for me to try is a constant battle. It is this reason why I found 3d graphic design in college so frustrating. One slip of my hand would ruin the whole thing I was trying to do, and that kind of thing happened often.\n\nThis is not something that I can just improve over time with practice. It is some thing that I have to accommodate for. Yes, it is true that with the right tools (like controlling RCS with a joystick) I might be able to figure out how to compensate for the problem, but that doesn\u0027t make the problem go away.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T21:39:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OpenWorldAddict**"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T21:49:14Z","Content":"there\u0027s [Active Struts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96361-DEV-HALTED-0-90-ActiveStruts-Create-Remove-Struts-in-Flight-v1-1-1-2014-12-31), can maybe even do some bungee jumping with the rubberband ones"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T21:58:59Z","Content":"Ah, ok.

I had KAS installed and built a orbit achievable rocket with a radial winch attached to the side and a ladder extending down from the cockpit hatch to ensure that my kerbal stays attached to the ship before he grabs the connector.\n\nThe plan was to do to EVA tests, one with just grabbing the winch and seeing what happens and if I could get the Kerbal back on board. The second test was to use the RCS jetpack while attached to the winch to see what happens and if I could get the Kerbal back safely on board. The ship also had a probe command unit.\n\nOnce I got the ship into a stable orbit, I executed my first EVA test, hitting the EVA button and then moving the Kerbal down on the ladder to where the winch was. Then I had him grab the connector and let go of the vessel. After floating around for a few minutes I found that I did not float too far. I could not get the ship to reel the Kerbal back in even with its probe command part, however it was to much of a struggle to get the kerbal back to the ladder to grab on and get on board. I do have to say the success of this first test does make doing eva to get eva reports for science gameplay mode possible, but I will have to do further tests in that mode to determine how early I could get the winch out as well as testing working with those science reports while on EVA.\n\nAfter the moderate success of the first test I was feeling good and so decided to go ahead with test #2, and that\u0027s when things went awry. As soon as a hit the EVA button, the kerbal was sent flying away from the ship. I didn\u0027t even have time to grab the connector (which by the way was still out.) and before I knew it the ship disappeared from site.\n\nSo I scrapped that mission and launch the same rocket again for the second test, and initiated it once in orbit again. This time it began as normal. My kerbal came out at the hatch, I moved him down the ladder and grabbed the winch connector. Once attached to the winch I allow him to let go and float away, then I activated his RCS jetpack; and that\u0027s when things went all wrong.\n\nEven with the smallest of movements with the jetpack, he was moving all over the place, even though he stayed connected to the winch. I had trouble determine which direction he was moving and how fast he was going; as well as I wasn\u0027t sure about his orientation to the vessel, so trying to move torward the vessel was very hard. Eventually I made contact but he came in so fast that he bounced off and started head out in the other direction. Eventually after many attempts to bring him back and many bounce passes, his jetpack ran out of fuel and he was stuck. Not being able to reel him in using the winch, I forced to end the mission.\n\nSo those were my attempts yesterday. One success and two failures. I noticed the posts on this thread yesterday evening after conducting those tests, and have downloaded the bug fix mod mentioned. I will be installing it today and then going back in game for another EVA test using the caps lock method for more RCS precision. \n\nI will report later on to let you know how that worked.\n\nEdit: So, I already installed the bug fixes mod and went into game to redo test #2. Again, once I started up the RCS jetpack things got out of control as happened before, but I was able to reel him back in using the ijkl keys mentioned above. (the caps lock thing didn\u0027t work). It took alot of tries to align him up with the ladder, but eventually I was able to get him to grab a hold of the ladder, let go of the winch connector and climb back on board. Before the launch I also added the winch retract to an action key which i used after the test to bring the winch connector back in, something which i could not do before.\n\nOverall, it was a moderately successful test (RCS jetpack part still failed but winch worked like a wonder). I may need some more time with the RCS jetpack, but knowing that I can always use the winch to help me get the Kerbal back on board will make me more comfortable with doing more EVA missions.\n\nEVA is most important when building space stations and interplanetary spaceships. So my next test which I will do this evening (maybe earlier if I get the chance) will be to launch a space station and then launch another rocket to connect to the station and see if I can use EVA after docking to help secure the connection with struts and fuel lines and whatever else needs to be done while building a station. I will let you know how that goes.\n\nI do still have a few questions:\n\n1. How early in the tech tree do you get KAS parts like the winch.\n\n2. Let\u0027s say I have a winch on the space station and a winch on the rocket. If I can the kerbal get to the other winch, can I switch which winch that my kerbal is connected to?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T15:41:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OpenWorldAddict**"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T16:39:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E short burst are enough if you take your time and let the movement happen. other games teach you to hold the button to keep moving in the direction, but in ksp you just keep moving and only press the keys if you want to change how you move.\n\nThis is critical to understand.

I can now feel confident about taking kerbals out on EVA without worrying about losing them to the void of space.\n\nI did one final test today. i launched a mock-up space station that had a stock space station core, a science module (even though I was in sandbox mode0, and a mechjeb probe pod to ensure I could launch it without a kerbal on board. I also added one winch to it, near the hatch to the hitch-hiker pod. Once that was in space, I launch a three man vessel with a shielded docking port on top. After having mechjeb do the rendevous and docking (but at first it couldn\u0027t dock because I forgot to open up the docking port shielding). Once docked then i took one kerbal from the rocket down some stairs that I placed on it to where the winch was. I had the kerbal grab it, let go of the rocket, and using a combination of rcs jetpack as well as the winch controls, I maneuvered the kerbal over to where the other winch was near the hatch to the station. Once the kerbal got close enough, I had him switch connectors and then i used the winch control to bring him in close enough so that he could board the station.\n\nWith that a success, I tried the process again in the opposite direction after retracting both winches. This time it was quite a bit harder, but I managed to do it and soon the kerbal was safetly aboard the rocket. With that i detached the rocket from the space station, used the rcs on the rocket to get some distance from the station, and then made the re-entry burn to send the rocket to back home. Once the rocket had safetly returned to Kerbin, I went back a de-orbited the station. I even had mechjeb plot of re-entry course that would plop the station down in the ocean of the coast of the KSC as one final showoff because this EVA testing in now finally over for me. Wish me good luck in my future endeavors, with hope of never losing another kerbal in orbit again."}]}
