This even if they\u0027ve made or now maintain mods pretty much everybody considers utterly essential. And even if their work isn\u0027t used by many, usually it\u0027s of quite high quality and deserves a nod for the effort even if you don\u0027t use their stuff. Seriously, it\u0027s a rare modder who has more than 1 green light under his name. And meanwhile, guys like me, who have made no substantive contributions to the community but just toot our own horns with mission reports, often have way more. The karmic (kErmic?) imbalance in all this is now posing a significant threat to the continued existence of the universe itself. Kraken attacks are bleeding over into real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I urge all KSPers who don\u0027t want to see the apocalypse happen this year to open up their GameData folders, see what mods they have, and go rep those who made and/or now maintain them. And then go through the last 10 or so pages of both the mod release and development forums and hand out more rep to whatever strikes you as a valiant effort whether you use it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t think you get nothing out of doing this. If you like a mod, you want to see it continue at least as long as your own interest in KSP. But every time KSP updates, some mods, even very popular ones, bite the dust instead of their creators/maintainers updating them to suit. How often is this caused by the creator/maintainer feeling under-appreciated? Rep has no cash value but it\u0027s symbolic. Napolean said \u0022It is by baubles that men are led,\u0022 referring to medals and awards. Rep here is our version of giving a medal. So give rep to those deserving of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T04:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes Rep actually count for anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get some and give some, but other than a quick and easy private way to thumbs up a joke or clever idea, what use actually is it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T04:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, and have you seen that SQUAD guy?

When signed in at Spaceport my DL count seems to make sense, a burst of downloads after updating before tapering off slowly over two or three weeks, but the fact that it changes when you sign out, and the general unreliableness of Spaceport makes me doubt either number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I think I\u0027m also guilty of inconsistent rep giving. The only place that I reliably give out rep is when people send results for my CPU thread. I even went back and sent rep to everyone who had contributed after they changed the rep system; it took two or three days because of the limits on giving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-30T16:04:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2014 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"avivey","CreatedById":98217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027give rep\u0027 would give a much more real signal it it was publicly shown on the actual post/thread/something that it came from - like facebook\u0027s \u0022likes\u0022: \u0022Alice, Bob, Eve and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E54 others\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E gave rep for this post.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt drives rep giving, surfacing the feature, and makes users more \u0022accountable\u0022 for the reps they give.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if vBulletin actually supports this, though, or if it\u0027s actually important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going to take me about a month to rep everyone responsible for the mods on my list.
