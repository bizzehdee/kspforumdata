In fact, the two can be converted between each other with any KSPI part that is labled a megajoule converter. Megajoules the resource powers electric systems, such as ELECTRIC\u00A0engines or fusion reactors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMEGAWATTS is the unit of heat. This refers to the heat from a reactor, the heat consumed by a THERMAL engine or thermal power generator, and also waste heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnytime you generate megawatts, or use megajoules (like from the reactor that powers a wireless power network, OR when the wireless transmitter is used) it produces the RESOURCE WASTE HEAT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for things to work, you need enough radiators attached to the things that produce or use megajoules or megawatts (waste heat producers). Your radiators need to have a capacity roughly equal to the megawatts you are producing. When your in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, click on the kspi icon and it will bring up a widget showing you what your radiator capacity is. When it turns green, you have enough radiators (provided they are placed close enough to the producers of waste heat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few quirks with this though. The first is that all radiators work much better in an atmosphere, so you can get away with fewer if you\u0027re on kerbin (like for a ground power station). The second is that when using a wireless power receiver, the game won\u0027t know in advance how many megajoules of power the receiver will get when you\u0027re building the craft (so the waste heat widget isn\u0027t as useful). In this case, look at the capacity of the wireless receiver and include enough radiators to match that capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having enough radiators is one of the number 1 problems I\u0027ve seen following the kspi threads. You can use tweakscale to increase the radiators capacity easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T07:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally the Megajoules have been implemented in KSPI by its original author (@FractalUK) in addition to ElectricCharge to avoid the situation,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen a megawatt-power consuming device (say, engine or emitter) drains out every AAA-class battery on your ship in a millisecond, and the ship gets dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, when your high-power devices produce and consume one resource (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E), while the cabin and antennas another one (EC), on the out-of-power you just get the engines shutdown, but the life and communication are still going on, because they use EC rather than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, you can keep being recharged your low-power EC-consuming devices from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E-producing generator, but a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E-consuming engine can never suddenly spend EC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Waste Heat is something like that, too. While your solar panels and radiators produce just kilowatts of waste heat, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E-class generators produce thousands times of that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, to keep away the low- and high-power equipment, he implemented the Waste Heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 100 K overheat is nothing for a high-power reactor, but a boiling for the cabin and fuel tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, if both megawatt and kilowatt class devices were using same Heat resource, then the cabin would boil on any minor overheat of the power/propulsion system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the other hand, a cabin doesn\u0027t need the megawatt-class cooling,\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the Waste Heat is for high-power devices and for high-power waste heat transfer/redistrubution, the Heat is just the waste heat from lower-power devices and their puny coolers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also, iirc, when the Waste Heat was implemented, the stock KSP didn\u0027t have modern heat management. But I can be wrong here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was similar situation with Water. To prevent the situation when a water-consuming device suddenly spends all onboard water, there were Water and LqdWater or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in any case you have to either use KSPI-E, or reinvent the resource separation yourself.
