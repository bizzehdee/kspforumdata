Ive added a few more than planned and now lost track of every mod I\u0027ve injected into the system!!! When I activate the engine it shows that there\u0027s no fuel in the tank even though there\u0027s a full tank of LHydrogen. Also it says that that\u0027s what it runs off of in the description.\n\nThanks,\n\nE"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T04:00:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It could be Near Future since it has a patch to make the Nervs use LH[/quote\n\u003E i really think the engines came from Nearfuture. The engines say Wobbly Rockets. It\u0027s the Nerva MKI Nuclear engine. Can\u0027t get the thing to light at all and it says liquid hydrogen is its thing...
