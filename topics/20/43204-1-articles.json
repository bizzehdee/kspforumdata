I know that I can have a quad or tri coupler with docking ports and connect them that way but the two parts still bend like a bendy straw. Any solutions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeblote","CreatedById":79303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T15:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod doing this, I think it\u0027s called quantum dock struts or something, basically when you dock ports it creates some sort of laser struts and ridges the parts together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
