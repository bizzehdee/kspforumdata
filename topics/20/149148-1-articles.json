Since there is only the Infernal Robotics mod that lets you rotate and elevate missiles, guns and other things at the moment, it would be really cool if there was a mod that lets you build your own turrets that work with BD Armourys mouse aim. For example you could choose your turret ring size/type (hand cranked or motorized), gun elevation mechanism, etc. and orcourse the gun or other thing you want to point at your enemy. It would be also cool to be able to add armour to the turret.

Right now the turret rotation and pitch are run by a turret module, this module only acts as a slave, so the turret doesn\u0027t point the gun, the gun points the turret, and the real kicker is that the turret module can only function when combined, in one part, with a weapon module of some type, it sadly will not function any other way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I\u0027ve tried using turrets for cameras and search lights, and it\u0027s a big fail , Baha himself stated that it would never work and now having come to know the code a bit myself I can see why.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you can do that works quite well is make a simple turret, just a nicely militaristic box, give it a decent amount \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E torque, mount it on an IR free docking washer, glue a radially attachable gun to the turret and it works quite respectably, of course it has basic point and shoot functions but cant access the advanced stuff that comes with a full part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as an idea yes it would be cool, but i think that it\u0027d take a complete rework of BDAc to make it happen, and perhaps it\u0027d be better\u00A0 to derive some ideas from BDAc and start afresh with the modular target in mind from the first\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FLying-FINN","CreatedById":162581,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T13:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222784633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149148\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475457117\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250907\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly as the code stands that\u0027s not currently possible, it\u0027s been tried so many times, by so many different mod makers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh god damn it..
