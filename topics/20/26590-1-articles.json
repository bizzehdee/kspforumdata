Is this normal? Are my ships just excessively wobbly? MechJeb issue/ bug-feature? And sometimes it will just wig out and start spinning back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T22:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is good, but not reliable. I really use it \u0022without looking\u0022 only on tested vehicles that I know will perform 99% as same as the previous flights. It could be a few things, try using \u0022RCS balancer\u0022 (not sure if it works with docking AP). It could be also that the MechJeb is trying to dock with a spinning station, in which case it would spend lots of RCS, switch to station and SAS it (or use timewarp, a bit unrealistically). Also make sure that your RCS thrusters are positioned so you have them in all axis. I had a problem when I only placed thrusters on sides, so the ship couldn\u0027t translate left-right and docking AP was trying to move but couldn\u0027t so it wasted tonnes of RCS. After I\u0027ve placed place-it-anywhere thrusters on sides it used very little fuel. Also try to balance it according to CoM as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, those are the things that come up to me right now, it could be anything really.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-12T22:45:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2013 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
