You can use it as a flight aide when actively controlling the craft, but also to make sure your probe keeps its heading and does a burn when it\u0027s out of range. Most of the buttons just tell your probe to point a particular heading: prograde, retrograde, normal, anti-normal, radial, anti-radial. These are always relative to your orbit, which means they won\u0027t match up with the symbols on the navball if the navball is set to Target mode, for example. \u0022Surface\u0022 allows you to specify a heading relative to the surface of the body you\u0027re orbiting, e.g. you can tell it to point directly up or directly down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust scheduler allows you to specify a burn at a particular throttle level (top slider), for a particular time in seconds (middle box), after a particular time in the format HH:MM:SS has elapsed (bottom box).
