I made a test rocket with a cluster of four NERVs, and i needed to run them at full thrust for 25 minutes (using infinite propellant cheat) to get them to glow, and at that point activating radiators (medium TCS, one per engine) basically negated all the heat. That was disappointing, especially given those were active engines. Passive heat management should be a consideration: consider\u00A0the ISS, which\u00A0has radiator panels despite not having anything very hot (like a rocket engine or nuclear reactor). As it is, it seems the only real use for radiators are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E modules (and in MKS, the nuclear reactors).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not interested in new engines and things like Interstellar Extended adds, i try to keep things largely close to stock (current mod list is mostly quality of life things plus MKS/OKS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not looking for anything fancy, just something that makes adding thermal control systems to things like space station recommended if operating in sunlight, so that radiators would have some use beyond realistic looks for non-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there is a \u0022more heat\u0022 mod that merely multiplies heat generation by engines but that doesn\u0027t address space stations and the like. But other than that, there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything like what i\u0027m looking for. Or is there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
