The idea is to launch an interplanetary ship from Kerbin with enough fuel to get there, and enough (empty, from launch) tanks to - if they were full, get to the planet I\u0027m heading to. I\u0027ll show up at Minmus on fumes, fill up the tanks, then drop back to Kerbin and use all that potential engery turned kinetic to get a nice boost in speed for my transfer.

Like on one of Jool\u0027s moons to act as a base for operations there. Or like I did in my Moho mission to support by stations and bases there.

It sounds silly but I\u0027ve heard players can get pretty defensive over their kethane stocks even if they\u0027re trying to claim the whole planet for themselves. another thing kethane could be used for is to establish colonies on another planet, you could make it so you don\u0027t have to start at the space center everytime to launch a ship only to add to a for sure growing fleet. I have a prototype in working where docking ports are used to create a fully mobile off planet launch pad and tests are going well. the only thing I ever have to return to kerbin for is to launch a new vessel then that vessel can operate solely from minmus without every worrying about running out of fuel and saving a hell of a lot of fuel escaping the kerbin system in the first place. kethane has many uses\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T13:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways in for a bit of necrosis: In my current career save Kethane (only) is what makes nuke engines glow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane is essentially an alternative to sending fuel up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit is, the farther away you are from Kerbin, the more fuel effective it is to gather fuel there instead of signaling Kerbin that you need more and then waiting several months.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
