I\u0027ve opened them using notepad and I get the wingdings style font for garbled code. Essentially telling me \u0022no no, not for you Sir\u0022. I know this will most likely cause some people to say \u0022if you dont even know how to open it, you have no business being in there\u0022 which is most likely a very accurate statement, but modders / community members do post the code they use to fix issues on mods that have otherwise gone dead in the water/no longer supported.

At this point my initial intent is to apply fixes to my own stuff that other more experienced modders (ie anyone who has opened a dll properly) have provided to mods that have either lost support or are actively being updated but current release with the fix has not been officially provided yet. I would eventually like to move toward being that guy that helps provide those tiny fixes. An end goal, to give a specific example, would be to help provide code for say KerbPaint that adds new parts, interstellar parts, procedural fairings, etc etc, essentially any parts I may use in my game or at the request of others, but I think that may border on some legal stuff in regards to ownership and what not. I suppose if I\u0027m ever comfortable enough, I would eventually try to do a mod of my own but I have no intentions at this point of taking credit for anything more than \u0022Hey, now you can paint this now, whereas before you could not\u0022.
