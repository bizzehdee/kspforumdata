But they all add text to the right-click menu... And, this id not a joke, some parts have menus that don\u0027t fit on the screen.\n\nI was thinking that maybe someone could make a mod that makes the menus smaller and scrollable, or makes it so a unity-style window pops up instead of the default one.\n\nIs this even possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:41:44Z","Content":"I also would like to locate something like this that takes all of the right click menus and neatly arranges them in a separate window.\n\nWould be very useful so that I don\u0027t have to play sniper with the right click menus.\n\nPart highlighting would be a plus."},{"CreatedByName":"seanmcdougall","CreatedById":143691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:53:35Z","Content":"Funny you mention this - I\u0027ve actually been working on a mod that will consolidate all the right-click menus from all parts on the active vessel into a single window.

I\u0027ll probably put something up in the Add-on Development forum in the next day or so to get some feedback - stay tuned ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"seanmcdougall","CreatedById":143691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T01:08:45Z","Content":"As promised, please come check out my new mod - [Part Commander](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124018)"},{"CreatedByName":"FunnyBunny14","CreatedById":128892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:09:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As promised, please come check out my new mod - [Part Commander](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124018)\n\nThank you so much!"}]}
