If you are in 1.8\u002B, that really leaves AVP or Spectra. If you have a potato PC, probably check out Spectra.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-09T15:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally use Spectra and love it, I think Spectra has amazing graphics and low performance.
