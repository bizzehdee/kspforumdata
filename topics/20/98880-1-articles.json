But, basically, the upper left corner of a right-click menu appears at the screen point corresponding to the center of the part. At a minimum, the menu should ensure it is on the screen when you right-click. As for overlaying windows, I\u0027m not sure if Unity is sophisticated enough to have the menus avoid each other (your fuel transfer example) or if its possible for a window/menu/element to check for others on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T06:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember I once saw an outdated mod that gives diegetic (in-game-world) holographic user interface for the right click menu.
