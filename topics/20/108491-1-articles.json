If a critical error occurs and a Kerbal dies then SOL. But, with the current hiring costs for new Kerbals as high as it is (mpo), one or two failed trips and your space program can be ruined not due to lack of funds for a new ship but due to no way to get additional crew. \n\nSo,\n\n**The Request**: A sliding difficulty (bar?) for the Crew Hiring cost, similar to the Science or Contracts rewards sliders in the New Game options screen.\n\nPreferably, to accommodate people who also want a harder experience, maybe a sliding scale from -100 (half current cost) to 100 (double current cost).\n\nAnyway, if anyone is interested in creating something like that or know if it is even possible, let me know!\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T00:34:09Z","Content":"My rebalance just sets it at half, no plans for a slider.
