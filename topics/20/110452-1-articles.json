This could make all manner of movement smoother.\n\n-rotors and pistons that have tweakable range, speed, can be throttle controlled, and have an oscillate option so they can go back and forth between the limits without constant button mashing/KOS codes.\n\n-a few foot types for different machines. Maybe some structural leg bits for aesthetics.\n\nIf you\u0027re actually interested in attempting this I can come basic concept designs for the parts."},{"CreatedByName":"gamingknight","CreatedById":175269,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-29T20:12:47Z","Content":"i do not know much about mechs but for the shocks try landing struts the rotors u can use airplanes plus and for feet i suggest u use the landing struts that come with IR"},{"CreatedByName":"Fireheart318","CreatedById":159932,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-28T13:34:01Z","Content":"I tried to make a mech a while back. It worked fine, save for some random wheel failures. It could pick up objects and had purpose-built weapon modules, semi-realistic shoulders, elbows, and wrists, self-contained power, etc., but if I had actual mech parts it would\u0027ve been even better.\n\nAnd NO, it wasn\u0027t a *replica* it was *inspired by* it - [https://imgur.com/zMoNDsC](https://imgur.com/zMoNDsC)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-28T13:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2017 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Fireheart318**"}]}
