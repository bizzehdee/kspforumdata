Up to now landing isn\u0027t an issue, since my comm network does not reach out of the Kerbin system yet, so that the signal delay is low enough to allow nearly realtime control of probes. Nevertheless, I\u0027m planning to go to other planets soon, and I\u0027m wondering if, and if yes, how landing on bodies without atmosphere is possible. I mean, of course one could program a course on the flight computer that will have the craft have a defined velocity at a certain altitude, but, well, how should I know the elevation of the ground below the ship to choose the altitude at which it should be slowed down? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m planning to add another mod to my game - one that will help me with that issue, and I\u0027d like to ask for your help on deciding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb, or any other \u0022does everything for you\u0022 solution is a no-go for me. If I can write a program that takes care of the landing, that\u0027s fun. If the program is already written and I only have to press the \u0022Play\u0022 button, it\u0027s boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been thinking about two possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I\u0027m not mistaken, kOS or kRPC have variables that give you the radar altitude, so it should be doable to write a kOS or kRPC script that brings down the probes speed at the right point during descent. Nevertheless I have no idea, if this works for probes without crew pod, because with the games GUI one only has a radar altimeter in IVA... Also, from what I\u0027ve read the integration between kOS and Remote Tech is not finished yet, so kOS doesn\u0027t care about antenna range. Does kOS respect signal delay in some way? How about kRPC? \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe second option I thought about is to make a map of the body the probe should land on using SCANsat, and to use that map as an estimate for elevation, before programming the flight computer appropriately. This is of course less exact, since the flight computer does only allow commands, no conditional programming, and the burns have to be calculated well. Added difficulty: The probes mass will change with spent fuel... \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich of these solutions would you use or are you using? Are there any other addons that work well?

We regularly send programming to satellites already. kOS would just be a program sent to the probe, then the probe can run the program locally. So there is no delay, aside from the delay of sending the probe the programming ahead of time.. That is one of the things that I thought was goofy with remotetech assumptions. Manual commands being sent would take a while, but if you send a program ahead of time, then the probe can run the program whether it has a signal or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T16:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know someone on Youtube did a mission to Duna and Ike completely via kOS, so it\u0027s definitely possible with kOS.

But once my communication network is in place, I\u0027m going to use kOS. I\u0027ve meanwhile written a script for it that manages to land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn without issues, as long as the TWR is high enough that the crafts mass does not change significantly while hovering (and fixing that would be a minor correction). It\u0027s not very efficient, but still much better than any manual landing I\u0027ve performed up to now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my plan is to already copy that script to the kOS storage within the vessel before launch, and to make kOS wait for an action group toggle to run it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the syntax by heart, but it\u0027s something like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EWAIT UNTIL AG1=TRUE.

That in my opinion doesn\u0027t really break immersion, since the land script is being run locally on the probe, and starting it still has to be done some time ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"notsorightstuph","CreatedById":82399,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T15:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too have been looking into this.
