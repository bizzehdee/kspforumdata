And if it comes to that and the game bugs you can always reload your backup save which you should always create before installing mods.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T11:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T11:51:49Z","Content":"You can install mods later ... no probem.
