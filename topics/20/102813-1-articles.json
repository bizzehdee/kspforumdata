I\u0027m looking for a stockalike 6 meter cargo bay for the stock MK2 fuselage system. I build a lot of fighter jets and I like them to look nice so I use internal payloads instead of external hard-points wherever possible. My problem with the current parts is that the 4m bay is a bit too short for my needs, and the 8m bay is a bit too long. So I either need a 6m bay, or a 2m bay to slap on the end of a 4m bay.\n\nIf you can either:\n\n1.) Be awesome and make one and let me focus on building.\n\n2.) Point me somewhere I can find one.\n\n3.) Or point me somewhere that I can learn to make one.\n\nI\u0027d love you forever and ever.\n\nThanks."}]}
