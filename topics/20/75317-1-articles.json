Now I think I\u0027m ready to orbit the beginnings of long-term converters. I\u0027ve tried reading a bit on the Kethane wiki, and while it\u0027s been loosely helpful it doesn\u0027t compare to getting direct answers from people with experience with the mod. I\u0027ve gone with, what I feel might be oversized battery storage, and power generation, because I might do conversion\u0027s mid-flight on longer missions to setup a station in orbit of say Eeloo. And I generally do not put more than a handful of solar arrays on my ships, because they have low power requirements, so my primary orbital Kethane conversion needs to be as close to self-contained as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aCTerLU.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/aCTerLU.png\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- is the core of what I\u0027ve been considering as part of my ultra-modular station components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ho2KJx0.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Ho2KJx0.png\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- is my primary fuel hub design at this time, which is where the new Kethane converters will link upto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8UPp2Dg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/8UPp2Dg.png\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- an action shot of my station, ever being updated as I learn and update \u0026amp; refine my designs. 1 of the fuelhubs is about 2 iterations in the past, and the other needs to be replaced with the newer model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow my question really is, for my Kethane Converter, will it operate with how I\u0027m designing it? Wiki states sometimes you don\u0027t need fuel lines, and sometimes you do. I do not have any of the mods that allows me to add parts, struts, lines on after the fact. Since I\u0027m trying to build this without those mods, I need to know prior to liftoff if I need fuel tanks mounted.

Monopropellant tank isn\u0027t as picky since it has all vessel flow, and can be placed anywhere.

If you land a converter, it\u0027s more economical to convert planet side and transport the fuel to the station afterwards. The whole operation is best done on bodies with low gravity and no atmosphere. It\u0027s cheaper to just launch fuel from KSC to refill a station in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefault Kethane fields are rather small, with the largest fields at about 450k units, and smallest just over 100k... you will mine it dry very quickly if you have a moderate to large operation. so might want to keep the mining side fairly mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T03:12:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
