It seems as though we can mine many different resources, even exotic minerals and metals. But I don\u0027t see why I would, as i can\u0027t find the need for them.\u00A0All mining contracts I\u0027ve come across has only taken interest in ore. It would make sense for some agencies to also want other stuff, like exotic minerals. Are there any mods that add contracts for minerals mining? Or are they already in the stock game, I just been unlucky so far?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T07:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, there are no mineable resources other than ore in KSP with no mods, so contracts for exotic minerals will first require a mod that adds such minerals (and makes them possible to mine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebbemann","CreatedById":141208,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T08:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mistake, then. I guess it is the Karbonite mods that add the many mineable resources. Is there a contract mod for karbonite?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
