But in general, you\u0027ll want to look at the configs for BD armory that define the ammo. Then you\u0027ll want to look at the Interstellar configs for fuel tanks to see how they do the switch. You\u0027ll want a modman config that removes the RCS resource, and then adds the Interstellar module that lets you switch between resources, using whatever format it expects.\n\nEDIT: Note this could have odd results if you load a save that had that RCS tank on a ship.

Now, you can duplicate the part as many times as desired, and make them all have their own capacities, but they wont be interchangeable.\n\nEDIT: Actually, I don\u0027t know any modules at all that allow fuel interchangeability. Maybe the fuel switcher mod has something like that, but I\u0027ve never used it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T07:10:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Forty21112","CreatedById":125887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:15:05Z","Content":"No, I was able to change tanks contents but I would have to put the module in the cfg.
