RAM tends to be fairly cheap compared to other PC components and is really easy to install, however it\u2019s worth checking if your motherboard can actually cope with a larger amount- I once bought a load of RAM to upgrade my old PC only to discover that it could only use a maximum of 8GB and I\u2019d just installed 16GB\u00A0on top of the 4GB it had before (it didn\u2019t like that\u2026).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re going to jump from stock scale to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u2019d suggest trying an intermediate scale to start with: you could try JNSQ which is built at 2.7x stock scale (around 1/4 real scale), or rescale another planet pack- Grannus has a 2.5/2.7x scaled config which can be used separately or with JNSQ, or you could use the Rescale! mod with the stock system, stock \u002B OPM or try a config for a different planet pack altogether e.g. Beyond Home. There are also plenty of mods to make the game more realistic than stock, but less real than reality e.g. life support, construction time for rockets, part failures, crew health and more; many of the mods used by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1 have stock-alike options too e.g. Kerbal Construction Time (makes rockets take time to build and research take time to complete), Kerbalism (science experiments take time, life support, crew radiation and stress, part failures and all are adjustable), tech tree rearrangement mods like Probes Before Crew (because in reality probes \u003Ci\u003Ewere \u003C/i\u003Ebefore crew at pretty much everything), budget management mods, different fuel types (hyperbolic and cryogenic, both of which are key parts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E) and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to jump in at the deep end, go straight for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1, but personally I found it a lot easier to make the transition via an upscaled system and learning some of the mods beforehand.
