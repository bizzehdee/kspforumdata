There are currently some mods available for stock, but nothing that works with AJE. I would ideally love Davon Throttle Control to be compatible with AJE as it seems the most advanced, but the current author doesn\u0027t seem interesting in extending compatibility. Advanced VTOL control is another mod that was great and even synced engine throttle with pitch input. This was a great mod, but really needed a solution for roll control as well. If anyone would be willing to update/add AJE compatibility to either of those mods, or make a new mod it would be a great thing for all AJE users and you\u0027d have my personal thanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
