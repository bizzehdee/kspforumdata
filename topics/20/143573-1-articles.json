It would be like a normal fuselage/ fuel tank, but when deployed, a thin wall slides down and reveals the slots with the pods in them, in which the pods are then fired out of, thus escaping from the ship they launched from. An example of what I\u0027m talking about (and where I also got the idea from), is in the beginning of Mass Effect 2, when the escape pods are launched from the burning Normandy Sr-1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3BbFxNZtZec/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this has been asked before, I\u0027m sorry about that, and all you have to do is tell me and I\u0027ll take this down.

With tweakscale, it makes the compartment much bigger than I need it to, which in turn makes it rattle about. And even so, I end up having to make the pods hang of the side, rather than being enclosed inside the craft itself, because doing something like this is too hard *and pointless* inside normal cargo bays, and clipping parts inside fuel tanks and such, obviously creates more issues than it solves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you can refer me to any modders that might be willing to take up a job like this, that would be greatly appreciated, as I\u0027ve been a bit too apprehensive to contact any of the numerous authors of the mods I use because I don\u0027t know how active they are, nor do I want to be a nuisance if they have a busy schedules with the mod(s) they are constantly working on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T17:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are a couple ideas - not quite exactly what you are looking for but may be close enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a Youtube video awhile back where \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/EnterElysium/playlists\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEnterElysium\u003C/a\u003E (in one of the World War K series) used the radial cryo tanks from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112328-113-deepfreeze-v0223-22nd-june-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EDeepFreezeContinued\u003C/a\u003E on the outside of ship.\u00A0 At one point the ship was hit and several of the tanks floating away looked like unpowered escape pods.\u00A0 This one is more of a stretch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might be interested in taking a look at Roverdude\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76169-113-usi-survivability-pack-formerly-derp-v054/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Survivability Pack\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 It has the \u0022DERP\u0022 modular escape craft which has a 1-Kerbal inflatable pod with engines and fuel which you can attach to a ship with a decoupler.\u00A0 It is designed to work with his Life Support mod, but not required.\u00A0 One of the cool things about it is the action group configuration as I recall - you can set an action group to inflate and jettison all of the pods.\u00A0 (You may be able to even set an action group for Kerbals to evacuate to the pods after they inflate although I may be misremembering this.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither is 100% what you are looking for, but may be close enough to offer a starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
