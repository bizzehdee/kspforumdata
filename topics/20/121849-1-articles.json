His engine size makes more sense compared to it\u0027s thrust, but I need bigger and more thrust. Vens \u0022should\u0022 be the right size for a Mk3 Shuttle OMS and even looks like a Shuttle OMS, but for some reason it has the equivalent thrust of 2 O-10\u0027s. Unfortunately not enough to adequately push a full sized shuttle. I could just change the config and may resort to that eventually, but I\u0027d rather have something not modded by me if I can.
