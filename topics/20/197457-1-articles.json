Some of the very newest mods are listed as only compatible with 1.10.x, though they may work in earlier versions too; sticking to the latest version of the game and mods means you get the latest and greatest additions at the expense of a potentially smaller selection.\u00A0Also has a few annoying bugs in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.9.1- nearly as many core features as the latest release but has been out for far longer so more mods are compatible; expect some occasional issues when using the very latest versions of some mods which are intended for use in 1.10.x but on the whole it should work without (m)any problems. Also has a couple of minor bugs in it, but some mods exist to correct these (e.g. fuel transfer issues).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.8.1- a bit older again, still keeps the most useful new features and parts (on the fly part action assigning/changing) but does without some recent additions (ultra terrain shaders and some performance improvements).

Supports many older mods and those which haven\u0027t been updated in a\u00A0long time but newer versions of mods for 1.8 and later have a high chance of not working. Also does without a lot of the newest features and performance can be worse too, but if you\u2019re using old mods this might be your best bet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
