KerbalGalaxy sounds soo cool with the Neutron Star, and it would be cool to put a base on one of the planets. Alternis Kerbol has always been a favorite of mine and I really want to set up a base on Ike or Gilly (the 2 comets). I\u0027m stuck on a descision, so I need help big time. All I want to know is how buggy each one is and what\u0027s better for base-building in general. Thanks a lot.
