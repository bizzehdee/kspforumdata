While I\u0027m aware of MP mods, you need to have time to play at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was interested in was to collaborate on a game through e-mail. Suppose I build a space station while my friends are more interested in building a Mun base. I\u0027d build the station then send a copy of my persistence file. They merge my orbiting station into their save just as I left it. Then when their base is done they send me a save and I merge their base into my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that I can play with what they build and they can play with what I build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you can get this effect with a text editor, it\u0027s easy to make an error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any mods with a nice simple interface to do this? If not, anyone here interested in making one?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sobanaut","CreatedById":126816,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will be much better off by using something like dropbox and share a folder, because it syncs whats inside this folder to everyone. Result - you get instant update whenever anyone changes anything.
