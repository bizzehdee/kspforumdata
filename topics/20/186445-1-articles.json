I don\u0027t remember exactly where but I think it\u0027s either in settings or in the alt-f10 menu somewhere.

Does Scansat have none repeatable missions (ie scan this planet, then that one etc)? Is there also perhaps one that gives progressively more difficult base building missions? Or doing wild things with increasingly large asteroids? Just a few examples. Just something that forces a progression instead of spitting out things you\u2019ve already done is what I\u2019m looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-17T10:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really, sadly. They\u0027re hard to make and the person making them won\u0027t get as much out of them as the random ones. There used to be a set of contracts that told a story but IIRC it was never completed and hasn\u0027t been updated in years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you CAN do is install Strategia. It allows you to focus on one planet at a time and it generates a few specific contracts for that planet.
