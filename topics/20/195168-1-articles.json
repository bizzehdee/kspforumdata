Most plugin based mods may also work fine considering there is no major unity version upgrade. Mods that are version locked like Kopernicus and their dependencies don\u0027t work as the mod author has chosen for them not to yet. Mods such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer may or may not work depending on back-end changes (e.g. in 1.9 they introduced a unified camera system for DX11 which broke scatterer). I also have a feeling 1.9 version of texture replacer may also not work due to the new suit picker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would do if I were you is backup your savefile and then run all your 1.9 mods at once on 1.10 after you\u0027ve tested a stock install, and see if you find issues. If you do, remove the mods you think are most likely to be the problem 2-3 at a time and wait until the issue goes away. The mods that you removed are the ones likely needing an update.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably a bit oversimplified, but hope that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
