Then I paid closer attention to the error message from build 197 (retrieved from above link... Thanks!!!) Your mileage might vary, depending on your OS and settings, but this worked for me in Win 8.1 Pro, and Win 7 Pro. Open the mechjeb2.dll properties: at the bottom of the window may be a note about the program originating from another computer. Unblock it, or it won\u0027t load. I unblocked the files for the pod part as well. Once done build 198 from the above link worked great. You might have to do the R\u0026amp;D too, depending on if you played with too much trying to get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eagain, ymmv.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ptrthgr8","CreatedById":107415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T18:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAha. I just fired up KSP yesterday afternoon for the first time since August of last year and I couldn\u0027t figure out why Mechjeb wasn\u0027t working (hence my visit today). But I guess this recent update may have caused that one? I\u0027ll check out the guidance above to see if that resolves the error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, the game sure looks a lot more evolved than the last time I played it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
