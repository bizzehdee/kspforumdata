I\u0027ve been doing some extensive experimentation over the past couple of days, and I was in your same exact position when I started! The core mods you\u0027ll want to consider are zKreuzung\u0027s Electircal Energy plugin, and Powertech (and associated powertech_mumech). loo\u0027s EPS is another option, but it isn\u0027t widely accepted and I\u0027ve found it merely complicated things (it tries to absolve the competing standards by creating... another one...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027ve got those down, what daksh mentioned is a great start- dynasat gives you animated 2 sets of animated solar panels, batteries, and an ion engine that are very nice.
