I like career mode, especially with contracts, but I find many of the contracts too hard to accomplish. For example, the ones that require a part to be tested within narrow velocity and altitude bands. Also the number and variety of contracts seems limiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I was hoping that folks could recommend some contract mods that 1) add a lot of variety and 2) aren\u0027t as restrictive in their implementation. And other mods that might add some variety to the early part of a space program. I\u0027ve always felt that I\u0027m not doing enough in near-Kerbin space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would add that I\u0027m a horrible, horrible kerbonaut when it comes to hands-on flying. I absolutely need Mech-jeb.
