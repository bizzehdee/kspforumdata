I have tried to install scatterer , distant object enhancement , and e.v.e.(claimed to work on ksp 1.0.2) and i failed terribly.\n\nI install the mods by dragging the gamedata\u003Escatterer folder into the gamedata folder of the ksp directory. However, the mod did not show up on all 3 mods, and the game behaved as if there wasn\u0027t any mod, although the loading screen did mention that the specific visual mod was being loaded.\n\nI have checked if i dragged the mods into the correct folder, correct directory and spent countless hours wondering where it went wrong.\n\nHere are some of my specs:\n\nProcessor: Inter\u00AE Core i7-4500 CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.40GHz\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nSystem type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor\n\nIn hope of desperation i tried every single method of unpacking the mod in the ksp folder itself, throwing everything into the gamedata folder and doing everything i can. *I am sure it is the right folder as i made some adjustments to the strut connector part file and it showed up. However the visual mods did not show up.*\n\nIs anyone else experiencing the same problems as me, or does anyone know how to fix this problem? Please help me out!"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:50:43Z","Content":"Scatterer is highly experimental and may or may not work properly together with other mods.\n\nPlease do the following:\n\n- Back up your saves\n\n- Delete everything related to KSP (except for your backed up saves)\n\n- Reinstall KSP\n\n- Install Scatterer by itself, no other mods\n\n- Check its function\n\nIf it works, you can now install other mods.\n\nIf it does not work, ask for help in the Scatterer forum thread (it\u0027s stickied at the top of Add-On Development).\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:49Z","Content":"So, in your KSP directorys GameData folder you should have one folder called \u0022Squad\u0022, and also the folders \u0022BoulderCo\u0022, \u0022DistantObject\u0022, \u0022EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\u0022 and \u0022scatterer\u0022 if you have installed them correctly. If that is the case, then try installing only one of the mods at a time, and see if they work individually. There might be a conflict between the mods, although I don\u0027t know of conflicts between those 3 mods. If they still don\u0027t work individually, try a fresh KSP install, there might be something wrong with the install you\u0027re using. If that still doesn\u0027t help, I am out of ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:41:35Z","Content":"If you installed the game with steam in the default folder (ie somewhere in \u0022C:\\Program Files\u0022 or \u0022C:\\Program Files (x86)\u0022) then Windows and/or some antivirus may prevent the loading of the plugins by KSP.\n\nThe best move would be to re install the game outside those system folders. Steam allow to define custom install folder for your game ( team \u003E Settings \u003E Downloads, then click the Steam Library Folders , then delete and re-install KSP) or you could move the whole steam install ([see how on steam support page](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129))"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T12:06:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m going to be *that guy*, and say that all of the mods you\u0027re trying to install are indexed by the [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-16-13-May-2015) mod manager.

Any idea what they mean by that?

That adds in some atmospheric scattering with just a hint of warmer colors near the day/night separators.\n\nOnly folders in my GameData directory related to the AVP mods:\n\nBoulderCo\n\nDistantObject\n\nEnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\n\nPlanetShine\n\nEverything works just fine. KSP-AVC tells me that there are 3 mods installed during the startup sequence: Automatic Version Checker, E.V.E., and PlanetShine.\n\nI\u0027m interested in following Scatterer now though ... does it fix the cloud collisions with mountain tops in AVP/EVE?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rdivine","CreatedById":66317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:02:43Z","Content":"Thanks for the response guys!
