I\u0027ve managed to brute force some SSTOs to orbit but am left with no payload, range, or rendezvous capabilities.\u00A0 If those planes survive reentry without breaking up they crash land because they can\u0027t fly slow enough without dropping like rocks.\u00A0 This is all beyond frustrating and I don\u0027t even know where to start fixing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there must be a way to read the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E analysis to help fix stability and maneuverability issues.\u00A0 I also know there\u0027s a way to use flaps, slats, and more complex control surfaces to make takeoff and landing easier.\u00A0 The problem is that I can\u0027t find any decent guides or tutorials on the subject.\u00A0 Most of the guides I\u0027ve found will say stuff like \u0022make sure the numbers in this dialog box are green\u0022 and \u0022smooth out this curve\u0022 without actually explaining \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to do any of that.\u00A0 Does anyone know of some complete but straightforward guides on this stuff?\u00A0 A \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes for dummies\u0022 of sorts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T05:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, not really - however concentrate on making normal aircraft first, from the basics you\u0027re describing you have rather large design issues.
