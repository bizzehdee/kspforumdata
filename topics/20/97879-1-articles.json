I\u0027d also like manned fixed-wing flight to come before manned rockets, and I\u0027d like a simple tech-tree addon that accomplishes this without any complicated system of dependent addons (such as BTSM). I\u0027ve also noticed that there are several utilities that allow modification of the technology tree, all of which seem to be outdated (We have Treeloader, TechManager and at least one other which I can\u0027t find at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of any fairly lightweight addons that accomplishes something like this, or where I can find more up to date info on modding the tech tree? I\u0027m going to start trying to edit some of the unofficial configs that come with TechManager (which, while last updated for .25, still works with 0.90... I think) anyway but if there\u0027s already one out there that does something like what I want it\u0027ll save me some trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a real pain to sort through a lot of this information since it\u0027s scattered across so many posts in different threads in the addon forums.
