I updated to the 1.3 release, and there has been \u0022odd\u0022 occurances. The Server I play,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nonameships.pw/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nonameships.pw/\u003C/a\u003E, has multiple sub-servers, such as career and sandbox. I joined sandbox after playing some carrer, and this showed up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nonameships.pw/screenshots/Cabbink/2017-06-10%2017-14-46.png\u0022 alt=\u00222017-06-10%2017-14-46.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs You can see, there are some VERY wrong things in here. For one, The cost for a crew member is all zeroes. There is the \u0022Xp Trait \u0022 Character In the bottom left of the crew. Apparently, there are no other crew members than these 12, even though there are over 200 kerbals on the server. I can not un-select kerbals when filling a vessel, nor can i add any. New crew cannot be hired, and there are no vetrans, or lost crew(a LOT of kerbals died on this server, mind you.) When I switch to the Career\u00A0Server, it acts normal. Help? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u00A0I have no additional Part addons, only kopenercus for planet packs(its not active right now) and K.E, with a hangar extender to boot(I installed after this occurred. Graphic mods are also installed. I have nothing that would cause changes to the astronaut complex.
