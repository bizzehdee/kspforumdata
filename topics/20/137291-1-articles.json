I searched and was unable to find a solution so hopefully someone can help me out. Anytime I add an inflatable part, the OKS Habitation Ring for example, it inflates automatically in the VAB and I cannot right click it. I\u0027ve tried putting it in between different modules, etc. Here is a list of my mods: Filter Extensions, USI Tools, B9 Aerospace (Part Switch included), Community Resource Pack, Firespitter, ImpossibleInnovations, JSI, KAS, KerbalJointReinforcement, KIS, Klockeed Martian Gimbal,MechJeb2, SmokeScreen, SpaceY-Lifters, SpaceY-Expanded, TweakScale, UmbraSpaceIndustries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you anyone who can help me out here. \u00A0Roverdude?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-19T03:17:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2016 03:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tyronebigumz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded Roverdude\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T04:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably best to ask in the main thread for the mod (link in the USI catalog in my sig). \u00A0And be sure to include mod version and KSP version. \u00A0Installing KSP-AVC and including a screenshot of all of the version info is also not a bad idea to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tyronebigumz","CreatedById":162173,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T16:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you, I downloaded KSP-AVC and need to update a few mods.
