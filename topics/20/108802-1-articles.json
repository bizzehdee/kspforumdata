If you like to move your toolbar around, and have many more icons than the stock one allows then you may still want it. A lot of mods have dropped support for it.\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - this mod has not been required since 0.23 I think. I don\u0027t use it, to me it is cheating. You might as well use Alt\u002BF12 and check the unbreakable joints checkbox.\n\nEnhanced Navball - The addition were the maneuver node pointer, which pales in comparison to the ghosted icon, and the radial and Normal icons. If you want to scale the navball or have the much better ghosted icons then you will still want it."},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:14:16Z","Content":"FAR - Current stock aero is good for me but they\u0027re different enough. Your call.\n\nToolbar - While the game has it\u0027s own toolbar it clutters soon the more mods you add. The toolbar mod makes smaller toolbars and they can be hidden to the side of the screen. I normally get it.\n\nKJR - Big Mk3 (space)planes have a problem with their joint strength. If you\u0027re not getting this, then get Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fixes Mod, which fixes this too.\n\nEnhanced Navball - They\u0027re mostly the same. The mod has this \u0022phantom\u0022 markers whenever the stock ones dissapear.

In my observation, stock\u0027s closer to NEAR than FAR: slightly more realistic without severely sacrificing gameplay \u0022fun\u0022 (as opposed to FAR, which emphasizes realism as the number one priority).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Toolbar - the game has it\u0027s own toolbar now\n\nThere are quite a few mods that (for whatever reason) still require Toolbar, and many of the rest still support it. While I personally prefer the stock toolbar in most circumstances, the fact that Toolbar continues to be supported (and even required) by various mods indicates that at least some folks feel differently.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nI still use it; rockets are still too wobbly for my tastes without it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Enhanced Navball - Updates were made to the navball before 1.0?\n\nNever used it, so I wouldn\u0027t know.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m happy to install these mods, I love them, I\u0027ve used them for a long time.

Hopefully Squad gets around to working out the kinks with the 64-bit Windows version (thus bringing it up to par with the 64-bit Linux version, which is rock-solid in my experience), but I probably wouldn\u0027t be all that concerned about memory from things like Toolbar and KJR.\n\nBasically, KJR\u0027s pretty safe to go with. Toolbar\u0027s probably going to be mandatory depending on what other mods you use. FAR is still viable if you prefer near-absolute realism over the new stock system\u0027s balance of realism and accessibility."},{"CreatedByName":"Tfin","CreatedById":27558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T06:38:18Z","Content":"I see people recommending KJR for the actual joint reinforcement. I used it mainly for the way it eased into the physics activation."}]}
