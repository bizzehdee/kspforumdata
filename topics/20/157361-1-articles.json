It was not started by a modder, but rather\u00A0by sal_vager, a\u00A0SQUAD staff member. The motivation was nothing to do with fame (though it was brought up later by others);\u00A0rather,\u00A0he\u0027s concerned about the workload that modpacks impose on forum moderators. He says they sometimes have to download,\u00A0unpack, and inspect large archives by hand, as well as look up the original threads for various mods, to check that the\u00A0terms and conditions are being followed, just to decide whether to allow a given\u00A0thread to be posted. He hopes that a blanket ban of modpacks would lighten this load because such threads could simply be deleted without all of that investigation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want to help people, maybe try acting as a responsible representative of modpack creators. Try to understand the actual concerns that are being raised, acknowledge their validity, and propose constructive compromises. You will have to deal with those concerns in order to convince people who care about them. Repeating this line about a mod author who is supposedly jealous of you does not address sal_vager\u0027s concerns about moderation workload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T00:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho said anything about banning you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to feel that only your opinion counts. \u00A0Maybe in your world, but not here. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m speaking as a fairly well known mod author and maintainer. \u00A0You have no idea what happens when someone download a modpack which has old versions and then looks for help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly, I\u0027m seriously thinking of adding version checking into all my mods, so that a mod won\u0027t run on an incompatible version of the game. \u00A0And it because of modpacks. \u00A0More work for me, and frustrated players down the road\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-06T00:59:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2017 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T02:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222977003\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157361\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488758879\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157644\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ForumUser\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, ForumUser said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I wanted is to help people.

Consider that you are essentially taking on the responsibility of a librarian. You must take it upon yourself to ensure that all the mods in the pack are updated and playing well together, and be doing this continually. I have a degree in library science and I can tell you that doing this would/does take most of the enjoyment out of the game. Instead of actually playing a game you will find yourself working at checking mod compatibility and updates more often than you are completing contracts. I thought about it once, worked out what all would be required and decided it was too much work to put into a game. When I Kerbal I want to relax and have fun, not work.
