Climate change had turned Kerbin into a frozen wasteland. Kerbal kind is almost extent with 20% of there population dead. All Kerbals have lost hope and go underground to just to die.\u00A0 Until a brown dwarf was detected its path was on course to sweep through the Kerboler system. Kerbals got even sadder, for the system will be completely desolated so the dwarf was named Desolation. The Kerbal Space Program, found out about its ginormous gravity well. because it was very dense. The Kerbals got an idea! To use the star to fling colony\u00A0 ships, into other gravity wells of nearby stars. The program succeeded but the gravity from a rouge gas giant interrupted there orbit and they all where separated in the darkness of interplanetary space. The Kerbals where heading to a solar system 30 light years away called Letvea Unsimi (or Alpha Centuri for humans). The Kerbals, lost track and landed on an unknome planet in the star, Gliese 581. The planet has Oxygen and good old H20! The Kerbals are saved! Only 13 Light-Years from Letvea Usimi, will you reunite Kerbal Kind or fail trying?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanets!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Getoo\u0022 Is the Gliese 581 analog. Getoo is a small red dwarf with 5 planets and a debris\u00A0disk (Shown with a giant ring!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Esel\u0022 Is the\u00A0Gliese 581e analog. It is a hot planet a bit bigger than Kerbin. It has a thick atmosphere with stormy turbulent clouds It has no moons but giant craters, along the equator insisting one broke up and fell to Esel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Beso\u0022 Is the\u00A0Gliese 581b analog. It is a warm fast spinning blue gas giant. It has very calm clouds with 2 moons. Its rotation period is 4 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ula\u0022 is Beso\u0027s closest moon and biggest. It is almost a circle, and has a giant crater on its south pole. It is a tan-white color.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hash\u0022 Is Beso\u0027s second moon. Only one kilometer bigger than Gilly, it is roasting from, core heat and has lava spots in its craters. It is in a highly elliptical orbit, suggesting its a captured asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cedo\u0027Lea\u0022 is the first habitable planet in this system. It is 1.2 bigger then Kerbin, and has a native people on it called the Kla\u0027Ki. It is much warmer then the place Kerbals landed on. It is tidally locked and has less water on the surface. It has really short trees, only about as tall as a small Mun lander. It has tones of Youcantgetium (Its really just ore). It also has oxygen. The planet has no moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZarmina\u0027s World. Is the\u00A0Gliese 581g analog. Named after Zarmina Kerman, it is the new home for Kerbals. It has three moons. It has oxygen, water and, life! It is a tropical wonderland of a home! Only 4% larger then Kerbin it is the best habitable planet we have discover! (By accident). The moons help stabilize the environment and create enough force to rotate the planet breaking it from the tidally lock!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet-Corse913-Carbo Trinary System. The YCC system is a system of asteroids just above Zarmina\u0027s Roche Limit. The moons are basically all twins. They formed out of a gigantic ring, and they all orbit and a stable orbit with each other. The barycenter is almost completely inside Corse913.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Decoi\u0022 Is the Gliese 581d analog. It is a small gas dwarf with only one moon. It is a pink gas giant with tones of oxygen in the atmosphere to thick to breath\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Srawbeit\u0022 Is the only moon of Decoi. It is the only circular moon in the system.\u00A0 It is a moon complete made of emerald with lakes of liquid Co2. It has a pink atmosphere that smells sickly sweet. It has oxygen but the smell makes Kerbals not want to take their helmet off. We think the moon got its atmosphere from Decoi. Life is not confermed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSystem map!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/PXMpntf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/PXMpntf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew Systems (Not done)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKERBOL SYSTEM!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind was originally Kerbol, the brown dwarf striped it of some of its mass, and is now glowing a redish. Kerbol has been renamed \u0022Behind\u0022 because the kerbals, you guessed it, left it behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarco\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarco was originally Moho it was thrown into just into the habitable zone, when the brown dwarf crossed orbits. The ice melted and Marco developed a atmosphere. There is no oxygen but, there is water near the poles, and some plant life near the water. The life is very exotic, and the atmosphere is thin. Moho is finally a exiting place to go. Finally the Mohole has been filled in with water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvco\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvco was Eve, after the Gilly\u0027s orbit has been disrupted, and it was flung into eve. Gilly is now a small ring, that will form a moon in the distant future. The brown dwarf has stolen some of Eves atmosphere and mass. The oceans that once sanded eve have been shrunken down to lakes due to unknown reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemains\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemains was once Kerbin, our lush and beautiful home we helped destroy, it was mostly spared by the brown dwarf but it was thrown into a highly elliptical orbit around Behind. There is no life, no oceans, only snow and ice, toxic ice, that we made. All the oxygen has been replaced by smog, and the atmosphere is now a nasty gray, from orbit it looks like a gray gas dwarf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeri\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeri was the mun, its orbit has not changed, but its face has, the brown dwarf and Kerbin created so much tidal force all of its dormant volcanos burst at once, creating a burning lava ball. There sill is land, but now a thick heated atmosphere similar to what Eve\u0027s once was. The gravity has not changed though. You can see great views of Remains and Jeplei.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeplei\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeplei was Minmus. The orbital disturbance pushed Minmus closer to Kerbin than the Mun. Tidal heating and constant bombardment of the brown dwarf asteroid belt melted the ice, and it is now a water moon. It has a thin atmosphere with no oxygen, only Kerbonium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunet was Duna, Ike has collided with Dunet, and left a giant crater. Witch melted the icecaps, and created a unhabitable mess, the crater is full of lava, the only thing that have not changed was, its color and orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSavior\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSavior was Dres. Dres is now the star of the Behind system. It was pushed into the center of the habitable zone by the dwarf. The ice melted creating oceans, witch made a thick atmosphere close to the thickness of Kerbins. The used science experiments we dumped there, they where full of seeds, and dead plants. The water and atmosphere made them grow, mutate and evolve! Dres is now a wonderland of exotic life, and a great place to set up shop for re colonizing the Behind system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be other real star systems in the future!
