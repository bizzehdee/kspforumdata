An easy way to read your equivalent airspeed and mach number at a glance. Just a simple little window, put it wherever you like, with both those numbers constantly updated. Leave any further features for the larger, more ambitious mods.\n\nHow feasible would such a mod be?"},{"CreatedByName":"mreadshaw","CreatedById":135349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:21:57Z","Content":"I suggest Kerbal Engineer Redux.

Either it ain\u0027t there, or I\u0027m just missing it.\n\nNathanKell, that\u0027s a very useful GUI! Maybe a little *too* useful. It takes up a whole lot of screenspace to display information I will only occasionally want to read.\n\nReally, just a small info box with two numbers in it. EAS, and mach. Two values that are always useful when flying in an atmosphere. Is that a mod that anybody else would want, or is it just me?\n\nMaybe anybody interested in those values is using FAR anyway. But I\u0027m really interested in trying out our newfangled stock aero for awhile, see if we can get along."},{"CreatedByName":"Adyx","CreatedById":70890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:52:46Z","Content":"I like the Aero gauge from Steam Gauges. I don\u0027t think it shows EAS though. The intake air gauge is useful though. I also don\u0027t know if it works with 1.0 yet either. You could create a custom window in MechJeb with just Mach and EAS."}]}
