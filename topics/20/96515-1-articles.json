I wanted a higher (realistic) atmosphere that I could still use stock parts and 64K. Did the same for Eve (venus) and Duna (Mars) giving them the RSS atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt got me to thinking about atmospheric drag for vessels like the ISS space station and other sats that decay over time due to drag and have to be re-boosted when in a \u0022low\u0022 orbit above the 130km cut-off. It would require flights to deliver fuel or boost tugs to go to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know craft are on rails when not focused in KSP. A tiny drag force couldn\u0027t be always applied to simulate atmospheric drag to spiral ships to lower orbits and finally causing them to reenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been searching forums to see if anyone has been able to apply \u0022thrust\u0022 to a ship not under focus to see how they did it. So my question is does anyone know if this has been done?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T21:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70881\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbit Manipulator Series\u003C/a\u003E has an atmospheric decay that works on rails; it could be adapted to work above the atmosphere line too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has \u0022Warpable engines\u0022 - on-rails thrust!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dorin6565","CreatedById":40540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T23:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what I am looking for!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I will see if I can mod it to do what I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I have changed the mod to give drag outside the edge of the atmosphere up to 3x the top of the atmosphere. Used a scale height extension of pressure/density beyond where HoneyFox stopped (top of the atmosphere) as a first model. Having issues getting the density beyond the top of the atmosphere to align without a step function. Works fine though as it is, will deorbit everything below 210km given long enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill open a thread in add-on development when I get it stable and after asking HoneyFox if they mind if I start a fork of this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to use this very interesting article on satellite orbital decay calculations as the basis for the mod in both normal kerbin atmosphere and RSS atmosphere models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ips.gov.au/Category/Educational/Space%20Weather/Space%20Weather%20Effects/SatelliteOrbitalDecayCalculations.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ips.gov.au/Category/Educational/Space%20Weather/Space%20Weather%20Effects/SatelliteOrbitalDecayCalculations.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T05:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dorin6565\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded article about satellite orbital decay\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
