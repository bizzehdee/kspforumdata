I didn\u0027t think of using save files though, that\u0027s a neat idea. I was thinking of using different save games for different systems. So once your ship went a certain distance away from a star (like 200 million km), a menu would open up showing all the available systems to travel to, which it could do if it had some kind of warp drive part on the ship. Then you could go out to the main menu and load a game with the name of the other system, where the ship would appear at some point far away from the star (although save files might be a better idea). The planets could be procedurally generated like in Space Engine. I have an idea of the probability distributions of the randomized parameters of planets.
