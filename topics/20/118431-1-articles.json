The lack of polar ice caps means that Laythe\u0027s oceans must contain another compound, most likely ionic, such as salt. Surface samples indicate that much salt is present on Laythe\u0027s surface. Unlike that of [Kerbin](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin), the air cannot be breathed by [Kerbals](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbal) (according to EVA reports). It is therefore possible that there are also high concentrations of salt in the air, as well as on the surface, assuming that the salt is sodium chloride. The apparent toxicity of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, despite being similar in composition to Kerbin\u0027s, may also be a reference to the film [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29) - the moon Pandora is very similar to Earth, but its atmosphere is too toxic for humans to inhale, and the moon also orbits a gas giant, like Laythe. Laythe may also be a reference to the planet Damogran from the radio/tv/book/movie series The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy, as they are not entirely unlike one another.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T02:55:10Z","Content":"I know there are some Kopernicus planet packs which add an entirely new star system, but not sure if any of them actually add a new star system (or more than one) ingame rather than just replace the Kerbol system with a different one.\n\nWhether any of those or similar planet packs have a planet where Kerbals can remove their helmets safely, I have absolutely no idea."},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAlain","CreatedById":141219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:44:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I know there are some Kopernicus planet packs which add an entirely new star system, but not sure if any of them actually add a new star system (or more than one) ingame rather than just replace the Kerbol system with a different one.\n\u003E Whether any of those or similar planet packs have a planet where Kerbals can remove their helmets safely, I have absolutely no idea.\n\nI\u0027m not seeing any that do, there\u0027s one with some oxygen in lower canyons, however, that\u0027s all I\u0027m seeing."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T15:31:17Z","Content":"Make the kerbol system a binary star system, and put a 2d sun several real AU away (Eeloo is around 0.78 earth AU from kerbol)."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T16:09:41Z","Content":"Making a binary Kerbol system doesn\u0027t really work very well.
