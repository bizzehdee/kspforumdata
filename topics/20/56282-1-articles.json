I haven\u0027t attempted a mod for KSP yet, but it\u0027s like other coding projects. Write a tiny mod, something you know will effect a change, and test it. See if your code works and how well it works. Then start adding complexity. For example, perhaps consider merely adding a display of fuel percentages to the docking port when you right click. Then go deeper and start figuring out how to perform actions on it. Go slowly and be patient, keep testing, and feel free to come back here often to ask questions.
