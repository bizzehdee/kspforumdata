From what I remember from poking through the .cfg files for the two listed mods, it shouldn\u0027t be *too* difficult to set something up. Probably tedious, since it might require each tank to be Module-Manager-configured separately. (Disclaimer: only fiddled with modding for my own amusement, so not *overly* familiar with either Module Manager or the Firespitter FSTextureSwitch module..I think that was the one.) ...be far nicer to find such a thing, admittedly. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:53:15Z","Content":"If people are interested , perhaps I will put the Interstellar Fuel Switch in a separate download, which is an improved version of FireSpitter Fuel Switch.
