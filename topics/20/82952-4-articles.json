I share very little back, but possibly a tiny bit of feedback, and mostly silent appreciation. At the same time, a closed license acts as a reminder that the mod it contains is not shared, it is lent. And that\u0027s perfectly fine, I am not entitled to anything. But the distinction is worth making. For us users, getting over-reliant on mods that are lent is a road to disappointment and resentment. It shouldn\u0027t, but that\u0027s human nature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sometimes do minor part tweaks for my own convenience - extremely simple changes that are within my grasp, cloning parts and retexturing, adding other modules to .cfg. Extremely derivative stuff for my own use. The thing is, even if suddenly something were worth sharing back, a closed license would provide a barrier to entry that I would probably not seek to overcome. Wikipedia kinda trundles on after nearly a decade and a half because the barrier to entry for contributing and expanding on other people\u0027s work is extremely low (and it also comes with its own share of problems).

The value of a modpack over the mods individually is the convenience (miniscule) - not having the guaranteed most up-to-date-version (rather important) - certainty of what mod causes what (fairly important). Thinking about this more, this seems like a negative value for users, not a positive one.

It would be a really good idea to get in contact with the mod devs for those mods you intend to distribute, and almost certainly required to get in touch with the mod devs for those mods you intend to edit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may or may not work without co-operation, but if the KSP community can actually work together here, I\u0027m sure that something good can come out of this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also definitely understand ferram4\u0027s concerns.
