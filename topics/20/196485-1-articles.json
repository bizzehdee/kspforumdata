You know the answer! Yet another mod that makes the game stupidly harder and makes you spend your entire life planning your next launch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like IRL electronics but i don\u0027t really love the power management in KSP: something nerd is missing there, i would love to see more scientific values in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E planners like volts,\u00A0busses, transformer, and a lot of electronic stuff!\u00A0\u00A0I like the mod AmpYear Manager but is not what i\u0027m looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aim of this mod is to add new values to the electronics components in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and force the player to study how to power the spaceship, you can\u0027t anymore just place some batteries and everything would be instantly powered up. You need power management.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s make some examples:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a basic satellite probe, with a Probe Core, 2 panels,\u00A01 battery, a Mystery Goo and a 2HOT!\u00A0Thermometer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, you have to check the values for your devices and then you need to program the current flow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say that the\u00A0Probe Core needs a stable 30v\u00A0to stay alive, the Mystery Goo 12v and the 2HOT! just 3v.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you connect your elements directly to the battery from a dedicated mod GUI, your components will get fried instantly (boom! included) since the battery output is 220V. You need some power management there!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say we add a new part called \u0022PSU\u0022 (power supply units) with different settings that can take current from the battery and run different voltages, at this point you could simply take a multi-channel\u00A0PSU\u00A0with 3 outputs and route the current on your specific parts with the correct voltage to avoid booming.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBigger PSU means more space but more channels, but you can also link different PSU together via busses, on large spaceship with a lot of things to power, you would have a master big PSU powering smaller\u00A0dedicated PSUs for every system (a PSU for science, a PSU for attitude control, a PSU for vital support and so on..). At this point, you would have a number of power busses that you can toggle on and off to maintain the stability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think about this idea?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could plan the mod with realistic values and collaborate to make this possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me know!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil Kermstrong","CreatedById":201201,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T20:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223842820\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196485\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598202112\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194212\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceCarmelo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SpaceCarmelo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Etext\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil Kermstrong","CreatedById":201201,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T20:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your idea, but something else I would also like would be cables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love if there was a mod that made all parts that need, stores or generatea energy needing to be connected to the desired part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEx: connecting a Gigantic XL Solar Array to a Z-1K Rechargeable Battery bank, and connecting the Z-1K to a Probododyne OKTO2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this wouldn\u0027t needed if the parts were directly placed one on the other, like placing batteries and a solar panel in a Probododyne probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCarmelo","CreatedById":194212,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-24T00:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223842923\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196485\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598215941\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201201\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neil Kermstrong\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Neil Kermstrong said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your idea, but something else I would also like would be cables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love if there was a mod that made all parts that need, stores or generatea energy needing to be connected to the desired part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEx: connecting a Gigantic XL Solar Array to a Z-1K Rechargeable Battery bank, and connecting the Z-1K to a Probododyne OKTO2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this wouldn\u0027t needed if the parts were directly placed one on the other, like placing batteries and a solar panel in a Probododyne probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
