In doing so, it occurred to me that I could not find a single thread where all of the known links were gathered and organized, mostly because the original creators simply posted them as links hidden inside of the texture replacer / universe replacer threads (or as best I could tell anyway.) Would anyone be willing to take on the task of gathering all of the known and working links to the various textures currently available and make a stickied thread for easier finding of new textures, much like the current mod/plugin thread?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T03:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only one that, I can think of doing alot of suit texture is greenskull link here. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72115-0-23-5-Green-Skull-Inc-Custom-Design-Spacesuits-v0-38-14th-April-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72115-0-23-5-Green-Skull-Inc-Custom-Design-Spacesuits-v0-38-14th-April-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T03:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KSPTexturePacks/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KSPTexturePacks/\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
