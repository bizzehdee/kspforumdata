Like, the part has all of it\u0027s other functions, but also counts a control surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-08T22:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not just make the part a wing with lift, rather than a control surface with no control? You would then add a reaction wheel or small stock control surfaces for control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock mk2 parts are already a bit like lifting bodies. From front to back, use a 1.25m nose cone, 1.25 nose to mk2 adapter, mk2 inline cockpit, mk2 crew cabin, another adapter and nose on the rear. Add wings to the side and offset them into the fuselage for more lift. Easy 6 crew lifting body. The mk2 inline cockpit already has a reaction wheel for control but you may need to add more reaction wheels or control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a more advanced version, you can edit the inline cockpit cfg file for more lift to have less need for offset wings. Module Manager can duplicate and edit existing parts, or you could just brute force edit the part with a text editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod Mk2 Stockalike Extension adds many helpful parts for lifting bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod Knes is focused on French and ESA rockets. It included 2 lifting body concepts that never got built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
