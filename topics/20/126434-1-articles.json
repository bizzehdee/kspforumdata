Simple shapes, easy to texture. It is actually not a bad idea, as it would open up for a lot of new stage designs. Also not having to use those ugly aerodynamic-looking stock parts when making Saturn V or Atlas V first stage. I\u0026#39;ve modeled a whole bunch of custom parts for myself, so I might just go ahead and make these for myself as well. Thanks for the idea :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T07:19:48Z","Content":"\n[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067\u0022]Modular Rocket Systems[/URL] has these (the bottom left is what I think you want):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nnpiCnX.jpg[/IMG]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T07:32:24Z","Content":"\nYou mean like this [url]https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/153/Radial%20Engine%20Mounts%20by%20PanaTee%20Parts%20International[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T07:58:22Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027hab136\u0027][URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067\u0022]Modular Rocket Systems[/URL] has these (the bottom left is what I think you want):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]http://i.imgur.com/nnpiCnX.jpg[/URL][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYeah I love those parts but I mean standalone ones.\n"}]}
