I was wondering if anyone else out there has had any issues with their reputation on Dark MultiPlayer servers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit more information. This is a server that I host there are only about 4-6 people that use it but I seem to be the only one with this issue. after a days worth of play I log of with a decent amount of reputation ~500-1000 only to log on the next day and be at a negative amount usually around -500 to 600 so over or around an 1000 difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas as to what may be causing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
