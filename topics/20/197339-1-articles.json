The problem is that it breaks terrain colliders, specifically on the Mun. Whenever I try to land, one of two things happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy craft might instantly destroy itself a few meters above the visual surface, no matter how fast I\u0027m going. The root part disappears first and then the rest of the craft destroys itself. On occasion I actually touch the surface but I end up going right through and my craft instantly explodes a few meters below the surface. I can\u0027t land on the Mun, and I don\u0027t want to get too invested in a save where I can\u0027t land on anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else encountered this and is there a solution?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
