Facilities are the Science Lab, Cyclotron, and Zoology Bay; the function of those is to produce Eurekas, Kuarqs, and Bioproducts, respectively. The actual experiments are small 1.25m pods. To run an experiment, you connect an experimental pod to a ship with the necessary facilities, hit \u0022Start Experiment\u0022 on the facilities, and wait (for a long time, the idea is that you\u0027re doing other things while the experiments run). After the facilities have produced the needed resources, you right-click on the experiment and hit \u0022Finalize\u0022, and then you get the options to store or transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Konisforce","CreatedById":33343,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T23:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, just installed this one as well. I have a staffed Science Lab, and I just docked a vessel with the Plant Growth experiment.
