I have a craft that has perfect alignments of these 3 indicators but is still unstable in flight. Having a mod that shows me detailed info about my vessel\u0027s aerodynamics would help a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance and have a great day!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T18:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent question. \u00A0Here\u0027s a great one that expands the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E display to account for all parts, and also provides a graph window with a lot more info about stability:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130783-12-correctcol-v144-stock-aerodynamics-design-aid-looking-for-maintainer/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like just what you\u0027re looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martian Music","CreatedById":154849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T11:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks great!
