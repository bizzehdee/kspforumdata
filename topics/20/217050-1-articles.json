And if so, how can I merge a SR recovered stage with something that KCT has recovered? Or is that not possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-16T06:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSR doesn\u0027t recover to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
