Finally got bothered to trim it down a little and start playing again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my last playthrough, I had a massive infrastructure of satellites/stations/bases around the Jool moons system, and I really enjoyed setting it up. However, one thing bothered me a lot about it, which was the lack of destinations to set up shop on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 moons, even with two (Laythe and Tylo) proving very unique challenges I still found that I did not really want to expand much further because of the lack of destinations. I am playing with a few planet packs (OPM, GU, MPE) to try and make a larger solar system for me to explore but with little changes to the stock planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to have a mod that adds a few more moons to jool (not too many, but at least 2) to expand on my campaign, and try to make Jool more like Jupiter. I am aware that there are some mods that do this, but they seem low quality or outdated. and I have not worked on mods in months and I do not really have the patience at the moment to try and make my own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ask, as the title suggested by I expanded on a little too much: are there any mods to expand on Jool that are up to date and of high quality? Even if they are relatively outdated, or added as part of some other mod, I do not mind. I just want more places to expand my Joolian empire to \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAny help would be appricated, would love to get back into the game and have a few months off school now to game so it would be great to have a campaign going.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T09:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not aware of any mods that add more moons for Jool, but it would be pretty easy to adapt an existing planet pack- take something like XPC or Dwarf Planets Plus, then change the configs to put some of those extra moons or planetoids in orbit of Jool at whatever height and inclination you like; remember to change their descriptions too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meid","CreatedById":194760,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T16:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223981908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202649\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221622452556\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not aware of any mods that add more moons for Jool, but it would be pretty easy to adapt an existing planet pack- take something like XPC or Dwarf Planets Plus, then change the configs to put some of those extra moons or planetoids in orbit of Jool at whatever height and inclination you like; remember to change their descriptions too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did exactly this but with NH!
