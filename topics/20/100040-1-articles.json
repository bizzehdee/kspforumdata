OP\u002B aims to expand OPM by adding new moons and dwarf planets. As of the current release OP\u002B adds seven new moons and two new draft planets, increasing the challenge and the fun of KSP. \n\nScreenshots\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Some KUFO believers say that the small white dots seen inside the glacier are secret alien bases.\n\n**Lyvara**\n\nWith it\u0027s brown rings and a Mars-like surface Lyvara created confusion when Urlum was discovered because astronomers thought Urlum had a nose!\n\n**Ven**\n\nA rocky brown planet.\n\n**Kerlanes**\n\nMany years kerbal astronomers thought the newly discovered planet, Urlum, didn\u0027t had moons... Until someone started cleaning the lens...\n\n**Moons Orbiting Neidon**\n\n**Phal**\n\nA rocky planet.\n\n**Viros**\n\nMany astronomers think that Viros had rivers, seas and even oceans but for some reason the moon was flung out of solar orbit and captured by Neidon and therefore it\u0027s water remained frozen under the dusty surface..\n\n**Erfen**\n\nThis captured cratery moon was named after the kerbal god of ground, Erfen.\n\n**Dwarf Planets/Asteroids**\n\n**Klive**\n\nThis litle asteroid was discovered when the KSC decided to start the asteroid redirect mission.\n\n**Sisyphus**\n\nCurently this litle comet is the farthest known object in the Kerbol system.\n\n**Installation Instructions**\n\n1. Install Outer Planets Mod\n2. Install Outer Planets Plus into Gamedata folder\n3. Have Fun!!!\n\n**To Do List**\n\nFinish Biomes for all new planets.\n\nAdditional moons or asteroids?\n\n**Special thanks to /u/CaptRobau and /u/Eudae55 on reddit, for helping me with all the problems I had.**\n\n**License**\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nOuter Planets Plus incorporates the following mods:\n\n[ModuleManager (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCC share-alike license\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/31342-0-20-ModuleManager-1-3-for-all-your-stock-modding-needs?p=528607\u0026viewfull=1#post528607)\n\n[Kopernicus (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFree software (LGPL) license\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88168-Early-development-0-24-Kopernicus-Planetary-System-Modifier)\n\n[KittopiaTech (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCC BY-SA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68619-0-25-Plugin-WIP-KittopiaTech-Ingame-Terraforming-Tools-V0-181)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T21:09:12Z","Content":"Hey, I might be able to do this in my Kerbal Space Colonies series I am preparing for (filming to start if I can ever get OBS to record anything other than a black screen!)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T22:18:14Z","Content":"Part of this isn\u0027t even original.

The only planet in this that I actually like is Lyvara. Not only is it beautiful, but it\u0027s a perfect analog to the planned moon for GP3 that had rings."}]}
