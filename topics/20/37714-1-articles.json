I need some help, PLEASE. I am currently using this probe: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/interplanetary-mapping-satellite-v1-1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/interplanetary-mapping-satellite-v1-1/\u003C/a\u003E and carrying a RemoteTech Remote attachment as well as the extendable antennae and the RF one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent that up after I sent 4 probes up that had both RemoteControl and RemoteCommand modules on them, I thought that this way I could do both. Now I point 2 satellites I have on each probe, where ComSat I points to KSC and the other goes to ComSat II then that probe goes obviously one back to ComSat I and the other dish to ComSat III. And ComSat III would point back at II and also IV. I had this at an altitude of 2868.75km above Kerbin and in 4 quads around Kerbin. I saw no blue line pointing at anything, the only thing I had was my 5th probe with only the RemoteControl attachment that was closest to ComSat III and had a blue line to that device. Why is this occuring??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/01RABAZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/01RABAZ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for your time and help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T11:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA RemoteCommand module allows a manned spacecraft to act like Kerbal Space Center; the signal can originate there, so it has to travel less far and there will be less signal delay.
