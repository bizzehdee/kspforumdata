Once you\u0027ve got 2.0BG\u002B in there, it\u0027s likely to crash when loading the game.

Total load for B9, Firespitter, Quantum Struts, KSPX, NovaPunch, Infernal Robotics, KAS, and a few other minor ones now comes to about 300mb total, with about 500 or so parts. I\u0027m in the middle of adding Remotetech and Mechjeb capabilities, as well as re-balancing everything to be in line with Kerbal Space Program and not \u0022realism\u0022. It will be a tiny patch applied over everything that does the job, so I don\u0027t have to mess with licensing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, and intuitive reorganization as well (all RCS related stuff in Control, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue with mods in general has always been \u0022cheat creep\u0022, however modders choose to justify it. They tend to make the stats on their stuff \u0022just a bit better\u0022 than the base game\u0027s, leading to basically \u0022Why don\u0027t you just use a cheat code instead?\u0022 On the other hand, you have the reality buffs that insist on making things very hard on the general populace, despite having really cool stuff. Either way, not in line with the overall game vision. Then, after about 800 hours (so says steam) of using only stock parts, I decided to try mods. Dear god, my game designer instincts took over and I just started seeing potential everywhere. Three main issues crept in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Redundancy - Every modder and their mother needed to make their own fuel tanks, tiny landing struts, boxy looking probe cores, boosters, etc that all did basically the same thing. A helping handful were truly unique, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Balance with Base Game - Bearcat Boosters, I\u0027m looking at you...\u0027nuff said. Some things were obviously done to be creative, like Wayland\u0027s stuff which I love, but other stuff was very insidious in their monty haul creep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Feature Creep - Does every modder need to invent their own resources to do everything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing is that the biggest resource hog is KSP itself. Their parts alone take up 700mb or so, half of that number is internal cockpit components for your command modules. Not much I can do about that. Digging through the internals, my hat is really off to the B9 creator for his efficiency...his stuff got trimmed too though, mwahahaha...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, results forthcoming probably by this weekend. I worked out how to do the patcher to kill stuff. So far I\u0027m most of the way through the catalogue...1100 parts and 1.8 gb is trimmed to 500 parts and 275mb. A few mods were already so stripped that you can just download them straight without patching need (Kethane, for example). Other\u0027s, while beautiful, were beyond help (sorry Soviet Parts Pack and Kosmos Stations). There are also a few that I\u0027ll implement in the CORE Patch later as they become more mature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, hope that was a good answer. Now back to sorting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if anyone knows a way to get items to arrange alphabetically in the catalog without changing their folder structure, let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T16:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I delete a part in gamedata and I have the game still running will that be a problem?

I\u0027ve put a lot of effort into measuring the stock containers (pre.21) in order to maintain that my stuff is volumetrically similar to stock containers, but then trying to compare engines and mass/volume v. thrust v. isp @ atmo v. velocity and considering the volume density of the fuel it takes, it\u0027s all just a lot to consider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotokid600, when KSP boots up it loads everything it needs from GameData into RAM, this is largely seen as one of KSP\u0027s biggest problems.
