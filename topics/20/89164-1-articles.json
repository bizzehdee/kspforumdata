Please remember that when the game updates, the mod makers have to update the mods they made. The modding community has become quite large and quite a few mods are dependant on other mods. So in some cases, a mod maker might update thier mod but it wont be fully functional until the mod that the first one is dependant on is updated. We must remember that these folks are putting thier mod out there for free and are not being paid to do it. These guys are doing this because they want to. Most of them have families, jobs, and everyday lives just as we do. So give them a break and some time to get your favorite mods up to date. I\u0027m sure that a little patience and a thank you would be appreciated by them and would get you a quicker response than complaining that they have not updated fast enough for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027d like to give my personal Thanks and tip my can of beer to Squad and especially to all the mod makers out there for turning this great game into a fantastic game.
