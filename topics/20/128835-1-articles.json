When you think of a \u0022mod that doesn\u0027t work\u0022 you\u0027re problably thinking of a computer crash, a game meltdown ect. Me\u00A0and my mods have been getting along, but, some of them don\u0027t actually show up in the game, like the mod where you can build bases on Duna or other planets. When those mods don\u0027t show up, they start producing random module manager\u00A0things in my GameData\u00A0and then it starts to say that Mechjeb is not working and will not function properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts really driving me nuts right now(and KSP), have any of you got any advice?

You just have to do more reading of each thread you download a mod from to ensure compatibility and others. It\u0027s for the best.

One thing I do when I have problems with a mod is to make a new test directory with a fresh KSP install. Then load only the problem mod in the fresh install (with any needed support mods). If it still doesn\u0027t work you either have a bad install (forgot a needed helper mod, stuck something in the wrong place, wrong version, etc.) or the mod has a problem. At this point I go back and read the forum thread looking for posts of the issue I\u0027m seeing and double checking requirements. If the problem disappears you goofed the main game install or there\u0027s a conflict - again search the forum for clues as to possible conflicts.
