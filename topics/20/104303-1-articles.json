By this I mean wheels that attach directly to an axel, instead of having to have these weird attachment systems.\n\nI bet this would be a very popular parts mod. The current rover wheels are not compatible with many aesthetic aspects of car-like constructions etc. I myself have no skills in modding KSP so I am simply throwing this out there as an idea. \n\nMaybe it would be possible to make a few variations aswell. \n\n- A variety with no steering, with just a direct attachment to an axel.\n\n- A variety with just steering.\n\n- A variety with steering and an electric motor.\n\n- A variety with two attachment points so can be used as stack-connected parts. (Like double tires in lorries)\n\nMaybe it is easiest to make them into a single part with tweakable options, but these are the options I would like to see. \n\nAlso, if they could be made to look more like modern car tires..."},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T08:19:13Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen modern car like tyres on any real life rover. Regardless you can make a decent enough axle in stock by using one of the radial decouplers on the bottom of the \u0027chassis\u0027 and snapping on 2 girders and then the medium dark grey wheels. You then have the shock absorbers in the wheels plus the single axle roll that.\n\nI had a screenshot somewhere of one I made as I described. IF I find it, that\u0027s a big IF, I will post it.\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T08:52:25Z","Content":"Somebody made a [Muscle Car Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106003-WIP-Muscle-Car-Parts-Mod) if you\u0027re interested.
