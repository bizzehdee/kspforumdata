The altitude is available to a plugin - just a question of how to hook into the fairing deploy. The thing that would worry me is that I would be a bit off my planned accent and I would hit the planned altitude still under thrust and the deployed fairing wouldn\u0027t clear in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gribbleshnibit8","CreatedById":113278,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T03:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a plugin that does this for myself. I forget to use it most of the time, but it does work just like it should, I guess I could release it, I\u0027m just lazy and making forum posts and coming up with licenses and stuff is a lot of work. Also I usually just stick them in the staging for my upper stage, since deploying fairings while thrusting is usually a really bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
