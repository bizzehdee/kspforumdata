You merge the GameData folder from the mod with the KSP GameData folder and the mod is installed. The final directory structure will be: KSPdir/GameData/ModDirectory (**NOT** KSPdir/GameData/GameData/ModDirectory)\n\n* * *\nMods which don\u0027t have a GameData directory in the first or second level should be added to GameData instead of merged with GameData (so you end up with the same final directory structure as above)\n\n* * *\nModule Manager .dlls are the one mod that shouldn\u0027t get a folder of their own. They always reside in the GameData directory (eg. KSPdir/GameData/ModuleManager.2.x.x.dll)\n\n* * *\nSome mods also package installation instructions/readme\u0027s or have detailed instructions in the first post of the mod thread. If this is the case, refer to those as the way to install.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T03:12:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T11:37:06Z","Content":"How to install addons: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Addon](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Addon)\n\nIf you want a point and click mod manager, you can try CKAN: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T14:34:01Z","Content":"Good mods to start with?
