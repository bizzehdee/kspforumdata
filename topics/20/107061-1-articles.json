I\u0027m getting the moderators to close this thread.\n\nSo, I know there\u0027s somewhat of a light debate wether the MechJeb mod is \u0027cheating\u0027 or not. So here\u0027s a poll to figure it out once and for all!\n\nPersonally, I love the MechJeb mod. I believe that if it is to be considered \u0027cheating\u0027, than NASA has been \u0027cheating\u0027 for over 40 years.\n\n**BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO SAY I\u0027M BEING BIASED:**\n\nI\u0027m in no way trying to be biased in the poll.

If you are a new player by the time you should have figure out how to get to orbit then You unlock the node that lets mechjeb do it for you as an example.\n\nI do not think it is cheating, I use it to launch reliable proven launch systems, I still handle new designs myself or any launch that has an awkward or heavy payload.\n\nIt almost exclusively handles burns for craft with ion engines.\n\nI do use it for targeted landings sometimes, I usually do not allow it to land just get me close to the area then I take over. Just too many failed landings with it.\n\nIt also almost exclusively handles rendevous for me.

Cannot say how true this is, but you can also equally argue that watching MechJeb do something (like a launch or landing) can let you learn how to do it yourself or that once you already know how to do stuff it can be nice to be able to just tell MechJeb to do it for you since you already know how to circularize things.\n\nPersonally I\u0027ve been taking a different approach. While I like the idea that rockets can be automated (especially when using RemoteTech) I feel like there should be more involved than simply attaching a part and then having it do all the flying for me. So I\u0027ve picked up kOS and written my own launch program (and am in the process of writing similar programs for other common operations). I really like this because although I now am slowly building an autopilot (for lack of a better term) it is one that I have cobbled together *myself* using the things *I* have figured out, which feels much more like a real space program to me. It also gives me the opportunity to have realistic launch failures as a result of bugs in my code or setting parameters incorrectly (such as when I accidentally told my rocket to fly to an apoptosis of 100 meters instead of 100km). It makes my whole space program feel significantly more real.\n\nBut then I also keep in mind that different people are playing the game for different things. I want a very hard, realistic approach to the game and run mods in an attempt to achieve that. Other people are more concerned with simply building a thing and getting it into orbit. They just want to see it in action and are less concerned with the actual flying. And then there are people who are more into testing their own ability to fly something even - or especially - when things go wrong. As long as the person is having fun doing it I\u0027d say that they are playing the game properly according to their goals.\n\nSeriously, why is there this big argument over how to play the game \u0027right?\u0027 Is it that horrible if someone is having fun playing the game in a way that is different from how you enjoy it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:41:20Z","Content":"After about 100 hours flying ships by hand it gets boring, but the building of successful ships doesn\u0027t, so I fly mechjeb whenever I can, have flown waaay too much to keep doing it manually.

I believe that if it is to be considered \u0027cheating\u0027, than NASA has been \u0027cheating\u0027 for over 40 years.\n\nDrawing this analogy is a bit insulting to NASA, because, well, let me give two sentences:\n\n(1) \u0022This is my autopilot, I get the credit and the blame for how it behaves.\u0022\n\n(2) \u0022This is someone else\u0027s autopilot. \\*They\\* get the credit and the blame for how it behaves\u0022.\n\nMost of the time that \u0022cheating\u0022 feeling that makes the people who don\u0027t want to use Mechjeb choose not to use it is (2) above, but the position NASA is in is much closer to (1). When you say that people\u0027s use of the word \u0022cheating\u0022 is identical to claiming NASA has been cheating, you\u0027re downplaying the fact that NASA is much closer to (1) than (2). The AGC was a joint effort between NASA and MIT. If it didn\u0027t work, the blame would have been very much on NASA\u0027s head, because even though MIT did the all the underlying low level work, they did so to NASA\u0027s specs for what they wanted it to do, what math formulas it had to use, and so on.\n\nNASA\u0027s position these last 40 years is much closer to being a member of the mechjeb dev team, than being a player downloading the ZIP and installing it without ever looking at the C# code.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T07:45:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading**"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T07:44:34Z","Content":"I don\u0027t care if you use MJ, but the whole \u0022NASA does it\u0022 thing is stupid, NASA can\u0027t just download an autopilot off curseforge, they have to program them themselves."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:05:03Z","Content":"MechJeb is a tool, plain and simple.
