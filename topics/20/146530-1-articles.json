These just hack part CFGs and that\u0027s pretty neat. There\u0027s a similar Module Manager patch to add Burn Together functionality to command pods instead of requiring special parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to do this to kerbals on EVA? Enable Burn Together functionality for that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already tried EVA Follower, and this can be used to set kerbals on walking paths and such, but the following behaviour is odd where the following kerbal swaps between running and walking when the leader is always running. And there\u0027s wanting to be silly, like putting several kerbals into a marching division or dance troupe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
