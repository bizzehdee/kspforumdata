My favourite fairing mod is Procedural Fairings, but until it is updated I could do with an alternative for 0.625m fairings so that I do not have to assemble a makeshift substitute using tweakscaled radiator panels every time I want to launch a small rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesecake","CreatedById":138400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-14T08:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t PF work in 1.6.1 without an Update?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-14T08:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I have not tested it. But typically I have found that mods can cause issues if you use them in the wrong version (i.e. 1.5 mods in 1.6, not so much for things like 1.6.0 mods in 1.6.1) so I generally wait for an update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-14T09:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: I tested Procedural Fairings; it does appear to work in 1.6.1.
