I recall once seeing a mod part that was similar in function and style but designed for larger parts. I can\u0027t seem to find where it was - doesn\u0027t look like NovaPunch or KW had it. I recall that AIES had some new decouplers but I can\u0027t imagine why they\u0027d need a real big one. I want the SRBs to be more or less flush to the fuel tank, but still decouple properly. The hydraulic manifolds don\u0027t let me mount them properly unless I put a couple of struts near the nose cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny recommendations for the ideal part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T06:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENovapunch has a low-profile radial decoupler.
