You\u0027re looking at physical RAM. Each Windows process also has an allocation of \u0022virtual RAM\u0022. Because of the limits of 32-bit architectures, KSP can only use 4GB of virtual RAM, no matter how much physical RAM is in your PC. And that 4GB has to include all of Windows that\u0027s currently loaded into memory, too, so as someone else said, under older versions of Windows the actual amount available to KSP could be as low as 2GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Task Manager, look at how much memory the \u0022ksp.exe\u0022 process is using.
