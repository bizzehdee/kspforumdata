Just waiting 1 month is a bit short and impatient. But what has forced the issue is the fact that the release of KSP 0.23 requires changes to the mod\u0027s code. At the moment any new users trying to pick up the mod can\u0027t. Unless they have a version of KSP 0.22 around they\u0027re out of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inability to ask the author if he\u0027d like to come back to it later, combined with the fact that the 0.23 update broke the mod, means people in the user community are starting to provide their own splintered forked compilations of the plugin DLL, not on Spaceport, but on their own personal shared cloud drives. There are a number of personal forks of the project on Github and a number of pull requests for getting some bug fixes back into the main release of the code, but with the original project admin gone, they\u0027re going unanswered and nobody else has the authority on github to bring the pull requests into the master branch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s looking like the time may have come for the user community to fork a new \u0022official\u0022 branch of the code, put it under someone else\u0027s control, and release a sort of \u0022community-made\u0022 release of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegally, given the open source license that was used, this should all be just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m also concerned about politeness to the original author, and proper respect. Hijacking a project feels a bit rude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave there been other mods that have had the user community take this step, and if so, what is the mechanical process involved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get releases onto Spaceport, does the forked mod need a new name because the existing Spaceport page for it is owned by the original author?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T13:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll reply since at one point I had a new tread for MechJeb while r4m0n was away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 month is bit short if he said he was busy IRL, but as you said .23 is out and the project needs some focus. His profile says he hasn\u0027t been on the forum since the 3rd of November, so it\u0027s nearly 2 month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to be sure you\u0027ll stay on the project quite some time and be prepared to spend a lot of time on the mod. I don\u0027t play much since I started working on MJ. Some user may help you but you need someone to manage the patch submission, bugs and choose where the project is going. If you feel up to it then make a thread, make your intent clear and be prepared to step down if the author want his project back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about the licence. Be wary of the licence on included part (if any) since most licence only cover the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor spaceport you can contact the forum mods once you fork is established, they can do things there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly if you don\u0027t try to make it look like you are the sole creator of the code I don\u0027t see why the original author would fell bad. But YMMV\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
