I have thoroughly enjoyed the game thus far. My excitement at landing on the Mun was (I am sure) almost as sincere as NASA scientists watching their Apollo mission do the same. But, I have reached the point of frustration with KSP that is now ruining the game for me. Perhaps I am too stupid to figure out how to do this. I have watched every Scott Manley video known to mankind many times over and can still not master the seemingly simple act of syncing orbits and docking. I would really like either the Devs or a fan to develop a MOD that allows auto-piloted controls to conduct tasks like orbital sync and docking or at least get me in close. Seriously if I concentrate any longer on how to sync and dock I think my head might explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of any MODs in development or out there that can do this?

The actual altitudes make little difference, just the difference between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship in the lower orbit is going to catch up to the one in the higher orbit. So, if you want to fly ship A to dock with ship B and A is behind B in their orbits, then A needs to be lower than B. If A is ahead of B then it needs to be higher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any point in your orbit, burning prograde or forward will raise the orbit on the other side of the planet. Burning retrograde or backward will lower the orbit on the other side of the planet. So you use that to adjust the orbital altitude. Keep in mind that once your orbit is non-circular, it will be very important \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhere\u003C/strong\u003E you burn to raise and lower your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get those circular orbits within a couple kilometers of each other, then you \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E eventually get close enough to rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s the part that will take some practice, and again you can do it without MechJeb of you want to learn without any help. You have selected the ship that you want to dock with and your orbits are where you want them. Accelerate time until they\u0027re almost even with each other in their orbits. It \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E happen if you did the first part right. Once you\u0027re close enough, you want to point your ship right at the other ship and burn. The number display right over the nav ball tells you surface, target or orbital velocity. Make sure it\u0027s set on target. Your relative velocity should be pretty low, probably less than 10 m/s. Your range will diminish slowly. You don\u0027t want to get too fast here. At some point, you\u0027ll want to null your relative velocity. When you\u0027re in target mode, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eyellow\u003C/strong\u003E marks on the nav ball are your relative velocity markers. Put your nose on the \u0022anti\u0022 marker, the one that\u0027s NOT the yellow circle but on the opposite side of the nav ball from that. Now when you burn your engine, your relative velocity should go down. When it hits zero, then you\u0027re not moving in relation to your target. Then repeat the process until you get closer and closer. Burn at your target, then in the anti-relative velocity direction and make your velocity zero. Keep your eye on the range to target, too. When it\u0027s going up, you\u0027re moving away, so you want to burn toward your target again. In that case, your relative velocity will go DOWN. Let it pass through zero and go back up to 5 m/s (lower if you\u0027re closer). You\u0027ll notice that in general terms, the prograde velocity marker should generally be near the pink circular target marker on the nav ball. Your velocity vector is pointing toward your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound this in Google image search:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nlhTi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nlhTi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll realize that as you do this process, the orbits of the two ships get closer and closer until they\u0027re identical and you\u0027re close enough to dock.

There is a rendezvous panel that has great info on relative velocity and how close you will actually get to each other before you start to move apart, stuff like that. PLUS you get a tool called Smart A.S.S. that will do all of that pointing at prograde and retrograde crap for you. Or you can just have it dock for you.
