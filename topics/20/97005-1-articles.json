I got the idea when trying to figure out how to make boosters separate better, and thinking that being able to make one separation rocket fire a second later, pulling the stage straight away, then pushing it over would be far better then having to fire all the rockets at the same time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther uses being staging complex sets of boosters, say have a ring of 8 srbs peal off 2 at a time instead of all at once, or even have them work like a Delta 2 and only light some at launch, and light the rest in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Remember how everyone was using tiny solid rockets to flip stuff over like the Brahmos? That would be easy to do with this, just have one rocket fire when staged, then the other a half second later, then the decoupler fires another second later, as does a rocket to pull off that bit that turned it. And all of this could be pre-timed, in one stage or action group, instead of the 3 you\u0027d otherwise need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T00:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmart Parts\u003C/a\u003E probably has the thing you\u0027re looking for.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T01:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ultrasquid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ultrasquid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmart Parts\u003C/a\u003E probably has the thing you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really doesn\u0027t, mostly by being limited to having every set of actions needing a stage or an action group, my way would be simpler, and have no new parts, and thus use less memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T21:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;mostly by being limited to having every set of actions needing a stage or an action group, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is that an problem?
