If i could do all of those things could it be possible to add textures/models to spawn in so i could have a cow shaped asteroid. and if all of this is possible how hard would it be to create a mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni wrote this in 2 minutes please don\u0027t yell at me for the grammar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-09T15:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2020 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by epicfailure2020\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-11T01:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204652-epicfailure2020/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204652\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204652-epicfailure2020/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@epicfailure2020\u003C/a\u003E No mod can be made that lets you spawn and despawn planets mid-game. The way KSP was built absolutely does not allow that.
