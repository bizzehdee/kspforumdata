Does anyone know of a mod that re-textures the fuel tanks and engines back to what they looked like originally? Stats are all the same on them, and the new fuel tanks stay the same. The only thing that changed is the look of the fuel tanks that we had originally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fiddlestyx","CreatedById":57329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T19:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is what you\u0027re looking for (it doesn\u0027t re-texture any thing) it puts the original parts back in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts don\u0027t appear in the new career mode, I\u0027ll update it eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/original-ksp-parts-6/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOriginal KSP parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
