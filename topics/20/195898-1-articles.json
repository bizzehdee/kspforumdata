Personally, I never got to take a proper look at GPO\u0027s planets and moons, but it sounds pretty cool. Four new habitable worlds and a beautiful protostar? Count me in, that is if...\u00A0 \u00A0 it were to work properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have heard that GPO no longer works on the latest version of Kopernicus. I tried it out anyway on my copy of KSP 1.8.1, with Kopernicus and KittopiaTech 1.8.1-1 with Beyond Home installed. I modified Gaia\u0027s config to make sure that it wouldn\u0027t become the homeworld and I edited its moons\u0027 orbital properties to make sure that it orbits Gaia and not a renamed Kerbin with Gaia\u0027s properties. I also reparented Dread, Dres\u0027 GPO moon, around Olu\u0027um on the opposite side of Telos\u0027 orbit. And it still didn\u0027t work. I then temporarily deleted my save and Beyond Home, and it failed to load when it was loading one of its Scatterer sunflares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I want to know; why does this wonderful mod no longer work with KSP 1.8.1 and Kopernicus 1.8.1-1? Did something change with Kopernicus in the versions after GPO\u0027s last update? Did something required in GPO\u0027s supported Kopernicus versions get removed in the newer versions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone can tell me why Gameslinx\u0027s Planet Overhaul no longer works on KSP 1.8.1, please inform me. Any support is greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
