So I\u0027ve added KAS so I can repair minor damage in space, Interstellar mod to give me a reason to have space stations (even though the warp drive seems highly unappealing to me) and visual enhancements to give Kerbin a nice shiny new look. The only problem is I still don\u0027t have any new Spaceplane parts to play around with. I was considering the ones included in B9 that Scott Manley uses but I can\u0027t find an updated version for .23.5, probably because some of it is now stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would be a good mod to look at for adding spaceplane parts? I\u0027m mostly interested in getting my hands on some sort of cargo bay that Manley has been using in his Interstellar series so if anyone knows of some with a working cargo bay compatible with .23.5 I would love to know!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T13:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to General Add-on Affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautical","CreatedById":75532,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T13:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoved to General Add-on Affairs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops sorry about that, forgot the forum has a special section for mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T14:06:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use b9 first install it and then use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66020-B9-0-23-fixes?p=907484\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post907484\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethese fixes\u003C/a\u003E.
