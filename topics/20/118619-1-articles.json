I thought it would be useful to put this one at about 450km polar, so that it also extends the Kerbin relay network... but I wasn\u0027t actually expecting the contract to complete because Minmus disappeared behind Kerbin during the 2 day smoke test, yet it did succeed. (I had expected that I\u0027d have to orient my polar orbit so that it had 100% visibility of Minmus during the testing period, but that this visibility would eventually decay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m confused, I thought all comms had to have line of sight which is broken by planets. How come I was able to fulfil the Minmus dish contract even though Minmus went behind Kerbin? If so, what\u0027s stopping me from just putting a dish on the launch pad and pointing it at Minmus?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T17:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe contract doesn\u0027t care about LOS.
