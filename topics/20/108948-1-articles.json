How would I go about swapping out existing textures for my own? Namely I\u0027m looking to alter the planet textures to something a bit more exciting. I\u0027ve dug through the root files but I\u0027m not finding them- I imagine they\u0027re packed inside a compressed file? I\u0027m not sure where to begin. A little help/advice would be awesome of you guys-\n\nThanks-"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:52:05Z","Content":"Everything you need to know:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107471-0-90-TextureReplacer-2-1-2-new-thread-the-old-one-is-broken](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107471-0-90-TextureReplacer-2-1-2-new-thread-the-old-one-is-broken)"}]}
