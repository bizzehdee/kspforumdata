I have been using Mech Jeb to help me get the feel of things without getting too frustrated. So, I enter the Mun sphere of influence and my flight path shows me that I will either crash onto Mun, or slingshot round it and escape its influence, depending which of my attempts I am looking at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that I cannot engage the attitude controls - pitch, yaw and rotation. They work fine in orbit around Kerbin, but by the time I get to Mun, having used Mech Jeb Manouevre Planner to plot and execute, they are ineffective. The instruments in the bottom left of the screen reflect that I am pressing the right keys, but the craft itself remains resolutely motionless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had a good look round Mech Jeb, but I cannot, for the life of me see where to restore manual attitude control to my keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I must be missing something that should be obvious....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be grateful for any pointers.
