From in space, some textures are low-res and/or blurry. The ocean floors of Eve, Kerbin, and Laythe are made of\u00A0random noise instead of realistic trenches and ridges. Etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I do not expect the devs of KSP 1 to redo the stock system (they did a great job, don\u0027t get me wrong!), I am curious to see what the community can come up with. Maintaining the fundamental aspects of the celestial bodies, how much can we improve the \u0022base game\u0022 experience?
