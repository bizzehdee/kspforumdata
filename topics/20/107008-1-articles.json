However initializing the turn consistently is difficult. I think a tool that allows you to initialize a rate of pitch would be immensely useful for consistent launching. \n\nIt could come in the form of a rate of pitch read out, or an automated thing with several pitch programs saved for different rockets. \n\nThis would pretty much become one of those \u0022essential\u0022 mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Scientist","CreatedById":129760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:12:03Z","Content":"sounds like mechjeb"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:55:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E sounds like mechjeb\n\nI thought mechjeb was an autopilot."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:08:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I thought mechjeb was an autopilot.\n\nIt is.
