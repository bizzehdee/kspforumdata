Apparently SQUAD is upgrading to the new Unity 5 and that\u0027s going to cause armageddon for mods, I guess? I\u0027ve finally got all my mods installed and updated, a little time on my hands, and I\u0027m ready to play a serious career, but now I\u0027m afraid everything is going to go kabloie in a week or two. Should that be an actual concern? I know when I updated from .22 to .23 my KSS spontaneously exploded. Will I be able to wait for everything to update and then continue playing or will I need a new save for every update? If we can continue to use our saves after an update, will the following plan work so I can continue playing while waiting for mods to update?\n\n1. Make a copy of my KSP folder and put it somewhere away from Steam. Play from there. \n\n2. Continue to update the KSP folder in steam and update all mods etc. \n\n3. When everything is updated, make a copy of my save folder and move it over to the updated KSP (in steam) and continue playing? \n\nIt seems like that should work, and even if it doesn\u0027t, I can continue playing the non steam version as long as I like. Is that true? Anyone ever tried this? Does it work?"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:03:13Z","Content":"You are misinformed, 1.0.3 will not have unity 5 update. Expect 1.0.3 very soon, expect the unity 5 update within the next couple of months. 1.0.3 likely won\u0027t break anything, unity 5 will likely only break plugins and part mods with wheels.\n\nI\u0027ll also tell you what I tell everyone who complains the updates break their save files. I\u0027ve had the same save file since 0.18 and it still works fine, so the myth that any of the updates definitely break save files is unfounded."},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:55:31Z","Content":"\u003E I\u0027ll also tell you what I tell everyone who complains the updates break their save files.

I think my station blew up because I didn\u0027t know Steam had automatically updated my KSP. So, I was using KSP .23 without knowing it and all my mods were still for .22. There was a conflict and wham! No more station. Hopefully AVC should at least prevent that from happening again.\n\nHave you had any problems with save games where a mod wasn\u0027t ever updated again or you had to remove a mod because of a conflict between a new version and an old mod? I would imagine that could cause a serious issue. But maybe I\u0027m wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:21:43Z","Content":"It\u0027s not a serious issue, at the most you\u0027ll lose some in progress flights"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:46:50Z","Content":"@minwaabi: Your steps 1-3 are the insurance that will protect against major changes. \n\nI now have separate \u0026 independent copies of .25, .90, and will make yet another copy of the Steam-maintained \u00221.0.x\u0022 installation, when Squad announces that \u00221.1\u0022 is very close to release. KSP doesn\u0027t care what folders you run it from, I have run these separate copies / versions side-by-side, with no problem. \n\nOld saves in new game versions: I don\u0027t have any problem loading up .90 saved craft in 1.0.2, except for air changes making some of them difficult to fly ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) *However*, the big tech tree overhaul affected career games. Parts that were researched before, might be locked after. This can be worked around. Also, sometimes squad will change a part, causing weirdness. For example, in .25, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInline Reaction Wheel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was shrunk, and renamed to \u0022Small Inline Reaction Wheel,\u0022 and made less powerful than the Advanced Inline Stabilizer. [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/x1nFdfH.jpg) shows a craft created in v.24, and loaded into v1.0.2. It goes from VAB to launchpad, and flies looking just like that ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEchoing raidernick - 1.0.3 is expected to be a minor update, mainly small changes to how parts and craft behave in air. I\u0027m not worried. But nothing prevents us from making a copy of 1.0.2 right now, to be absolutely safe ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nv1.1 will be a major update. I expect saved game problems, for good reasons. Already they have told us in this week\u0027s devnotes, that wheels will be different, and in last week\u0027s devnote, that asteroids will be different. I would prepare for any craft attached to asteroids after the v1.1 update to look different, at the very least. Asteroids might be the same general sizes, but because they are generated with random surface contours, I don\u0027t expect the shapes to be the same; some parts or craft may be buried under the surface, or floating over it (Something like the reaction wheels picture, linked above.)"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T09:26:15Z","Content":"Or you know, deactivate steam automatic update of KSP ?

It used to be that that option only meant that Steam waited for you to launch the game before updating. You had to set no automatic updates \\*and\\* remember to always start KSP in offline mode. So I just checked. It still works that way but at least they say so now. The options are basically \u0022always update\u0022, \u0022update when you launch the game\u0022, and \u0022update first (before other games)\u0022. Or am I perhaps looking in the wrong place?"}]}
