I also have this odd feeling that \u00221 billion kN\u0022 aka 1 Teranewton (currently practically unmatched even in explosive/propulsive power) would utterly rape the rocket apart rather than propel it, this simply because 100 ms is enough to impart the massive multi-G forces on the craft, meaning the shock absorbing code must really work and really defend the craft, otherwise (this requires lots of testing as you mentioned) we\u0027d have to tone down the thrust but up the number of pellets, equaling the same effective delta-V, but more \u0022applicable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to do some math here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets use the Tsar Bomba (a 50 megaton nuclear device in its detonated version), producing 210 Petajoules, following W = N * m, we find that (using the bomb\u0027s length here as its the highest value in meters) 8 meters for m and 210 PJ for W (210,000,000,000,000,000 Joules) N = W/m so N = 210PJ / 8 = 26,250,000,000,000,000 Newtons, (aka 26.250 Petanewtons.) Seeing that previously 1 Teranewton was proposed, we overshot by x26250 using the Tsar Bomba, which weighed 27000 Kilograms. Moving onwards:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewtons: 1 Teranewton\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight of Charge: 1028.5 Grams. (if we use the raw weight (including shell and non-reaction-fuel components of the Tsar Bomb))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA charge weight of 1 Kilogram is very low, as well as the fact that nuclear reactions due to their chain-reaction nature are exponential, especially when uncontrolled, meaning we must increase charge weight to 10 Kilograms, while keeping an output of 1 Teranewton. Lets do more math:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming our charge is cylindrical, 50% of it is immediately lost (if it isn\u0027t a shape charge) because its facing away from the craft. A further 17% (50/3) are lost because, while pointing at prograde, the blast expands without touching the blast shield. Another 17% are lost because while hitting the blast shield, the angle isn\u0027t sufficient to impart acceleration and instead imparts rotary force. Of these lost 17% roughly 66% (meaning 11% of the initial charge power) is recovered, due to the blast being layered by later arriving particles and trapping those particles which were initially to bounce off. This leaves us with 0.27 (27%) of the previous Teranewton, lets apply a final bit of math to find out final imparted prograde force:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.27 * 1,000,000,000,000 = 270,000,000,000 = 270 Giganewtons of force slamming the blast shield. Due to the shock absorbing assembly and the blast shield, effectively 50% of this is lost, because the force is simply terminated via hydraulics and springs. This leaves us with 135 Giganewtons reaching the tip of the spacecraft. Now these are Earth Proportions, so we must reduce them properly to Kerbal Proportions (aka 1 Real Meter = 10.63 (simplified 10) InGame Kerbal Meters), this means we must divide by 10:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.5 Giganewtons are imparted on the ship effectively. In Kerbal Proportions the empty ship would have 10,000 Tons, meaning our thrust weight (calculated in KiloNewtons to Tons, like the game does) lies at 13,500,000 / 10,000 = 1,350. This is unrivaled and in the ranges of x1000 to x250 of most KSP craft currently even able to be created. However, 13.5 GN and 10 Kilotons of weight really push the engine to its limits, as these numbers are gigantic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR = TWR of 1350, Pushing the game beyond its limits probably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//Just a brief note, the top of this reply post is so short because half of it got deleted due to a browser crash, if you want a more formulated opinion please request it, as I couldn\u0027t be forced into rewriting everything.

It will never be capable of FTL, because the energy cost is far too prohibitive, scaling with ship mass and the requested delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe warp field generator simply changes it\u0027s own mass at a constant draw to electric energy. Also a somewhat prohibitive cost, which scales with ship mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to use either of these is with a pile of batteries and solar panels, which would probably be torn off if used in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, seeing as how I actually thought of official names after I posted, I\u0027ll share those:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IVM will be called a Ship-Wide Inertial Field Transformer, SWIFT. The energy cost for a change in velocity (either positive or negative) is at least abs( shipmass * requested dV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe warp field generator will be called a Higgs Field Gradient Generator, HFGG, since it is directly changing it\u0027s own mass. The energy cost per second of doing this will probably be (|new mass| \u002B 1) ^ ln(|shipmass| \u002B 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also make an absurdly powerful Ion thruster that works on it\u0027s own (sans-plugin file), if you\u0027d like, but it looks like someone else above has already started on one. Once again, I\u0027m just dipping my toes into plugin programming, and changing velocity and a part\u0027s mass is easy enough, but also has interesting consequences on play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T22:15:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ummwut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T22:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, what about a O\u0027Neil cylinder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a huge (15 miles long) cylinder that rotates slowly to generate gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/5987/neilcylinder.png\u0022 alt=\u0022neilcylinder.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4420/neilcylinder2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022neilcylinder2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
