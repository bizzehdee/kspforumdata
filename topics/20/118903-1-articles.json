However, when making a vertical landing with a horizontally-oriented (airplane-style) cockpit, you can\u0027t see the prograde/retrograde markers because they\u0027re at the top of the ball and you\u0027re looking at the side. Being able to see your lateral and longitudinal drift rates would make IVA-only landings a lot easier. The Apollo LEM had something like this, showing two crossed lines that could be centered to zero out the horizontal velocity, but I\u0027m having trouble finding a good picture of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of an existing mod that adds a UI window or IVA prop that does this? I\u0027m pretty sure RPM \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Edo this, but I\u0027d rather not recreate the wheel if someone has already done it, especially considering I currently know next to nothing about RPM and IVA development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T13:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
