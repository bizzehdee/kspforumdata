I take my hat off to all of you - but it is completely beyond me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of features I thought of that I would really like to see...I\u0027m going to list some ideas below and I was wondering if you could point me in the direction of a mod that already does it, or in the perfect world help me create it (lots of hand holding and full credit goes to you of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my ideas. (Please feel free to add/critique as you see fit or ideally tell me if it is possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Pilot Progression System - Pilots and crew need to complete a sub-orbital flight and reach Level One to earn their \u0022Kerbonaut Status\u0022 before they are allowed to pilot a rocket in orbit. (I\u0027ve been roleplaying this with the OMSK Redstone :-) ). Pilots can be assigned to positions depending on their experience (Pilot, Command Pilot, Mission Commander) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Awards and Accolades. I know Final Frontier does this but I was reading the Wiki entry on John Glenn and followed the link to the NASA Awards page and realised there are quite a few medals available for Astronauts. Whilst Jeb was my \u0022First Kerbal in Space\u0022 I don\u0027t think he should get a ribbon for it...rather a separate accolade and keep the ribbons for the really Epic stuff, like completing his tenth successful mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Perhaps linked to items 1\u0026amp;2 - a detailed Kerbonaut record that is viewable in game. I would love to know that Jeb served as \u0022Pilot on Kerbal One\u0022 or that Bob served as \u0022Mission Specialist on Kerbal Two\u0022 - again Final Frontier does this but I would prefer something more in-depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)Meaningful Part Testing - getting contacts to \u0022kerbal-rate\u0022 my new rocket design. So like \u0022Test the Launch Escape System on Kerbal One\u0022 or \u0022Complete unmanned Orbital Flight on Kerbal 2\u0022 before Gene will sign off on launching Jeb into space on top of a firework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Programme Contacts - like \u0022Project Mercury\u0022 Contract to complete X number of sub-orbital and orbital flights before contract is fulfilled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse my wittering, but I have no idea where to begin building all this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or advice would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T12:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor #4 check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109901\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETestFlight\u003C/a\u003E.
