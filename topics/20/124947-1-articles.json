Matching)","CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:41:20Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, my name is Stone Blue, I have OCD, and I am a KSP mod hoarder... \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had a spreadsheet going, which I have been using to keep track of mods that I use, or find interesting, since before KSP v0.25. This is by NO means a complete, all-inclusive list. This is MY personal list, so there will be lots of popular mods NOT on here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince, I, and it seems many others still play older versions of KSP, I\u0027m getting caught up on an updated list for every version of KSP from 1.0.5 to 0.25, that has the most recent (last) versions of mods for each version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also wait a month or two after each KSP release, for mods to catch up to the new release, before I start playing the new KSP version. It makes for a lot less broken saves and crashed games. Instead of scrambling around every few days as modders hurry to push working mod updates, I update my list. Once the dust settles after a few weeks, and everything tends to stabilize, THEN I will have a nice organized list to quickly work thru for getting STABLE, mod updates for the new version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play heavily modded, and \u0022collect\u0022 every version of every mod on this list, and then some... That makes it difficult to keep track of mod updates \u0026amp; new releases. It especially gets crazy when a new version of KSP drops every few months...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I get it completed, it will make it easier to keep track of mod updates as I jump from each current, to each next future KSP release. It will also help me clean out (delete) lots of old, unnecessary .zips, and make it so I have (hopefully), only the latest copy of each mod, for each version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I would share it, not only because there are a lot of \u0022odd\u0022, unknown mods that get little love, that people might like, but mainly as a spreadsheet people can download it if they want, and use it as a template of their own, and add or delete the data as they wish, to keep track of the mods THEY use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0in;line-height:100%;\u0022\u003E\nSo here it is. I have just over 600 mods on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YKIhbzB.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YKIhbzB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, its gotten bigger and bigger, and its now WAY too much for me to keep current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had previously posted it, and had some offers to help maintain a live list. At the time I wasnt sure it was a good idea. I guess I STILL dont know if it would be or not. But if anyone is interested in colaborating, please post. (Serious offers only though...This will take a bit of time \u0026amp; dedication)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this point, I guess I\u0027ll throw it out there, and hopefully get feedback on whether this is worth publicly maintaining or not. Feedback on ways to structure it, or to make it easier to maintain for private use would be welcome also. I\u0027m about ready to trash it, as it takes up too much of my time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know people who use CKAN, which seem to be the majority now, will probably see absolutely no point in this list, but maybe there are still enough of us holdouts to get some use out of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is downloadable, in case anyone wants to download it, and use it as a template and add/delete/maintain THEIR favorite mods privately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now its a bit of a mess. Anything with \u201Czd\u201D AND is highlighted green is pretty much up to date (within the past few days as of Apr 1, 2016). So use it at your own risk, ALWAYS check the release thread for the most current info. DO NOT pester mods or post on release threads about ANY information directly from this list (ESPECIALLY about old versions). PLEASE post questions, issues, noted discrepancies, feedback and opinions on THIS thread ONLY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also welcome feedback and opinions from mod authors on having this information publicly listed in one location like this. If any author would prefer not to have their mod listed at ALL, feel free to PM me and I will see its removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALWAYS, ALWAYS, USE YOUR HEAD, AND CHECK THE MOD RELEASE THREAD FOR THE MOST CURRENT INFO. ESPECIALLY BEFORE POSTING ON THE FORUMS THAT A MOD IS BROKEN, DOES NOT WORK, OR YOUR SAVE GOT DESTROYED. On outdated mods, 98% of the time, I bet someone has already asked/posted about any issues, so DO the research if you want answers!! That is what I created this sheet for: keeping links and notes that I\u0027ve had to dig up and/or research ONCE, so I dont have to keep doing it all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALWAYS make sure the mod version matches the KSP version you\u0027re playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed the links for direct downloads. Also, this is WIDE...It goes over all the way to column \u0022 Y \u0022...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now the DOWNLOAD LINK:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0D_PFGuuyqoS1d2eGs4a1kwd3M/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStone Blue\u0027s Top \u0026amp; Odd Mod List\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T17:49:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T17:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m reserving this post for future updates\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Partially updated list for Apr 01, 2016\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis does have mods marked as being compatable with, or being \u0022W\u0022-orked on for PRE-RELEASE v1.1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKeep in mind that the PRE-1.1 is supposed to be for STOCK bug finding first and foremost.

I suspect I am in a similar situation as you (hoard mods, organize them, although not in a master spreadsheet, just spreadsheets of parts, reorganize configs and file structures, etc), so I can appreciate the level of effort you have gone to, especially settling on a single organizational system. When I ever get around to switching to 1.1 (who knows when that will be), this will most likely be useful, and I will most likely make my own sheet to keep track of stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you open to feedback? If not, that\u0027s cool, since this is a pretty personal matter (organizational preferences). If you are, maybe make a trimmed down version for the public? There is a lot going on here, and it\u0027s clear that it\u0027s very individualized. I doubt the average user needs to know every revision or hand that\u0027s touched a mod (you or I might find it interesting though).
