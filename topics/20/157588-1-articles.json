possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter thinking on the subject a bit, I came to the conclusion that my ideal base construction mod would NOT be something based on any sort of parts themselves.\u00A0 Instead, it would be something that lets you build actual buildings (i.e. the same kind of object that the actual space center\u0027s buildings themselves are).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce a building is constructed, it could either be upgraded with funds (if on Kerbin/a populated world), or with some sort of \u0022Parts\u0022 or \u0022Supplies\u0022 resource (if on NOT-Kerbin/an unpopulated world).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt its core, it could simply be a mod that lets you build the Kerbal Space Center the way YOU want it to be layed out.\u00A0 You would start out with a single building that lets you purchase/place another building, in a vaguely sim-city style, where you want said building (in a career mode, the first one you\u0027d get would probably place would be the rocket launchpad, and some of the administrative buildings, which for purposes of balance would all cost 0 for the level 1 version).\u00A0 The starting building itself could be upgraded to increase the number of different buildings you can build.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA necessary aspect of the mod would be the launch button in the vehicle designer bringing up a short list of all nearby launchpads and runways (in case you decide to build more than one, such as having two runways facing different directions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother necessary aspect would be the ability to switch between different space centers, and a part that allows you to build the lowest level version of the building you build all other buildings from (in a sense, using the part places a new space center at that location).\u00A0 So you could build another \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on the north pole if you wanted or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, there would need to be a tag or value for a planet that basically tells the mod whether or not it is a populated planet, so that you can\u0027t just construct bases on other planets that work the same way that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E does.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, once you had this, the next step would be to apply it to other planets.\u00A0 On other worlds, instead of currency, there would presumably be some combination cost of ore (easy to get there), parts/supplies (have to bring with you until you have a building capable of manufacturing it from ore and energy), and in some cases construction time based on energy and how many kerbals are there to work on it.\u00A0 In the event a building is destroyed, it would leave rubble behind that you can select and repair for the appropriate resources, just like the default buildings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the mod were to just keep itself light, it could be that you can only build structures for things like hangars (buildings that store/unload a nearby vessel until you want it to be spawned again either outside the hangar, or at the base\u0027s launchpad), habitation (basically, like the training center except you cannot recruit new astronauts there, only store the ones you have so you can put them into any ships you take out of hangars).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted to go further, you can also have VABs and/or SPHs, which could only use parts that you actually have there, or which can only work if you have some sort of factory building to produce the parts there (the level of which could effectively correspond to what research level of parts can be used there).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could go on listing various things that could be cool, but I\u0027ve already rambled enough.\u00A0 Are there any mods that let you build actual BUILDINGS?\u00A0 Not just building-like parts, but true, proper buildings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
