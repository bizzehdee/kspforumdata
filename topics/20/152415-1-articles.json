Maybe I can increase the range and force of the magnetic like field to the equivalent of 1G. Also, what I meant by enabling friction was to just simulate friction instead of full atmosphere. Just slow down relative to target at a consent rate regardless of current speed. So I guess \u0022simulate a simplistic atmosphere\u0022 might of bin a better choice of words on my part. As for Kerbals walking around it would be nice, but I rather try to get it to work with crafts first before even thinking about Kerbals.

If your writing a plugin I would think you\u0027d be better off doing it from scratch - I don\u0027t think there are any insurmountable hurdles and you\u0027d have lots more control of how it worked. The detecting a craft and applying forces should be strait forward (famous last words) - I would think the trickiest part would be deciding how to calculate the aerodynamics in a reasonable way without recreating the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E plugin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T13:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222861621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152415\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479908174\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022120438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasml\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, wasml said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(famous last words)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
