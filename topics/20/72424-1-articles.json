Soon I will attempt a grand tour with VOID, Kethane, and LLL. Now, I\u0027m thinking of using KSPI for the thermal turbojets.

I\u0027d say you\u0027re cheating yourself out of the challenge. KSPI is firmly a career mode mod, meant to require effort from the player in order to earn themselves the privilege of using those very powerful propulsion systems. If you\u0027re just hitting up a sandbox to design a vessel, you don\u0027t have that progression, and the only thing that keeps you from slapping an alcubierre drive onto your craft is your own judgement. However, no matter where you draw the line for yourself, anything at all from KSPI is likely going to make your life easier at no drawback, because it\u0027s a mod entirely focused on giving you expensive, high-tech parts that make things easier. So you might as well not load the mod, if you\u0027re in it for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Of course, if you just want to make a cool looking craft to tour the planets with, go right ahead! KSPI is pretty good at that sort of thing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously Kethane also makes things easier, because you can refuel in the middle of the trip, which also removes the big dV challenge. However, at least Kethane requires you to put in effort - you need to plan your refueling stops ahead of time, crunching numbers to make sure your fuel lasts; you need to integrate extra components that reduce the vessel\u0027s dV instead of increasing it; and you need to design a reusable lander/miner capable of operating on all the refueling stops you determined are necessary (or carry one disposable lander for each), and then carry all of that along \u003Cem\u003Eas well\u003C/em\u003E. You\u0027re trading one difficulty for another, so if you\u0027re operating on a challenge basis, that seems like a fair trade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T10:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I the only one who would recommend the bigger nukes from KSPX and still think it is stock-enough to not feel \u003Cem\u003E\u0022cheaty\u0022\u003C/em\u003E? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T20:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the replies.
