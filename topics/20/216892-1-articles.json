There are also compatibility patches, which might be relevant if you are adding this to an already modded game, I think there is an all-in-one version called something like the \u0022Uber Paket\u0022, which should cover all bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that is all accounted for, and keeping in mind that I saw this error crop up recently, but only once, when reinstalling mods in different orders/stages (and I didn\u0027t actually have tweakscale installed at the time); I think you might be able to fix this by changing the order you install mod manager and any fix/compatibility mods you might be using (like KSP Community Fixes/Harmony/Patch Manager). Sorry I can\u0027t be more specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that isn\u0027t a quick fix; given that some of the mods I mentioned, or similar ones, might patch or add new files, variations on this theme might also yield results. In order of troubleshooting efficacy (though not necessarily practicality), I would:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCompletely delete your KSP directory (backing up saves you might want to keep, the main config if you want to save current menu settings, and any zipped mod installation files that you really don\u0027t want to redownload), then reinstall KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdding just TweakScale and it\u0027s dependencies to and unmodded game and confirming that the error is not logged any more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdding Module Manager and other patches/fixes to an install with only Tweakscale (and dependencies) installed, and running the game once to generate any patches, and check the log.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe above two steps but reversed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep searching the internet/TweakScale forum posts/github development page for any mentions of this issue, and try not to give up in exasperation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(Ideally after trying all the above) Report it as an issue on the development page/forum thread and hopefully get a solution or bug confirmation and fix.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard people claim, quite a few times, that some errors are fine to ignore. However, without confirmation of this, the least recommended \u0022solution\u0022, if you don\u0027t mind losing a game in progress, and the mod seems to be working, is; Hope the error isn\u0027t causing save corruption, and keep playing.
