Long story short every newer version of KSP keeps crashing 20-30x a day so I\u0027ve given up... even when diligently checking to make sure ALL my mods are up to date, or they claim to work with 1.0.4\u002B et all. So I\u0027m still using a backup .24 and it only sometimes crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to do is combine a model from kommit nucleonics and change it to be a variable mode Sabre engine with newer engine effects. I did my best to study the config file, copy/paste on a new part. I only changed the particle effects to something from the KSO shuttle and the variable fuel/air parameters from B9\u0027s sabre engine. What I got instead was a part I could not attach to anything, and visually it was fully encased in it\u0027s fairing shroud. I\u0027m also using Hot Rockets by Nazari.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for personal use, and not for any public mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to make this baby more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X7gpZB9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X7gpZB9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note. I\u0027ve got lots of thing orbiting EVE and Moho, they got there fine but after orbiting for 100\u002B days I cannot access any ships without the game freezing on me. When I load them from the starmap, I can see them but the stabilizing physics message appears in the corner and it locks up. This even happens when I try to use Hyperedit to move a small probe to either planet, they lock up too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
