At around 75% or so completion you should be able to find a spot in each deposit (all be it maybe not the best landing spot for each deposit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I dont think there is a whole lot you can do to direct the seed in how is spawns deposits....there are some variables, but nothing that allows you to say \u0027put X unit deposit at lat/long X\u0027.....not now, but I do think Majiir is working on a much more complex deposit generation system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, using debug to reveal deposits is NOT the same a scaning as it wont actually fill the hexes. If you had a planet fully scanned for Kethane and then installed another mod with resources you would have to rescan for said resource in order to get legit filled in hexes on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfaik, kethane only stores some kind of \u0022is scanned\u0022 flag per hex.
