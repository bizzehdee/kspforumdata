The team is currently working on some cool features regarding one of our favorite Celestial Bodies: Asteroids! As you know, before the \u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E, it was very hard to get an asteroid within the atmosphere of other Celestial Bodies, at least without mods or some sort of cheats. When Asteroids were originally introduced into the game, only space interactions were in mind, but that changed with the expansion as now players can easily spawn asteroids on collision routes with other Celestial Bodies. In light of this, \u003Cb\u003Ewe have been working on ensuring that asteroids behave properly whenever they enter the atmosphere of a Celestial Body\u003C/b\u003E, similar to a spacecraft. So far, we have added VFXs as they go through reentry heat and included explosion effects when they actually collide. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/ConfusedBadCleanerwrasse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECheck this Gif\u003C/a\u003E to see the progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThere is no mod but check the link near the end of this quote.
