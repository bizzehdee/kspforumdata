I do, however, have access to GIMP, and I was wondering how you do the same things he does but on GIMP. Does anybody have firsthand experience with making mod textures in this way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-10T22:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took a very quick look at Beale\u0027s site \u2013 it looks much like how I do things in Gimp - same steps, different interface. Unwrap the part, clean it up, export to a texture map that you open in Gimp. Paint the thing \u2013 layers are your friend! - and then export to .png for development, dds for final. You may need to download a Gimp dds exporter \u2013 at least I did when I was setting things up some time ago. I think DXT5 is used for UV textures and DXT5nm for normal maps (you might want to double check that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
