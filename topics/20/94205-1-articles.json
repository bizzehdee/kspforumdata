Because sometimes when I attach radial decouplers to a mod tank or booster, it doesnt exactly match up with the texture/surface of the tank. And when its not attached properly it will spin wildly, blow up, or not work all together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have thought that radial decouplers would be an automatic kind of thing to include with RADIALLY connected hardware. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But if you say that decouplers are finiky then I guess ill take your word for it.
