They just don\u0027t go out far enough to make the lander stable on anything but fairly gentle Munscape slopes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather not stick bits of girder all around to have the legs spread out farther.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has two 16K Kethane tanks side by side under a ReStock Bigger, Badder BiCoupler and will have the booster built down from two more of those under the tanks.

MechJeb wavers the throttle up and down during landing and after filling the tanks with hyperedit it can barely make it to a 15K Mun orbit and MechJeb won\u0027t shut the engines off completely at the end of circularizing. A sign it needs moar boosters . Will probably have to find somewhere to stick on more fuel tanks, which will mean the (completely untested) booster will likely need more...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first, it needs better legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSF77","CreatedById":88474,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T16:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInfernal robotics telescoping pistons, attach landing gear to those and extend them when landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T17:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy miners run into the same issues, so here\u0027s what I did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-mechjeb likes to be able to turn quickly, reaction wheels help a lot, but be careful not turn on SAS when docked in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-have you considered putting the 2 kethane tanks with two fuel tanks around a central core?

The fuel tanks are stuck to the sides of the kethane tanks. From above it\u0027s like an 8 with a smaller circle top and bottom (the drills) and smaller circles to either side of the upper and lower sections of the 8 (the fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 16,000 unit kethane tanks are just tall and when full they\u0027re heavy. I thought about laying them down side by side to lower the COM but given the problems I had with Large Rover built around one laying down tank and another with two 4,000 unit tanks in tandem (I tried assembling them *on top* of a Bigger, Badder, Bi-coupler with stack separators.) I figured upright and underneath the bi-coupler and making it a lander would be easier, especially for building the booster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
