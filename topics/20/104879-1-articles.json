[http://imgur.com/35Mk1QI](http://imgur.com/35Mk1QI) I took that picture from the YouTube video Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack but when I download the mod Kerbin looks nothing like it does in the video. I\u0027ve tried both Ren and Better Atmospheres and while they\u0027re both awesome mods I can\u0027t quite get Kerbin to have that deep blue look!\n\nI know it\u0027s possible to use \u0027Alt \u002B n\u0027 to edit the layers myself but I have no idea what I\u0027m doing so I\u0027m hoping someone can help! Literally all I want is that deep blue atmosphere look!\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T23:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DaveyLeo10**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T00:05:23Z","Content":"Scatterer.
