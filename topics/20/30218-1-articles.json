I ended up making a rover with all attachment options and then drove it off of the launch pad. Then I launched another one and drove it over to the first. This allowed me to play with and figure out how the attachment system worked. I found that the Kerbal carried attachment devices didn\u0027t always attach to parts. anyway, it was much easier doing it that way than in space or trying to figure it out after I created my awesome ship with attachments. I also managed to wreck my station when I retracted another section into it. It\u0027s not a foolproof, and shouldn\u0027t be, system and takes thought before just blindly attaching stuff to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for got the pic, thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slam525i","CreatedById":67543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T15:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem.
