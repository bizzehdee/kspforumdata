I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not alone in going OCD about the exact placement \u0026amp; angling of any lights I put on my rockets and planes. And then clicking launch, and timewarping into KSC night so you can check placement; go back to the assembly and adjusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat a few (dozen) times, and then even going so far as to be in LKO and you did a full hohmann transfer to your space station to refuel.... only to find out your lights are not angled quite how you thought. Due to not being able to check light distance while sitting on the launch pad, or runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.... any coders want to try figuring out a nifty lightswitch? Jeb accidently kicks the powercord to all those stadium tower lights or something... puts the whole assembly building into darkness, and you can finally adjust your lights to your heart\u0027s content without launching, and returning, and tweaking, and launching, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T02:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this still works but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84553-Plugin-WIP-0-23-5-DimmableVAB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84553-Plugin-WIP-0-23-5-DimmableVAB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T02:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that works, thats exactly what I was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanke, time to test it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T16:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell after extensive testing, that mod works. Sort of. After dimming the lights, I found I had to alt-f4 out of the game, so I spent large amounts of time idling until I saw an autosave notification. On the bright side, most of my existing craft that utilize lights did get optimized... to the current mark of whatever I\u0027m using. But I\u0027m sure within 4 months I\u0027ll need to retweak the lighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just sort of renewing this search, or if any experienced modders want to takeup updating the mod linked by tygoo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
