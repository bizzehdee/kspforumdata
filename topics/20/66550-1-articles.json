Let\u0027s say, that I have an unmanned craft going to Duna and I would like to go straight for the landing without any orbit insertion. How high should my Periapsis be, so that I could land without burning up and G-forces ripping my craft apart?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T14:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are talking about trying to come straight down and landing from orbit, you will have to burn A LOT of delta V to bring the craft to a stop and basically fall straight down. Even then I can\u0027t say for sure if your craft would survive the fall. Honestly Duna is one of the easiest planets to land on with an atmosphere due to its thin atmosphere. As long as you have a heat shield and a pretty conservative decent angle you shouldn\u0027t have to much of an issue with burning or G forces. The hard part on Duna is slowing down for landing without hitting the ground at 20\u002Bm/s. Most people use retro rockets and parachutes to land pretty softly on Duna. I used nothing but rockets, and I think everyone else had it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadRocketsCo.","CreatedById":101686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T16:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo no, I men\u0027t to aerobreak to slow myself down straight from interplanetary speeds to speeds, that are slow enough to not enter orbit again and land., kinda like Curiousity did.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-23T16:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2014 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BadRocketsCo.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T16:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can.
