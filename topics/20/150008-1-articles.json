I\u0027ve been looking to add another element of difficulty to my KSP game-play (career mode), but there\u0027s a lot of information out there and more than half is outdated. I\u0027ve so decided to start a new thread for the various mods to be discussed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally am looking for a nice mod that adds an extra layer of difficulty, but in a matter that makes sense. I\u0027ve looked into TAC (the most popular), but a lot of aspects just don\u0027t make sense to me. The tonnage of food vs. the time it last is off. The necessity of having a special module on aircrafts to convert air to O2 makes no sense, and it feels forced. The fact that Kerbels will die after 60 days of not having food, but only 2 hours of not having O2 or electricity is very contradictory. One aspect is too lenient and the other is too drastic. Lastly, the textures and sizes of the each compartment is just too off for me. I\u0027ve seen space stations that are taken over by the sheer amount of stuff needed to keep things running, I mean if the boys and gals at the\u00A0ISS needed the same amount of food the ISS would be twice the size.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther mods like Snacks,\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0just don\u0027t seem deep enough, but provide a nice starting platform to which you can other mods to round-out the experience. I think I\u0027m going to try SUI in combination with Ioncross and some sort of greenhouse mod next.

I never bother trying to create an ecosystem because, to me, that just defeats the purpose of planning and deadlines while adding additional parts. If you create a perfect ecosystem (power, LS, extraction, replenishment) every time you can easily create it for every random number of crew, begging the question of why you\u0027re using LS in the first place since it essentially has no meaning beyond a few extra parts; there is no risk of danger in that case beyond a busted craft.
