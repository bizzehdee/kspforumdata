Years ago (and I mean YEARS ago hehe) while playing some role-playing games and some combat flight simulations with a career mode in them, I discovered Symantec\u0027s \u0022The Norton Utilities\u0022 and with it, a HEX EDITOR. It\u0027s a powerful thing, the ability to edit hex data...one minute your pilot is dead, the next minute he\u0027s back in the barracks as if nothing happened. Was I happy? You bet. But in the long run, ending my campaign didn\u0027t feel as satisfying as when I finished it without Hex-editing my savegames. So I wasn\u0027t cheating anyone else--I was cheating on myself, and sometimes the guilt-effect of that can be as bad as cheating in a multiplayer game, or maybe even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut going back on topic, no, you\u0027re not cheating when you use mods in KSP because in the first place, there is no \u0022career\u0022 that you\u0027re trying to gain advantage from by adding mods. KSP is on sandbox mode and that\u0027s the primary reason why anything you add to it can\u0027t be considered as cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, MechJeb is a wonderful self-teaching tool--by using it, you actually learn the optimal ascent profile from a planet or moon, how to burn an eject properly, or how to land properly.

I think the simple answer is \u0022No, it\u0027s not cheating\u0022. There are many games where use of mods is generally a little frowned upon or considered cheating, but a poke around the forums will likely convince you that this isn\u0027t one of them. Indeed, moreso than most other games, KSP is actually designed for modding. The developers have gone to quite a bit of effort to support mods. Also, as it\u0027s not finished at the moment and clearly a little simplified compared to what the final vision will be, and it\u0027s in a sandbox state with no particular goals built in, I think that the use of mods is particularly appropriate in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always avoid mods initially, as I like to know what the vanilla game is like. But, mods can add an enourmous amount of flavour and depth to a game. They are also addictive (you\u0027ll start with one, and start to question yourself a bit after 20....), and will inevitably cause you some headaches, particularly when updates to the core game come out or when something unexpected happens. As other have mentioned though, mods can also ruin a game for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to have a good go at the vanilla game first. Then, once you\u0027re getting a little frustrated or bored, try installing a mod that will add some challenge or variety (like a parts pack, comms systems, oxygen requirements, or resource mining). Avoid the likes of MechJeb, that automate difficult tasks and make the game easier. Those mods have their place (e.g. to speed up testing of a difficult rocket design, or to give you an understanding of the general way to go about a launch procedure or landing), but if you use them too much early on you\u0027ll miss out on some of the sheer joy and sense of achievement that KSP has to offer, and that really is quite unique. The first time you achieve orbit, the first time you do a 3km flyby of the Mun, or land on another planet.... Those are moments when you sit back and feel proud of what you accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA friend of mine came over for dinner and to have a look at KSP and get pointers from me for getting to the mun (my most recent achievement at the time). I had a ship fueled up and waiting in orbit, and we decided hey, Duna isn\u0027t THAT much further.... ended up staying up until 3am in the morning. We really felt like the two of us were tucked away in a dark tin can in the loneliness of deep space, making some educated guesses on burns, timing, direction etc, a million miles from home, all the while wondering if we\u0027d just done something that would get us killed or leave us adrift in space for eternity. Eventually we made it after a very near miss with Duna\u0027s moon and barely a few drops of fuel left (Duna orbit that is, landing was a complete fiery failure), and what a sense of accomplishment in the face of adversity. You really feel like you could of been there with the astronauts on the way to the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t get that if a mod flies you all the way there hands free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T05:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just downloaded the B9 pack.
