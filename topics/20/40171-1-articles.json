So far, it\u0027s a nifty looking structure, symmetrical and functional as a fuel depot for extra-orbital missions. But what I\u0027m really missing, something that\u0027s essential to all space stations built in our own, real world, is the capacity for SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock science equipment is not that exciting in KSP - one can see the use for an accelerometer or a gravimeter at 100km altitude - less so for a thermometer, and let\u0027s be honest, a barometer is useless there. What I\u0027m looking for are suggestions for mods that would allow me to implement scientific capability to an orbital station. I\u0027ve found lots of interesting planetary science stuff, but that won\u0027t help me here. I\u0027m looking forward to an update of the Ordan telescope, and hoping I\u0027ll be able to mount the small one on my station as an observatory. Are there any other mods, plugins etc that would let me do more science? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T00:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33323-PLUGIN-PARTS-Development-0-20-tek-Industries-Science-v0-4-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33323-PLUGIN-PARTS-Development-0-20-tek-Industries-Science-v0-4-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno if it would work exactly for your wants but it could turn your station into a processing facility for collected samples.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T00:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will probably consider that once I get to the point where I\u0027m visiting other worlds - right now I want to start with science that I can do from where I am.
