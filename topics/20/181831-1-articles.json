I only knew the name of one, collide-o-scope, and the Github page had it updated for 1.5; I assumed it would sort of work. There appears to be a new two folders in the local files (plugins, plugin data) and i tried sticking the mod in them. It didn\u0027t work so I tried the old method with the Gamedata folder. That didn\u0027t work either; I\u0027m not sure which dodgy part is the problem and also not sure how to install mods now at all. Any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T19:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I can tell you is, if the mod worked in 1.5 I\u0027d be pretty hopeful it\u0027d work in 1.6.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd gamedata is correct...
