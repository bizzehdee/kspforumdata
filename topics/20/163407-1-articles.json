To prevent it getting overpowered, It would work like this: You enter size, propelant used, whether or not it requires pressurised fuel tanks (This would would be done with RF) Nozzle size, amount of time engine turns off and on (Or infinite) AND then using those calculations, it comes up with a range of thrust. You would select what thrust. Say, my pressurized, 0.5 meter, Aerozine and NTO burning engine has a thrust range between 5-20 KN (just an example) and I then select which thrust I want. from THAT, the computer figures out efficiency. What do you guys think? Can anyone make this?
