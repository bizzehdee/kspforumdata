You get your probe, Phile, and head down to the comet. You land, and bounce because of the low gravity. You land on the dark side, but you still landed. The excitement of landing on a comet for the first time! Wow, if only we had that in KSP. My request, is that someone add a comet or 2 to KSP. I\u0027d love that very much. If you can\u0027t do it, I\u0027ll do it, it\u0027ll take a few weeks though XD."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T22:40:06Z","Content":"Making a comet is easy, but getting the tail is what\u0027s tricky. The comet itself could be made using Kopernicus, but I have idea idea about the tail."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T05:55:15Z","Content":"Kopernicus contains KopernicusExamples archive, which contains Minmus Particles sample.\n\nColor, speed, density, direction, source points are defined in cfg file and look not much complicated.\n\nIt is better to watch this yourself than to describe in words."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T15:12:25Z","Content":"The coma and tail is just a very nepid atmosphere. It would be interesting to have a feature that increases or decreases the atmospheric density as the body\u0027s temperature changes during its elliptical orbit around the Sun!"}]}
