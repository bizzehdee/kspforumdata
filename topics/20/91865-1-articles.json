I have the very same problem and I was searching the internet for a solution or, at least, to check out if someone else had stumble on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I was able to figure out is: every time you load a save where the IR parts are moved from their \u0022zero\u0022 position you end up with that strange behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain the only solution to it is: before saving move all IR parts to their original state. After loading move again parts however you intend to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find a smarter solution PLEASE add a notice on this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"calut","CreatedById":131304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T15:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont think u need a rotortron for wheels.
