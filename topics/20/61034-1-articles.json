There are too many factors I think to say for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the craft while it flies is probably the most likely to be inefficient. You need to bring at least the Kethane with you, and the converter. And the drills unless you send down a driller that stays where you put it. And if you do that, then when you get where you\u0027re going you have this converter and kethane tank that is no longer useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally put a drilling/converting station on the ground and lift only fuel (and oxidizer) into orbit for refilling ships there. That way I\u0027m lifting the least amount of stuff possible. To me, that seems the most efficient way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you\u0027ve got the drills and converter running all the time so when you need to time warp for some reason, you can jump to that mining station and time warp there, getting the drilling and converting done while you\u0027d be waiting anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
