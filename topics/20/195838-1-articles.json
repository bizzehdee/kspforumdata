I seem to remember being able to do this back in the day, just as I can today with asteroids. This seems so backwards, as it\u0027s the engineered object whose \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E should be able to be known, while an asteroid\u0027s should be less certain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve considered options like a \u0022pull design\u0022 tug that could perhaps work, but I\u0027d still need to know roughly where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is at the time of attachment, so that\u0027s not my ideal. Also, I just feel like I should be able to know the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E of an engineered object (even if the engineers were kerbals).\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m open to other ideas and suggestions, but at this point I\u0027m wondering what would be involved in writing a plugin that revives this capability. I imagine the devs had a reason for removing it, so maybe there is some big barrier to success here, but it seems like it might be worth a try...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve written up contract packs and waypoint collections in the past, and have a bit of \u0022backend\u0022 experience, so something (seemingly) simple like this seems like it would be within my capacities. I\u0027m just not too sure where to begin. Any help would be appreciated!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
