Also this is more of a mod request thread then anything else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI propose a mod that does a few things, mainly to improve remote tech and the new satellite systems. But could also have uses outside that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would work like so:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If an object has a extremely similar orbit to another object (what the mod considers \u0027similar\u0027 could be tweaked till it felt right) the moment that the object loses focus (you switch to another vessel outside of the render distance) the objects orbits get changed so that they match perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I was going to have a few more points (stipulating that unless thrust was intentionally applied, the orbit would be reset back to what it was before focus was gained in order to avoid accidentally changing orbit while twisting or otherwise interacting with the craft in a way that doesn\u0027t provide force but changes where exactly the centre of mass is relative to the orbit) but I realised that 1 would more or less solve that issue anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have played around with making the mod myself but outside of some rudimentary dives into things like Lua my coding skills are sub-par for sure. If anyone could potentially make this mod, you would have my eternal gratitude because this seemingly insignificant details has frustrated the absolute hell out of me since I noticed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T11:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you want KSP un-realistic? cause thats how you get ksp un-realistic.
