Cargo modules hung off the left and right of the fuselage in big orange tanks (shielded from forward debris by the wide cockpit) and could be added and discarded as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole effect was a cross between 2001\u0027s Discovery and a freight train in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny skilled modders up to the challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can try to make some drawings of what I remember of it.
