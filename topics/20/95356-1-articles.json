Maybe tie it to the max quantity of Kerbals you\u0027re currently allowed too so that when you only have 5 available its maybe 3-4 days, but with a fully upgraded ATC its like 15 days or something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T11:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbonaught? No Kerbal? XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the down times seems like a nice idea, encouraging expansion to the Astronaut Complex early without artificially limit astronauts functionality like EVA (really, kerbals, you can\u0027t open the airlock without having a nicer building?). Also sounds more realistic.
