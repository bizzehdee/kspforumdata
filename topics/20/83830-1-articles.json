To micro-manage you would need to move ships around without having to fly each and every one of them, and therefore, the ability to automatically transport ships is needed, and a kind-of manager to keep a record of your ships and their movements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetails of the automatic transfer mechanic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a particular transfer available, you would need to \u0027prove\u0027 that the move is possible by doing the transfer yourself in-game with the particular ship first. The plug-in would also use your journey to set the start and end location and the duration-time possible for that ship. Once proved, you could schedule a transfer provided you had the ship available at the start location. Example of a transfer could be: [ship 1] from a [100km-orbit around Body A] to [200km-orbit around Body B] to start in [14 minutes]. The automatic transfer would remove the ship\u0027s physical model from the Universe while it was in transit, and then place it in its destination orbit once the transit time has elapsed (in this way the plug-in wouldn\u0027t actually manually move a ship like a player would).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyone doing something similar as a mod?
