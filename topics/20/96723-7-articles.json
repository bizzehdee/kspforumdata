With mouse and keyboard you have only binary inputs, deflect or don\u0027t deflect. So each time you hit W/S you create a perturbation. Planes are known to react to this with wobble.

Building a rocket is pretty easy. Slap on some fins and it\u0027s going to fly perfectly straight. If you are careful you can also launch crazy contraptions, which is hard. Building a simple plane, like a Cessna is very easy. Just copy an existing design. I mean, add wings, add tail plane, elevators, ailerons, vertical stabilizer, CoM in front of CoL - it is probably going to fly. Building a spaceplane that can carry a significant payload or building an extraordinary plane design is hard again. Build building a spaceplane in stock is also hard, so it\u0027s no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-19T09:36:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2015 09:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DaMichel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T16:35:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need fins.
