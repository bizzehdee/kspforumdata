And thinking about how you could do that without it being super complicated, it occurred to me that may be defining science as a collectible resource like Ore (and thus having locations for it defined by that sort of system) would simplify it greatly.\n\nYou could define \u0022resource maps\u0022 for each experiment, and then the experiments would have varying results depending on where it is. And it wouldn\u0027t be too intensive, as you\u0027d have large blotches where the results would mostly be the same for most experiments, with smaller blotches where the results could be of higher or lower value. Some experiments could even not have any results in a given area or they might be widely available but not very valuable on the whole, giving diversity and balance to experiments. This sort of system would work really well for things like surface samples, because then, depending on how far you can go with it, you could define your map as having small areas where you\u0027d have really high value samples with lower value ones surrounding it, basically giving you the system that the Geology mod originally wanted to go for. \n\nThe only issue would be non-surface experiments, but I would think that may be it could stay the same as stock, but just have values change based on altitude and possibly situations. An EVA/Crew report gently cruising at sea level would be different compared to a report while traveling a supersonic speeds 30km up. Same goes for a low versus a high orbit and so on and so forth. Things like a magenetometer experiment would be much more in depth if you could actually map out things like Van Allen belts.\n\nUltimately doing this would greatly enhance the Science part of the game, as then it would actually give more of a point to actual exploration rather than just to say you explored. It would also extend time spent actually playing on the surface of bodies (without being unnecessary tedium), which is something I think most players don\u0027t spend much time on. I know that my Apollo style surface stays hardly last an orbit of the CSM unless I\u0027m going for multiple biomes at once. It would be interesting to have to actually explore an entire crater to come home with a good science haul rather than landing, running and collecting the experiments, and then leaving all in 5 minutes.\n\nNow, I don\u0027t know how hard this would be to implement (or if it would even be really possible), but I figured I\u0027d share it. Its no secret that science in the game does leave much to the imagination, and while it certainly shouldn\u0027t be come tedious, it could definitely do with a bit more player involvement."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:37:38Z","Content":"Maybe you could make a massless Science! resource with a price that isnt funds, but science, and make pods/science bay tanks for that resource which are untweakable in VAB so you cant pay science and get science?
