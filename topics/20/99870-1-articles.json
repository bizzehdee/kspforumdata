However, in game, if I were to say, mouse over my apoapsis to see how many days it will be before I reach it, it gives me a number based off of the 6 hour day rather than the 24 hour one. If anyone knows if someone has found out to alter this, or can alter this themselves, I\u0027d much appreciate it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T23:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a setting somewhere for that in the options screen.
