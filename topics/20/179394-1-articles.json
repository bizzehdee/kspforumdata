Apologies in advance if I missed a recent thread about this, but I think it would be nice to have a mod that lets you toggle the autostruts on wheels and landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forced autostrutting on those parts can sometimes have undesirable side-effects, as many KSP engineers must have realized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think about this? Is it feasible at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaf\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-31T23:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere WAS a Module Manager patch to enable this. It doesn\u0027t work any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI spoke to someone who would know (and I can\u0027t remember who), and they said the ability to turn them off had been removed completely. Whether that was from the public API or the private code, I don\u0027t recall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I agree with you, 100%. I\u0027m still living in dread of the day when I dock some craft and they\u00A0catastrophically disassemble due to the Heaviest struts shifting targets. That, and designing rovers with body-flex and suspensions\u00A0was fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
