I haven\u0027t posted here yet, figured here would be a good place to start.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027ve been fiddling with parts a little, I figured out the workings of the .cfg format pretty quickly, it shares a lot of similarities with the JSON notation Starbound uses. What I was wondering was, how do I make a new part based on an existing part? For example, if I wanted to take the Quad Nuke Engine from ModularRocketSystems and create a duplicate version of it that uses LiquidHydrogen from NearFuturePropulsion, how would I go about this? Is there a way I can have the .cfg for the new part be in a new folder as if it was a part created from scratch and simply point to the model and texture from the original part?\n\nI imagine another solution would be to use modulemanager to make the Rocket be switchable between LFO and LiquidHydrogen, if anyone knows how I can do that, I\u0027d love to hear it, I\u0027d still like to know how to make duplicate parts though!\n\nLastly, I *would* like to learn how to make parts from scratch, I\u0027ve modded for 3d games before, so I\u0027m already familiar with the modeling \u0026 texturing aspect, but I\u0027ve never done anything in Unity before. I\u0027ve read over the \u0022Making an asset from start to finish\u0022 tutorial on the ksp wiki a number of times, and have seen a couple on Youtube, but I\u0027m interested in knowing if there\u0027s a good tutorial more focused on the unity aspect of modding for people who already have \\*gotten their feet wet\\* in the modeling\u0026texturing area.\n\nLet me know! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T07:32:21Z","Content":"on the cfgs... KSP will load a part for each one there is.\n\nSo as long as they have a unique name (in the file, not file name). You\u0027ll get a different part. I\u0027ve got a pile of cfgs in a folder of my own for re-scaled parts, ones that use different fuels, etc.\n\nThere is a cfg (several actually) floating around from Atomic Age and from NFT itself showing how to swap fuel types on the NTRs. I\u0027d take a look at those for inspiration.\n\nDoing the in game fuel switch requires using the firespitter DLL... I believe Nil2Work\u0027s orbital tug has a good example of how to do that (though his lets you do it during flight, not just in the VAB)."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T08:30:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For example, if I wanted to take the Quad Nuke Engine from ModularRocketSystems and create a duplicate version of it that uses LiquidHydrogen from NearFuturePropulsion, how would I go about this?

Crzyrndm, your example was very helpful, I was able to change the NFPropulsion patch for the LV-N atomic rocket motor to make it create a duplicate of it that uses LiquidHydrogen rather than an LFO mix. I do plan on making some interplanetary vessels propelled by LiquidHydrogen, but I\u0027ve grown fond of the LFO rocket motors, since I can repurpose the LFO for new rockets when doing extraplanetary bases.\n\nI have another question, where can I find the meshes/textures for the buildings/launchpad/runway at KSC? They don\u0027t seem to be in the squad folder as far as I can tell, but I\u0027m interested in taking a look at them so I can make something based on them. I\u0027m interested in making some full-sized stuff for extraplanetary launchpads for establishing big bases capable of launching huge heavy rockets. I still have to figure out how to make parts from scratch, and I figured looking at some assets from the game would be as good a place as any to start."}]}
