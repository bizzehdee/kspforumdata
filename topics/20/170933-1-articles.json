I do more and more hit the Lights-out-key (F2) just for clearer visibility when in the pitch black nothingness of space. I\u0027ve changed all mods that allows it from the Stock KSP UI to the Unity UI, just because of the brightness. And please, don\u0027t tell me I\u0027ve got to play around with my screens calibration; I\u0027ve got it just where I want it, thank you very much. I like it dark, it should be dark! And by the way, colour calibrated Eizo screen on 10 bit colour per channel should not be the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, which is more concerning the aesthetics than the functionality, I think that the UI has grown apart from the games graphics, in the sense that it\u0027s a bit too pastel coloured and playful. It should be more of a satire feel than a toy, in my humble opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I really the only one who feels like this? Is it impossible to mod the UI to look more like the Unity style UI?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBj\u00F6rn\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
