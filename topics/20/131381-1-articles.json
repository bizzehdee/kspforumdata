Part of the cost would be a base cost for the class, then there\u0027d be a cost per Kerbal, and a cost for the teacher. If you used your own teacher(s) you could eliminate that cost, and it was always most cost effective to put as many Kerbals into a class as possible. One of the original ideas was to have a test at the end (success\u00A0based on the Kerbal\u0027s stats), if they passed they\u0027d get the XP/a stat increase. If they failed they wouldn\u0027t get the XP but would still get a stat increase to help their odds next time. Now I\u0027d probably just stick to the \u0022take class -\u0026gt; get XP\u0022 method and not rely on (or change) stats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 is pretty easy. It\u0027s just adds optional benefits (maybe with a required \u0022basic training\u0022 course before a Kerbal can fly) that can reduce grind and would be great in a Stock game and alright for an\u00A0RSS game. The simple way of doing it would be to tie courses to specific planets/situations and just adjust the flight log, but keeping the experience separate from any situations is an option as well. It\u0027s a mod I\u0027d happily add to a save without worrying about it affecting my playstyle much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 is obviously tougher, both from a programming standpoint and from a playing standpoint. It sounds perfect for RSS but sounds tedious for a non-RSS game. Even if you go \u0022benefit only\u0022 with it, it\u0027s specific enough that I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d take the time/funds to\u00A0train people.\u00A0I love the idea, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027d use it personally and I wouldn\u0027t want to take the time to work on something I won\u0027t use (someone who does use it will do a much better job at it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of teams. I just started watching \u0022From the Earth to the Moon\u0022 and I can see why teams would be important. I\u0027m less a fan of retirement personally, but it probably wouldn\u0027t be hard to add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the problem: I\u0027m in my last semester of a Masters program where I\u0027m doing research and am a teaching assistant. I have to write my thesis soon. Time isn\u0027t something I\u0027ve got loads of at the moment, so I\u0027m not sure if I can devote much to something like this. I could probably crank some proof of concept stuff out this weekend, at least for 1, but I can\u0027t make any promise of anything over the long term. If it\u0027s kept simple enough I\u0027d be able to find the time though. I also start a new job in early July, but I think I\u0027ll actually have more free time once that starts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0isn\u0027t interested, and nobody else chimes in in the next few days, then maybe I\u0027ll play around with it this weekend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T23:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome interesting ideas, I really like this kind of stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222393946\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131381\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454618596\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, NathanKell said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Again, it\u0027s a question of \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E, and therefore planning. KCT is great about actually making you have to plan ahead for missions (and have nailbiting rescue windows, especially if you didn\u0027t keep a rescue LV ready). However, so far it only deals with the hardware, not the (as it were) software. Further, right now kerbals are fairly interchangeable, separated pretty much only by XP: there\u0027s no reason to not keep reusing the same kerbal over and over, and indeed (XP gain) reasons *to* do so. If you have to plan ahead and have kerbals in training, if you fly two LKO missions within a week of each other, say, you can\u0027t just reuse the same kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E re: automatic: see above for why that actually plays into the idea. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (Not for everyone, of course, but for those who do want the challenge of playing ahead, not being able to \u0022buy and fly\u0022 applies as much to kerbals as to vessels.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to punishments vs. bonuses: I agree that (stock-wise) the bonus approach would be better, but I \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E agree that it\u0027s very hard to find good, balanced ones that don\u0027t (hi VesselValues) change physics, for example.

And I think everyone in this thread is well aware that I like configurability, so I\u0027ll make it easy to define new courses through configs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding how the XP should work, I think having two options is a good idea: an option for \u0022raw XP\u0022 that\u0027s blindly added to the XP total after the career log, and a second option where flight experience is added to the log. So you might have a\u00A0\u0022Kerbin Orbit Training\u0022 course that adds \u0022Kerbin, Orbit\u0022 to the career log and a second course \u0022How to use a Space Wrench\u0022 restricted to Engineers that gives \u002B1 XP. The first course wouldn\u0027t benefit Kerbals who have been to orbit, but the second one would benefit anyone who took it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally there\u0027d be options to restrict courses to specific classes, prerequisite courses, minimum (and maximum) levels, whether it can be retaken or is a one time thing, expirations for the experience (I\u0027m a bit wary of removing data from the career log, but StageRecovery removes things from the Flight Log so it should be similar for the career log), the amount and type of experience, base cost/per kerbal cost/teacher cost, and whether the course is required before the kerbal is allowed to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think KCT\u0027s math parsing might be handy to use to let you hire a better teacher (at a higher cost) to get more XP without having a nearly duplicate course. For #2 it might be better to define separate courses though, unless the data that gets returned when you query a Kerbal\u0027s course history also includes the finalized course config (definitely an option).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a rough idea of what a course config might look like. If anyone can think of anything else you\u0027d want/need, let me know, but I think this covers most basic needs. The REWARD node could be fairly arbitrary so you could define your own custom rewards (for #2 it could be used to define the situations the course is valid for). Like I mentioned before, I could return the REWARD node when you query the courses a Kerbal\u0027s taken or I could return the whole COURSE\u00A0node, or just the course id.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\nCOURSE\n{\n  id = ENG101\n  name = How to use a Space Wrench\n  classes = Engineer, Scientist\n  prereq = BAS101 //basic training\n  time = 18.0 //total number of hours the course takes to complete (3 Kerbin days)\n  expiration = 180.0 //number of hours the class experience is valid for (30 Kerbin days)\n  expireOn = IMMEDIATE //when to have the XP expire, IMMEDIATE expires as soon as the time is up, RECOVER expires when the kerbal is returned to Kerbin (so you can finish the current mission)\n  required = false //whether to course is required before the kerbal can fly (ie, basic training)\n  repeatable = EXPIRED //can be repeated if the granted XP is expired (ALWAYS, EXPIRED, NEVER)\n\n  minLvl = 0\n  maxLvl = 5\n\n  costBase = 1000 //base cost of having the class\n  costSeat = 100 //cost per kerbal in the class\n  costTeacher = 1000 //cost of hiring a teacher for the class (can be mitigated by using a kerbal of our own)\n\n  teachClasses = Engineer, Scientist\n  teachMinLvl = 2\n\n  REWARD\n  {\n    XPAmt = 1 //RAW XP added to the total, independent of situation\n\n    FLIGHTLOG\n    {\n      //here you\u0027d define a flight log that would be inserted into the career log\n      //since this course doesn\u0027t use this type of experience, the node is blank\n    }\n  }\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273338\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_3\u0022\u003E@magico13\u003C/a\u003E yeah, makes sense.

Expiration blockers: Expiration will not occur if another course is currently on the list. Consider a Basic Orbiting course that allows flying a basic orbit, and then a Transmunar course for entering Mun\u0027s SOI. Each has an expiration of 90 days and a length of 90 days. The Basic Orbiting course blocks expiration if Transmunar is active, so if you do them back to back ordinarily Basic Orbiting would expire, but it\u0027s blocked to not expire until Transmunar does. Perhaps an easier way to do this is just as a stack, where only the \u0027topmost\u0027 course (with an expiration) can expire? Or, alternatively, the other way around: a course can list what other courses it blocks from expiring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Required minimum number of kerbals in a course (if you don\u0027t add this many, the course doesn\u0027t go forward).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Prohibits as well as requires (a list of courses that, if present in the record and unexpired, prevent the taking of this course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Can be removed from course (and if so, how much of the REWARD is given). I.e. it\u0027s a 2 year course (basic training) and you can remove the kerbal starting 6 months from the end, but get only 3/4 the reward if so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Is auto-run on hire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Meta-courses, i.e. course packages. Per 2 above, we might have a LKO course and a Transmunar course, and a Transmunar package that is presented to the player which includes both together (so you don\u0027t have to add six courses manually for a complex mission). Maybe even offer time and cost discounts for these package deals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Make the use of a teacher optional (i.e. some courses can be set teacherless--they have only a base cost and seat cost, and don\u0027t have teacher requirements or costs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, and this is something for KCT as well as this: it\u0027d be nice to have the option to show dates in either y/d/h/m/s format, or KAC-style calendar date using a known epoch equivalence.

KCT\u0027s got both the math parser and y/d/h/m/s support so bringing those into a new mod would be easy (I might move them into MagiCore and have both KCT and this reference that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 1 you mean that there\u0027s two separate expiration triggers: 2 days of flight (total, non-consecutive?) OR 360 days, whichever comes first? That feels like it\u0027s something that would benefit from a general solution for handling expirations rather than the mod including a bunch of specific triggers. I\u0027ll have to think of a good way to handle that, but I can definitely provide a way for other mods to manually expire a course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 2, if Transmunar required Basic Orbiting and both were Flight Log based, then Transmunar would include Basic Orbiting in it by default (if we\u0027re just talking about XP). Not just talking about XP, Transmunar might be FL205 while Basic Orbiting is FL151, and Basic Orbiting would be a given based on the fact that you\u0027ve taken Transmunar. Basically you\u0027d only have to look at the highest in a stack and all pre-reqs should be automatically valid. I realize now that there should be two sets of prereqs: active ones where you must have the taken the course and it has not expired, and inactive ones where you just have to have completed the course in the past (perhaps with a maximum amount of time since it expired, like transferring credits has a max number of years before they\u0027re no longer valid). Basically, the highest course should probably include all the lowers. I could maybe add an additional \u0022provides\u0022 where a course can provide equivalent credit as another course (but that could also be handled in the REWARDS). I\u0027ll have to think about this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also realize there should be a way to \u0022test out\u0022 of a course if you have equivalent experience. So a kerbal who has orbited Kerbin and wants to take the Tranmunar course could take it even without taking Basic Orbiting. The Basic Orbiting course would define what counts as equivalent credit for prereqs. I\u0027ll have to also think about how to add this, it might be a task for later on down the line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3, 4, and 5 are all fine. Perhaps the REWARD section can define how much you get for completing the course through the use of a variable (0 to 1 representing the percent of course finished). If that variable isn\u0027t present then you get none of that reward if you quite early or all of it if you stay. (ie \u0022XP = 10 * [COMPLETED]\u0022 vs \u0022XP = 10\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 This conflicts with class sizes and such so I\u0027m not a huge fan, and what if someone tries to set up several autorun courses? I\u0027d rather provide a \u0022required\u0022 flag in the course that makes the course a requirement before the Kerbal can be used in missions. Then you can hire a bunch of people at once and\u00A0put them through a single basic training once you\u0027ve got them all hired (rather than N individual basic training courses). You can even have multiple required courses then, so maybe there\u0027s a \u0022basic training\u0022 everyone takes and then \u0022Flight 101\u0022, \u0022Engineering 101\u0022 and \u0022Rocket\u00A0Science 101\u0022 for each class that is required before they can go. It\u0027s be extra cool if you set it up so they can be used for missions after basic training but have no \u0022specialty\u0022 until you train them in one of them (I\u0027ll add a REWARD option of defining the kerbal\u0027s specialty).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7 would be a \u0022later on\u0022 task at this point, but I like the idea. Especially if group dynamics are added then that could provide an additional group bonus since they will have stuck together the whole time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8 teachers would be optional. By default you either pay for a teacher to come in from somewhere else (a university, another company, etc) or devote one of your kerbals to run the course (thus taking that kerbal out of the roster as well, but saving some money, maybe providing other incentives too, like extra XP [defined by the REWARD]). If the teacher cost is zero then it\u0027d be free to hire an outside teacher, or you could just say there isn\u0027t a teacher at all. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d totally disable the teacher option then, since you could still provide benefits by having one of your kerbals teach (set the min level to 6 and then the teacher is disabled completely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of KAC\u0027s calendar so I can look into that. That\u0027s something that can easily be added later so I might not worry about that this weekend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T20:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_6\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E ooh, the refresher course/tiered thing is great!

Or consider a simple Apollo-ish Mun mission. Jeb gets the pilot training for LEO, translunar, transkerbin, and reentry; Bob and Bill get EVA and Mun-landing and Mun-ascent. As to \u0022in the past\u0022--I would suggest combining this and nightingale\u0027s idea: if you\u0027ve done a course in the past (before some final expiration) you can take a refresher instead (or test out period).

I haven\u0027t really figured out what, if anything, I\u0027m going to do about \u0022real\u0022 experience from flights as opposed to \u0022course given\u0022 experience for things like prerequisites or assigning equivalent REWARDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this theoretical additional plugin would provides some configs for \u0022flight simulators\u0022 that when completed add a REWARD with \u0022proficiency = mk1cockpit\u0022 in it. The plugin would ask FlightSchool for all the REWARDs active for a kerbal and the plugin would set the kerbal\u0027s level based on the current cockpit and whether the kerbal has proficiency with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a lot of the trickier ideas are going to require implementation in a secondary plugin like that, since I can\u0027t think of a good way for FlightSchool to handle every possible idea. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0has more familiarity with really open ended things like that, so maybe later on down the line we can come up with a good way of handling that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T12:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222393946\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131381\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454618596\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 04.02.2016 at 11:43 PM, NathanKell said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You can train them up (to a certain XP level) by \u0022sending them away for training\u0022 at a cost of x funds and y time. During that time they are unusable for missions (although they can be removed from training early, at a cost of not getting the XP gain). This might be initiated automatically on hire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. They can be trained for a specific spacecraft and/or mission. In order for a kerbal to actually control a vessel in a given situation they will need to be trained on it (for some time period), and that training wears off after a time period. Or, if you go the bonus instead of penalty route, they get a bonus during the period, but can still always control everything. Or some combination. This will obviously need to vary by part and by situation, ideally including speed ranges (\u0026lt;250m/s, \u0026lt;1000m/s) and flying low/high/spacelow/spacehigh per body, and that affects training time and cost. Different AC upgrade levels can affect what options are available. Tourists would come trained for their requested environments (so controls don\u0027t lock), although they would still not be a source of control themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been thinking abut that for a long time too. My suggestion is to replace Super-Mario-like disgusting XP system with the one that is closer to reality: Kerbals just have stats of practical (in-flight) hours and ground training hours which may consist of theoretical classes and G-training. In a mission a kerbal\u0027s ability to do something is determined by those hours of experience but with some random variation. You should never tell the exact amount of training. A kerbal sitting on Kerbin for too long may gradually loose his training. But I don\u0027t know how to disable the stock XP system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: kerbal\u0027s stupidity may be given a practical purpose if used as a modifier to a kerbal\u0027s training rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal training for a mission:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should encourage you to always train a spare team, like IRL. Random events might be added, like inability of a team member to go on a mission. Amount of training could depend on a mission size (e.g. number of specific parts in a vessel) But there\u0027s a trouble I\u0027m still thinking of: how to determine that a vessel still represents the mission same as the crew has been training for? I mean, you can build a small vessel, train a crew and then add much more parts to it. After that it stops being the same vessel (mission), but the crew is still trained for it. Think that could be solved by having a \u0022training volume\u0022 for each part and each trait (scientist amount, engineer amount, pilot amount). So if you add two large engines then you have to do much more training for a pilot on this mission, and for engineer also. If you add a ton of science experiments, you\u0027ll have to train your scientist hard. Thus we can have a number that represents ability of each kerbal to do a certain job. For example, scientist\u0027s ability to do science = personal_science_training / total_amount_of_science_training_required_for_ a_vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T12:53:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
