Do you have a tutorial for replicating the configuration in KSP?\n\nTo be honest, I\u0027ve never actually done it without guideposts. When I fly to place a Draim configuration, my typical tactic is to edit the persistence file to place targets at the desired points, and then I fly my spacecraft to rendezvous with them. In the Draim configuration, all four of the satellites are in orbits with inclination 33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and eccentricity 0.28, and a semimajor axis that gives a periapse high enough for the satellite to do its part in covering its section of the planet; Draim\u0027s parameters for Earth were these:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![BAYCNwI.png](http://i.imgur.com/BAYCNwI.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThe minmum 27-hour requirement over Earth is how he specified the semimajor axis for his orbit. This works out so that, for any particular world, the minimum semimajor axis for the Draim configuration is about 7.25 times the radius of the world. As such, these were the parameters I picked for the challenge, which are a little larger than the minimal Draim configuration over Kerbin.\n\n[table=width: 800]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td][/td]\n\n [td]Sat 0[/td]\n\n [td]Sat 1[/td]\n\n [td]Sat 2[/td]\n\n [td]Sat 3[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Semi-Major Axis (SMA)[/td]\n\n [td]4350000 m[/td]\n\n [td]4350000 m[/td]\n\n [td]4350000 m[/td]\n\n [td]4350000 m[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Eccentricity (ECC)[/td]\n\n [td]0.28[/td]\n\n [td]0.28[/td]\n\n [td]0.28[/td]\n\n [td]0.28[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Inclination (INC)[/td]\n\n [td]33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Argument of Periapsis (LPE)[/td]\n\n [td]270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Longitude of the Ascending Node (LAN)[/td]\n\n [td]0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n [td]270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Mean Anomaly at Epoch UT=0.0 (MNA)[/td]\n\n [td]0[/td]\n\n [td]-1.57078[/td]\n\n [td]3.14159[/td]\n\n [td]1.57078[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Epoch (EPH)[/td]\n\n [td]0.0[/td]\n\n [td]0.0[/td]\n\n [td]0.0[/td]\n\n [td]0.0[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\nViewed from a point perpendicular to the orbital plane, each of the orbits has this shape:\n\n![DraimOrbit5.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/DraimOrbit5.png)\n\nAnd the video below has a run of the simulator that I bashed together back in march to show someone that the Draim Configuration does do full-surface coverage.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOWPGKcFAek?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe satellites were placed using the above parameters. It is probably best viewed on YouTube, in full-screen mode, where you can see the numbers in the table.\n\nIn the big upper square, we assume a non-rotating Kerbin for simplicity, and using a plate-carree projection. Each of the thin horizontal and vertical lines represent 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of longitude or latitude. The secondary vertical lines are at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 intervals, and the big thick lines represent the equator and Prime meridian for the simulation.\n\nThe numbers on the big grid represent the point directly under each of the four satellites on this non-rotating Kerbin. 0 is Cyan, 1 is Orange/Yellow, 2 is Magenta, and 3 is White.\n\nThe colored contours around each satellite represent contours of how far above the horizon the satellite appears in increments of 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Right below the satellite is the number, the next contour has the satellite appear 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon, then 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and all the way down to the thick contour, which is the limit on the surface where the satellite can be seen.\n\nBelow that is a table. Latitude, longitude, and altitude are the surface coordinates of the satellites. \n\nHorizon is the radius, measured along the surface, of the region of Kerbin each satellite can see. \n\nSurface % is the fraction of Kerbin\u0027s total surface that each of the satellites can see at any one time.\n\nSat0 Link, Sat1 Link, Sat2 Link, and Sat3 link is sort of a split table.\n\nThe upper right triangle shows the length of the communications link between each pair of the satellites, with the stipulation that none of the links are allowed to pass closer than 600km from the center of Kerbin (because then Kerbin would be in the way). \n\nThe Lower right triangle shows the link path. As it turns out, Kerbin never gets in the way of the link between any pair of the satellites.\n\nFinally the lower three views are animations of the satellites viewed from above the X-Z plane, the X-Y plane, and the Y-Z plane, The reason they don\u0027t look elliptical is because all the orbits are at angles relative to the planes of view.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T23:31:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maltesh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T07:27:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Short interruptions due to planets / moons / sun in the way of LoS are acceptable for me right now.\n\u003E What I want is to not lose connections due to planetary rotation (or current satellite angle when not in synchronous orbit).\n\u003E \n\u003E And therefore I guess two polar orbital sats will be enough?\n\u003E \n\u003E As Alshain said, the total coverage is more for the late game.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve just started out with RT and I am currently setting up my first interplanetary connection.\n\u003E \n\u003E So it does not have to be perfect.

Make sure you understand the cone mechanics. You can\u0027t just use the biggest antenna at every planet.
