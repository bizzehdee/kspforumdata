Too ugly and unrealistic, I say!\n\nWe\u0027ve also tried making Kerbol a black hole and having stars orbit that. Too unrealistic, I say!\n\nAnd don\u0027t even get me started on randomizing the Kerbol system...\n\nThe true way it should be done is this:\n\nForget adding to Kerbol. Instantiate an entirely new star system completely separate from Kerbol, that can only be accessed by getting a warp drive. When you reach a Kraken-causing altitude, pop up a menu selecting a star system to go to. When you select the new star system, it teleports you to it.\n\nNo, Kerbol still exists in the background. Time will still pass in there. This new system is literally made by coding half the game again."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T14:21:41Z","Content":"This is a bad idea.
