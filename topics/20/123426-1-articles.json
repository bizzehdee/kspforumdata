I want to know what people think are the most essential and basic mods to add enjoyment and fun to game play. Also: what are the performance / stability implications of running lots of mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried some of the \u0027cosmetic\u0027 mods (texture replacer, planetshine, etc) but they seemed to create many issues. I suspect that they slow down gameplay a lot. And once I am far away from Kerbin, they don\u0027t seem to make much difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER, DPAI and MapView Plus seem really useful. I would not be able to play the game at all without KER. RCS BuildAid seems good. They help me get my craft optimised and help with simple task \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM*chj*b - I gather this is a heated issue. I find there are some things (landing, launching, rendezvous and docking) that I can do without MJ. At the moment I am using it like an extended version of an alarm clock: I create a maneuver node and then ask MJ to implement it. Beats time warping or waiting for hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow: parts \u0026amp; other add-ons. Which are recommended? I have tried the Near Future series \u0026amp; they look cool. KIS \u0026amp; KAS - they seem enormously popular. Can\u0027t really figure out why. Is it a colonization thing? Will I need it when I am setting up bases on planets? At the moment I am still just building space stations and flying missions around Kerbin. Most important: will adding a lot of parts impede game performance?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T12:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you do anything more than launching rockets, Ferram Aerospace.

Ignore people complaining about MJ, they\u0027ve been doing it forever, it\u0027s dumb \u0026amp; won\u0027t ever stop. I\u0027d get PreciseNode because I prefer it as a node editor, and Kerbal Alarm Clock because it\u0027s an actual alarm clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS lets you basically dock anything just by connecting a hose between the objects.

For me? I only use four:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetshine is one, and it shouldn\u0027t slow you down so much... you can change the settings to reduce the number or quality of lights if you need to.
