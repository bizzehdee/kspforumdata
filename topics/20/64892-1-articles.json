I can\u0027t post a screenshot at the moment since I\u0027m not at home but basically the issue I\u0027m having is that I built a self contained kethane ship (tanks,converters,drills etc) and it launches attached to an orange tank via a large docking port. My plan was to leave the orange tank and big engine in orbit while my kethane ship lands, harvests the fuel, meets back up with the tank and then we\u0027re off to another destination. My plan was going swimmingly until the kethane ship docked back with the orange tank and somehow became much more wobbly than it had been originally. I figured using the large docking port would have reduced the wobble between the two ships but as it stands right now when I re-dock it becomes unflyable from the wobble \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E . I\u0027ll try and post a screenshot later but any tips would be appreciated. As an FYI I am using Kerbal Joint Reinforcement which I also figured would have prevented it.

Also, how large are the masses on either side of the docking port? It doesn\u0027t matter how much stiffening KJR attempts to apply, if you put a stupid amount of mass on either end of a docking port there\u0027s nothing that can be done to help besides redesigning the entire ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flitter","CreatedById":33550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T15:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience, time-warping for a moment fixes conundrums like this as it disables physics temporarily. So the moment you dock, prepare your forward warp button if things get nasty with wobble! In the immortal words of danny2462, \u0022Time-warp fixes everything!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
