I\u0027ve seen suggestions for a \u0022kuddle shack\u0022 or cloning facility to add new kerbals in the field.\n\nA dedicated part for breeding doesn\u0027t quite have the feel I\u0027d like to play, so here are a few design ideas I\u0027ve had. \n\nOnce an in-game day, look at every manned shop with at least one empty seat whose time since launch is at least 15 days. (Time cutoff should be configurable; I picked 15 based on the default maximum time out of supply in USI Life Support.)\n\nEach eligible ship has a chance to spawn a new kerbal in an empty seat. Probability proportional to the total number of kerbals on the ship and the male/female ratio. The geometric man of the numbers of male and female kerbals has the right kind of properties. \n\nIf a kerbal is born, randomly select one male and one female as parents. Probabilities for courage, stupidity, BadS, and tourist based on the parents\u0027 attributes. Class can\u0027t be inherited directly because it\u0027s a function of the name, but kerbals of the new addition\u0027s class could be given a bonus to being selected as parents.\n\nTo keep the light-hearted \u0022don\u0027t think about it too closely\u0022 attitude of the base game, I\u0027d rather not worry about childhood. Any crew member kerbal created would be able to function immediately. If you\u0027re playing without a mod to give kerbals experience in the field, award a fraction of the stars the parents have, especially same-class parents.\n\nBy not requiring a dedicated part, we allow a chance that any interplanetary ship could arrive with fewer empty seats than it took off with. That\u0027s a kind of spontaneity I think would be fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:28:07Z","Content":"Yeah, I dunno.

You don\u0027t have to worry about male/female ratios, time in flight, room, skipping childhood, genetics or anything else. Simply making it so the hiring cost makes sense would be ideal for most applications. Maybe make the price inversely proportional to rep (plus some base constant) and make it so you have serious hits to your rep if a Kerbal dies. The current cost formula only makes sense if the Kerbal population is very very small or your killing Kerbals left and right."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T01:40:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The geometric **man** of the numbers of male and female kerbals has the right kind of properties.\n\nThat\u0027s a rather ironic typo.\n\nA few more ideas:\n\n\u003E Perhaps the baby kerbal could be temporarily flagged as a tourist, allowing them to mature over time?\n\n\u003E Only allow kerbals to breed in parts without command authority or any other purpose (e.g. Hitchhiker Storage Container, Mk2 Crew Cabin, Mk3 Passenger Module) because there\u0027s more space in there (and you wouldn\u0027t want to contaminate any of the experiments in the science lab now would you?)\n\n\u003E If possible, have the child use parts of their parent\u0027s names, for example Gregrod (Male) and Valelle (Female) might have a child called Valrod (M) or Gregelle (F)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:45:25Z","Content":"*This* thread again."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T12:56:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *This* thread again.\n\nGot a link? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHonestly, I do not think this would work out reasonably for kerbonauts, but introducing colonists alongside tourists might work - but without a complimenting life support and stuff ..."},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:36:04Z","Content":"We shall call it... the FANFICTION MOD!"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T12:54:34Z","Content":"[Civilian Population](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112142) lets you breed new Kerbals in a non-cheaty way.\n\n[Kolonists](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106103) lets you push button, get Kerbal."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T13:15:59Z","Content":"Will the baby kerbals eat all your mined resources?\n\nGeeze Kathy what happened to all or LfOx?\n\nOh, I thing junior broke into the storage, my has he grown.\n\nWe don\u0027t have a biological resource flow yet in the stock game, all the resources flow is for non-biologicals.\n\nBefore you can have an effective breeding colony given\n\nKerbals have mass\n\nE = Mc^2 (Yes I know this is crudely applied here, but chemical energy must be stored in biologicals in terms of C-H bond energies (100kcal per mole).\n\nTherefore increasing the mass of kerbals requires energetics and"}]}
