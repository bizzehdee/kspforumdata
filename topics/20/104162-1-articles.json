I used to add them one at a time and such, but I\u0027m thinking about just throwing them together and seeing what happens.\n\nAlso, is there a way to recover faster when they update the game? And do you need to start fresh every update like I used to?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T03:36:37Z","Content":"[CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-6-26-Mar-2015) is a very good tool to install, manage, update and remove add-ons for KSP.

Not very likely in the grand scheme of things, but definitely possible. The best policy is to back up your game directory before updating if you\u0027re worried about it. Alternatively, stick to updating mods that you\u0027re having obvious issues with and simply leave the rest alone."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:49:50Z","Content":"\u003E I\u0027ve seen that, but would that possibly make a mod update automatically break my save?

If a mod is outdated, it notify you and direct you to a download page if the mod\u0027s author include one. The rest is still manual."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:15:44Z","Content":"CKAN however is automatic (well, you still have to click to tell it to install updates), but like regex said, any way you update there\u0027s a chance for saves getting messed up and game crashes. There are mods to help keep your saves backed up ([jebretrary](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-4-0) for instance) but I just do it manually prior to starting a play session. CKAN certainly makes installing/updating mods way faster and easier and is my personal choice for my more heavily modded installs."}]}
