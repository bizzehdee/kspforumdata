Maybe like different colors of kerbal skin, hair, and eye color? like dark green, lighter green and/or Neon green for the skin. Blonde, Brown, or red for hair. and blue, green, or light orange eye color. it would be nice if it wasn\u0027t too large and memory intensive. this would greatly expand the kerbal variety from male/female to a combination of these. thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Jebby2","CreatedById":145394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T04:46:43Z","Content":"Well, I can give it a try ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:12:19Z","Content":"Sounds like [TextureReplacer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107471-0-90-TextureReplacer-2-1-2-new-thread-the-old-one-is-broken) does pretty much what you want. The different texture packs available have a variety of hair colors and skin tones. Most of the existing packs are only work for male Kerbals in 1.0, but if you look through the last few pages of that thread you\u0027ll find a couple of options for 1.0 females as well.\n\nDon\u0027t know about eye color, though. That would definitely be cool but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen it done."},{"CreatedByName":"Jebby2","CreatedById":145394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:52:36Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think he knows how to texture, so I will texture for him ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
