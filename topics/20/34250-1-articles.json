First, is there a mod that lets me load sub-assemblies when building rockets? I\u0027d like to build my rover, test it separately, then load it onto my pre-built lifter. Secondly, and possibly a bit un-kerbal... is there a test-flight mod? I mean, pick a starting location and drop there to test without the problem of getting there. Three times now I\u0027ve gotten a remote base unit to Minmus, only to realize \u003Cem\u003Eafter getting there\u003C/em\u003E that I forgot something critical, or built the lander wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st flight: landing gear installed upside-down (hey, I didn\u0027t know it flipped when it extended)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd flight: What do you mean, \u0022manned missions still need battery power\u0022? *base core dead in orbit, solar panels still collapsed*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd flight: Solar Recharger Drone, rendezvous with base core, recharge batteries, successful landing... \u0022The drills extend SIDEWAYS, not vertically? Bloody hell. Oh, and our ladder is attached to block the cuplola module airlock, so Jeb can\u0027t even plant a flag. Someone go find Wernher Von Kerman and load him into the Duna Impactor...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah... I\u0027d *really* like to be able to test these things in minmus-like gravity first, instead of taking an hour or two to get to the landing zone, then test.
