You\u0027ll ascend a bit slower if you have a fast launch vehicle, but you won\u0027t risk burning up and you\u0027ll expend less fuel fighting drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T01:46:39Z","Content":"Better than that, don\u0027t overbuild your rocket. The fastest you need to accelerate is on the launchpad, from there you will only need to reduce your thrust. Your thrust to weight ratio should not be greater that 2 at the most if you can avoid it."},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:43:58Z","Content":"OR when I use MJ, (At least with my build of MJ), Terminal velocity does werid things, so I just limit my accell to 20-25 m/ss. You\u0027ll get some shockwaves, but no overheating. It also let\u0027s you carry less fuel if you have first stage boosters. As they Accelleration passes 25 m/ss, Mj will throttle back the liquid fuel engines, sometimes cutting them off completely. This extends your liquid engines range during ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T20:18:12Z","Content":"Some flames on ascent are *fine.* Just because you\u0027re going fast enough to make the air glow doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s imparting worrying levels of heat."}]}
