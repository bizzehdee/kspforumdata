The \u0027real\u0027 RSS and 6.4x scales are awesome, but sometimes I just wanna play stock. Well, honestly, stock size isn\u0027t that great...it\u0027s way too small. FAR and NEAR are required, in my opinion, but they make the ascent (the funnest part, I think) way too easy and quick. KIDS sort of fixes this, but not in a preferable way. So a 2 or 2.5x scale would be just perfect for that \u0027stock\u0027 feel with decent aero. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I\u0027ve seen this done before though. I can\u0027t remember who did it, or where I saw it, but I vaguely remember seeing someone post a 2.5x scale config. It may have been in one of the realism debate threads, I know it wasn\u0027t more than a month/2 months ago.
