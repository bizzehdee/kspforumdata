Because yea. I can no longer take the stock contract/science system. So what I\u0027ve been thinking about doing is via the cheat menu ( upon which I forget how to open up. Hold shift for five seconds or something? ) give myself whatever I need to unlock all the parts of the tech tree. All except the science nodes. Then make it so 100% of science is converted to funds via the strategy. So here I have a full parts list at my disposal. And in order to fund the next mission I need science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the lack luster contract system... I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll take the contracts that are only relevant to what I want to do to gain more funds. Plus ill have all the parts unlocked so that aspect there should make the contracts more enjoyable. The only hurdle would be money. Which is what would prevent me from creating a moon rocket for the first flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do to change things up.
