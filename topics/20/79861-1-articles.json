However, I am a complete noob in this regard, and I haven\u0027t a clue how to begin. All of you fine people have much more knowledge than I do, so I thought I\u0027d ask a few questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) What software do I need to have in order to create various parts? (I picked up Gimp a little bit ago, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s useful here and I\u0027ve been dabbling a little in altering .cfg files with the Module Manager mod.) Guess a second part to this question would be, what is the most common application used?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)Are there any good tutorial vids out there that go over the basics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) I\u0027ve seen references to something called C#. Is that a piece of standalone software? And I have some limited familiarity with C\u002B\u002B. Is this C# similar to that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm.... My mind has blanked on the rest of the questions I had, so I\u0027ll probably update this thread when they come back to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your help and answers in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T17:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
