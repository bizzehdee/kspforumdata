Discovered KSP on my last deployment and man...this game....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow I just recently discovered BD armory and WOW what an amazing mod. Using contract packs I\u0027ve fought a war on Kerbin and out to Minmus and was thinking, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How awesome would it be to have a mod that takes a few basic ship designs with guns and randomly spawn them while you are out in space doing your thing and attack you etc etc?\u0022 Maybe taking out an enemy ship would produce some funds or maybe in the aftermath you could send an engineer out to salvage parts or something? Hell, KAS the wreckage and tow is back to Kerbin lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no modding ability whatsoever.
