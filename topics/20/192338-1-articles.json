And will it fix the current super easy science problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience is really easy to farm and by the point when you reach minmus you can unlock most of the nececery parts for reaching all of the celestial bodys. However, by changing the progression system somewhat like this : [ reaches milestone (etc Land on the Mun) ] -\u0026gt; [ unlocks node but not reaserched ] -\u0026gt; [ use science to actually get the parts ] it forces you to go out from the kerbin system and explore other planets/muns, and prevent rushing a specific high-end node. Also, it may add a bit of context on R\u0026amp;D a craft without any power gerneration reaches 3\u002B days on its mission and runs out of power therefore there\u0027s a need for power gen tech ( so you have to actually run out of power to get solar pannels ) or you reached dres with conventional engines and you are blocked by a technical wall of rocketery but there\u0027s a break through with NERVs using atomic power to yield greater \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. It would mix well with stock/modified milestone contracts too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntldr; I want an addon that does this : 3 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 [ reaches milestone (etc Land on the Mun) ] -\u0026gt; [ unlocks node but not reaserched ] -\u0026gt; [ use science to actually get the parts ]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-13T18:44:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2020 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Astatine85\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMiss typed nerv as lvn\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
