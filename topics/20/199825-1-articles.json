I understand this would allow things to be spawned inside each other if I don\u0027t move them away, but don\u0027t like how far I have to move things before I\u0027m allowed to launch. Is there a mod or cfg that can allow this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-25T17:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch the vessel, exit to space center. Go into your save file with a text editor, search by \u201CVESSEL\u201D (case sensitive) and if you have the option reverse search from end cause it\u2019ll be the last one. Change situation to LANDED and remove the value for \u201ClandedAt\u201D. Save. Reload the save in the game. Now when you launch a new vessel the game won\u2019t detect any other vessel on the runway (or launchpad using same technique). After launching the new vessel and returning to space center tho this will revert and both vessels will be removed upon launch of a third vessel, so you have to do it each time. Best to create a separate save you can reload with whatever you want to remain out there and then launch anything new.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
