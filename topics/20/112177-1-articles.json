First off, you never have a -whole- ship as it\u0027s own item in physics. A ship is always a collection of parts, stuck together, so you\u0027ll always have to apply this to all parts on the ship. Second, the part value may be labeled \u0022mass\u0022, but the way the physics calculations work in game, it works more like density, and this quirk complicates things.\n\nThere is another density related issue that may not be obvious. Most of your ship\u0027s mass will usually be fuel. Well, the math behind any engine\u0027s operation is actually highly dependent on its density. If you try to reduce a fuel\u0027s density, you suddenly throw all the listed values for engine thrust and efficiency out the window.\n\nAll in all, it would be possible, but you are asking for ***-SIGNIFICANTLY-*** more than you realise. It\u0027s like the problem of image identification by computers. Everyone thought that it\u0027d be simple to do once we started putting pictures on computers because hey, it\u0027s so easy for us right? Well, it\u0027s been decades, and imagine how much time and money companies like google have been putting into the problem. Let\u0027s just say there was a reason that google being able to teach a computer to recognise a cat made it onto national news even though no one understands how hard t is. Yeah, you\u0027re not asking for something that hard, but you\u0027re not paying millions and hiring hundreds to get it"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T11:50:47Z","Content":"ok, if you want the keep the thread serious I\u0027ll indulge : no, it is not that hard. you have to change each of the parts rigidBody mass.
