He soon realized that this fuel tank was holding way more fuel than should be possible. He took this new tank, and hoping that it would return the fuel put into it, Succeeded in creating the BH001 Black Hole Tank.\u00A0 Unfortunately, Due to its shape, it happens to be an aerodynamic nightmare. The other difficulty\u0027s with the tank, it retains all of its mass, and requires power to keep its fuel accessible. he soon realize it would work well for Planetary bases and refueling stations, and began marketing immediately.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts About 3.5 meters wide, and in the shape of a D20, and requires 20 EC/s. I think it should, at max hold about 10,000 fuel (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E with the correct proportion of Oxidizer). I want it to retain its mass so people don\u0027t launch it as a main engine and give it a base mass of 15-20 Tons. I also want to make one for ore. BTW I really like my stories (the Part Desc.) and would like to keep them if at all possible. The other two stories follow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u0022After have made more than a usable amount of money off the BH001 Drive, his assistant questioned why Daquan had put the 001 after\u00A0 BH. Daquan also wondering this, headed out to the back of his office to the original BH Tank, Decided to throw a rock into it and see what happened. Surprisingly, it went in. Daquan, borrowing a truck from one of his employees, decided to see how much would fit, and again found it held way more than an object its size should. He quickly patented the BH002 Ore Tank, bought that employee 3 brand new trucks, and began selling again.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O tank should be a 550 science, and the Ore a 1000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncomment if your either interested in coding, or just want to see this come into existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T21:49:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DarknessHasLost\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENamed second tank and added comma to title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T23:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like an interesting idea.
