Since the xenon engines don\u0027t produce a lot of acceleration I need the constant ability to run my engines on the dark side when solar power is unavailable. Packing enough batteries is highly impractical as this adds enormous amounts of weight to the craft making it difficult to lift. I need a non-overpowered option to supply at least a fair amount of electricity in a somewhat compact package. It doesn\u0027t need to supply enough power to run the engines all night, just enough to keep the batteries from running out while it runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody know a good mod for this?

Among other things it adds 3 sizes of nuclear reactor (probe to 2.5m) with accompanying heat fins. It also adds capacitator banks, they have much higher charge/mass rating but charging takes a lot of time and you have to discharge them in 1 go (Good for bursts, not so good for long continuous burns).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T18:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also check out the Interstellar mod.
