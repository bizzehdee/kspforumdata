I tried launching a basic rocket ( I don\u0027t change my heading)\u00A0and as per the formula I should be able to get to 480 m/s but I don\u0027t, I always get 360 m/s.I believe that this due to drag of the atmosphere, I doubt wind is taken in consideration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone tell me if there is a certain angle I should follow or maybe another formula to know how much drag is affecting me and if so, where to find drag coefficient and the related detail in the menu.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note that I use Xbox to play KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBader\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-18T16:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag is a complex calculation in KSP.\u00A0 Each face of each part has its own drag coefficient, which is modified according to Mach number and orientation to the air flow.\u00A0 The drag produced by each part is computed separately and then those values are summed to get the total drag.\u00A0 The vehicle as a complete unit has no drag coefficient that you can look up.\u00A0 All you can really do it take measurements during flight tests and deduce the drag coefficient from the measurements, which might allow you to derive an empirical formula.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go to the cheat/debug menu, you can open the Aero GUI window.\u00A0 This will display aerodynamic data in real time.\u00A0 A couple properties displayed are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edynamic pressure\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eballistic coefficient\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 If you take the mass of the vehicle and divide it by the ballistic coefficient, that gives you the product C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003EA.\u00A0 Multiply C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003EA by the dynamic pressure and that\u0027s the drag.\u00A0 You really don\u0027t need to know the drag coefficient by itself, C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003EA will suffice for any calculations you need to perform.\u00A0 But if you really insist on knowing C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E alone, then just divide C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003EA by the \u003Cem\u003Ereference area\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The reference area is whatever you define it to be, like cross-sectional area of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha Carinae","CreatedById":186556,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T07:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you want to construct a rocket to get to a certain altitude you need to put fuel tanks and whatnot.
