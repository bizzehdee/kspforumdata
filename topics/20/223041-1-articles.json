Me and my group decided a marine plane, that can land on water on bad wheather. I did find out how to make the wings not rip off, neiter the engines, but now it can\u0027t take off. The plane is very small (MK2 for those who ask), with folding wings, capable of archiving supersonic speeds (not optimized for it since it\u0027s a public transport), yet it only gets about 24m/s, not enough for takeoff. Is there a way to change the water drag coeficient so that it maches realistic drag and not some sort of pitch ocean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-16T12:00:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2024 12:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 16\u0022\u003EJanuary 16\u003C/time\u003E by Harald Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Echanged the title, forgor to update text\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harald Kerbal","CreatedById":210553,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-16T15:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s on the cheat menu. how do i close this topic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
