All those part mods; out of all those hundreds of parts; you probably only use a small fraction of them.\n\nI can\u0027t really recommend any specific mods to remove; as I don\u0027t know which mods, and which parts of which mods, you use regularly.

However, I\u0027ve started approaching the RAM limit, so I\u0027ve been setting up a sort of \u0022triage\u0022 of mods that I\u0027m willing to give up first. A program like [WinDirStat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDirStat) can be handy by showing you what the real memory hogs are, but the ultimate question for me is basically \u0022What does this mod let me do that I can\u0027t do without it?\u0022"}]}
