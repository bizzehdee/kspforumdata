Some people have gone into the configand modified them to do this, but an easier solution is to just stick one of the standalone APAS ports that actually work on top of the PMA port, at which point it will work fine."},{"CreatedByName":"alpha tech","CreatedById":84978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:56:33Z","Content":"I was actually thinkning about going into the config if u could tell me how to do it i thought about why all the docking ports arent universal and also i was thinking about just putting all the parts with the apas and apas docking ports and replacing the pma adpts later by replacing the modules themselves.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please add punctuation.
