I\u0027m trying to play KSP with RemoteTech 2 mod, and I can\u0027t get any satellite working, I lose control over the vessel close to the circularization burn. Is there anybody who could help me make those first steps with the mod?

Otherwise you need to do the burn within comm range of KSC, which usually involves making a shallow burn to go straight from the ground to an orbit. Third alternative is to use the built in Remotetech 2 autopilot, which you access by clicking the littler \u0022calculator\u0022 looking button next to where it says \u0022connected\u0022 in the top left of the screen. Then you can make your circularization maneuver node, and then tell the autopilot to perform it for you, that way you don\u0027t need a communication link to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaps","CreatedById":83083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T15:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoah, it\u0027s that easy? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the orbit should be synchronous with Kerbin though, and there should be 3 sattelites.
