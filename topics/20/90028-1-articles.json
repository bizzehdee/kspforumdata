You also have some influence over where it comes down even after ditching your propulsion. With FAR, you can use lifting body effects to come down slower/farther away or faster/closer. Just angle your capsule so that the blunt end points a little down to add lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T17:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PringleMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PringleMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I have terrible timing and land in the mountains a lot...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to MasterTao\u0027s advice, I would also suggest using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93685\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectories mod\u003C/a\u003E. It takes lift and drag forces (both stock and FAR/NEAR) into account based on the descent profile you\u0027ve picked (default 0 angle-of-attack, which is good for spaceplanes, and usually should be changed to 180 AOA for pods) and puts a big red \u0022X\u0022 on the planet where you will land.

And I am not even talking about large stuff, I mean the mk 1 pod with nothing else, coming down from a 100 km orbit with the re-entry pe at about 40km. Drogues will deploy at the default 30 km, then snap at 20 km every time, main chutes will snap right away on deployment unless I deploy at that magical 200 m/s. But that leaves it fully deploying at 300 m ASL, which wont work for pretty much and land-based touch down.

It seems pretty high to me. I\u0027d suggest letting your heatshield do the brunt of the aero-braking, then pop your drogues at the appropriate velocity, and finally your main chutes at the right velocity (I usually deploy my Mk16\u0027s at right around 300m/s, which I try to aim for 5km altitude, with a full deploy at 700m).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T19:01:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by madlemur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDidn\u0026#039;t realize where the original thread started...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T04:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d much rather have had this stay in the RealChute thread.
