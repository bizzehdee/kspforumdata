I kinda failed at dropping them off using the drop ship but the fix was to get kerbals to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to turn them the right way up and orient them correctly. However, the game wont allow me to flip the module over without it being put into the terrain, which in turn then causes the module to either go several hundred meters in the air, or explode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not overly sure why this is happening and its prohibiting any further construction of my base, so if anyone knows a fix please can you say.
