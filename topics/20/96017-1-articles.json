I\u0027m trying to build a alternative input device for KSP, basically a keyboard of sorts specifically designed for KSP. For instance I want to use switches to activate action groups (and a shielded switch for the abort action group \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) and fun .... like that. I have ordered some parts to play around first as I have some expierence in electronics and programing but have to figure out how exactly I have to go about this first, so I\u0027m still very much in the preliminary stages of the whole project. Yet I have already encounterd a problem I wont be able to solve on my own: in my eyes the whole thing would be pointless if I wouldn\u0027t use a sliding potentiometer for throttle control (actually I want to use a motorized fader as they are used in sound boards so I can still use other inputs as well to control the throttle (at this point I would like to request a drooling kerbal smiley for the forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)). Using the Teensy as a controller the intepretation of the signal from the potentiometer shouldn\u0027t be a problem but I don\u0027t know how I can use that value for the throttle. So far I haven\u0027t found out if the game can use controls for the throttle other than shift, control, x and z. Is that really all or am I missing something? If not, does anyone have an idea how this can be achieved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emidnitemax\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T14:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 90% sure that the throttle on a joystick can be used, so your sliding potentiometer should work if you map it to the throttle axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just checked and it is there.
