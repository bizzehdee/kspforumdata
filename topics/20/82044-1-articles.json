It\u0027s more work than just bolting a hundred parachutes onto every stage and getting them for free. On the other hand (and why I like it) because you get full control over each stage you can have hybrid and composite ships - heavylift plane to take a rocket up to altitude for example. Fly the plane up, separate, fly the plane down and land, skip back to your rocket at the moment of separation, do your mission and recover both ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iasus","CreatedById":74473,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T10:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty cool.
