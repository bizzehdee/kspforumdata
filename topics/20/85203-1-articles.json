Some people can get it to work, others can\u0027t. I can\u0027t even get it to launch. However, most people say that despite 64-bit it still seems to have the same memory cap that 32 bit does so you aren\u0027t really gaining anything by using it. The mods your going to use are the same ones you would use in 32-bit, at least until the 64-bit issues are resolved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as which mods to use, it largely depends on your play style, there is no wrong way to play but everyone does things differently. Most GUI-only mods will take very little to run. These are things like Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineer (v1 can be partless, and you can delete the legacy parts), TAC Fuel Balancer, Toolbar, Precise Node, basically anything that doesn\u0027t include either parts, visual effects, or static elements falls into this category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts packs, like NovaPuch, will likely take most of your memory. Bigger ones, also like NovaPunch, are going to be that much more intensive, so many try to find smaller more precise packs to do exactly what they want rather than large packs that encompass wide varieties of parts they won\u0027t use. This group includes things like KW Rocketry, B9, Spaceplane\u002B, NovaPunch, etc. Active Texture Management can help you keep the memory space from these below the cap, but it makes your start up very very long, and textures look quite terrible, especially the moon or the polar caps of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual effects I\u0027m not entierly sure of, I don\u0027t use them a lot. Things like Hot Rockets, I\u0027m not sure if that takes a lot of memory resources or not. However, things like Environmental Visual Enhancements and all it\u0027s various texture packs do take a fair amount, not as much as parts packs though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbTown, Kerbal Konstructs, and all of their supported plugins add static elements to the world, these are nearly as memory intensive as parts packs because they contain similar artwork.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T13:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T16:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is a perfect example of why at this point we need mod pack managers to step up and offer packs with pre-tested mods for the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@sam: I am working on testing mods to combine into a mod pack.
