If you\u0027re using a dedicated development environment it would give you clues on which parts of the code are no longer up to date. However, even if the code is compliant and therefore can be compiled, there might be other changes to make in the code to make it functional in the current version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would help if you gave more information, like which plugin you are trying to revive. This would allow others coming across this thread to give you specific advice on what it might take and help you with problems you encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
