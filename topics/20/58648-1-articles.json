Interstellar uses engines that conserve energy so its engines require far more power to produce the same thrust. Consequently, interstellar reactors and generators produce a lot more power so it\u0027s not necessarily a good idea to mix and match reactors and engines from each mod. Personally, I\u0027d recommend using parts from one or the other on each ship depending on the parts you need, otherwise you do risk balance issues, of course it is up to you how much this bothers you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people like to use the near future electric engines for the late stock game era, when interstellar electric engines are still struggling for thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T21:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can always delete the parts that overlap too much.

Either Interstellar generators needs to be reduced in power or near future engines need a higher power requirement.
