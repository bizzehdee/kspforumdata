Below this is the MechJeb rendezvous window. In the window, you can see part of the station. I am docking manually using RCS, with MechJeb holding the attitude on the target. I don\u0027t use most of MechJeb\u0027s functions, as beyond Smart A.S.S. they don\u0027t work very well for me. I do use it for informational purposes that it may serve better than KER. For example when setting up a rendezvous, it\u0027s rendezvous window is superior to KER\u0027s. I\u0027m a big fan of tools like MJ and KER, I feel they augment the lack of avionics in base KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the crew shuttle docked with the station, the crew shuttle at the top. It is composed of the standard 3 man command pod, as can be seen, a shielded docking part, four landing legs, two radial engines, two solar panels, B9 RCS and a PlaCo inflatable heatshield(used with deadly reentry), as well as three B9 airbrakes. The airbrakes are used to force the vehicle into a retrograde heatshield first direction when atmosphere is hit. This is used with FAR. The vehicle lands with two radial drogue chutes and two radial regular parachutes. It lands on land with the four legs, touchdown slowed slightly by the engines if fuel is remaining. The station is Karmony, I believe, and the orange tanks in struts are from deep space pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l47TnqJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l47TnqJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the crew shuttle on the pad, with it\u0027s launch vehicle. It is launched with the two side SRBs and the center engine which is a Rockomax Atlas engine. These are KW parts. The SRBs have parachutes on top for reusability, and small solid rockets on the bottom to allow them to separate without hitting the center tank(took a while to work that out). Since it is used with FAR, the launch method I use is roll and pitch to a 90 heading and 75 pitch at 70 M/S, then wait until 10-20 apoapsis is achieved before continuing the pitch. Generally, I can go to orbit with just the two SRBs and the expendable center engine, but sometimes the two engines on the vehicle itself have to be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kZnhekn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kZnhekn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for look, what do you think of my KSP style?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T08:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t really describe any style...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
