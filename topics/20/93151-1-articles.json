The first thing you\u0027ll need is an atmosphere texture, you can either make your own, or borrow it from a pack (I\u0027ve borrowed the atmosphere texture from Astronomer\u0027s pack before, and it worked well). Then, you are going to want to make a new layer for the body using the atmo texture, and adjust the parameters to adjust it to your liking. It will probably take a bit of mucking around before you get it how you want it. I suggest poking at the layers for planets that other people/stock in E.V.E. have made to get an idea of what everything does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh yeah, the same thing basically goes for clouds, you\u0027ll need to either get or make a texture, and just make a new layer and have at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T21:05:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ival70\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candlelight","CreatedById":203979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think i sort of understand, but because i\u0027m pretty much new to things like this, i\u0027m gonna need something like a step by step guide.I would really appreciate if someone found, or even better, made a guide/tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T21:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Candlelight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the modding sub-forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T05:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm, I\u0027ve never come across a guide for making custom clouds and atmospheres, not to say there isn\u0027t one, but it\u0027s probably well hidden if it exists. I\u0027m not the best at explaining these things, (though I could probably answer a specific question about it). I don\u0027t think I personally could make a guide, though I\u0027m considering doing it anyways..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best advice I can give (which I sort of said before, but not really, anyways what\u0027s a little redundancy?) is to try the E.V.E. mod on a regular kerbol system, and use the in-game editor (Alt N) to mess with kerbin\u0027s cloud layer. Try changing the RGB values, (If set to more than 1 they start to get really bright and glow in the dark), try changing the height of the layer, the speed, offset, all that stuff. Once you get an idea of what everything does, download a pack (Such as Astronomer\u0027s Better Atmosphere\u0027s Pack, you only really need the E.V.E. portion of it). Open all of the texture files and see how they are stretched to fit on a sphere. See what other people have changed to get the layers to behave how they want. Try modifying what they did to get things to look different. That is pretty much what I did, and I think I learned how to work with it fairly well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candlelight","CreatedById":203979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T13:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk figured out how to make clouds but my atmosphere \u0022glow and texture\u0022 isnt visible altough i changed rgba colors(0.90 IS OUT!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T21:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheres on planets exist because the planet object has an atmosphere child object with an AtmosphereFromGround applied.

Hm, what are all of the other values set to? if they are blank you could probably copy them from the cloud layer and go from there. A few things I can think to check off the top of my head is to make sure height value is pretty high, on Kerbin I usually will set it to roughly 30,000m. Also check that the transparency is above 0 (For a single layer, I find that 0.1 to 0.2 works pretty well, 1.0 is solid). The transparency value I believe is called \u0022A\u0022, and is below the RGB color values. If you post what all the values are set too I can see if anything is out of whack. Or a screenshot could probably work too, plus I\u0027d like to see your planet. =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAtmospheres on planets exist because the planet object has an atmosphere child object with an AtmosphereFromGround applied.
