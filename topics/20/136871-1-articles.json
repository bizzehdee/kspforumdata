Previously, before I wrote that, I was aggravated by an event that included a school project and a 2:30 AM sleeping time (long story).

I mean to say that a mod or a mod-distributor advances and\u00A0helps the community, used by hundreds of people to alter an aspect of the game itself. Therefore, there should be some kind of controlling process to limit the removal or ending of mod/ mod distribution projects, a process that\u00A0comes down to multiple \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0people, including\u00A0the modder himself.

Otherwise, if no such process is conducted, service and maintenance of the project can be handed over to another forum user or suspended.\u00A0With a system like that, things such as Fengist\u0027s Shipyard or Kerbalstuff will not be lost due to mere emotion/ anger/ anything else, only shutting down for urgent reasons, and the forums will be much calmer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETo summarize:\u00A0 I am trying to think up a plan of action to somewhat limit\u00A0the shutdown of important mods, mod distributors, or other projects, in order to avoid the endless waves of dilemma and argument hitting these forums.
