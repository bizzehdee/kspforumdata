The problem is, the storage capacity is relatively small. While you are conducting inter-planetary flights, you will find yourself having to switch back to your labs tens of times per orbit, just to transmit the science points when they top off, to allow the lab to continue the research.\n\nI\u0027m sure trying to make the game execute scheduled operations on vessels other than the active one is really hard, so I tried to work around that.\n\nI tried going into the \u0022largeCrewedLab.cfg\u0022 file and tweaking the storage capacity of the lab to increase it 10x, but that screwed up the research rate, increasing it by a huge margin. I don\u0027t want to buff the lab, only make it less grindy. That increase in research rate seems to have occurred because the calculations for it take into account factors like *current stored data* vs *maximum data storage* and *current stored science points* vs *maximum science point storage*. There is also a variable in the .cfg file that is labelled as being responsible for adjusting the research rate, but it does not accept decimal adjustments, and increasing or decreasing it by 1 seems to have an enormous effect. So my plan to increase storage as a means of reducing the number of visits the lab needs, failed.\n\nIt now seems to me there are only \\*\\* ways to tweak this:\n\neither\n\n- coming up with a way of draining the science points storage into a secondary storage compartment (module?), which has no effect on the research rate formula, so that you can later go there and transmit its contents;\n\nor\n\n- using my original strategy, but somehow tweaking the formula the game uses to calculate the research rate;\n\nor even\n\n- my original assumption is wrong, and it would not be hard to program the lab to periodically transmit its accumulated science;\n\nAll these things fall beyond my abilities, and that\u0027s why I came here to ask for help.\n\nI just don\u0027t want to have to stop my flights every 100 days to go back to my lab to empty it out. This is not farmville.\n\nFor those wondering \u0022why do you need that much science anyway?\u0022, I\u0027m playing career mode, and if find using the lab in conjunction with a \u0022science for funds\u0022 policy works as a nice and steady small source of extra income.\n\nHope someone can help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:24:17Z","Content":"solutions 2) and 3) should be possible by modifying the module code.
