Yeah docking was iffy, and I could blow through Monopropellant if I was not careful, but ascents and landings were flawless. In fact, I had rockets land from orbit right on top of the launch pad! For a while, I had a veritable forest of landed rockets scattered around the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the last few months I can\u0027t even land anywhere near the launch site. Sometimes I crash into the mountains, other times I am far out to sea. Sometimes I come screaming in with plenty of fuel, and it does not even attempt to straighten up and land vertically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any ideas? What am I doing wrong? Is it Mechjeb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T20:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the man himself, not fifteen minutes ago:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142300-could-mechjeb-fly-a-real-rocket/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2644204\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142300-could-mechjeb-fly-a-real-rocket/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2644204\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-23T20:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2016 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
