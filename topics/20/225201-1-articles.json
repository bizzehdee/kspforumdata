Large high-thrust boosters on low-thrust central cores sometimes manual struts to avoid the boosters flying off and leaving the main rocket on the pad. Huge stations that haven been assembled by gradually docking more modules can still wobble if using small-ish docking ports. An occasional diagonal strut attached during EVA will stop that wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"feral_fenrir","CreatedById":234077,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-25T06:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the insight.
