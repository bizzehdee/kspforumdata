I also want to actually play with Earth, not Smearth or MiniEarth or Earth-colored Kerbin from some 1/10 scale RSS mod. Realism Overhaul adds entirely too much extra to the game. Lots of parts, real fuels, procedural parts, dang-it, all sorts of things that overcomplicate everything. All power to those who like that style of play. I\u0027m not one of them. I like my Kerbals, and I like their rocket parts looks and the simplicity that the collection of stock parts and stockalike mods add.\n\nSo it would be extremely nice and wonderful if I could use the stock parts (modified, so technically they wouldn\u0027t be stock) to play RSS. Be it by changing tank drymasses or engine masses or thrust, or Isp, the engines in KSP are basically steampunk rocket tech, not suitable for the real world unless you want to fly high-altitude blimps.\n\nBasically, I want KIDS. But it doesn\u0027t look like that\u0027s coming back any time soon, so alternatives would be nice."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T01:41:03Z","Content":"Best guess is that you could try and change all the fuel to what this mod uses [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86331-1-0-4-Impossible-Innovations-0-8-7-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86331-1-0-4-Impossible-Innovations-0-8-7-1) And have fun hope it helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T06:50:48Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found myself wanting the same thing, so I made a Module Manager patch to adjust tank and engine masses to be more in line with reality.

That lets each part get tweaked individually, but it means that it doesn\u0027t apply to any mod parts. SMURFF, on the other hand, works on classes of parts (tanks of various contents, and engines), so that anything that matches the pattern gets included. This means that there\u0027s no limitation on what mods are supported, the way that there is with RSS Stock Parts\u0027s approach (or Realism Overhaul, for that matter).\n\nGregroxMun, regarding Isp, I have figured out a kludgey way to modify all engines\u0027 Isps (MM can\u0027t do math on them since \u00220 350\u0022 and the like aren\u0027t numbers, but I can do a filter to replace \u00220 3\u0022 with \u00220 4\u0022 or the like), but I\u0027d need to do a lot of testing to make sure I don\u0027t get any weird cases (not all Isps have three digits, how to achieve finer-grained adjustments, etc.), and there is the matter that 300-350 seconds is about the state of the art for engines that burn LOX/RP-1 (kerosene, arguably the closest real-world analogue to Liquid Fuel). I think that suggesting Cryogenic Engines to serve as the higher-efficiency upper-stage engines is a reasonable course for SMURFF to take for the time being."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T20:04:54Z","Content":"Huh!
