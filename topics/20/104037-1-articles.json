I have a problem with my spaceplanes. When I fly them i always have to correct the pitch of the plane as the nose always slowly drops down. SAS does not help, point prograde also does not. It still drops. I tried using MechJebs Smart A.S.S. surfice mode set to 20 deg up but the plane woblles like crazy. It only becomes stable after 20 km hight where the air is thin. So, for the first 20 km my only option is to pich up to an ascent pitch, turn on SAS and tap up so I my nose does not drop. \n\nAm i doing something wrong with my designs or is MechJeb and FAR combinaion broken. Also, i forgot to mention have the MJ patch for FAR. \n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T12:17:05Z","Content":"First the obvious : do you use the right version of the FAR extenssion of Mechjeb ? ( ie. FAR v0.14.7 with the ext for v0.14.7 ). I guess so but it never hurts to check.\n\nMJ atmospheric controls are often a bit too violent. You can play with the Max tf and Min tf in the Attitude adjustment windows and even deactivate the auto Tf tunning. An higher Tf should make the controls change slower.\n\nThe Spaceplane AP may work better for climbing but it depends on what you are actually doing."},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:05:04Z","Content":"OK. just reinstaled MJ 2.4.2.0, the FAR patch and FAR. A lot less of wobble, and is flyable. Thanks. here is some rep."}]}
