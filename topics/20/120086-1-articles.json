If there is, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I had an idea for a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0022gate\u0022 of some variety (FTL, Warp, Star, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my thoughts on the how, details, and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod has two piece in it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod would add only 2 pieces to the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The \u0022Gate Gantry\u0022 (or perhaps Gate Arm)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The \u0022Gate Controller\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the idea I am having.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe \u0022Gate Controller\u0022 would be a very small piece, with very low mass and use a small burst of energy, like an antenna. I see it nearly the size of the air-break when its flush This piece is used to activate the assembled gates. (How that works is more directly explained below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Gantry\u0022 is a somewhat large, heavy piece. By its self, it does nothing. However, when you assemble 4 (and/or 8) of them together, they will form a ring. This ring will pull ships to it, that have a Gate Controller. (and/or, ships with the Gate Controller move to them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gantry uses a lot of power to pull something trough to it. The amount of energy is based on the mass of the ship. (so smaller ships take less power, larger ships need more.) I am thinking there may also be a size restriction (they have to fit \u0022through\u0022 the gate. This is why I say we can make them 4 pieces round or build them 8 pieces round.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gantry generates power via built-in solar cells, which means the further the gate is from the star, the longer it takes to charge. Perhaps there is an energy discount (say, 1/2) if you jump from one gate to the next? Or perhaps ships without a controller can travel between gates? Not sure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach fully constructed ring (of 4 or 8) can only pull a ship from a limited range, but this is why you build larger gates stacked up together. (so 1 ring can pull from 1 long distance, 2 gates goes to 3 long distance, and 3 gates does 7 long distance, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how this isn\u0027t \u0027broken\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) You have to move the big arm pieces out to where you want them to be. (I am thinking that we make up a techno-babble reason why gates cannot themselves pull gantry pieces through them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E The rings need time to charge up, so they can\u0027t be used too often. And since the arms are not able to be built upon, the recharge rate is set. (but a config file can be included to allow for changes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) The gantry pieces will need to be gently nudged into position to form the rings, so its not simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopes: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps there is an animation of it unfolding from a flatter, \u0027powered down\u0027 state, to a full ring when powered up. And perhaps some neat particle and wave effects when its actively pulling a ship to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea is still very young.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is willing to help me make this, I\u0027d love to hear it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a little programming experience, and I am currently using photo shop every day for my Art Degree I\u0027m working on.
