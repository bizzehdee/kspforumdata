I\u0027ve only been to Duna once, and never put boots anywhere except Mun, Minmus, and Duna. Despite a modded tech tree that needs way more points than stock, I\u0027ve still near enough reached the end of it. This makes me feel like I\u0027m in the end-game now, with not much left to push for.\n\nWhich got me thinking it might be time for a fresh run, something that would fill the gap until 1.0, and in which I would operate with a few specific rules in effect:\n\n1) No probe landers. Not even on Minmus. (Probes may be returned and parachuted onto Kerbin however.)\n\n2) No one-way crewed trips. Any permanent bases must have a crew extraction vehicle in orbit (or landed) that is capable of bringing them home. (I\u0027ve always done this anyway, but for the record...)\n\n3) \u0022Satellites\u0022 *for contracts* cannot have engines.\n\nI\u0027m curious as to what you guys and girls would include a mod pack for this sort of gameplay? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMy mod setup is already pretty heavy, being 2.3gb at the loading screen with opengl, so I\u0027m leery of any more large parts packs. I\u0027ve chosen B9 and SXT because I love SSTOs and spaceplanes, and the latter uses stock textures to keep a low memory footprint.\n\n--\n\nMy current modlist for this setup includes:\n\n- Outer Planets and Outer Planets Plus\n\n- B9 Aerospace and Procedural Parts\n\n- Lack\u0027s Stock Extensions and Kerbojet for new cockpit options\n\n- DMagic Orbital Science, Orbital Material Science and Station Science (this is probably why I had way too much, even at 40%)\n\n- Kerbal Construction Time and Stage Recovery\n\n- ScanSat\n\n- Karbonite (option for refuelling stations in the outer moons)\n\n- KAS\n\n- Antenna Range *or* Remote Tech - undecided as yet. I dodged RT once because it made probe landings impossible, but I just ruled out landing with probes...\n\n- FAR, KJR, Navball Markers, Docking Alignment, Contract Science Modifier, Sane Strategies, and other things that improve the UI, sort balance issues, or fix bugs.\n\nI don\u0027t want to include:\n\n- TAC-LS. Been using it since 0.90, and it\u0027s good, but it seems at odds with having more distant planets. Transport ships would need to be vast to carry 50 years of supplies...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T17:06:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Axel","CreatedById":64944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T16:52:03Z","Content":"If you want a more approachable lifesupport scheme, try [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841) \u003C--- Snacks.
