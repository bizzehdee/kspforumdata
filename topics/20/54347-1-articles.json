Sure enough it wouldn\u0027t dock the way I wanted. So I EVA\u0027d, and then discover I can remove other parts like RCS blocks, but not the winglets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess I need to learn how to edit the persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T22:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the KAS folder there is a .cfg labeled admodule i believe. Open this and look how the present modules are wtitten. Copy a present module line and replace the part name with that of the one you want to add. So find the winglets in gamedata and open its .cfg. It\u0027s has two names. The apparent name and an ID of sorts.
