You\u0027re free to reuse and make derivative works using the assets in the GameData folder. With the power of MM, you don\u0027t even need to distribute the files (though if you want to distribute modified models/textures, that\u0027s ok too).\n\nYou do not have to use module manager, and you can redistribute edited textures and model, but if they aren\u0027t changing you could just reference the model path in the cfg file. And remember to change the part name in the cfg as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T19:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:05:28Z","Content":"Why eat up ram if you don\u0027t have to ?"}]}
