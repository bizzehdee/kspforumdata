I have seen mods with other planets and I have read a few things about computers getting weighed down by tracking everything that was happening. With the way KSP runs, is there a namesspace or class that can tell the program to reload the solar system utilizing a different set of DLLs and information? In essence, replace the persistence file and all the planets and modules with a new set? Pretty much only running one solar system at a time? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis question may be very generic, but I thought to throw it out here from my planning and plotting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T13:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean can you swap out all the planets for different ones in the middle of the game?
