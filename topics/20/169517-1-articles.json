The structure is supported by xenon engines that compensate for the acceleration of the ship that lands on it and you need to refuel it. I assume this would be beyond the capability of the physics engine because of the size of the structure so I need to work around it/trick it somehow. The relative speed between the objects at encounter may also be a problem, though I\u0027ve seen demos of land speed in excess of 2000m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice to also be able to incrementally build this structure (transport the materials and they get automatically added - increase the length). I\u0027m not sure whether that would be too tedious though, it may need quite a few launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions/help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
