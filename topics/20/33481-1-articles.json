Kerbals are 1m, so the smallest size pod you can fit two of them in is 2.5m unless you stack the fellas one atop the other. The FASA Mercury \u0026amp; Gemini pack has a brilliant rendition of the Gemini 2-man capsule. I highly recommend it. But it will require 2.5m tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T23:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could definitely fit two kerbals (stacked front to back) in a 1.25m pod. Hell, we can fit 3 ~1.5m tall humans in an ~2 meter Soyuz descent module. But a cylindrical lander-can (or hitchhiker) setup would work too. Basically, there\u0027s no way to move two kerbals in a sensible way without dramatically up-sizing and using the Rockomax-compatible parts (I\u0027m playing a game in which I don\u0027t allow myself to use any of the larger tanks or engines and don\u0027t launch payloads over (about) 10 tons to force myself to construct and fuel all my large ships in orbit. The only exception is the hitchhiker module since I need that for space stations, but something smaller that fulfills the same function is ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the other stuff? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are there any .5x.5 structural panels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
