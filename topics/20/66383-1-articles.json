(The basic idea is to recharge that \u0022uncharged\u0022 resource with energy and some gas on planets with atmosphere or something like that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need an engine that not only consumes some resources, but also produces some waste resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I tried to use \u0027ModuleAlternator\u0027 but it seems the calculation for this works different and I couldn\u0027t balance that the way I wanted to. For every 1 \u0022charged\u0022 resource used by the engine there should be 1 produced \u0022uncharged\u0022 resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried another approach by adding the \u0022uncharged\u0022 resource as propellant and giving it a negativ ratio (charged resource ratio 1, uncharged -1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I thought it worked out, but then I ended up with 60.17 units produced out of 60 units, which means after recharging I would have more fuel than I started with. That\u0027s not intended^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I make it match exactly? I don\u0027t really care if I use it as propellant for ModuleEngines or as resource for ModulAlternator as long as the numbers work out. Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
