Also Tweakscale? I haven\u0027t noticed anything but I\u0027m using a wide array of stock-ish tanks and I\u0027m more used to Real Fuels/Procedural Parts-style tank management. I have yet to really change any tank contents because I don\u0027t need to. I much prefer MFT but IFS is required by mods I use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
