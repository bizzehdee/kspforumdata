KSP has become one of my most played games. I got an Oculus Rift last week. Vireio perception released drivers that are somewhat compatible with KSP. Here is what happened. I got to orbit in stereoscopic 3D!! I can honestly say that KSP and the Oculus Rift were meant for each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenies to tell the story... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ke9ImKp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ke9ImKp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to the launch pad was not easy. The mouse is out of sync with the distorted view used for the rift. It is in sync with the original view. Once I realize this, I was able to fumble my way to the launch screen. The settings are set to no shaders, but it was still beautiful because of the depth perception. The screenies don\u0027t do it justice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pSFQXTR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pSFQXTR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the screenshots you can see the HUD, but with the Rift you can not see the stages at all, the navball is distorted and you can not see your altitude. But this is kerbal space program, who needs fuel gauges... we\u0027ll do it by sight and ear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LRls8Ca.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LRls8Ca.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no head tracking, but you can use the mouse to look around.

It was not as usefull as I though it would be, but it was much more precise and fun. The sun looks ok in the picture, but in game it looks like its part of a skybox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EZLUNOs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EZLUNOs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe map view also works, however it looks like a solar system inside a box. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerception 2.0 is the software that makes this possible. It was released the 28th of November so there is a lot of work to be done and a lots of bugs to iron out. I find myself with some spare time so I\u0027m trying to make it better. So far I have done a profile for KSP, but to make it playable it needs a lot of work. I am learning the ropes and I thought this would be the best place to find information on how to make it better. Is there anyone else with the Rift? what is the position of the Devs on this matter? Is anyone else interested?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe settings I used.

I swore I could see small differences in certain parts when I used my Rift to look at these.

If I understand correctly, the left eye edge of whatever object you\u0027re using to align with the GUI marker is supposed to appear to move/warp in the horizontal so you can use the gauge to tell the difference. I couldn\u0027t get it to budge from the second left marker from the center. Convergence also seemed to do nothing going from maximum to minimum. There seemed to be a small amount of 3d anyway, though I could be wishfully thinking? The SPH ran at ~1FPS though, no idea why. Same thing happened for me in Portal, both World Scale and Convergence seemed to not function. I\u0027m using Catalyst 13.9, the latest official. Might try 13.11 beta if I can\u0027t think of anything else..Plus re-read the documentation, see if there\u0027s anything..This is on a Radeon 6850, I\u0027m not concerned about FPS hits at this early stage in development but 1FPS in that certain scene seems like something not working as intended for the moment.

But, oh I really think that KSP in the Rift with good setup, even DK1, would knock your socks off and send them into orbit as far as the amount of depth. It really feels like you\u0027re on the nacelle-ish parts looking across the wing. With this FOV you can\u0027t see much further past the velocity indicator and the rest is peripheral. The sense that it wraps around you is fantastic and that\u0027s something the rift does that nothing else I know of does. Oculus is planning for a consumer version of an even better \u0027Rift in 2014. That will take your socks, now orbiting kerbol, into interstellar space.
