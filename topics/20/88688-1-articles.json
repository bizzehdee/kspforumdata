So, what mods, or features similar to those in the mods, would you like to see added to the game before is completed? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll start, heres my list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize thats its hard comparing something like KSPInterstellar to Docking Port Alignment Indicator, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m dividing the mods into a few categories. The Game Play category would add content, which is one thing Squad said they would be doing in the Beta with all the foundations in place. The Quality of Life category is smallish mods that are nice to have. The DLC category would be for mods that are cool and would be a good addition, but you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think really fit in original concept of the game or aren\u0027t right for everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame Play:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation Science - adds more purpose to stations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS - gives more things to do in EVA, and it\u0027s useful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANsat - it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cool and adds more purpose to satellites \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuality of Life:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstronomer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Visual Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDLC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-These three all kinda fit in the theme of colonization and add pros and cons to having manned vs unmanned vehicles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I restricted myself to just three mods per category because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure like most of you, it would be a long list if I put in every mod I wanted. It kinda forces you to prioritize which mods you think really are the best, and it makes a more manageable list for Squad if they actually consider adding any of these.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I just copied what they said what they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to do in the beta and what they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve said about adding mods into stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeta means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be focusing on creating content, on using the tools we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve built.\u003C/strong\u003E It means a different approach to selecting which features go in, since we won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be constrained by the development constraints of one feature requiring another. Priorities should level out, which means the things we consider important should also match what everyone considers important. Beta essentially means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be working a lot more on stability, usability, performance, balance, aesthetics, all the while still throwing in little and some not-so-little things we hope you will enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t consider KSP complete until Feature X is implemented!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a question. However, if you asked everyone which features they would like to see in KSP, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d get different answers from just about everybody. We all have our wishlist of ideas and features we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to see, us devs included. The fact is, we must be very level-headed here with what we want to do, and what we can in fact achieve in the time we have. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not to say of course, we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t planning to tackle the biggests requests from our community. Just remember that all features are judged in a big-picture perspective, and how it affects the game experience for everyone, and sometimes even what would seem like fun ideas are going to fall outside the scope of the game, or just be plain too much to take on. Time and Manpower are our main limiting resources now, and those must be spent wisely, pursuing the goals that will add the most enjoyment for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: Are you going to integrate \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMod X\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 into the game? (a.k.a. Q:How can I get my mod integrated into stock?)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: This depends on several factors. First of all, we have to ask ourselves: Is this mod doing something we wanted to do ourselves already? Some mods, awesome though they are, aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t part of what we have planned for KSP, and that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fine. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why we support modding in the first place, but it also means a mod isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to be auto-added just because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond of all, if we do find a mod that does exactly what we wanted to do ourselves, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done well, follows the style of the game, all that stuff, then we get in touch with the author, and we get the conversation rolling from there. There isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a system for adding a mod into the game. That said, we very well might find mods that do stuff we wanted to do, and we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to reinvent the wheel if we can avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T21:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of TriggerAu\u0027s mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T21:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistant Object\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T22:28:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think some sort of life support should be added, not just for its own sake but as an enabling feature for career mode aspects that depend on game time.

I actually think that a simplification is fine---like Snacks, but with death, not rep loss as the penalty. Real life support has consumables, and elements that can recycle. All that matters is the end mass of non-recovered stuff (and power) per day used. You can abstract by having a constant drain rate, and more LS units in more advanced habitats/pods, or you can have the drain rate based on the habitat/pod, and a more fixed number of LS units for a given hab/pod. No need to micromanage CO2 removal vs water vs whatever. LS units per man-day used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
