I would love to have a probe/part available that gathered science a little bit at a time, rather than one big chunk all at once. So, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say that you have to provide power to it, and for every two days that it was powered, one point of science would be generated. If the power is interrupted, the two day gathering period starts over. So if we have one of these probes in orbit and powered for thirty days straight, 15 science would be the reward. To make this more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cchallenging\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, the probe would have to be in orbit or on the surface of a celestial body other than Kerbin or asteroids. Also, the total science that it could gather could be capped at say 50, and then you would have to send up another probe. Perhaps asteroids could be included with this, but if they provide less science or something. Thoughts, comments?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
