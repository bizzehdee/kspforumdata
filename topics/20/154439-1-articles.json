stage battles?\u00A0 with multiplayer not really a thing for combat quite yet, and the only AI being for aircraft, though i suppose you could script something in KOS to use the IR sequence, but it\u00A0 wouldn\u0027t be random at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut on to the construction, the animated pit\u00A0 and rotating parts aren\u0027t a problem, there are KK modules that can do that, aside from a major snag ,\u00A0 that snag being that the animate on click which is the only animation module in KK, only functions on mouse click rather than vessel proximity or collision, and I think that\u0027s the real stumbling block. If you wanted to use a KK type static then patches and code would need to be written\u00A0 to interface the proximity animation module with the existing KK code and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167349-ger_space/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167349\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167349-ger_space/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ger_space\u003C/a\u003E would need to think it was a possible thing in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we have the snags out of the way \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E what kind of size, what kind of finish, this is quite important as without this info you could end up with something you were not expecting, so sketches screenshots of what you\u0027ve already tried etc would help get someone interested, and interest is a greater motivator to ksp mod makers than cash (unless of course it\u0027s bundles of cash \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twitchi","CreatedById":73343,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T23:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, thanks for the interest\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo here is a screenshot of my last attempt \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MicTMlM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/MicTMlM\u003C/a\u003E was the best I could make from the standard assets from Kerbinside, I was looking into how to make the models myself but I just seriously lack the time that would require\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrange tank included for scale but this one was to large, about 4x I recon, I have no idea how to estimate the size in meters, but I\u0027ll run some psudomath\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only even roughly estimated length that I could find online was 3.7 or the FTL800, 2 of them to an orange tank length makes about 7.1m, 3 or 4 (well go with 3.5) orange tank lengths to a fence length on the old battle arena. 10 lengths a side for an estimated length of 250m on the old arena, so maybe 100m required for the \u0022actual\u0022 one\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe finish was quite good on the old one so something like that would be awesome, apart from I think it needs a Kerbot Wars Logo in the middle.. only problem with that is I wasn\u0027t very happy with the one I designed last time\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for how we actually fight.. last season we had the fun and frolics of working with DMP.
