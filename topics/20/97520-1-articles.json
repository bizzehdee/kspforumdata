I need some better ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I have the AAT set to stock SAS, and I want to try different values for the Tf range, Kd, Kp, and Ki values. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone willing to help with suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Autopilot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EIx3zyC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EIx3zyC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the plane it cannot seem to fly- I am using stock SAS, and I still nearly crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cSBXXnd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cSBXXnd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...

Easier to help when the nature of the problem is explained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond the only parameter I recomand changing there is Tf.

Small value with make the control more twitchy and responsive, large one more slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
