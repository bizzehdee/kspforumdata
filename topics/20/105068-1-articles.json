And I planned on using a Keyboard protocoll to relay information to KSP, so the Swiches an levers should work.\n\nMy main problem is retreaving the Information from the game to be able to process or display it for I have no Idea how the Game is internally structured or how to access the various variables, or in C# I think stuff like that are called Classes and where to find what, so thats why I\u0027m here.\n\nThanks alot for reading and excuse my spelling, I have never been good at that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T22:54:38Z","Content":"Hey, welcome to the forum. \n\nThere\u0027s two existing mods that are popular for simpits and controller hardware: [Telemachus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-0-25-%282014-10-12%29-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser) uses a web socket to get data in and out of the game, and [KSPSerialIO](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393) uses a serial link over the Arduino\u0027s USB connection.\n\nThey both output a lot of very detailed telemetry information. And also have a protocol for inputting control data. I\u0027d suggest adopting one or the other for your project, and dropping the idea of keyboard emulation for simplicity\u0027s sake.\n\nThere are quite a few hardware projects on the forums, most of them using one of those mods. Have a look at the [custom hardware/simpit repository](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66763-Custom-hardware-simpit-repository-For-people-who-take-KSP-a-little-too-far) thread, and look for the [Hardware] tag in the [Fanworks forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/40-KSP-Fan-Works). Lots of ideas and inspiration to be found. \n\nAnd make sure you start a thread in the Fanworks forum for your project!"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T08:46:44Z","Content":"You could have a look at a [related project](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393-Hardware-Plugin-Arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-%2809-Mar%29?highlight=Raspberry)"},{"CreatedByName":"GalaxG64","CreatedById":104063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T16:24:19Z","Content":"Thanks alot. It seems to be a better Idea to use the Serial IO mod, than to emulate a Keyboard. I however found the Idea of maybe writing a mod myself kind of cool, so I wanted to know, where I could find the required documentation, or a tutorial that coveres the KSP API (Ill learn C# with the help of books and learning by dooing other smaller projects). Thanks again\n\nRegards,\n\nAlexander Becker \n\nBavaria Germany"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:38:55Z","Content":"For that, you want to have a look at the [Mod Development Links Compilation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638-Mod-Development-Links-Compilation-START-HERE) post in the Add-On Development forum. The plugin development section has a series of links to API docs and info on how to get a development environment set up. I haven\u0027t written anything from scratch, but following the docs there got me set up to contribute to a few other addons.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:19:35Z","Content":"stibbons posted the right link.
