The problem, as I see it, is that the parts are too heavy for Unity to deal with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is simple. Divide all masses and thrusts/moments by 10. You could then have 10 times more fuel/engines/boosters without the parts pogoing and melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Harvester: Mod the parts folder so everything is 1/10th its current mass.
