First of all, happy new year !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, i have a question !\u00A0Why the laboratory is better than the R\u0026amp;D departement at the KSC ? I mean, it give you MORE science with two kerbonautes than all R\u0026amp;D and the scientists on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, i wonder if it\u0027s possible to manage a little mod\u00A0like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou pick up some scientist (2 for\u00A0T1, 4 for T2 and 6 for T3 maybe ?) and make them work on your R\u0026amp;D departement. The default science was lower than stock, but if you wait, you can gain so much more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you think about it ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
