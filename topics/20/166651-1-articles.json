It sounds like it can be done totally stock. (Well, via Module Manager patching of stock parts, anyway.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll need to write several configs:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.)\u00A0define the resource you want to generate\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.) patch all crewed parts to include storage of this resource, starting empty\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.) patch all crewed parts to include a resource generator that produces your resource out of electric charge.
