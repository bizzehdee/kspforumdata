It used to not have an atmosphere, but I\u0027ve heard that you can aerobrake in the sun now, so maybe they added a proper atmosphere.\n\nThe \u0022flying\u0022 situation is only achieved when both ends of the orbit intersect the planet, that is why aerobraking maneuvers won\u0027t give you flying high/low results (unless you are using my experiments, which rectify that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:58:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The \u0022flying\u0022 situation is only achieved when both ends of the orbit intersect the planet, that is why aerobraking maneuvers won\u0027t give you flying high/low results (unless you are using my experiments, which rectify that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))\n\nCould you elaborate on this?

It\u0027s always a nice reminder when my reply ends up at the top of the next page. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\nErm ... this stuff has me totally confused. I get the bit where you say that you can get science from \u0022in space\u0022 while suborbital from space low, there\u0027s never been a question about that. Where you said \u0022just need to get apoapsis inside the atmosphere,\u0022 I think you may have meant \u0022periapsis.\u0022 I believe the debate was on whether the periapsis needs to just be under the atmosphere, or whether it needs to be gone altogether -- which xEvilReeperx showed that it need only be under the atmosphere with his screenshot. What I couldn\u0027t determine from the screenshot is his apoapsis which may have been under the atmosphere as well (if that makes any difference, which I doubt, but just being thorough).\n\n-- And now with this escape trajectory stuff. It\u0027s starting to sound like you might not be able to gather science while flying inside an atmosphere while \u0022aerocapturing\u0022 from an encounter to a potential escape. You may need to wait until an orbit is established before gathering science or else you\u0027ll get an escaping situation instead of a \u0022flying at,\u0022 which might result in getting science from \u0022space low\u0022 even under the atmosphere. I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the case, but I\u0027m not ruling it out yet. As to what does any of this have to do with gathering science from an atmosphere that Kerbol probably doesn\u0027t even have? Nothing. There\u0027s no way to be on an escape trajectory from Kerbol in KSP.\n\nThe real hard stuff about filtering this list of all things KSP science: landed vs. splashed down. I\u0027ve heard that it\u0027s possible to gather science while \u0022splashed down\u0022 in Kerbin\u0027s grasslands. I\u0027ve tried it (involves splashing down in a river instead of in the ocean) and I\u0027ve only gotten yet another \u0022splashed down at Kerbin\u0027s shores\u0022 situation, but I\u0027m still convinced it\u0027s not entirely impossible. What\u0027s really gonna give me trouble is how many places on Eve and Laythe can you splash down and get a biome that isn\u0027t normally a liquid surface. Same goes for landing on biomes that are supposed to be liquid surfaced. There are some places on Kerbin that aren\u0027t shores but also don\u0027t require water wings in order to get the \u0022Kerbin\u0027s water\u0022 biome while landed -- same is possible on Eve and Laythe I\u0027m guessing, but it takes forever to get real data on any of this."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T15:05:45Z","Content":"Here is the breakdown of how your current situation relates the experiment subject:\n\n- On solid ground, or the launchpad (prelaunch)  \n\n    - Surface Landed\n\n    [\\*] In the water/ocean\n\n    - Surface Splashed; regardless of biome\n\n    [\\*] In space; any type of orbit: sub-orbital, orbit, escape trajectory:\n\n    - In Space Low if below the threshold\n    - In Space High if above the threshold\n\n    [\\*] Inside of a planet\u0027s atmosphere; the only tricky one:\n\n    - In Space Low if on an escape trajectory, regardless of whether you are headed out or in\n    - Flying Low if you are below the threshold with any other type of orbit: sub-orbital, orbital with periapsis and/or apoapsis inside the atmosphere\n    - Flying High if you are above the threshold with the same orbital characteristics as above\n\nThe only one that doesn\u0027t make sense is an escape trajectory while in the atmosphere.\n\nNone of that really has any bearing on the topic though.\n\nAbout nonsense biomes while splashed down or on the surface, there is no way the game registers a biome-situation combination as invalid. Biomes are determined using a low-resolution color map, if your current position is inside one color then you are in that biome (there is some blending at the borders of colors, which is why you can get Tundra a few km west of the KSC). The low resolution of the map means that small islands or small lakes might be considered an ocean or surface biome, respectively, even when the experimental situation doesn\u0027t match.\n\nI\u0027m not sure of how to handle this other than manually marking biomes-situation combos that generally don\u0027t make sense, or some extremely slow, tedious method of checking the elevation at a biome to see if it\u0027s under water.\n\nMy understanding of FinePrint is that it checks if a survey point is valid only after selecting a location.
