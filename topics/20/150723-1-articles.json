I was in the R\u0026amp;D/techtree place the other day and was wondering if there is a mod or plugin anywhere that makes KSP remember how far zoomed out you where. Usually whenever you exit and re-enter, the tree will be zoomed right in again, staring straight at the start node. With many mods and CTT installed, it can be a pain having to zoom out every time you enter the R\u0026amp;D. Is there a mod that changes this? Thanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBenji13.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
