I\u0027ve an idea I\u0027d like to share with you, and ask that those technically inclined please be as pessimistic as possible. I hope to prove it can\u0027t be done before I hope it can be done. The scope of this post is limited to: the concept of \u0022bridging\u0022 two games with a smooth transition, specifically Minecraft and KSP, and it\u0027s technical plausibility. I understand that KSP is unfinished, and that the KSP surface will most likely be a great experience one day. I also understand the state of MC\u0027s modding \u0022capabilities\u0022. I just love MC and I love KSP and I want it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may or may not be familiar with the multi-player mod for Just Cause 2: JC2-MP. By my layman\u0027s understanding, JC2-MP uses an external executable and some \u003Cem\u003Efancy \u003C/em\u003Ememory reading and writing to enable client\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;server\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;client transfer of game data. The concept of gleaning/inserting data between two programs\u0027 memory is interesting, and the JC2-MP results are amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may or may not be familiar with Minecraft, and it\u0027s modding capabilities. I\u0027ve played tekkit, and feel it\u0027s alittle bloated, but I like the idea of progressing to modern technology in Minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may or may not be familiar with Kerbal Space Program, and it\u0027s modding capabilities. Personally, I like the sense of exploration, but wish there was more to do on the surfaces of worlds (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://breathinbuddah.imgur.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBear in mind I haven\u0027t explored further than the Mun, and have played less than a month\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dream:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlay minecraft, with the added ability to build space centers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome smooth transition between MC and KSP, where one moment you\u0027re playing minecraft, having just completed your space center; the next moment you\u0027re at the main screen of KSP, overlooking the space center.

On the other hand, Minecraft and KSP do not understand each other. Minecraft has no concept of physics whatsoever; KSP is a physics simulation. KSP has no concept of mutable terrain whatsoever; Minecraft\u0027s whole premise is mutable terrain. How the heck are you supposed to explain one to the other with an interposed translation layer? Even if you translated \u0022a block was just broken\u0022 into exactly the data format that KSP needs, you\u0027d still get the reaction of \u0022what\u0027s a block?\u0022.

This causes another event that sends data to the translator app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The translator app directs Minecraft to teleport the player to a new dimension, according to the \u0022landed on \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 ID that was handed over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You hit alt\u002Btab and switch to Minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You play Minecraft on this new map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what you can do with an interposed translator: you would still be playing only one game at a time, but you could cause events that trigger something in the other game. Note that such a translator app, together with the required Minecraft mod and the required KSP mod (which you would both have to maintain over version updates!) would still take a gigantic amount of time and effort to create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I ask, why would you go through all that effort when \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287888-galacticraft-3-open-source-4-100-000-downloads\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eyou can already have a space program in Minecraft without needed KSP at all\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T10:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d argue that Space Engine\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eer\u003C/span\u003E* might be the middle point between the two games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you are looking for something that might satiate both itches of KSP and Minecraft at the same time, you might find Space Engine\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eer\u003C/span\u003E* to be the best back-scratching post you\u0027ve never had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Not to be confused with Space Engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T18:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could use OpenComputers to build a mission control in Minecraft that controls Kerbal vessels through kRPC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
