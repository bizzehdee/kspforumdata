What I don\u0027t understand is why yesterday the game started fine, barely reaching 3.2 Gb RAM before the memory reduction plugin did its thing and dropped it to a stable 2.6Gb. Now today, it gets barely halfway loaded before hitting 3.7GB and crashing. I even completely removed 300Mb of mods and it still can\u0027t load completely without crashing.

It\u0027s not impossible but fairly unlikely. Universe replacer and Interstellar are big ones, cutting those should help. B9, as optimized as it is, eats a lot. Nix B9, then try. I can give you some more suggestions on what to kick if you can list those \u0022thirty plugin mods.\u0022 If your computer only has 4 GB memory, you may be eating into KSP\u0027s memory with running stuff alongside it. If you are like me and have 8GB, you can run KSP twice over without crashing (lol, I have actually done this). Even if your mod load did not change, sometimes a system setting can effect memory allocation. Even if you haven\u0027t changed anything in your KSP or it\u0027s mods, something you might think is completely unrelated could do something as memory crashes, though I personally have only seen it once, can be brought on by non-KSP changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest help I can say now is cut the most memory intensive mods. After UniverseReplacer and Interstellar got removed, the only biggie I can see is B9. Kick that. If you are still crashing, try to give us what I labeled above. It\u0027s probably more than anyone could need but it gives us more info to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T18:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB9 and, to a lesser extent KW, tend to be the ones that rapidly cause memory problems.
