I like the easy use of Procedural Fairings, better part shielding, \u0022clamshell\u0022 seperation, and the ability to place parts like grid fins (for Soyuz-like LAS) or RCS thrusters on the surface. But the customizable-ness, memory-friendliness, pretty models and textures, and the thing where they move out of the way for easy payload access of the stock fairings. I would like the best of both combined into one mod. Have the options of \u0022clamshell\u0022 or \u0022confetti\u0022 style seperation, manual or automatic fairing design, all of the cool bells and whistles of Procedural Fairings, the models and textures of the stock ones (probably just use Ven\u0027s absolutely gorgeous ones), and the option between persistent fairings and non-persistent ones. Also, if this could be done mostly or completely done through ModuleManager configs (the latter is less likely to be possible) that would be great. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
