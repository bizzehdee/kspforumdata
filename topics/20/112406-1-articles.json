Remote Tech** - a mod that I have never used before and frankly combined with Hard Career it may be the biggest uphill, but that\u0027s what I wanted I guess.\n\n**2. TACLS** - The only LS I tried and used to. Probably a greenhouse too for Jool stations as I do not want 40% of my ship weight to be food and 40% fuel.\n\n**3. KAS/KIS** - realism means kerbals can do stuff on EVA besides collecting samples and experiments data.\n\n**4. SCANSat**- I think it is redundant now with the new way of ore finding, but it is still good for terrain altitude mapping, easter eggs and others ?\n\n**4.1 SCANSat contract pack** - May make my life easier and less tourist grindy at the beginning, but still keep it real, right ? *Not sure if the income is balanced though ?*\n\n**5. Stage recovery** - Hope it fixes the non-opening parachutes in vanilla ?\n\n**6. Background processing** - Sorry, I have not checked mods for a month(full vanilla), hope this works now?\n\n**7. KER** - should help me sync my satellites ? I am only using the hangar part of it now.\n\nThose are the first ones that come to mind as long as few more (balanced to the game) command pods and parts.\n\nAnything I am missing ? Maybe malfunction mod with reasonable durability on the parts? I do not want to have to change satellites after every mission. Maybe I will have a kerbal engineer stationed and stocked with supplies to repair them, but do not want that to be my primary gaming.\n\nWhich one do you suggest if any ?\n\n8 - EVA Parachutes ? Realistic or not ? Honestly for hard mission and if I put malfunction mod I rather have them and not need than simply watch my kerbals plunge into Kerbin oceans with malfunctioning parachutes.\n\nKeep Fit"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:11:52Z","Content":"Remote Tech isn\u0027t entirely realistic since we don\u0027t build batteries of relay satellites to communicate with our probes on faraway worlds. I mean, sure, we use relay satellites but they\u0027re generally local to the specific probe. Generally we program probes to do certain tasks and talk to them during the times when we have line-of-site. There are, however, plenty of features you can use from Remote Tech that are realistic, such as the light speed delay and command execution (although their SAS will turn your craft into a dying fish, so strut it down good), and getting the Realism Overhaul RT2 config file will give you the equivalent of our \u0022Deep Space Network\u0022, as I understand it.\n\nIf you want realism get MechJeb instead of KER and let the machine do the flying.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 8 - EVA Parachutes ?

The 0.625m SRBs are a personal favourite for the early stages of career/science games. The combined decoupler/sepatrons give more reliable radial staging while keeping part counts down.\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement (KJR), if you haven\u0027t already considered it, can reduce the need for struts and help reduce part count when launching payloads such as space station elements.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You might want to look into SKY\n\nI\u0027d definitely recommend a medium scale-up such as SKY\u0027s 3.7-times planets.
