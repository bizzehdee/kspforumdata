Better?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes better, but I think what you are looking for is Flaps and Spoilers, also available in FAR. These will allow you to alter the control surface deflection in flight (via Action Groups). For the purposes of the game, the only difference between Flaps and Spoilers is whether you want staged deployment (Flaps) or single deployment (Spoilers) and also what the default deployment direction is. You can set their deflection value to negative to reverse it, so Spoilers can act like single deployment Flaps if that is what you want (this allows you to make air brakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I\u0027m not sure I follow your logic. Most people want full deflection on re-entry to slow the plane down faster. If all you want is fine controls, hit the Caps Lock Key, that\u0027s not even FAR, that is Stock KSP. The little arrows in the bottom left corner turn blue to indicate fine controls are turned on. It\u0027s not the best indicator, but it\u0027s what we have.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T15:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T16:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I use air brakes to slow down during actual reentry, but the problem arises when I\u0027m still moving at supersonic speeds at low altitudes.

It\u0027s a bit confusing though because you can call them \u0022Flaps\u0022 but you can have them deploy negatively and behave like \u0022Spoilers\u0022, but the game still calls them Flaps. What compounds this is there are real world spoilers that have controled deployment to behave just like what the game/mod calls \u0022flaps\u0022. Anyway, that seems not be the original issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Caps Lock controls may help you a lot. Flying with a keyboard unfortunately isn\u0027t ideal. Another thing that may help you are trim controls.
