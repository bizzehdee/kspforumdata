The memory number shown under Processes is the total RAM, physical and virtual. That\u0027s the number for KSP that you need to be aware of.\n\nIf you\u0027re not running a big program, the Kernel and other permanent tasks stay in physical RAM. Load KSP and a lot will be paged to virtual RAM on disk. Something like the background Google Drive app spends most of its time just waiting, but when there\u0027s nothing happening it stays in physical RAM. When you exit KSP, the physical RAM being used by these parts will be much less.\n\n64-bit Windows with enough physical RAM won\u0027t have anything delayed by virtual memory. How much is enough? Going by the address-space limits for 32-bit programs, 8GB of physical RAM should be.

I\u0027ve scratched on 9 GB myself, though I do have 16 in the machine, so...\n\nSome mods are so large, they eat a gigabyte by themselves. And some mods consume practically nothing. People have had installs with over 100 mods in the 32bit days despite the limit of 3.5 GB, but if you try, you can easily consume twice as much with a quarter of the mods. As such, how many you have installed is fairly meaningless. It all depends on each individual mod.\n\nAs for why so much memory use? Because KSP loads all assets into memory at startup, as opposed to unpacking them on demand. This greatly increases memory use, but also shortens load times of scene changes (particluarly entering the editor or a flight scene) and costs less system performance (as long as there\u0027s enough memory available). It\u0027s also simpler to implement... always keep in mind that KSP started as a one-man, learning-by-doing project. And for the scope of the stock game, it\u0027s perfectly adequate even today.
