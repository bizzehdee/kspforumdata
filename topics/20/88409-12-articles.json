I recommend you use Kerbal Engineer Redux or Mechjeb when designing rockets to see what your thrust-to-weight ratio is and how much delta-v you have. Please note that for the first stage you want to look at the sea-level TWR (Mechjeb calls this stat \u0022SLT\u0022). In general it is very recommended that you read the guides on the RO wiki, such as this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki/First-RO-Rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki/First-RO-Rocket\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for going up - everything seems to be OK, in real life (and consequently in RO) getting straight up is pretty easy, it\u0027s what sounding rockets (and many amateur rockets) do. The hard part is getting enough horizontal speed to stay up. Your ship needs to fly at the speed of about 8000 m/s in order to achieve orbit. Considering losses due to gravity and air resistance, this means that your rocket needs about 9300 m/s of delta-v in roder to reach low Earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlito","CreatedById":135536,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T19:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat with the SLT i already found out bye reading in the wiki. i was just suprised watching that small thing going off like that, not used to that.

Are there any TACLS greenhouse mods supported by RO?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETACLS is a tricky beast. \u0022throughout\u0022 the solar system will be a nightmare management wise. I highly recommend you take it one manned mission at a time. A closed loop LS system is from my experience impossible. No matter what you do you cannot get back the same amount of O2 and H2O with the scrubbers and purifiers. So after a period of a few years your resources will dwindle. That being said. You can make some LS blocks that REALLY last a long time with only food being the main concern. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say you want to go to Mars. You need a habitat with enough LS for the trip to and from. And on the surface you need a habitat that can support the Kerbals until the next launch window back home. And that\u0027s it really. LS doesn\u0027t get consumed by probes so once you fly all your LS to your location before sending you kerbals out there things become easier. So its really up to you. You can pack ALL The resources needed for the proper durations. Or experiment with purifiers and scrubbers so you don\u0027t have to pack as much O2 and water. Food you will always need. Theres no greenhouse I know of that can generate it. Waste is another issue unless you use TAC Fuel Balancer ( highly recommended ) and dump it. You can dump all your waste, your co2, your waste water incase you don\u0027t have recyclers and don\u0027t want to pack waste storage. I had to experiment in LEO for awhile with different LS setups to get a system I was confident of to take interplanetary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it failed. I was under the impression that you get the same amount of H20 and 02 back with recyclers, but that\u0027s not the case. I watched my LS time remaining on each resource go up for the longest time thinking that\u0027s it I got a closed loop system. Not the case. Half way out the numbers start to decrease. The crew died of dehydration because I was burning up all my water to make 02 with the sabaiter. The crew themselves obviously consume 02 and produce the C02 you need to recycle it back into 02 ( almost makes me want to try actually bringing C02 with me on the next mission ). And its the same with H20. So it can get confusing. And I often wonder if its worth taking the time to make an efficient LS system as opposed to bringing all your resources in mass like with food needed for the entire trip. Both of which require a LS block of significant size and weight. So idk what the reclycler parts save you... can anyone touch on that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-01T20:06:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2015 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MysteriousSteve","CreatedById":111246,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T04:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes someone know where to find an RL-10?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T17:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew (dangerous) rocket scientist here... but I\u0027m a good pilot though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided to mod KSP with this mod. and installed all the \u0027required \u002B suggested\u0027 mods via Generic Mod Enabler (keeping track of dependencies and versions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway all is working fine \u0027I think\u0027, but (there\u0027s always one of these !!) for a few questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the stock scenarios and tuts crashing (Not the game.. just the ship and game ending as you start).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027d imagine this has something to do with the scale differences between the Kerbal and Real universe ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Are there any similar tuts, educational docs on the Real Mod.. as I\u0027m useless at making rockets, and seriously need some education \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any info..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T19:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MysteriousSteve\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MysteriousSteve\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes someone know where to find an RL-10?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, FASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ColKlonk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ColKlonk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there any similar tuts, educational docs on the Real Mod.. as I\u0027m useless at making rockets, and seriously need some education \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums and the RO community.
