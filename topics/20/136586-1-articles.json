Heck no!) this is the first time in the history of ever in the KSP community that a seperate fork of a mod is being released to circumvent the decision of the original author to not have a release. This I find utterly disrespectful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear I am not against the spirit of open source licenses. I have been part of such an effort myself. I poured many hours, together with blowfish and others, into upgrading B9 Aerospace from Beta to release version. But this B9 maintenance port formed after bac9 himself messaged on this board that he has no further time to keep updating B9. Furthermore we didn\u0027t have an official release until he approved of it. All that we did had his blessing. That doesn\u0027t mean that I think others should never pick up a mod when they do not have the consent of the author. If a mod author hasn\u0027t shown up for 2 - 3 months I think it is fair game to pick up where he or she left off. Even than people on this forum are usually reluctant to do so, because the author might come back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is clearly not the case here. As far as I know people were so desperate for ferram to work on the pre-release that they offered him a steam key as a gift. He refused it because he simply didn\u0027t want to work on multiple unstable releases. That is when a third party steps in and comes to the rescue. That he doesn\u0027t have ferram\u0027s consent is pretty clear when you look at the thread of the fork. ferram says that he will receive no support in getting KJR to work. Making this worse is that this will cause ferram problems down the line as he himself has stated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sorry but this is wrong and I see nothing worth applauding here. We are lucky that ferram has a pretty thick skin. Another author might just decide you know what. You don\u0027t seem to be needing me anymore, so just keep on going without me. I doubt there is anyone in this community who could pick up ferram aerospace if he decided to drop it, but even if it is a mod which is fairly simple and someone else can continue just fine it is no way to treat each other in this community. The licence might not forbid this, but morally it is just crap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay I am done that is all I wanted to say on this matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-10T07:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2016 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Flashblade\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T08:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis Pre-Release thing has made a lot of folks completely bonkers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey seem to forget that this is an extended public beta to fine tune the upcoming official release and not the official finished product in and of itself.
