(but i play the game for the piloting ) im sure the engineering type of player would strongly disagree each to there own i guess"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:27:03Z","Content":"Alternately: weak and strong engines on both parts of the vertical shuttle.

It automatically throttles your engines to ensure that your thrust vector points through your CoM. If you want something more interesting, watch ShimmytheJJ or EJ\\_SA on twitch, they do a lot of shuttles with stock, or near stock designs. Long story short, their designs involve rotating the shuttle engines so that they push towards the CoM, and the thrust vector stays centered. Here is a past broadcast by shimmy that is mostly him tweaking his [shuttle design](http://www.twitch.tv/shimmythejj/v/4660365) to work."}]}
