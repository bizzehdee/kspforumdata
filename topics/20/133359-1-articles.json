For instance,\u00A0I wanted to add more planets, and although the Kopernicus mod is only on the second page, it has no indication of what it does without clicking on it, and clicking on every page to see what the mod does\u00A0is not how I want to spend my time. The \u0022Search\u0022 bar also fails to turn up what you are looking for about 90% of the time unless you know the exact term to search.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tag system is a start, but it needs to do what StackExchange does with tags, instead of typing what you want,\u00A0\u0022weapon\u0022, \u0022weapons\u0022, \u0022weaponry\u0022 are all different tags, that should all be the same. There should be a drop down for adding a tag \u0022Weapons\u0022 \u0022Engines\u0022 \u0022Planets\u0022 \u0022Flight Mechanics\u0022 \u0022Overhaul\u0022 \u0022Gauges\u0022 \u0022Visuals\u0022 etc. and finally custom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also now way (that I know of) to sort the page by tags, and to only show the posts with certain tags. You can click on them, but it also includes search results where the tag name was in a paragraph. For instance, this post will show up if you click on a tag that says plugin, just because I used the word just then!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETLDR;\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E (suggestions for Released Add-ons page)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForce at least one tag choice, because tons of posts have no tag, and the name is not descriptive\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSelect, or recommended tags just like StackExchange\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearching posts via tags\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EIt would improve every mods user base if people could more easily find what they were looking for.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-02T19:15:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2016 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Strikerklm96\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
