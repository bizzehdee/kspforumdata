It would be awesome to have a star wars themed planetary add-on. I\u0027ve seen some youtube videos of star destroyers and stuff but I would love to see planets based on the star wars universe. Going further it would be cool to have places on said star wars planets, like a base on Yavin IV\u00A0or a wrecked star destroyer on Jakku or canyons you can fly through on tat. My love of KSP mixed with my love of star wars would be amazing. Even if this never happens, the thought alone makes me happy! Thanks for reading, may the force be with you and safe flying out there kerbonauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
