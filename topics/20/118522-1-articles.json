That\u0027s basically how asteroids and rescue missions work, except the ship is a single part. Modifying the orbit of that ship after a set amount of time (for example having it transfer to another planet) would also be possible, as would landings or takeoffs, though you\u0027d have to intercept the ship deletion call so it didn\u0027t get deleted in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really hard or impossible would be to have proper fuel usage and staging in the background.
