I never have more than 10\u00A0000 m/s of delta v(I know it\u0027s enough for an orbit but if I want to send something to the moon or a other planet that\u0027s a problem). Did I need something for my engines to fit the mod ? Or did you have any advice to build rockets please ?

Not that you should be surprised that getting enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E into a rocket is hard - it\u0027s the primary bugbear of all Real Life rocketry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general the fixes are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUse more power on your bottom stage so you minimise the amount of energy wasted in lifting the tanks and fuel of the bottom stage. You can achieve this by either swapping the engines for more powerful ones, or adding on bigger/more boosters.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E side-boosters on the bottom stage, then play with using fuel-lines to cross-feed fuel to the core booster. That way, the core stage gets up to some altitude and speed with a full tank of fuel instead of getting there half empty. Yes, the boosters drop off sooner and that can feel wrong, but that way you waste less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E on getting them higher up. (you will need to compensate for the reduced power/weight ration of the core booster by starting with a slightly less aggressive turn, then turn harder once the side boosters have detached.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse lighter engines on mid and upper stages. Lighter upper-stage engines require less energy to get them up, so the lower stages put more of their energy into lifting payload as opposed to lifting upper-stage engines. Higher Isp mid-stage engines can help get\u00A0 the upper stage and payload into orbit more efficiently.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlay with just how much fuel you use in mid- and upper-stages. You may find you have too much fuel higher up than you actually need, forcing the bottom stage to waste fuel lifting that fuel. Counter-intuitively, it turns out that adding fuel to upper stage can be counter-productive! Above all, make sure your payloads have no more fuel than they need to do their job - adjust their fuel loads in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to trim their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to the essentials (plus a wee bit) before launch. For example: an imitation Apollo CSM with a full fuel load will be a real pain to launch:- NASA \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E launched the Apollo CSM with a full load as its engine and fuel tanks were severely over-specified! (Because history.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExperiment with using Real Fuels, and using HydroLox engines. Use RP1/Lox for the bottom stage to give it the best oomph without oversized tanks, and HydroLox for the mid stages to minimise their mass. If you want to play realistically, use hypergolic fuels for your payload engines, ie Apollo-style CSM, otherwise consider using HydroLox.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-21T22:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock parts and stockalike part mods are balanced around smaller scales than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
