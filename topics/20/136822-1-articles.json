Lately, though, I\u0027ve been missing playing in the Kerbol System (especially Minmus), but going back to it, it\u0027s just too dang small and easy! Plus, I really enjoy using real fuels and real engines a lot more than stock. So I was just wondering if any of you are playing RO using the Kerbol 6.4 or 10x system. Which scale do you use and why? Do you also use Outer Planets, and how do the textures look? Is it even compatible? The 10x thread says yes, but the 64K thread makes no mention of OP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, I could just set it all up and try it out, but an RO install can be time consuming to set up and get working properly, so I\u0027m hoping for a little input before I set it all up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
