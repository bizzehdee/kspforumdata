With the new 2.5m liquid boosters in the ARM pack, I can make a 8000 kN core. By comparison, the 3.75m Griffon XX has 4900 kN of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t found an optimal amount of fuel to use, but the 4 Griffons in a core of 2 and 1/4 KW 3.75m tanks can get a positive TWR on a 450 ton payload. All I\u0027d have to do is add boosters until I reached my required delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this as an exercise to see how much I could lift with 3.75m parts, but now I\u0027m just thinking \u0022What am I even going to launch with this?\u0022. The ISS itself weighs 370 tons right now. I have basically made an accidental NOVA rocket for Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s some ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Over three full length 3.75m fuel tanks from KW rocketry. That\u0027s like 30 jumbo orange tanks. Something tells me gathering Kethane from Minmus will be easier. Refueling all those tanks would probably require all the Kethane in the Kerbin system :stick tongue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launch a giant Kethane rig that can drain an entire Kethane deposit in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Launch a FAR compatible 7-Kerbal Eve Launch Vehicle. Yo dawg\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Launch an entire interplanetary base in one go\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Launch a fully fueled mega-tug to deliver that base somewhere in the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Launch a fully fueled mega-tug that can deliver a class E asteroid to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
