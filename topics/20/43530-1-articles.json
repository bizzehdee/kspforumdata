The staging column did not always update correctly, leaving blank spaces from the removed parts. The Center of X indicators were not visible on the craft but much further down in the VAB. After a while serious lagging would start, updating the game every 5-10 seconds, seemingly slowing even more - ALT-4 to the rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know about incompatibilities or bugs in the mentioned mods that might provoke such behaviour of the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
