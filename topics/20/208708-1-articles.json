Some patches are even deleting stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slightly better metric would be to look at the size of the GameData/ModuleManager.ConfigCache file after the game has loaded since this records the actual final information stored in the game database but even on a very heavily modded KSP instance this is unlikely to be more than about 100MB or so (and the space it takes up in game memory may be much less than that). A few large textures will have much more impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main cause of increased memory usage in KSP is models and textures. Some mods that add a lot of parts might use shared textures to reduce their memory footprint (BDB for example) or even reuse the stock textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have memory concerns concentrate on pruning any parts you don\u0027t need/want and making sure to delete any deprecated parts (provided you\u0027re not using them in in-flight vessels). The perma-prune feature in The Janitors Closet by linuxgurugamer can be helpful for this but proceed with care, shared textures and models can cause issues if you delete a part that provided a texture/model that another part you didn\u0027t delete relies on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t worry if adding a QOL mod suddenly makes your patch count jump up considerably. In general QOL mods have very little impact on memory usage compared to parts mods. One exception is Action Groups Extended which adds some large chunks of data to every part which can bloat the size of your save file considerably if you have a lot of vessels in flight - personally I find the trade-off acceptable for the added functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
