There\u0027s conduction, which is heat transfer between adjacent parts across a temperature differential; there\u0027s convection, which is heat transfer between a part and an atmosphere or body of liquid; there\u0027s blackbody radiation, which is heat rejected into the great void of the vacuum; and there\u0027s internal flux, which describes parts generating or removing heat through their own internal functions, or those of nearby parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Parts have a skin (which in turn can have two faces - I don\u0027t know how that works), some internals, and optionally a core. There is conduction flux between all three of those, the degree of which can be configured; also, conduction between parts happens on both the skin to skin level as well as the internals to internals level, but never between cores. A part\u0027s maxTemp field controls how hot both skin and internals can get without the part expoding; there\u0027s probably a way to set it individually too. The core always has its heat cap defined individually. If any of those maximum heat tolerances is exceeded, even for a split second, the part is instantly destroyed. Radiation and convection flux is exclusively happening from the skin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Temperature is given in Kelvin, heat energy is given in kilojoules, and heat flux is given in kilowatts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Skin, internals and core each have a \u0022thermal mass\u0022. It governs how many Kelvin a section increases in temperature when a given amount of heat energy is added to it. Low thermal mass means a part increases in temperature very quickly. Skin has low thermal mass. This is why you need ablative heat shields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- A passive radiator works by simply being a part with great conductive and radiative properties, which causes heat from adjacent parts to easily conduct into it and be radiated away. Note that all parts in the game passively radiate heat; specific passive radiators are just better at it than normal parts. However, Squad has already given all parts very generous self-radiating capabilities. Also, since conduction seeks to equalize temperatures between parts, a passive radiator can never cool a part below its own temperature. This makes them, by definition, the coldest part on the vessel - and they have to be, because otherwise, no heat would flow into them. Since blackbody radiation scales with the fourth power of the temperature, this makes passive radiators very slow, because they always remain at very low temperatures. Should environmental heat affect a passive radiator, they will actually ingest temperature more quickly than any other part, and conduct it into the spacecraft instead of cooling it. In stock KSP, the fixed radiator panels used to be passive radiators. However, due to the points described above, players found them extremely useless and they were made active in 1.0.5. Solar panels still function as passive radiators, however they do want to orient themselves towards the sun, thereby potentially ingesting heat instead of rejecting it. They also lose Ec production efficiency as their temperature increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An active radiator works by checking other parts if they exceed a certain temperature threshold (for stock it\u0027s 400 K, I believe). If a part does exceed it, the radiator creates a negative internal flux in that part, and a positive internal flux of the same value in itself. Thus it steals the part\u0027s heat and transfers it to itself. Using this mechanic, an active radiator can become hotter than the part it wants to cool (in stock, up to four times as hot). This makes them by definition the hottest part on the vessel. Which is great, since blackbody radiation scales with the fourth power of the temperature. A very hot active radiator will reject a huge amount of heat, and will even continue to work (to some degree) in an environment that\u0027s nominally hotter than the vessel itself. All stock radiators currently are active radiators, and consume Ec/s to provide their function. Active radiators with a joint will attempt to orient themselves edge-on to the sun to minimize incoming heat from sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stock radiators have the ability to configure a field called \u0022maxJumps\u0022 in their module, which defines their reach. The field defautls to 0, which makes a radiator operate vessel-wide, able to reach all parts. The extending stock radiators do this. The fixed panels, meanwhile, have a value of 2 max jumps set, meaning they can only reach the part they are attached to, and one jump out from that. This can have advantages or disadvantages, depending on what you want to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cycling back to \u0022core\u0022 heat: As mentioned above, giving a part a core is optional. It is meant for parts which must generate heat during high timewarp, or passively in the background while the vessel is unfocused for extended periods of time. Due to the challenges involved in that, core heat \u0022cheats\u0022 the system, and works separately from it. For starters, all active radiators have a maximum \u0022core transfer\u0022 value, which is far below the radiator\u0027s theoretical capacity. For example, the largest stock radiator can radiate many dozens of megawatts effortlessly, but can only transfer one megawatt worth of core heat. Additionally, even that heat isn\u0027t transferred for real, but internally divided by 100 before transfer. So a large thermal control system fully tapping out its core transfer will show an internal flux of only 10 kilowatts. But because that isn\u0027t complicated enough, using the core transfer function of the radiator saturates some part of its normal (and usually much greater) heat transfer capability, and vice versa; a running rocket engine that produces enough heat to prompt the radiator into cooling it will mean that less than the full core transfer remains available to cool cores, even though the radiator is still cold and not anywhere near maxed out. Parts that use core heat are for example the drills and ISRU refineries; the system was introduced in 1.0.5 specifically for them, because they tended to get screwy under timewarp or straight-up blow up on load in previous versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the brief version \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t know all the details myself.
