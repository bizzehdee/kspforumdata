This includes delta-V budgets, which makes it very worthwhile, but also details like aerodynamic conditions and orbital data.\n\nOf course, if you *also* installed a script to place KER on every command pod and probe core, you won\u0027t need those parts to use KER."},{"CreatedByName":"Delta_scientist","CreatedById":145713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:38:58Z","Content":"Ah, make sense!
