I have lots of questions first off, is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E still somewhat unsupported?

Is manual install still your go to method or not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext my first real big mod choice seems to be life support. Back when I started playing TAC was THE life support and that was it now it looks like two others have grown up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS and Kerblism. I have to admit that less resources put me off somewhat of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E but after some more reading it seems like its not less per say just its all grouped together under supplies. It also seems to work really well with Roverdudes other mods witch are always a treat so it is very tempting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on the other hand we have Kerblism witch seems to be TAC plus other good stuff.
