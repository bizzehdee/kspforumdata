Only issue I have with it is that the ambient stays the same, so your craft is still illuminated, so is the ground and the atmosphere. I would love to see a mod where the ambient light changes for solar eclipses, it would be beautiful. This is why I never notice solar eclipses; the ambient light doesn\u0027t change to signal what\u0027s happening :/\n\nAs far as I\u0027m aware, mods like ambient light adjustment doesn\u0027t do this? I know it let\u0027s you actually adjust the ambient light manually, but I don\u0027t think it does it automatically when a body covers Kerbol. Personally, I think it would be a really nice little mod! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BinaryBad","CreatedById":117229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T13:47:01Z","Content":"Planetshine is a good mod.
