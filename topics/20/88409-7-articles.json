Looking it up, looks like the original Explorer 1 used mostly solid fuel, what kind of fuel are you running out of?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Juno 1 booster is the one running out of fuel. It has both fuel and oxidizer in it. I\u0027ll check again later today to see whether I can get any more information.
