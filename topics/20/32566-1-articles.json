It allows you to just press O to select your maneuver node. It helps *tremendously* when doing interplanetary maneuvers. Also, you can type in delta-Vs for each axis of the node (i.e. prograde/retro, axis N\u002B/N-, and rad\u002B/-) and allows you to change conics mode. The conics modes basically let you view your resulting orbit around your target in a few different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
