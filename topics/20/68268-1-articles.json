I strip ksp down to its bare bones. And I mean strip.. I delete nearly all of Squad\u0027s parts and IVA in favor for mods. And as of late I\u0027ve used procedural parts and MFT for everything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m getting at here is that I have more ram then I know what to do with. So id like to venture into RSS. But the one thing thats been putting me off is the very low level of detail that comes with the stretched out mesh. The textures look bad from orbit and even worse on the ground ( being that there is none.. just.. flat color ) and the featurless landscape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing ksp with 8k textures for a long time now and I gotta say I am spoiled by it. So.. what can be done to make RSS more visually appealing? If I can bring RSS up to stock levels of detail then i think id be fine. I really want to try it, but if every planet is a big ball of blur then.. its not for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I said I have A LOT of ram to play with. My gamedata folder is around 800mb. So with all that room for expansion what can be done to pretty up RSS?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-05T19:28:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2014 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
