Note that for the demo you should find the output\\_log.txt file located in the KSP\\_Data folder.\n\n - Steam users should right click KSP in Steam, click on Properties, then in the Properties box, click Local Files, then Browse Local Files.\n\n Mac OSX: Open Console, on the left side of the window there is a menu that says \u0027files\u0027. Scroll down the list and find the Unity drop down, under Unity there will be Player.log Aka Files\u003E~/Library/Logs\u003EUnity\u003EPlayer.log\n\n Linux: The log is written to /home/user/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T21:53:34Z","Content":"You can at least try to answer the question at hand without accusations or sarcasm. Also, ad.fly links are explicitly forbidden by the [forum rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-July-24-2014).\n\nKAS Version 4.4 is the most recent version for KSP 0.22. AFAICT, it\u0027s only available as source code in [Majiir\u0027s repository](https://github.com/Majiir/KAS/releases)."},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix1583","CreatedById":84915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T02:28:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I paid for the game but those new versions always crash as out of memory on my PC.\n\nI somewhat doubt you\u0027re being honest.
