I would love a mod that simply adds a variety of launch clamps and/or launch pads to the game. The FASA clamps are great, but I feel like there really should be more options available. What about a SpaceX or ESA themed pack? There are no launch clamps (to my best recollection) that lean away from the rocket prior to launch (i.e. two stage clamps). Imagine getting ready to launch your amazing creation and doing the countdown in your head (don\u0027t deny it), and the launch clamps begin to lean away from the rocket (especially if there was some way to show the fuel lines from the clamp stay attached to the rocket and then disengage as the rocket flies away).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may be alone, and I know these parts make up a very small part of the overall experience of the game, but I can\u0027t be alone when I think one of the most fun aspects of the game is creating a rocket that looks gorgeous and sending it to the stars, so why can\u0027t we have more gorgeous looking clamps and pads to go with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has been suggested before, I used the search function and couldn\u0027t find a single thing related specifically to this. So if any talented modders out there feel up for the cause, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll have more than just me as a supporter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T06:14:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shoe7ess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T06:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think SpaceY has some larger launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T07:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-1-0-4-Kerbin-Side-%28v1-0-4%29-Supplements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbinSide\u003C/a\u003E for new Launch Pads \u0026amp; Runways.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoe7ess","CreatedById":114974,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T08:11:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yukon0009\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yukon0009\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think SpaceY has some larger launch clamps.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to see and grab those from that mod depending on how they look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-1-0-4-Kerbin-Side-%28v1-0-4%29-Supplements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbinSide\u003C/a\u003E for new Launch Pads \u0026amp; Runways.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand this, but I\u0027m talking actual parts, not to mention KerbinSide (depending on which additions you choose) can take a lot of RAM, but the basic parts of KerbinSide, at least I believe (may be wrong), started from KerbinKonstructs, which allowed you to create new areas around the KSC.
