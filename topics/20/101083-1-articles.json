I request this mostly to save on parts counts for already mass-heavy part-heavy builds where you would need the extra power from Vernor.\n\nI had attempted to make this in the past, taking the standard 4 port RCS thruster and make it consume LFO, but the issue I ran into is that the it only provides 1 direction of thrust. I do not understand why Squad would limit the RCS module in this manner, esp when it works just fine consuming Mono. \n\nIf a mod-maker takes up this project, could you also please make the module coding robust enough to change the .cfg attributes to say use Electric charge and zenon? or maybe Zenon \u002B ElectricCharge \u002B Mono, for (bad) example (more than just 1 or 2 resources), or maybe even a mode-switch system so that an 4 port RCS thruster can use mono at one ISP and then LFO as a worse ISP?\n\nIf a special RCS thruster-block is needed to be made to accomplish this mod, I would like to ask that the mod-maker try to keep the new part(s) matching the stock aesthetic, but also keeping the design looking aerodynamic as well. Yes, I realize that at the surface of my request, the stock aesthetic for RCS thruster blocks are the furthest things from being aerodynamic, but that is ..not quite.. what I am asking.\n\nI know I maybe asking too much, but thank you in advance for taking up my request.\n\nTLDR: 5 port vernor engine that works properly because Squad\u0027s code for the RCS module is potentially broke and to save on part-count while providing all the benefits of a Vernor engine."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T09:05:55Z","Content":"Or maybe you did not write your config properly and the RCS module already allow for what you want ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Haze-Zero","CreatedById":71279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T09:33:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or maybe you did not write your config properly and the RCS module already allow for what you want ?\n\nIt has been a version or 2 since I attempted it last. I will reconfirm, but perhaps can someone better at .cfg editing than me confirm this as well?\n\nEdit: I have reconfirmed that turning an RCS block into a Vernor-like engine, that burns LFO instead of Mono provides only 1 direction of thrust from the RCS block. Why the RCS Module does this, I do not know. It is possible I am missing something in my cfg editing, but it seems quite straight forward. If I change it back so that RCS block uses a single resource, either mono, or just LF or just Oxi, it works properly from all 4 directions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T10:35:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 10:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T10:59:27Z","Content":"Post your cfg content.

It just doesn\u0027t use multiple thrust transforms/vectors. If you have a 4-way RCS block it only uses one axis. NathanKell mentioned this a while ago; he knows more about it than I.
