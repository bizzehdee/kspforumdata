(some only change simple things, one is in the works to add ablative nozzles to engines and/or electrode wear to ion engines) my question is, i modify stock and modded parts alike. would it violate the license to distribute a mod that changes the overall feel of another mod without explicit permission? and if not, would it be impolite? would most mod makers be ok with it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T19:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say that it wouldn\u0027t violate the license (assuming you don\u0027t bundle the mods together or something), but letting the author of the other mod would be polite.\u00A0 If you\u0027re doing it for a specific purpose, they may even help you.\u00A0 (Heck, depending on the situation they may ask for your configs to add to the mod itself.)\u00A0 Most mod makers would likely be OK with it, assuming you kept it clear which parts were from you and which were the original mod.\u00A0 (Basically: Don\u0027t cause them more support issues.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T14:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA license regulates the rights to use another person\u0027s work.
