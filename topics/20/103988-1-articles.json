I tried it and it is in no way fun anymore for me to launch rockets. However i quite like NEAR :-) \n\nBut i do strugle with planes, let alone Spaceplanes. So i want to ask can i use a FAR craft file in NEAR or will it not fly ?\n\nAlso are there any caveheats i should know about bulding planes in NEAR or is it almost stock like (design wise) ?\n\nThanks\n\nManuxKerb\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T20:34:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T19:23:20Z","Content":"It should.

So the following should apply:\n\nIn NEAR, what flies well subsonic will fly well supersonic.\n\nIn FAR, what flies well subsonic may or may not fly well supersonic.\n\nFrom that I would say that if if flies well subsonic in FAR, it should perform well at any velocity in NEAR.\n\nI could, of course, be wrong ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T19:35:22Z","Content":"From my experience Deutherius is probably right.

The one I posted is the standard version; small Mk2 cargobay and Mk2 docking port. The second is designed for crew; Mk2 crew pod and Mk2 docking port. For the third I had to sacrifice the docking port for the large Mk2 cargobay.\n\nAll three have very similar flying characteristics and can reach Mun/Minmus orbit with relative ease.\n\nThere are only a few mod parts and only a few are tweakscaled.\n\nNormally I rarely share craft but for this one I am willing to make an exception. I\u0027ll see if I can rescale/replace them with stock parts and still retain the design and functionality. But it will have to wait till tomorrow.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T20:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tex\\_NL**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:23:00Z","Content":"Moved to Add-On Affairs."}]}
