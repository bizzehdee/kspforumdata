Instead of having to enable the cheats for weight carried and weight inventoried, could someone plz make a mod that has like an exo-skeleton that the kerbal wears or gets in which will allow you to build entirely ships and bases in space,\u00A0 panel by panel, part by part..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-12T10:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re looking for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204395-1124-simplex-assembly-11/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204395-1124-simplex-assembly-11/\u003C/a\u003E, which effectively allows a Kerbal in EVA to move any part it can lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-12T13:28:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeight and mass are not the same thing: weight is mass multiplied by gravity. Microgravity might make an object have no weight, but its mass is unchanged. For example, if you\u0027ve ever tried to push a car on a flat road you\u0027ll know it takes a lot of effort to get it rolling and to stop it again even though all the weight is going through the wheels- that\u0027s inertia, a property of mass, not weight. Now imaging trying to push a car when both you and the car can move in three dimensions at once,\u00A0 you don\u0027t have the convenience of an entire planet to brace yourself against and with the restricted movement provided by an EVA spacesuit. One wrong move and you could get crushed or seriously injure yourself by stressing your body beyond its limits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I\u0027m aware, KSP EVA construction is limited by weight and not mass so objects that are fine on Kerbin would be too heavy on Eve and in orbit there are no limits at all.
