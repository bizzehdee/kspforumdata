It lets you set alarms for distinct ship events (maneuvers, SOI changes, periapsis/apoapsis, etc.) or even transfer windows to make sure that you never miss one.\n\nNot necessary but it will make your life much easier:\n\n3) [Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-1-0-x-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-2-Updated-05-04-2015%29) -- once you get the gist of it, this tool will let you perform flawless, effortless dockings. What I like about it is that after a while of using it you won\u0027t even need it anymore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T19:36:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:04:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I mean more as a sort of live tutorial by watching and copying how mechjeb does things.\n\nSome people like to use KER for info and also use MJ for other functions. Personally, even when I started, I always preferred MJ over KER, just because it gives me all the info I need and more, and after the 99999 launch you surely learned the game so it gets boring do all the stuff manually (for some).\n\nSure MJ can be a great way to learn, but in my own experience, there is no substitute for doing it yourself (and fail) and learn. \n\nOn the topic, it all depends how hard or easy you want you career game is. Personally I think the levels of difficulty on KSP are lame. I use mods to make my game harder and it\u0027s not the difficulty levels that will make my game harder (just longer grind if you reduce science, rep and money rewards from contracts). \n\nWhen you learn the game, and feel comfortable with it, and, if you are like me lol, discover the amazing mods this community has made, your gameplay will be harder. \n\nIf you want some kind of realism there are many mods that do just that. If you want a easy life, then forget some hard mods out there.\n\nBe aware there are mods that gives you more rocket parts and other stuff and makes rockets a bit overpowered and easy to get into the orbit and other places, in my honest opinion I would stay way from those. But hey, it\u0027s your game!\n\nMechjeb is good for info and automate many thinks, still learn and do it yourself first it will be much more rewarding and when you know how things are done, you do make MJ doing it for you, you can even fine tune many things MJ do. \n\nStay away from visual mods and graphics mods, they are great, and those people made amazing jobs but the memory problems KSP still have with the limitation of 32bits KSP its a pain to run big mods.\n\nSome mods that do not increase or reduce the difficulty (imo) are:\n\nChatter: does not add anything just makes your kerbal talk. \n\nTac fuel balancer\n\nActive texture management (reduce memory usage)\n\nwaypoint manager - great when you do many contracts flying over kerbin.\n\nNav instruments - adds ILS to your ksp, easy to align in any runway to land your planes.\n\nStage recover - Drop your boosters with parachutes and recover part of the funds you spent. This one saves my economy in career.\n\nIm sure there are many others, I also use many more but those makes the game more harder and thats not you want do you? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nMy mod list:\n\nMany here actually makes the game more harder, but much more fun. \n\n![ksp_mods.png](http://s7.postimg.org/e8xojn1ej/ksp_mods.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T16:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kar**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:23:49Z","Content":"The following all improve the ease of use / make the game more tolerable.\n\nAll of these are UI mods:\n\nAction Group Manager - Lets you edit action groups in flight.\n\nAction Groups Extended - Adds tons of action groups, and lots of extra functionality.\n\nFilter Extensions - Makes the part filters better, which makes it easier to find parts.\n\nGPOSpeed Fuel Pump - Balances fuel, takes less effort than TAC.\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - Lets you set alarms. Pretty much necessary if you want to run more than 1 mission at once, don\u0027t like waiting 3 minutes after warping to a node, or similar things.\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - Tells you information that it\u0027s really good to have. Eliminates more frustration than any other single mod.\n\nLanding Height Display - Switches the altimeter to display height above terrain instead of height above sea level, so you don\u0027t crash into mountains.\n\nMenu Stabilizer - Once your mouse is over a menu it won\u0027t move, even if your vessel is spinning.\n\nModule Manager - Lets you tweak quite a lot about the game.\n\nNavball Docking Algnment Indicator - This or docking port alignment indicator are really, really helpful for docking. \n\nNavball Up Default - Shows your navball by default in the map view.\n\nPart Commander - Lets you access all the right-click menus from your parts via a menu, instead of hunting around for them. Especially useful to access parts inside fairings or service bays.\n\nPlane Mode - Swaps the yaw/roll keys as needed. Especially handy if you use a joystick.\n\nPrecise Node - Vastly better maneuver node interface.\n\nQuick Search - Adds a search box to the SPH/VAB parts lists.\n\nRCS Build Aid - Lets you balance RCS/Engines. That makes docking much, much less frustrating.\n\nSAVE - Automatic save game backups.\n\nStock Bug Fix Modules - Fixes a bunch of bugs.\n\nStock Plugins - Removes the need to have a part for Kerbal Engineer, Graphotron, Protractor, MechJeb etc.\n\nThrottle Controlled Avionics - Makes VTOLs and multi-engine landers easier.\n\nToolbar - Reduces button clutter.\n\nTrajectories - Shows your aerobraking/re-entry path. \n\nTransfer Window Planner - If you\u0027re not using KSP-TOT and want to go to another planet, or just need a quick guess, this is the way to go.\n\nWaypoint Manager - Show waypoints from contracts in flight. No more switching to the map while trying to fly a plane.\n\nSome mods that have parts:\n\nAdjustable Landing Gear - Exactly what it says. Lets you easily align your landing gear so that your planes don\u0027t veer off the runway.\n\nProcedural Parts, B9 Procedural Wings, Procedural Fairings - Parts that can be changed in size/shape easily. So instead of 10 different fuel tanks, you use 1 and resize it to what you need. Saves memory if you prune the stock tanks, wings, probe cores, stack decouplers, fairings, etc.\n\nAuto Balancing Landing Leg - Exactly what it says. If you land on a slope it will keep your craft level.\n\nFerram Aerospace Research - More realistic aerodynamics, and GREAT tools to make designing planes easier.\n\nMechJeb - Autopilot.\n\nKerbal Inventory System \u002B Kerbal Attachment System - Among many other things these let you avoid the use of the Advanced Grabbing Unit (Claw). Since the Claw tends to irreparably break savegames, that\u0027s a good thing to avoid."}]}
