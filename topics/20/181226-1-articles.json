Other forum users have a lot of badges to show off too. I can\u0027t fit all of them, lol, so I was thinking about making a website where you can do something like give it a list of badge images and make a gif out of them, or make an overlapping stack image. What do you all think, is this something people would be interested in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-09T06:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a neat idea. How about a site challenge-makers can access and assign badges to your profile. Instead of having badges in your sig, you could have a link to your profile on the site, similar to the KerbalX link in your sig. Perhaps it could be managed AT KerbalX, so we don\u0027t have to have a new account somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-09T09:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223518926\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221547016782\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, FleshJeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps it could be managed AT KerbalX, so we don\u0027t have to have a new account somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, there\u0027s an idea. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/35181-katateochi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002235181\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/35181-katateochi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@katateochi\u003C/a\u003E, what do you think?
