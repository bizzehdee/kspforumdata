I tried to make a small launch vehicle with the J2 Aerospike engine for the first stage. Now, that engine doesn\u0027t have thrust vectoring, which means alternative steering methods were necessary. For the first 40k control surfaces do the trick, after that I decided to use RCS.

Until 40k the aerodynamics overcame that easily, but after that it\u0027s impossible to keep under control, I would need to use some hypergolic verniers, but that will make the rocket less efficient while I\u0027m already having problems making it efficient enough.
