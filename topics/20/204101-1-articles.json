The loading screen won\u0027t show any progress. Removing the pluging made the game run again. So my idea was to get the source code from github (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Vivero/Kerbal-VR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Vivero/Kerbal-VR\u003C/a\u003E) and compile it myself with the 1.12\u0027s libraries, which was successful, but still, the add-on won\u0027t work and the loading screen won\u0027t show any progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid\u00A0anyone manage to get Kerbal-VR\u00A0running on 1.12?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr does anyone have an idea, what to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
