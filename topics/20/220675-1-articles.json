I wanted to try this, so I installed WASD Camera Editor and Hangar Extender. They work but, I can\u0027t get out of the hangar like shown on the cover for the mod on Spacedock.\u00A0 Is there a button of function that comes with the mod, or is going out of the hangar going to need another mod?\u00A0 Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
