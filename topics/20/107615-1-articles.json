I have Near Future Electrical and the one from Aies, but I remember there being a mod out there, stockalike or something similar, which had a wide variety of RTG shapes an sizes. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:36:29Z","Content":"[RLA Stockalike](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90218) has a smaller sized RTG.\n\nMoved this over to General Add-on Affairs as it\u0027s a request for mod recommendations."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:28:35Z","Content":"Sorry about the misplaced thread. I do already have RLA, but it\u0027s not the one I\u0027m thinking about. The mod I\u0027m remembering had 5-7 different RTG\u0027s ranging from a small cube sized all the way up to a couple of meters in diameter. Mostly I\u0027m looking for the variety so I can keep part count down by putting a larger RTG on board instead of multiple smaller ones."}]}
