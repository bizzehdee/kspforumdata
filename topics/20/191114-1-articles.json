However, what sort of mods would you lads recommend for someone seeking to reach, say, another star in-game?

I have gotten all of them to work in 1.8.1 and they do work well together. I would recommend IXS as it gives you warpdrives that are fairly well balanced and can get you to other stars in a short amount of time(I also use TACLS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-25T00:14:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2020 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Aniruddh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diddly Feelerino","CreatedById":116824,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-25T20:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions!
