This would also allow tweakable resource containers for the eventual resource system, without needing separate parts to store each resource type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its good to know that KSPX is still compatible! I thought maybe I had broken the VAB when I tried putting an old and new HECS core next to each other (prompting me to remove all my mods). But now, after reading the forums, I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s just because I had mechjeb pre-installed in my KSPX HECS core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, I miss those mini-ASAS units already.
