Additionally, you can use the mod manager CKAN to automatically download and install mods together with all their dependencies.\n\nThe closest thing KSP has to modpacks are projects like Realism Overhaul, which tell you what mods are recommended for the full experience. You do however still have to install the mods yourself."},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:16:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ll take this chance to remind everyone that ckan supports metapackages, which are essentially modpacks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T12:53:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are there any modpacks like \u0022Tekkit\u0022 or \u0022Hexxit\u0022 for KSP?\n\u003E If not, it would be a great if somebody creates one.\n\u003E \n\u003E A KSP-modpack would be easier to handle for normal users, because they don\u0027t need to search all mods and check all compatibilities and dependencies on their own.\n\u003E \n\u003E The job of the maintainers of a KSP-modpack would be to search good mods, include them into the mod collection and check and fix problems with them.\n\u003E \n\u003E An additional job could be to moderate between modders who are making mods that, for example, should be compatible because of their topics, but they aren\u0027t\n\u003E \n\u003E or to give new ideas for new mods for their modpacks.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is just an idea and maybe someone wants to implement it.\n\nFor the \u0022compatibilities and dependencies\u0022 part of your \u0022modpack\u0022 wish, you can can take a look at conversion mods like the Realism Overhaul or the SETI-BalanceMod in my signature.\n\nOf course they do not provide one download but links to the respective mod threads, as download bundling mods is considered detrimental to the modding effort."}]}
