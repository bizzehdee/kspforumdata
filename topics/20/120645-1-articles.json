A planet that\u0027s in a retrograde orbit with 168 degrees inclination, between Kerbin and Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A planet that\u0027s in a polar orbit around the sun with 80 or so inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A planet with extremely eccentric orbit that stretches far beyond Eeloo, with the periapsis similar to Dres. Better catch this one while its close to its periapsis!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt Vax","CreatedById":149558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T17:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould also be nice to have planets that destroy your probes after a certain time if not properly shielded, kinda like Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
