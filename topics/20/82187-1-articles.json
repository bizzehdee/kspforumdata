I wanted to ask if anybody knew how this was done and my mod idea, so I know if its even plausible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was planning on making a very large parts pack, but due to my own game development on an indie team, I\u0027ve had to put that ambitious project aside for the time being. So I decided to take a bit of a smaller one. (I hope) until time opens up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering how you can make anomalies on planets. As you know the game developers have \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Eput anomalies themselves, such as the black tile like things, the kraken, and the pyramids, and such\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Please do NOT turn this into a flame war or anything. There are alot of interesting things out there, and whether you believe them or not is entirely up to you, but for the sake of enjoyment, mystery and adventure, I\u0027ll consider them all 100% real in the Kerbal universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were things I wanted too add for players to find in another mod I wanted to add aside from my star wars extensive, super advanced item pack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving played KSP for over a year now, and having started, and restarted about 100 campaigns, its getting.. well a little dull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod is essentially to add anomalies. Anomalies which people have accounted for, seen, or thought exists in our real system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe anomolies naturally would focus on mainly the Mun, Duna(Mars), of course the Kerbal homeworld. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things I wanted too add are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerban\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Black Knight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Underwater pyramids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- UFO\u0027s under ice \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna(Mars) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pyramids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Small \u0022ruins\u0022 or very tiny square like chunks of rock, looking like possibly 600,000 yr old ruins or \u0022something\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Many many many many other anomalies reportedly seen in mars photo\u0027s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Many other idea\u0027s I have for other planets or moons, some very obvious, and some, you could miss 10x over before you have the \u0022Eureka\u0022 moment of spotting it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted the mod to be compatible with another mod which lets you scan the surface of planets, both for anomalies, and high/low area\u0027s, helping you spot ridges, or possible \u0022buildings\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not even sure this is possible though. I\u0027ve looked at Planet Factory, however that seems to be more about creating the planet as a whole, rather than editing the surface in a fine tuned way. (maybe I\u0027m wrong). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just have no idea how I\u0027d go about adding anything to any of the planets, or where to start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T09:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite good idea you have Lady Athena, but, there is a but sorry, planet editing feature is \u0022locked\u0022 I may said and Squad never talk AFAIK about releasing whatever they have used to create the bodies in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbtown can be use to put static objects but they will never be count as anomaly by mod like ScanSat and I have look a bit at ScanSat source code, anomalies are quite a \u0022magic\u0022 thing, don\u0027t know where they comes from at all !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd PF (CE, PF has been burried a while ago for some reasons) is quite too \u0022drafty\u0022 (editing text file to add bodies... is a bit ridiculous and there is no way to just take existing stock bodies and add or remove some of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally underwater things are only viable if we can use some boat parts, as water is not like real water as it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, unless some magician come and do a magic plug-in that do the job, I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to keep your enthusiasm for something else or lower your expectations a little bit.
