In fact I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the onboard GPU is not the bottleneck. KSP is also very much dependant on the sort of activity you\u0027re doing and what you\u0027re doing it with. Nobody gets smooth performance with a 500 part monster on the launch pad \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther games will definitely benefit from a proper GPU. The 950 or 970 suggested above will be good for most cases - just not really needed for KSP ^^;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
