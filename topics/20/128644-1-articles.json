Say, after the warp drive, and after figuring out how to get energy from vacuum space, or from an alternate universe (zero point energy). What I am suggesting is a mod to allow a player to create a tunnel between two points, and travel between planets instantaneously. This could work much like the Stargate series, or even like the Portal Game.
