When I\u2019m not pulling the trigger, it says I have no ammo. When I am, it says I have full ammo, but it still doesn\u2019t shoot. Can anyone help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-03T21:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[MOD - Moved to KSP1 Mods Discussions subforum]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
