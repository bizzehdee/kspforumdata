Think of it as IKEA for spaceflight: You get the flat-pack box from the store, then assemble in-place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtraplanetary Launchpads is a bit more far-future: It models you being able to set up an entire production chain off-world, so you don\u0027t have to send anything from home, although you can.\u00A0 You can build on planets or in-space, wherever you want, as long as you get the materials to your launchpad - and again, those materials don\u0027t have to come from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, starting with Ground Construction and building up the capability to do EL makes sense.\u00A0 (Though it should be a longer process between the two than it is at the moment.). Both have strengths and weaknesses, and they compliment each other well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to note: Ground Construction is in the process of being integrated to work with MKS - as a part of that, it\u0027s building resource is going to change in the next release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
