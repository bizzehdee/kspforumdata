If you are using solar power, test what happens after adding a bunch of RTGs or other non-solar power to your refinery. That would let you know whether it\u0027s a solar panel issue or something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat prior folder copy suggestion also lets you try brute force by uninstalling half your mods. Test. If the problem continues re-copy to bring those mods back and uninstall the opposite half of your mods. Once you find which half triggers the issue, then cut that half in half, repeat, and after many copies you\u0027ll get to a specific mod that triggers the issue (if you\u0027re familiar with computer science terms, it\u0027s like a \u0022binary search\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OldMold","CreatedById":102700,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-06T03:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMystery solved - SystemHeat\u0027s Extras patches to make ISRUs use the SystemHeat system.
