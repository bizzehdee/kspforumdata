I didn\\\u0027t use Kosmos for a long time (15 minutes, game crashed yesterday ;P) but I think some of the engines also run on RCS. And they are for space stations, not lift off. If you want Kosmos-style launch vehicles, try their Angara parts."},{"CreatedByName":"jyoumon","CreatedById":13365,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:07:07Z","Content":"heh, i know its not a bug ^\\_\\_^, im trying to circumvent the and modify, its what mods are for right?\n\neitherway, i know they were \u0027built\u0027 for Spacestations, but they have GREAT application ability in other places, but i want to know...if its possible from a modding point of view to make them compatible with other engines and stuff.\n\nEven if it means tweaking a few parts.cfg files \\*grins\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:17:41Z","Content":"Of course, but aren\\\u0027t there enough different engines in Down Under and Nova(Slug)Punch?\n\nI really think about writing a program that compares all the engines and prints that to a text file...\n\nHowever it could be difficult if the program searches for .5m engines and the part description says \u0027BETTER THAN ALL .5m ENGINES HAHA PWN\u0027 ???"},{"CreatedByName":"jyoumon","CreatedById":13365,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:25:07Z","Content":"Hmmm i think i may have solved at least one piece of my puzzle.\n\nGoing through parts .CFG\\\u0027s i found that the Kosmos fuel tanks only have one additional line added \u0027Type: Pure LH2\u0027\n\nIm thinking if i delete this line..it will work with normal fuel tanks and engines too!\n\nthough if not..ill find out soon"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:29:59Z","Content":"No ti won\\\u0027t work. You also have to change MuMechVariableTank to the default FuelTank type. ANd you have to change fuelType for the engines to \u0027liquid\u0027 to make them drain normal fuel. Or to \u0027rcs\u0027. Or \u0027apple juice\u0027, but then you whould have to change the tanks too ;P (this only works with engines, not tanks)."},{"CreatedByName":"jyoumon","CreatedById":13365,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:35:14Z","Content":"So basicly, unless the parts are manually modified and reuploaded (probably as another pack) then the idea is pretty much useless?"},{"CreatedByName":"jyoumon","CreatedById":13365,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:48:36Z","Content":"WOOT, thanks man! with a little tweaking to the CFG files i have added a new brand of fuel tanks to my Rockets inventory!\n\njust tested a few tweaks and its MARVELOUS!"}]}
