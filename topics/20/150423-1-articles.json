I tryed it allready by installing one by one, in different order and so on. It just appears at random when i am half way through installing the mods and i cannot pinpoint if the issue is duo to a mod, a compatibility issue or just some kind of weird graphic related bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, long story short, my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI starts to flicker when i try to build rockets. Flicker in that way, that it seems like a second gui without buttons appears and then dissepear again after i move the mouse. It\u00B4s incredibly annoying.
