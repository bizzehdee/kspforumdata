It was an incredibly overpowered reaction wheel, I think it was called a small stabilizer. It was red and grey and worked like a charm. After I reinstalled all my mods again I can\u0027t seem to find it or what mod it was on. Not sure if it was an update that lost it or what, but really miss my old planes and its usefulness. Does anyone know what I\u0027m talking about. Let me know if you know what mod it came with. I don\u0027t think it was new reaction wheels, as that mod is the same version I uninstalled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-28T05:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198496-jtwilson44/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022198496\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198496-jtwilson44/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jtwilson44\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have moved your question to add-on discussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
