I would also like to know if I can scale up the animation to fit the 2.5m part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T16:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi to change the FX of mainsail to Ion you would simply copy the fx references\u00A0 from the ion to the mainsail, though as the mainsail still uses module engines and the ion engine uses module engine FX this leaves you with two alternatives.\u00A0 i notice that ION plume is still ref\u0027d in the FX folder\u00A0 so you may be able to simply swap the fx_exhaustLight_blue to IonPlume.\u00A0\u00A0 Although i have a suspicion that wont work out too well. The best option is to convert your mainsail to module engines FX and use the ion FX cfg block.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you can change how much is emitted from exhaust FX,\u00A0 the fx particle model is a fixed size and can only scale with an engine, there is no facility to scale FX size independently as the fx model has no cfg of it\u0027s own\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
