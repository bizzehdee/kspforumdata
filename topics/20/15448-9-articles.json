Mercury missions were flown from the ground, though the astronaut had manual overrides available. They had to fight NASA for those, as shown in an overly-dramatized scene in The Right Stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGemini missions were a mix, with the Gemini 8 orbital maneuvers calculated from ground then flown by-hand, but the approach for docking was fully automated by radar from 100 km leaving them stationary with the Agena target at 50 meters. The actual docking was manual, but consisted of a single, short forward burn. The automation had lined them up perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGemini 10 tried calculating a rendezvous by-hand with a sextant and failed completely. The windows weren\u0027t transparent enough to use hand-held instruments. Timing, attitude and burn duration were calculated by radar with ground-based mainframes, and instructions transmitted by radio. But their attitude drifted a bit during the burn, and that tiny inclination error meant this ground-assisted manual rendezvous and docking used up 60% of the RCS fuel, rather than the single pulse needed last time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo added not only a built-in sextant but on-board computers that do pretty much everything MechJeb can do. Every command was a 4-digit number, though, so it isn\u0027t as friendly. Course corrections were calculated by mainframes then radioed to the spacecraft. Lunar module landing was completely automated from parking orbit to 600m, when it went into an automatic hover mode that let the astronaut move horizontally to choose a landing site. Landing from there was called \u0022manual\u0022 but the computer was keeping the LM upright and buttons were preset for functions like \u0022kill velocity\u0022 and \u00223fps descent\u0022. Moving the joysticks gave the computer direction, which it then translated into RCS pulses. All that automation didn\u0027t make it easy, only possible. NASA\u0027s experiences with the Lunar Lander Research Vehicle convinced them full manual control would never be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA paper describing what \u0022manual landing\u0022 in the lunar module really meant is available here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/LM.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/LM.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle had, for the very first time, a fully hands-on landing, and while astronauts loved it NASA hated it.

But to be fair, I don\u0027t think that the automated systems in KSP are that much better than us human pilots. I can give you at least one solid example showing that human pilots are entirely capable of flying better than MechJeb: Check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/12869-Optimal-Ascent-Profile-for-this-spacecraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOptimal Ascent Profile for this spacecraft\u003C/a\u003E challenge. The top three entries in the non-MechJeb category beat the best MechJeb assisted entry at that challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for the Protractor mod, what people forget is that in the real world, your navigation systems are only as good as the accuracy of your position measurements. There is no uncertainty in the position measurements displayed by MechJeb and Protractor because the values they display are taken directly from the game. By contrast, ground controllers and the crew aboard Apollo 8 weren\u0027t entirely sure that they wouldn\u0027t hit the moon rather than fly by it when they flew there in 1968. This was despite the fact that they had all of their computers, automation and some of the smartest people in the world managing the flight. Even the stock game\u0027s map view eliminates that uncertainty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-19T16:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue on both but ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, when I was talking about automation being better, I\u0027m not saying that it is more efficient per se ( not even in real life ).

Alternatively we have a big radio dish in KSC 1 and 2 for some reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E That is why I said that both mod were stopping gaps: they aren\u0027t what should be there, but they are covering for faults of a game that is far from complete.
