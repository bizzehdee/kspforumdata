So the title pretty much says it, I started the game with Kopernicus and all the instructed mods in the folder that evolution mod comes with, but only the normal ksp planets are there. Evolution is working because i see the vortex around the sun, so why aren\u0027t the planets loading?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheLoneMartian","CreatedById":190956,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-03T16:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a quick look on the website, it says that the mod is out of date. You most likely are using 1.4.5, when the mod is made for 1.3.1. So I am sorry, but it is looking pretty much unusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
