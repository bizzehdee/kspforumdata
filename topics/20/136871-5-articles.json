They have near absolute right to do what they please with their work, whether that is to share it openly, share it privately, share it on whatever terms they feel are fair, or not share it at all. If they choose to withdraw their work from the community it is their right to do so in as smooth or abrupt a fashion as they desire, and we have literally no leverage to prevent them from doing so, nor should we. If we load up volunteers with onerous obligations we will get far fewer volunteers. It\u0027s nearly impossible to keep someone from quitting a job for which they are not paid, and taking their work with them. It\u0027s really as simple as that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing is: Volunteers should share with the community and make provisions for their work to continue. They are not obligated to do so, but it\u0027s bad for the community when they don\u0027t. In an ideal world, every modder and site operator would continue volunteering for as long as a project interests them, find a suitable successor if they do move on, and use permissive licensing so that their projects can continue if they get hit by a bus or something. This isn\u0027t some legal obligation, it\u0027s just a good thing to do. This is a higher standard of behavior than what is required of a volunteer (due to the first point above), but we really want them to follow it. Because it\u0027s awful when good things are taken away or allowed to die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that brings us to the third thing: We can encourage volunteers to share with the community and make provisions for their work to continue. If we want them to hold themselves to a higher standard of behavior, we need to hold ourselves to one, too. By far the best way to make a volunteer want to share their work with a community is to make that community one they want to share with. This goes beyond common civility and the crass stuff covered by the community rules, this is an effort that users must make above and beyond that. So what can we do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nContribute. If you have skills that are applicable (modelling, texturing, coding, writing CFGs, web development, etc), help out with your favorite project if you can. Good contributors also often make good successors when a project changes hands.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHelp with support. A lot of mod threads and such are filled with new users asking repetitive questions that can be answered by more experienced users, if you can answer one confidently then do so. That\u0027s one small bit of the support workload gone, so the volunteer can focus on more difficult things.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGive useful, friendly feedback. If a project is good, tell them so and why. If you have criticism, make it constructive and detailed. If you find bugs, make your report thorough and include logs and all other relevant info. Offer useful suggestions on ways their work could be even better.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpread the word. Community projects live on word of mouth, if you like one tell others about it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t nag or pester, ever. Every time someone makes a demand, that\u0027s one more straw on the back of the volunteer, one step closer to the day they decide to stop.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEncourage open licensing. Use and support permissively licensed mods over restrictively licensed ones, where possible. Don\u0027t make hostile forks. Honor the wishes of the modder even if they\u0027re beyond the letter of the license, lest they choose a license that is more restrictive.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuy a volunteer a coffee. If your circumstances allow, throw some cash to those volunteers whose work you enjoy, if they have donate links.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we want volunteers to treat our community well we have to treat them well. If we want high standards from them we have to hold ourselves to high standards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR:\u003Cbr\u003E\nVolunteers can take their ball and go home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nVolunteers shouldn\u0027t take their ball and go home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nVolunteers can be encouraged not to take their ball and go home, by making them want to keep the game going.

they will come back to you.\u00A0 Then those support requests result in valid support requests being buried, hindering tracking down info for bugfixing and just causing general frustration.\u00A0 And frankly, you don\u0027t gain all that much by using an open license;

It was unique, pre-cursor to SCANsat... It kind of got left in limbo (and even tho it had an open license, and I could be wrong about the following part), and yet the idea was picked up by another, and out of that came SCANsat... ( I dont recall whether any of the ISA Mapsat code was used for SCANsat, but I think there were large differences between the mods)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy point is, even in the worst case scenario, the torch, the IDEA, at least, of a deceased mod can be picked up by another, and another mod that fills the void of the original is available to all, and there is much rejoicing in the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo those that are worried about the disappearance of their favorite, MUST have mod... Dont Worry, Be Happy... If it was that great a mod, it WILL be replaced...
