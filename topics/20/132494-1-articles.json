When you download Realism Overhaul and its recommended mods, you get some new agencies in career mode. the most common agency I\u0027ve seen so far in Realism Overhaul Carrer mode youtube videos is FAI(Federation Aeronautique Internationale). However, I can never seem to get that agency when I download Realism Overhaul and all the other mods that are recommended with it. Does anyone know which Mod adds this new agency to the game?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T20:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wan to play career in RO, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/93045-105-realistic-progression-zero-rp-0-lightweight-realismoverhaul-career-v042-dec-28\u0022\u003Eyou need RP-0\u003C/a\u003E..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C1DEAN","CreatedById":158627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T20:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the very quick answer Nathan :). I have RP-0 installed already. what I was asking is\u00A0there a certain mod that adds the FAI agency to the game, or does RP-0 modify\u00A0the stock agencies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: sorry for all the commotion. just got the agency when i loaded the game\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T00:44:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by C1DEAN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
