Constructed using titanium, aerospace grade aluminium and built like an item that really was going to be flown on a real spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you have the control system work ? I have given up on using a joystick with KSP because the interface is buggy. Or was, I gave up in about 0.19 and haven\u0027t tried again. So I\u0027m thinking switches to provide keypresses rather than potentiometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to switch between fine and coarse controls ? - there are two obvious ways, having the controller use a single set of switches and selecting the mode with a seperate switch on the unit. Or more complex have a second set of switches built into the controller - moving the hand control slightly out of the detent fires fine thrusters, further movement fires coarse thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas from the community ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking about making a very limited run of controllers for sale, to defray the costs of the first one. Would anyone be interested ? The units wouldn\u0027t be KSP specific, you would be able to use them with any sim. They wouldn\u0027t be cheap though, given the amount of machining involved and the materials used. Would be pretty cool to own however...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T16:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a simple plugin, you can feed flight controls directly to the game instead of mucking around with keypresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sid","CreatedById":72855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T16:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interface will be a commercially available USB board designed for people who want to use their own custom hardware with a sim. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the default mapping is in place it can send a \u0027W\u0027 to command pitch up.
