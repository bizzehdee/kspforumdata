That checkbox tells the simulator to apply pedals when you are into a curve, to keep it coordinated, a task a pilot usually would do himself, if he had pedals at all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real world, the yaw damper system in airliners do the same trick, besides preventing dutch rolls. Airliner pilots (and the autopilot for instance) fly with pitch and roll maneuvers (yoke or stick), and let the yaw for the computers, unless they need compensate for some external factor, like crosswinds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ask, there is (or somebody can make) a mod that have this nice checkbox to help fly our contraptions in a coordinated manner while in atmosphere? Of course, this kind of help is not necessary while in space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks you all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T14:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using FAR, there is a damper there you can manually tune, somewhere around flight assist sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr try fly-by-wire from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124417-11-atmosphereautopilot-152/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E, it should kill dutch roll alright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FellipeC","CreatedById":77983,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222536137\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137969\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461506696\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boris-Barboris\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Boris-Barboris said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using FAR, there is a damper there you can manually tune, somewhere around flight assist sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr try fly-by-wire from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124417-11-atmosphereautopilot-152/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E, it should kill dutch roll alright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow that was a bit overkill with so much options but it did exactly what I want!
