Instead of plopping a small exhaust nozzle at the end of your fuel tank and suddenly you fly, it has a part that takes the normal resources for that engine, but then outputs Thrust. Thrust is then used for the jet engine or the veneer engines. I really hope that someone can develop this mod into a fully developed one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can, thank you.
