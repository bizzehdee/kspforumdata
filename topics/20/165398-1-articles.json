Does anyone know which mod this is and where I\u00A0can find it? \u00A0I think it was just the part in the mod. \u00A0Even if it was never completed I may be able to finish it myself\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts radially mounted, and it folds in, it rotates 90 degrees back into an indentation in the base so it sits against the side of the ship flat, its streamlined. \u00A0I definately remember seeing the model so I know that part was finished. \u00A0Its brilliant but I cant seem to find it again\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-11T22:04:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2017 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by At4851\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding extra info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
