Is there a mod or a method that will allow me to predict when exactly my satellite will be over that biome? I believe it is a very small biome, so it would be difficult to just wait and watch for when I happen to be over the biome.

The thing is, the measurement has to be taken while high in space from this particular satellite that launched from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E whose orbit is about 87 degrees inclined and is very eccentric. I know that eventually the sat will pass over WBI but that it could take hours or days and will only be over WBI for a few seconds, so I\u0027m trying to predict when that will be. I guess the alternative is to use kerbalism, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, or some mod that makes the science experiment continuously take readings, but I really don\u0027t want to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-13T11:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalism won\u2019t help you here- gravity scans take 14 days so it\u2019ll take literally \u003Ci\u003Eyears \u003C/i\u003Eto complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, if you\u2019ve fulfilled every other contract parameter I think it\u2019s acceptable to use the alt\u002BF12 cheat menu to complete the contract- trying to get an experiment done in space high over a biome that\u2019s only a few square kilometres in total on a planet the size of JNSQ Kerbin is nearly impossible no matter how you go about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joontry","CreatedById":210169,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-13T12:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you. I\u0027m running Principia also. Sure, I could just cheat to finish the contract. But then I\u0027d miss a chance to learn something and I\u0027m more interested in that than finishing the contract quickly. How exactly would you predict when a satellite in a near polar orbit will be directly over a particular set of coordinates in real life? I get that the math involved is probably quite difficult. Is it possible to make a mod that would apply that same method to solving a similar problem in KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-14T16:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrincipia?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u00A0You\u2019re on your own\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoking aside, SCANsat might help you- if you make a biome map of Kerbin, you could use that to see the probe\u2019s trajectory over the surface and find a time when it crosses over Welcome Back Island that way; no idea if it works with Principia though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the contract require that specific satellite to do the gravity scan, or can you just launch anything up there into an equatorial orbit with a much better chance of passing over WBI and get the scan done that way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Morphisor","CreatedById":202433,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-18T12:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI concur with Jimmy, Scansat is your best bet.

I had already used the alt-shift-f12 and completed the contract though. But now that I have a complete biome scan with SCANsat and have used it a bit, I realize you are correct that looking at the trajectory on a SCANsat biome map and its zoomed-in map, warping until that trajectory crosses WBI, then trying to come out of warp and do the experiment right at the moment I\u0027m over WBI, would be the closest thing to a best solution. Good call on the molniya orbit! That would make the mission take much less in game time. I think the contract required that the specific satellite do the scan and that it have a very polar orbit though (80-100 degrees ish, too polar for molniya). I\u0027ve used the SCANsat biome map while running Principia to execute a few other experiments over small biomes like \u0022shores\u0022 and it works fine. It seems like a possible new feature for SCANsat would be to tell you when your orbit\u0027s trajectory over the surface will come within a given distance of a particular set of coordinates, since it already seems to be doing much of the math required to answer that question.
