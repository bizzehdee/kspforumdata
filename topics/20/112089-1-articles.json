Not to mention all the other tools at their disposal. While the spacewarp engine from the show has already been invented by the USI Exploration Systems, the KSC finds the idea of using the vintage mystery goo and materials laboratories to be a quaint and old-fashioned idea. They realize that the crew of the USS Appleprise uses Tricorders, Phasers, and advanced Sensor devices. And yes, this is no doubt going to be very Over-Powered.\n\n***--LANDING PARTY PACK--***\n\n***TR-C01 Handheld Scicorder***\n\nA leather and metal purse filled with some of the most advanced miniaturized sensor equipment available.\n\n![86JwevT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/86JwevT.jpg)\n\nIt is a handheld science experiment with high science value. Data can transmit for as much as it can be recovered. It includes four science experiments.\n\n*Planetological Scan*\n\n--A scan of the surface chemistry, geology(planetology), and atmospheres.\n\n*Anomaly Scan*\n\n--When near an anomaly, the scan will get a reading on the interior structure and allow a detailed analysis of it.\n\n*Crew Log*\n\n--A personal report on the conditions of the situation. A more biased and detailed Crew/EVA Report.\n\n*Astrometrical Scan*\n\n--A scan of the other celestial bodies in the immediate system, (Duna from Ike, or Tylo from Laythe), and what effect the other objects have on the planet the scan is being taken from.\n\n***CM-SF1 Commicatronationalizer***\n\nA small handheld antennae to transmit science data back to the main spacecraft/KSC.\n\n---Remotetech compatibility: It is omnidirectional and has a small range. (No larger than Eve\u0027s diameter \u002B300 km [10000km])\n\n*Appearance: (no picture), basically identical to the original Star Trek communicator, but with a few exaggerations.*\n\n***Type II Hand Phazor***\n\nA handheld aimable device that can be used to heat up (vaporize) rocket parts or Kerbals, or stun Kerbals (make them ragdoll for a certain time). Totally not a gun.\n\n![B8ScY43.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/B8ScY43.jpg)\n\n*Stun Mode*\n\n--Disables solar panels, drains batteries/probe cores, and leaks fuel tanks, and pops tires, and ragdolls Kerbals for five minutes.\n\n*Torch Mode*\n\n--Heats up parts, totally empties resource containers, destroys solar panels and tires, and ragdolls Kerbals for two days.\n\n*Vaporize Mode*\n\n--Destroys any part, and has a 20% chance of destroying a connected part. Poofs Kerbals into death.\n\n***--DEEP SPACE PACK--***\n\n***TR-1701 Inline Sensor Pod***\n\nA sciencey thing that provides an orbital version of the Scicorder Astrometric and Anomaly Scan, and also allows the vessel tracking to be extended to two gigameters. (i.e, the green HUD marker will appear as far as a gigameter away. It is a 1.25m device, and is designed to be attached to spacecrafts. It requires a scientist onboard the vessel to function.\n\n***LZR-24 High-Power Phazor***\n\nA phazor beam generator capable of creating a large enough blast to vaporize an entire unshielded vessel. It can also be tuned down much like the Hand Phazor.\n\n***PDD-TP Hitchhiker Telematerialization Module***\n\nA crew pod which is capable of transporting up to seven Kerbals down to the surface of a planet at a specific point that has been selected (kind of like the UI for when MechJeb asks you to pick a landing site). It can also beam up to seven Kerbals up from the surface into the ship. Note, that the Telematerialization Module has a very very high power requirement. (Say, one of the largest NearFuture nuclear reactor to do one materialization of seven Kerbals. Of course, you have batteries, but, with any less than that it would be impractical)\n\n***KLW-REPL Traction Beam***\n\nA device that allows you to cause a targeted vessel to be attracted to your current position. It will also bring you closer to it without any corrective thrust. Also available is Repel mode.\n\n***S.H.I.E.L.D. System***\n\nA device that produces an energy-powered shield to protect from any objects entering it, as well as phazor blasts. Phazor blasts will drain the shield of ShieldEnergy, which can be regenerated using ElectricCharge.\n\n![BI0p0rvl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BI0p0rvl.jpg)\n\n(All of this art is pretty old)"}]}
