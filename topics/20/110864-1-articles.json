(Stock ones and the ones in the US Soviet solar panel pack aren\u0027t near anything to this scale)![ISS.jpg](http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ISS.jpg)Can anyone make solar panels like the one above (orange ones) or refer me to a place to find them? Much appreciated. (Sorry about the large image)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T05:58:48Z","Content":"KSO has them but it a good size mod [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68429-0-90-Kerbin-Shuttle-Orbiter-System-v4-13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68429-0-90-Kerbin-Shuttle-Orbiter-System-v4-13) And NearFutureSolar [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed%29) has some big blue ones and KOSMOS [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99168-KOSMOS-3-14-2015-RD-170-Family-Released](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99168-KOSMOS-3-14-2015-RD-170-Family-Released)!\n\nEDIT- The KSO is the only ones that color, I have seen."},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T06:21:45Z","Content":"NearFutureSolar looks like it has a good one.
