While watching Prometheus the other night the thought struck how perfect it would be to create a plugin that allows you to recreate the missions in the Prometheus and Aliens storylines. It would be absolutely incredible to recreate the Aliens universe in KSP.

So I suggest the following. I will need to create a new system that is ridiculously far from Eeloo, so basically this would be effectively end game expansion. I intend to model the entire Zeta 2 Reticuli System for inclusion so you could theoretically explore other moons as well as your primary objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZeta 2 Reticuli is a wide binary star system in the southern constellation of Reticulum, 39.17 light years from Earth and the location of LV426 (Prometheus) and LV223 (Aliens), both planetary bodies are around separate gas giants in and near the binary star system (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prometheus.wikia.com/wiki/File:Zeta_Reticuli.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee image link\u003C/a\u003E).\u00A0Although LV426 and LV223 are around separate Gas Giants with about a 1/7 of the diameter, LV426 is quoted as having a diameter of 1200kms (LV426 in an early Alien script was quoted as having a diameter of 120km) this would make the Gas Giant have a diameter of 8400kms, making it much smaller then Earth (12700kms), the same can be suggested for LV223.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLV426 like LV223 are the largest planetary bodies around separate gas giants in the binary star system known as \u0027Zeta Reticuli\u0027 comprising of Zeta Reticuli and Zeta 2 Reticuli. LV426 is the nearest planetary body to a gas giant and LV223 is the second nearest around the star Zeta 2 Reticuli.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to The Weyland Timeline LV426 is just outside Zeta 2 Reticuli system.\u00A0Zeta Reticuli is the Bayer designation for a wide binary star system in the southern constellation of Reticulum 39.17 light years from Earth.\u00A0A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. The brighter star is called the primary and the other is its companion star or secondary.\u00A0LV426 is named \u0027Acheron\u0027 in an early draft of the script Alien. Notably Fiorina \u0027Fury\u0027 161 was called \u0027Aceron\u0027 in an early draft for Alien 3.\u00A0As of 2010 it is understood that the stars are only orbited by a circumstellar debris disk.\u00A0Although LV426 and LV223 are around separate Gas Giants with about 1/7 of the diameter, LV426 is quoted as having a diameter of 1200kms (LV426 in an early Alien script was quoted as having a diameter of 120km) this would make the Gas Giant have a diameter of 8400kms, making it much smaller then Earth (12700kms), the same can be suggested for LV223.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDISCOVERY OF ACHERON LV-426, MAY 14, 2039\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeyland astronomers discover multiple moons and a ringed planet just outside the Zeta 2 Reticula System, which are possibly able to support life.

No oxygen, little to no usable water and no gravity make life hard. So with this in mind I think we will need to explore full life support and cryogenics/stasis systems for Kerbals. After all, in both Prometheus and Aliens our irstwhile explorers awake from cryogenic sleep prior to their adventures.
