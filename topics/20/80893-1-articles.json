You could have your \u0022team\u0022 approved to work on your mod\u0027s tickets and if the user is REALLY insistent on seeing the \u0022manager\u0022 then they can escalate it to the modder him/her self. I do not know if my personal experience is worth anything, but my agency receives thousands of tickets and of those 5\u002B thousand I only know of one where the user wanted \u0022the manager\u0022 and it was resolved easily. Now all this is based on using a ticketing system where the modders \u0022team\u0022 is identified and legitimized by the system itself.

Again, if you use github this is only a matter of getting the support people to sign up for github, and setting them as collaberators on the repo, and convincing users to sign up to. There are a lot of other bug trackers and wikihosts if you don\u0027t want to leverage on github, I\u0027m not sure if there are any bug trackers that support anonymous(accountless) reporting though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
