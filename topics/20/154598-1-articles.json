I want to script multiple scripts to achieve an Apollo style Landing on the moon and to do this I have decided on the scripts I want to make.. The first one is the auto-launch program where the craft goes up to 5 - 10 km then preforms a gravity turn and is put on a heading until the objective altitude is reached then it coasts to Apogee then makes the circularization burn I also want it to script the\u00A0if negative vertical velocity to trigger the abort action group and switch to a file that contains procedures for the abort to jettison the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003Eles\u003C/abbr\u003E and to deploy the parachutes. I need a program that will execute maneuver nodes, a lunar landing Descent and Liftoff, a reentry autopilot for displaying heat shield integrity and action groups. I will also need a few micro managing programs that I think I can code my self and some of this I may be able to do since I do not fully understand the Kerbal computing language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T12:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a late reply, I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been browsing for some tutorials and guides on kos lately and I can only recommend you to go small first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI completed a script to knockout kerbal tourists in space and return them to the surface wich took me a while.
