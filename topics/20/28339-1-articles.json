I ask because some may not know about the way you use KW fairing system. You must start at the top first and work your way down. Not the other way around. Start with the nose first and then add your walls. After you have a complete faring then if you need to remove it to see what is inside you just click the bottom most part and it will remove the entire assembly for you. You can then place it back when you are done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the rescale factor, is this something new as well? While I change a lot of the other settings for these parts, I have never had to change that before. I have only concentrated my efforts on only the 1.25 and 2.5 meter items but I have noticed that the unit of measure for certain items seem to change from mod to mod. So instead of using pounds of thrust think kN instead. Same goes for weight, ton and metric ton or volume, gallons vs. liters for tanks. The best way to keep track for me is to use a spread sheet that I have made to keep track of all the standard settings the mod has. I also place any changes I have made along side those setting so I can tell what I have changed. Now it reminds me that I need to go update it for 19.1 so I can move to .20.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synthesis","CreatedById":26557,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T16:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LawnDartLeo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LawnDartLeo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESynth, as far as I know you can.... with a lot of work.
