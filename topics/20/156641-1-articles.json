As in no extra moons, no rearranged planets in any way, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Maybe has a planet or so that\u0027s closer to the sun than Moho, but is primarily about going much, much farther out than the stock bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Variation, such as more than just a bunch of gas bodies, and maybe a solid body or two\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Preferably few or no extra stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T17:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOuter Planets Mod is probably about what you\u0027re looking for.\u00A0 It makes exactly one change to the stock bodies: It moves Eeloo to be a moon of one if it\u0027s planets.\u00A0 (No other changes to Eeloo - it just becomes a moon.)\u00A0 Otherwise, it adds three gas giants, one stand-alone planet, and a bunch of moons, including some with atmospheres.\u00A0 Jool and inwards is untouched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-19T19:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso bump\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
