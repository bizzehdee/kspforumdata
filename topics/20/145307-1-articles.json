Apart from Eve, I manged to do mission to every stock body, and have bases or stations on many of them. Mun, Minmus and Duna are permanently inhabited by Kerbals in modular bases. I have designed and piloted my share of spaceplanes and SSTOs. But.... It\u0027s just not the fun as it used to be. I believe most of the fun that came from experimenting and horribly failing could come again if I started another playthrough with a more challenging system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I would like to know what you would suggest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Should I just play with a resized system? And if, which version did you have most fun with? 2 x the size? 6,4 x the size?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Or should i go straight for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E? Do you think I\u0027ll manage, or I should get some experience in mid-size system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Are the resized systems playable with stock parts, or should I get some mods that rebalance the engines and fuel tanks? And if, which do you find the best?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Am I missing some obvious, simpler option to change the game to be different and fun again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichal.don\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T13:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E means a lot of new stuff to learn about, fail repeatedly, and learn some more. It also generally means a lot longer loading time. I\u0027ve sorta kinda not really started playing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E recently (my computer won\u0027t let me enjoy it though, so I haven\u0027t been playing much of anything on it lately) and I think it\u0027ll be a lot of fun once I fix the blue screens. If you\u0027re looking for new, complex systems to master, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E has all sorts of stuff like ullage, unthrottleable engines, a plethora of different fuel types, and more. The larger systems aren\u0027t really much more of a challenge, they just mean your burns will be much longer. Expect 8-10 minutes to reach orbital velocity around Earth, for instance. It seems like the stuff in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E is what you want. You can ease into some of the mechanics in the Kerbal system beforehand, though, such as life support and antenna relays. All the stuff in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E is a lot to take in at once, but it can be very rewarding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T15:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E.
