Almost always 0 people on. This led me to come up with the idea. We should make a mega-server! If you play Minecraft, you know theres a couple of servers with up to 40,000 people on at once, while others only have 10 or 20. So, what would you guys think if we all made a mega server here on the forums, where we could all play together? Then as time goes on, more and more KSP users will discover it and start playing on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T00:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this might be a good idea.

A mega-server with 1000 or (all possible deities forbid) 40,000 at once would of course have nightmarish lag (even CCP\u0027s mega-uber-server used for EVE has trouble with that), but I don\u0027t think our server will get anywhere near that crowded.
