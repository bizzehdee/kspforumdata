Some part in the lower end just blows up every time, and i cant actually see which one is the first to go. The rest of the big launcher blows up extremely fast part fails. which is really a paint to be able to see whats the initial cause.\n\nSo, during this painful process i thought, maybe someone already worked on some mod for exactly this kind of situation.\n\nIs there any mod out there to review your failed launchs? say some kind of replay recorder with some slow speed replay of any sorts?\n\nIf there isnt, i hope someone with the proper skills likes the idea and make it a reality ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T08:55:58Z","Content":"The f3 mission overview doesn\u0027t help?
