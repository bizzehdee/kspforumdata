Docking is too easy.** \n\nCurrently, if you and your target are in simple orbits, all you have to do is make an intercept node, and then null your velocity when you get close. The nav-ball nodes make this incredibly easy, and as long as your Kerbals have their autopilot levels maxed out, it\u0027s super easy. You can pretty much dock completely by the nav-ball in most cases. \n\n**2. Antenna are boring.**\n\nThere\u0027s no need for multiple antenna currently. There\u0027s no incentive to really deck out your vessel with multiple antenna and greeble, as any more than one are redundant. \n\nThe idea is to make classes of parts that enable certain information that would be relevant to a docking scenario tied to different parts you can add to your vessel. All these parts would be different and separate from the stock antennae. Stock antenna would still function only as science transmission antennae. \n\nI\u0027d like to model my idea on the the IGLA model of rendezvous. \n\n![RndVradarsP.gif](http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/RvDRadar/RndVradarsP.gif)\n\nThe part classes would be these:\n\n**Tracking Antennae:**\n\nBy default, a vessel\u0027s orbit is visible from the tracking station, but it\u0027s current *position* in that orbit is not visible without a tracking antenna. With this antenna, the ground, and other vessels would be able to see a vessel\u0027s position in an orbit. This would be a low-level part available VERY early in the tree.\n\n**Telemetry Antennae: Send/Recieve**\n\nTwo vessels attempting to rendezvous will need sending and receiving capabilities. Depending on which craft is passive, and which craft is on active approach, the need for certain antenna will change, but generally, both parties will need both antennae. This ability allows a vessel to see and target another vessel, and know it\u0027s orbital speed, but not relative speed. In low-tiers, this will be to separate antennae, in higher-tiers, this will be a single, smaller antenna. \n\n**Vessel Range Finder:**\n\nThis device allows the distance to a vessel to be seen, and it\u0027s relative speed. Range finders do not need to be in pairs. Only the active craft needs one to see distance to target. The docking target MUST be targeted in order for it\u0027s distance from your vessel to be seen. This also is needed to see distance to an asteroid.\n\n**Radar Altimeter.** For planetary bodies, a radar altimeter will be required to see distance from he surface in IVA. \n\nA lot of the information in KSP we take for granted, and I think it\u0027d be a neat immersion thing to really flesh out docking in KSP, and make it fairly immersive. I\u0027m not sure how this would work with probes, or on other planetary bodies. WIP. \n\nIs hiding certain information, and making select parts enable specific pieces of information in the UI possible? I\u0027ve currently got a VERY small parts add-on that this plugin would support. I\u0027m really new to add-on creation, and I\u0027d love to take a stab at this. Thoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T18:20:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by curtquarquesso**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:16:04Z","Content":"I love the sound of this.

Add tracking antenna part to every ship (and I mean \\*every\\* ship)\n\n2. Add telemetry antenna to space stations\n\n3. Add telemetry antenna and range finder part to docking ships\n\n4. Add radar altimeter part to landers\n\nFor #1: space programs have to have [some way of tracking debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#Tracking_and_measurement) (both man-made and natural debris) that obviously don\u0027t have an antenna, so why would they need an antenna to track a craft that they already have a good idea of where it should be?\n\nFor missions away from LKO, this would make a lot more sense. If you\u0027re entering in to Moho orbit to rendezvous with Moho Station, you may not be 100% sure of where the station actually is, and a tracking beacon would help you to know.\n\nIf you could fuzz the location instead of completely hiding it (it should be over \\*here\\*, plus or minus 20 km in any direction), that would be interesting. Lower the fuzzing the closer you get.\n\nFor #2/#3 - this would be interesting if you could hide both the distance to the other ship and the relative velocity (disable Target mode in the navball). You could still dock by sight, but it would be extra dangerous.\n\nFor #4 - uh, that\u0027s not docking. I guess you could call landing \u0022docking with the planet\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s no need for multiple antenna currently. There\u0027s no incentive to really deck out your vessel with multiple antenna and greeble, as any more than one are redundant.\n\n[RemoteTech 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305) gives you a reason to use multiple (and different) antenna, though usually just one omni and one dish, except for communications relay satellites. I usually use mothership with dish\u002Bomni paired with a lander that just has an omni.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is hiding certain information, and making select parts enable specific pieces of information in the UI possible?\n\nCheck out [ResearchBodies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127533) which hides planets until you discover them (like asteroids). I\u0027m not sure if it will help, but it\u0027s along the same lines.\n\nIt\u0027s real easy to check if the current ship has a certain part (or better, PartModule), but to avoid doing that check every frame, you can set a boolean flag when the flight scene starts and then whenever the ship changes (or you switch active ships)."}]}
