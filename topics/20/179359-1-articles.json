Even with Physics Range Extender..making an accurate ring with craft parts is pretty much impossible given the required size and range at which parts can..unload from a scene via distance, not to mention massive part count lol.

Someone scaled up a single part to encompass Kerbin and it cast a shadow, but you can\u0027t do anything with it because you\u0027re considered \u0022too far away\u0022 from the centre for it to be rendered when you approach any of its surfaces...

A single celestial body needs a PQS surface defined so you can land on it, but those surfaces have to start out as spheres. And you can\u0027t land on the inside of one; even if a small body had a terrain glitch that let you travel inside it, your craft would self-destruct upon crossing the threshold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe there\u0027s another possibility. Kopernicus appears to support a barycenter object, so you could have two or more celestials orbit that. The barycenter need not be solid. Maybe you could construct a ring out of multiple celestials orbiting a barycenter. You might not be able to make a \u003Cem\u003ENiven\u003C/em\u003E-style ring around a star, but perhaps a smaller ring \u003Cem\u003EHalo\u003C/em\u003E-style, constructed of identical objects orbiting a barycenter. I don\u0027t know what would happen to the space between your ring segments though, as you\u0027re talking about each segment\u0027s sphere of influence intersecting with its neighbours.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-29T01:20:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2018 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Fecyk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesusthebird","CreatedById":176735,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-29T05:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157121-gordon-fecyk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157121\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157121-gordon-fecyk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gordon Fecyk\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0ahh interesting..I knew there had to be some sort of limitation involved that I wasn\u0027t aware about.
