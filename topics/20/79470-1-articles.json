The same thing as unixes shared libraries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne typical pitfall encountered with this design is the so hated modstatistics for which Majiir have probably done unnecessary and not very clean, I guess, checks to be sure the first loaded one prevail on other instances found. If it was made as a library in its very beginning, no modders would have need to add the (ironically*) \u0022shared libraries\u0022 in his/her own mod folder, but some config file which trigger the feature or a glue code/call inside their own mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*ironically cause DLL is supposed to be a shared library ! :/ (but not shared this way, imagine if each windows programs comes with its own \u0022unshared\u0022 libraries, like msvc*, directx, etc you\u0027ll have probably GB waste of duplicate libs in many versions)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T09:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it falls under false advertising.
