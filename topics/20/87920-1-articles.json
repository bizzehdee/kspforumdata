Game crashes, broken features, and overall bugyness and raging ensue. So i was wondering, Like Minecraft has mod packs,( i.e feed the beast, technic etc.) why can\u0027t KSP have mod packs? We could have a realistic mod pack where dangerous re-entry, FAR/NEAR, Tac Life support, and KAS all work together. again, without the bugyness. I (from a non-coder standpoint) think that it would work. Anyone else think that this is a good idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T18:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem there is that everyone has different standards even within those categories.
