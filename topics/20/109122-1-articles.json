I think I now have it fixed so that doesn\u0027t happen without a bit more effort. However, if you find new ways to bash into the site, I\u0027d appreciate you letting me know in private rather than making it public so I can fix it.\n\nAnd the difference is, popularity. Kerbal Stuff is based on the number of followers and/or number of downloads. While either of these give some indication of a mod\u0027s popularity, that\u0027s still not a lot of information to determine if it\u0027s a good mod. FAR is top on KS... I\u0027d never use it personally. Kerbaltopia will (eventually) present a number of pieces of data that users can determine the \u0027value\u0027 of the mod. The one I consider most valuable, each mod will have it\u0027s own separate user comments and no, you don\u0027t have to log in to leave them but they are moderated.\n\nWhere Kerbal Stuff presents raw facts and figures, Kerbaltopia will present opinion.\n\nFinally, do you really want your mod host to get into the business of comment debates? I\u0027m pretty sure that SirCmpwn has the ability to code comments into Kerbal Stuff and could have at any time. But I get the feeling that he didn\u0027t so that he can remain unbiased about being the host. And, in my opinion, and it\u0027s just my opinion, he should remain unbiased. I, using his data, am not under that obligation.\n\nI also thought it might be nice to let those that create the mods see what an anonymous opinion of their mod is. I can think of nowhere else they can get that.\n\nThere is no \u0027perfect\u0027 solution to determine what makes a good mod or a bad one. I\u0027m merely trying to offer an alternative.\n\nFinally, Mods are just a starting point. There are other plans.\n\nAgain, thanks for the input.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T02:57:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T07:52:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve just recently finished a project that took a good bit longer than I expected. I have succeeded in mashing together the data from both Kerbalstuff.com and CKAN.

I\u0027ll be converting them all to the .zip format, uploading and making them available for download.

(already have that mostly completed)\n\nA web form that generates .ckan files (possibly)\n\nand any other similarly insane idea that pops into my head.\n\nThere are probably bugs and incorrect mod versions listed. Just let me know if you find them and I\u0027ll get them fixed.\n\nOh, and a new, much easier to view theme.\n\nEnjoy\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, and one more thing.
