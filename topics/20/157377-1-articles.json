I really want to see a texture where the underbelly of a space plane has black tiling for it\u0027s heat shield. There are a bunch of mods that exist for space planes like MK2,3 expansions and the MK4 system. However none of them have the option to have a texture like this. Is there anyone out there in the forums who feels the way I do on this or has any desire/plans to implement some sort of a change like this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T06:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119951-122-cormorant-aeronology-10-release/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
