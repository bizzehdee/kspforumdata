I\u0027ve heard that a space elevator is impossible in KSP, because parts over 2.25km away in thick enough atmosphere instasplode, and an elevator ribbon must go all the way to the surface, through the atmosphere. But... if Squad implemented Futurama\u0027s ship drives (they move the universe around your ship) to make Krakensbane, then why can\u0027t we do something equally ridiculous to fake a space elevator?

Runs from an anchor to another anchor or ends in space. Length could be a tweakable, effecting mass and cost. Ideal material, doesn\u0027t taper. Launched as a spool, deployed from a menu when in the proper orbit. (It unrolls both up and down.) Any given elevator cable would have multiple instances, each a view of the entire gigameter long structure. Elevator state could be saved in a master cable part; the views would refer to it.

The mod would give KSP 2.25km views of the full elevator whenever in physics range and would move anchors and climbers around on custom rails for the tracking station/map. Since force is transmitted through our parts, we can implement anchors and climber wheels as engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking station craft.

In Red Mars, the cut elevator cable screams in through the thin Martian atmosphere and obliterates everything on the equator, even creating diamonds where it hits! People in the anchor space station and upper elevator cars go flying off into space. I imagine some players might want to sabotage their space elevators to see what happens. Afaik, real world engineers still don\u0027t agree on what would happen, so our bar for realism is the low one set by KSP\u0027s stock aerodynamics model. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotato version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESimplified cable model - a straight line from ground anchor to space anchor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECable can only be deployed within a couple degrees solid angle of an equatorial ground anchor from a stationary orbit. The in-space anchor would jump to directly above the ground anchor when you change focus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECable deploys instantly.

If there isn\u0027t enough of a counterweight, it falls to the planet when you change focus and everybody onboard dies anti-climactically (just like with atmospheric first stages). If there is enough of a counterweight (long enough cable and/or a massive enough space station or asteroid anchored to the space end), then it hangs perfectly vertically.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EClimbers climb when on rails at whatever rate they were last throttled at.
