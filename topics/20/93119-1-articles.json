Perhaps later on, this will be fleshed out and we have actual meaningful specialization rather than arbitrary limitation like now. I guess something like this does work as a stopgap measure for those who do not like the new specialization system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I kind of like story potential from the current system....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb went out on EVA, but forgot to shutdown thrust, sending Bob and Bill off into space. The two frantically turned off the engine, but now they are stuck spinning like crazy in an orbit around mun with no knowledge to control the craft.
