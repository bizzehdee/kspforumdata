But if it\u0027s sound coming from an object where the sound is played as part of an FXgroup (I think) then it *is* positional. Check out which speaker your rocket engine sound comes from as you circle the camera around the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that\u0027s only as 3D as Unity\u0027s sound-playing allows; Unity may support only 2-channel, non-3D positional audio natively (i.e. not the 3D-in-2-channel you\u0027re suggesting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, that doesn\u0027t affect the rest of your post, re: environmental audio (underwater, etc).
