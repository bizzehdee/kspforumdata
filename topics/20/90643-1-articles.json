The problem of course is that planes need fuel. I\u0027m considering sending along an ion-powered drone as well for general scouting around, but what I think is really needed is for Wernher Von Kerman and his team to invent the propeller. I\u0027m just after a basic electric propeller that matches up nicely with stock parts- that way my colonists can fly around Eve as much as they like. Some kind of airboat for ocean exploration might be possible too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny good mod parts out there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T17:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadd \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EcheckForOxygen = false to ModuleResourceIntake{} on an intake part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"praise the suuun","CreatedById":69912,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T11:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyour looking for the firespitter pack. it includes a robust electric propeller that fits to the size of a stock radial mount. its yellow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
