Now, I haven\u0027t only been thinking about it, I\u0027ve also read up a bit about the possibilities of it in the scope of KSP and it\u0027s modding community. Read through diverse forum rules, read licenses and how I could handle them in a modpack. Looked at the requirements for developing mods and I wanted to get into C# either way. I also read a lot about the general mood/opinion of mod-devs and people, which is, to say the least, not positive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow from other threads where people mentioned the thought of assembling a modpack, it never really seemed very well thought-through to me.

Like the water-splitter in TAC-Life support which produces oxygen and waste. Why not make it actually produce hydrogen and use that to also fire up a Near Future Propulsion engine which could make use of that! Wouldn\u0027t that be awesome?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also might consider reviving some old mods if the creators let me do that and try to integrate them within the modpack. I will also try to build new parts when it would fit a given niche/hole I want to fill. Add more biomes, rework a multi mod techtree, add better models to simpler sphere-tank modules, when they aren\u0027t tanks, etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: A modpack also allows the modpack-manager/dev to control which version of which mod he might use in the pack. While that also poses its own pitfalls (old mod versions) it\u0027s als an advantage since it allows the modpack-manager/dev to assemble the mod versions which will (hopefully) work together the best. It will also avoid the possible case of players being unable to download the version of a mod that would be required by the modpack. Be it because the given version isn\u0027t findable, because the website went down (Kerbal Spaceport?) or because only the newest download is still available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. rough balancing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will probably work on some part\u0027s .cfg files to roughly balance them out with the rest. A lot of mods have some sense of balance with stock KSP, but mix a lot of them together and it becomes a mess very fast.

Someone wanted to distribute compressed versions of my part textures, but since I was overhauling the parts to use a common texture map (and UVs would get updated/moved around/reworked on an irregular basis), I privately told him to wait until I\u0027ve finalized my overhaul. He agreed to do so privately, but then announced publicly the very next day that he was going to do it anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I pointed this out to him, he claimed that my licence permitted him to do so with or without my permission, and that he was \u0022saving me the effort\u0022. My counterpoint was that the major changes I was implementing would render his optimizations completely useless and outdated. As it happened, he went ahead anyway, just as I released a dev build of my overhaul, and indeed, his \u0022optimizations\u0022 became obsolete almost immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, it\u0027s better to ask nicely and honor the decisions of the original add-ons\u0027 authors, instead of re-interpreting/exploiting permissive licenses to one\u0027s personal advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
