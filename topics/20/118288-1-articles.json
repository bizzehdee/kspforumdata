But that seems to be more tricky than I had anticipated.\n\nMy problem is, that I have no tool to read mbm files. So I digged out the old **mbm2png** converter from once. That worked well and now I have my grafics all in png. I changed the MU-files so that the are able to use the PNG instead of the MBM. I trief that in KSP and it workes well.\n\nThat was the first part.\n\nFirst I tried the DDS4KSP program, but that has some errors. It wasn\u0027t able to save the bump-files. So I want to use Paint.NET.\n\nI loaded the PNG and now want to save as DDS. But there are so many ooptions that I don\u0027t know what to use.\n\n- DXT1\n\n- DXT3\n\n- DXT5\n\n- A8R8G8B8\n\n- (and so on... I don\u0027t know...)\n\nPlease, does anybody had tried that before? Or can anybody tell me, whar format of DDS is to use for the main maps and for the bump maps?\n\ne.g: \n\n- PART\\_core.png\n\n- PART-core\\_bump\\_png\n\nAny help would be wery nice.\n\nThank you,\n\n- Isabelle"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:13:12Z","Content":"Have you checked out this thread it helps a bunch [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119873](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119873) and you really didn\u0027t need to do anything with the MU in if you still have a problem will be glad to help."},{"CreatedByName":"Isabelle.V.Fuchs","CreatedById":91426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T13:59:54Z","Content":"Thank you, MeCripp, for your quick answer.\n\nI hadn\u0027t checked this thread. It helped a little. I had forgotton to flip the DDS images vertically. This is okay now. No funny patterns any longer. But the images look terrible.\n\nThe thread said this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Texture Formats:\n\u003E DXT1\n\u003E \n\u003E Use this for anything without an alpha channel.\n\u003E \n\u003E DXT5\n\u003E \n\u003E Use this for anything with an alpha channel. This includes combined diffuse/shine maps.\n\u003E \n\u003E DXT5nm\n\u003E \n\u003E Use this format for normal maps.\n\nI tried a lot combinations. Main map in DXT1, 3 and 5 as well as the bump map in 1, 3 and 5 in any combinations. But always the result was bad or worse.\n\nSince I use Paint.NET I have no sort of DTX5nm. And whatever format I use, the result is war worse than the PNG.\n\nMaybe you have a hint. It is [BobCat\u0027s MIR](http://www./download/mqhvqb8wa6thj2o/MIR.zip) I want to convert from MBM to DDS (via PNG). I tried with the Core Module.
