I want the orbit lines gone so I can assign different colored circles to each vessel type (already have this working via Asset Explorer texture swap) and create something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ARaUSuAm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ARaUSuAm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith each color a different type of asteroid (the types come from the Custom Asteroid mod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the general-use side however it could be nice to help de-clutter the view sometimes when you have RemoteTech and/or just a lot of vessels creating a lot of lines to peer through\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T02:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny takers?
