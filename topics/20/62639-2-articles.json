If a new player is introduced to MJ too early they can become hopelessly dependent on it.

It provides all the missing data during craft construction and flight, plus allows the automation of routine, menial tasks. I don\u0027t really gain much from manually launching and docking five tankers to fuel up an interstellar ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, I enjoy the craft design and mission planning parts of the game more than piloting. I\u0027m a mediocre pilot at best, and, while I\u0027m sure I could improve with more practice, I prefer to let MechJeb handle that stuff for me as it\u0027s not the part of the game that I enjoy most. I still do a few landings manually but that\u0027s the exception rather than the rule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand and respect those players who love piloting manually and wouldn\u0027t dream of using MJ; obviously for them the piloting is the most satisfying part of the game. Good for them, and I hope they have fun with it. But it\u0027s not for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the effect on new players, I think MechJeb broadens the appeal of KSP. We are literally doing rocket science here, not everyone has the talent or patience to get into manually calculating dV, TWR, transfer burns, phase angles, etc. I think there are a lot of potential players who would be turned off by having the game be math homework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have pointed out, it is a great teaching tool. You can learn a lot about how to efficiently do a variety of maneuvers by watching how MechJeb does it. For example, I think trying to learn how to rendezvous with another spacecraft by trial and error is very difficult for new players not versed in orbital mechanics (and really, how many people are?). So much of how orbits work is counter intuitive (slowing down to catch up with a target ahead of you, etc) that I can see a lot of new players getting frustrated by feeling stupid and giving up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, and this may be a bit contentious, MechJeb is realistic. Modern spacecraft, even manned ones, don\u0027t have a pilot holding a stick manually guiding them through maneuvers, the autopilot handles all that. At most, a manual system exists as a backup should something malfunction in the automatic systems. Spaceflight really does consist of telling the computer what maneuver is to be completed and then letting it do its thing without manual intervention. Just like MechJeb in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be very happy if MechJeb were incorporated into the core game. It suits every style of play; do manually the things you enjoy and let the autopilot handle the rest. If, for you, that means having it off all the time, have a great time. I\u0027ll be having fun the way I like to play.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T03:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aghanim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aghanim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know, mechjeb launcher is hopeless for launching my rockets into orbit as it will flip all time\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never seen a rocket flip with MJ at the controls that wasn\u0027t badly designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat mechjeb doesn\u0027t have is burn timer\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENor does it need one as a burn isn\u0027t measured by time it\u0027s measured by delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T03:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never seen a rocket flip with MJ at the controls that wasn\u0027t badly designed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr rather, that wouldn\u0027t do the same thing if you flew a similar ascent.
