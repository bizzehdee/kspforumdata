I\u0027ve seen mods that had both in the same parts pack!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then you consider that there are stock parts that are overpowered compared to other stock parts. The AV-T1 hasn\u0027t been useful for a very long time: It\u0027s heavy compared to the other winglets, has no control forces, and doesn\u0027t produce as much lift as other winglets. The AV-R8 similarly has been largely superceded by the canards and the Delta Deluxe winglets (Canards for Control force strength, Delta Deluxe for light weight controllability). The new Stratus-V Cylindrified monoprop tank holds half again as much monopropellant as the FL-R25 but has the same dry weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA friend of mine once pointed out that some of this will probably have other factors balancing it in career mode, like availability and price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being the case among stock parts, if you don\u0027t personally feel it\u0027s cheating, does it really matter if someone else does?

I like to include escape mechanisms for the crew on my craft. On rockets, sometimes only untested designs, but for spaceplanes all of them. For a spaceplane this takes the form of a \u0027cockpit ejection system\u0027, which uses a decoupler to get the cockpit(s) off the craft, and parachutes to bring it safely to ground. Can\u0027t do that with B9\u0027s new cockpits, because there\u0027s no decouplers for any of his new (or not so new, in the case of the Mk2 stuff) form factors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T12:06:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T12:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELot of good reasons why mods are not only not bad, but in fact exceptionally good already described above. Main thing is, you\u0027ve got to be an informed player and make choices for yourself. For example, buying the game and _immediately_ installing mods might not be the wisest choice as you prevent yourself from learning the stock game. As another example, installing mods that you have no idea what they are or do and/or installing mods that you are skeptical you will like = probably bad ideas and a waste of your time and that of other users/modders when you go to ask questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to point out one other thing about mods though that doesn\u0027t have so much to do with game play, but rather as they relate to commerce, gamer culture, creativity or \u0027art,\u0027 and \u0027education\u0027 for lack of a better word. In my opinion mods, or more broadly modding communities, contribute immeasurably in positive ways to all of these areas of life, fairly narrow though they may be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as commerce goes, it is pretty close to an \u0027ideal\u0027 system. You\u0027ve got creative people on one hand (the design studio) who have released EULA\u0027s for an intellectual property. There are many such groups who would never, NEVER dream of allowing users to \u0027look under the hood\u0027 for various petty reasons that reflect traditional hierarchical and exploitative notions of consumer-producer relations. The irony is that, those overly protective design firms probably do more to harm their popularity and bottom-line than anything else. Then you\u0027ve got firms like Squad who show some basic faith in their fellow gamers and realize the tremendous power of releasing a game that is moddable. They will, like all the other studios who have taken this bold leap (recall that it was not long ago that modding was quite the exception, though it is increasingly the rule I suppose), reap dividends I\u0027m sure. The real beauty of this is not simply that the studio\u0027s benefit in a fiscal sense, but that really everyone involved benefits in terms specific to their reasonable expected needs. No one but the studio makes money, and that is precisely as it should be, but modders get experience and presitige if not visibility as potential professtional designers (I am aware of several \u0027famous\u0027 modders who have wound up landing jobs with studios despite being very young people). Presumably they also get some satisfaction from the simple fact of creating something they enjoy and seeing that others enjoy it too. The users get an unquestionable benefit too: if you don\u0027t like it, you turn it off, if you do like it, then the game is ever better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving elaborated on the issue of how mods benefit \u0027commerce\u0027 it is probably fairly evident what I\u0027m getting at about the other issues of gamer culture, creativity or \u0027art,\u0027 and \u0027education.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sum, I think that mods for games, and the modder \u0027culture\u0027 is one of the most awe-inspiring and promising social trends I can think of. I have tremendous respect both for the studios who open their work up for modding and for the fellow gamers who provide us average users with such amazing works of creativity!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alaskafish","CreatedById":57562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T15:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll comes down to personal preference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think mods can be considered cheating, just because of the things you can do. It changes gameplay, and I call that \u0022cheating\u0022. For example, kethane; in vanilla KSP you need to brign the amount of fuel you need to go to a planet. Whereas with kerthane, you can stop on your way, get more fuel ect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr B9 pack, gives you more ways to make a SSTO easier, or even kspx lets you have radial fuel tanks that let you have smaller but more efficient rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T17:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only reply to this would be you are playing with \u0022Mods\u0022 right now. More than a few parts in your so called stock install were all mod parts in 0.20. This pattern is a repeating one since the game was released. I believe some devs were lifted from the mod crowd?? When you really think about it we can\u0027t call the game \u0022stock\u0022 until its official release since it\u0027s a constantly developing and moving target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs many have stated some of the mods actually bring your game closer to real life than the so called stock installs. Alaskafish mentions Kethane. That mod mimics modern plans to get us back from Mars and is pseudo based in real science (ok the kerbal killing machine for kethane is a bit over the top lol). Not sure how that is considered cheating though since it\u0027s based on real life mission plans.
