It\u0027s not Kerbal enough (at all). All I really want is some great radial mounted thrusters for a dragon-like pod; a first stage engine that really works for re-entry and landing; and those massive landing legs (maybe), and maybe some waffle air flaps, but airbreaks should work just fine. \n\nI am a motion graphics guy that can create parts and even edit the part files, and whatever. But setting it up with module manager, and any heavy coding (bug testing, or updating) may put me in a bind. Anyone interested in spearheading this, or helping?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:13:00Z","Content":"There\u0027s [SpaceY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-12-3-%282015-05-08%29?highlight=spacey), a stockalike heavy rocket parts mod that has some SpaceX-like parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:24:10Z","Content":"There is Tundra Exploration [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83039-WIP-0-90-Tundra-Exploration-v0-2-2-IVA-added!-Stockalike-Dragon-V2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83039-WIP-0-90-Tundra-Exploration-v0-2-2-IVA-added!-Stockalike-Dragon-V2)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:45:58Z","Content":"KSLO is also pretty stockalike and the LV engines are based on the Merlin."},{"CreatedByName":"texasjakit","CreatedById":81224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:12:56Z","Content":"Yeah, all of these just miss the mark far enough for me to still want to create one myself.
