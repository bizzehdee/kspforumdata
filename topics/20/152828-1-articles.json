It may be that it\u0027s only the limit of the slider. If you go into your save file you should be able to find the setting. Try putting 600 hours instead of 100 and see if that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"beelzerob","CreatedById":147002,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T15:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a good idea, I\u0027ll look into that tonight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was looking at the contract mods out there to see how hard it would be to tie a Kerbals death into a contract to go rescue them from wherever they may be, or thereabout. \u00A0If I could just stop playing the game long enough, I could probably figure it out....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mandella","CreatedById":170213,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-03T05:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a way to edit a .cfg file that does what you want (I know this because I have done it) but I don\u0027t seem to be able to find exactly what needs to be edited right now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I\u0027m just here to tell you it\u0027s possible, and when you find it would you repost it?
