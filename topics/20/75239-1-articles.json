I am already researching and working on TAC configs and CLS support, but also I would like to make them scientifically useful also. Because ISS is very much \u0027in-situ\u0027 in low orbit and doesn\u0027t move around the planets and moons, the default experiment model doesn\u0027t work very well because ISS will quickly become used up once you have fired the experiments on each module a few times for the biomes it passes over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to find if the following can be done either with a mod or a CFG file entry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake Science continually available for an experiment setup (an ISS module\u0027s lab rack for e.g.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESend Experiment resources up and be able to use it to generate valuable science data\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETransmit (via antenna) or return (via Dragon or other crew craft) the science data - obviously already present in-game\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptionally \u003C/strong\u003EBe able to swap experiments in a rack (so take an experiment up, run it, and return the data then throw it away) - this might fit better with how the game works?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this will be very notional, I guess, you won\u0027t see anything past the movements with CrewManifest and right clicking and processing with the menus but at least it will make modules useful. I would make it not overpowered to prevent it being used as a science spam exploit. Having to fly supplies up to get science is one way, also because ISS only does small experiments and such the base value of the experiments will be relatively low. Given ISS nodes will likely unlock in the tech tree (I would say under Specialized Control or Advanced MetalWorks? They don\u0027t have any tree nodes assigned yet) they can still produce good amounts of science (maybe 25-50 per experniment?) and not overpower the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already am thinking of using KAS to fly up, operate, and return \u003Cstrong\u003Eexternal\u003C/strong\u003E experiments (something to use Dragon\u0027s unpressurised trunk for! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) and will work on that too but that is another issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d2XVdZK.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022d2XVdZK.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-16T20:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2014 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MDBenson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
