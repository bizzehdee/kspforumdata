We also use TAC Life Support, Kerbal Construction Time, Remote Tech to add both realism and challenge. We will be comparing (once we get there in the game) different methods for getting to Mars and establishing a permanent presence there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you like science/math you will like this. \u00A0If you don\u0027t, but you want a challenge, you may also like this. \u00A0While probably meant for a more mature audience, I invite any and all to give it a try. \u00A0There will be regular content added (and my skills should also improve on the video side) so I hope to establish a space-loving community, especially one that is interested in the human colonization of mars (the moon too, sure) in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQzHRxEKFiu9tVnM7YNhc-w\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERocket Science Advanced\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. I wrote (and copyrighted) the music used (except of course within the KSP game itself). \u00A0The music is the hardest part because I need to try to crank it out for every other episode or you might get bored hearing the same stuff all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny feedback is appreciated. \u00A0There are only 3 episodes there now, but I promise many more are coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPSS. I may be a bottle rocketeer on this forum, but just so you know, I have 30 years experience as an Aerospace Engineer. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-19T19:04:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2016 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Parallax59\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
