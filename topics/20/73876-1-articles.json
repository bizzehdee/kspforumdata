This number is actually a bit off, it should be 76 or 77, don\u0027t remember.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to resource mining, it\u0027s not something I very much like myself. The two main mods for that are indeed Kethane and Interstellar, however there are other mods which use the Kethane plugin (not necessarily the rest of the mod) to add some new resources. I can\u0027t name any from the top of my head, but there are a few cool things that I considered getting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Interstellar mod is a cool thing, but what I like in it isn\u0027t the resources so much, it\u0027s the reactors, power and heat management. The problem with this mod is that especially in the beginning it is VERY confusing. If you are going to get that mod, don\u0027t go alone.

Bookmark it, write it down a few sheets of paper and place them strategically around your house, print out sheets from it and place them in the toilet so you\u0027ll learn to play Interstellar while pooping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, though, if you like Interstellar, you might as well consider playing with Real Fuels and RSS (actually, don\u0027t do that. I went that path and look where I am now. And I\u0027m being serious here, the mod addiction can kill the game for you). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I just remembered about Interstellar is that whether you like it or not, heat management will become an important issue for you. It can be annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor someone who hasn\u0027t played a lot with mods I would recommend FAR and DRE to go along with anything you choose. They aren\u0027t resource mining mods, as you probably know, but they are kind of like a standard pack for KSP. They fix two of the greatest issues I have with KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor resource management (not mining) I would recommend TAC Life Support. It adds a new aspect to the game, which I really like. it creates 6 new resources, each with its unique challenges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that covers the basics of what you asked and a bit of what you didn\u0027t ask.
