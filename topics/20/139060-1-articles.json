There were many changes that caused (almost) every plugin dll that is compiled for 1.0.5 or earlier to not be able to run in 1.1. Also every wheel or landing leg that is not updated will not work because of the changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the one you mentioned \u003Cem\u003E\u0022TAC-LS\u0022\u003C/em\u003E does not support 1.1, so it will not run properly and will cause a lot of errors.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis topic is currently almost\u00A0omnipresent in all of the threads for the mods.
