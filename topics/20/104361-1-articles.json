All the wheels.\n\nMore choices, better physics, all that.\n\nI downloaded one that I found. It was ok, but extremely unrealistic.\n\nSmall tiny wheels drawing the same amount of power as huge monster truck looking wheels.\n\nSmall tank tracks drawing the same amount as HUGE tank tracks.\n\nMost all of these were the same price as well. Only thing that changes with size was mass.\n\nBut not enough in my opinion. It was done very nicely in some ways, but just not realistic enough.\n\nToo much of an ARCADE feel.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for wheel mods?\n\nPS: one more thing. Lets say I get a mod and I like it but there are a few values here and there that I would like to make changes to.\n\nIs that difficult? Modding a Mod. lol ???\n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Leoworm","CreatedById":136802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T12:36:35Z","Content":"You can change the cost and electrical consumption of wheels in the Parts .cfg, which you can find in ./GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel\n\nHope this helped you a little ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:23:55Z","Content":"When looking for mods, a good place to start is the modding subforums.
