If it behaves more like a space plane, S.S.A.S on surface settings is your friend. If it behaves more like a rocket, try the Ascent Guidance. If it requires engine switching or other events that aren\u0027t tied to staging, you\u0027ll still have to go hands-on for those parts of the flight. Might have to do something like handle lift-off manually, then switch over to automated guidance once the craft is in the right mode. There are other mods out there that supposedly make VTOLs and MJ more friendly with each other, but I haven\u0027t tried them, as I haven\u0027t done a lot with VTOLs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
