I\u0027m pretty certain it\u0027s doable, but I\u0027m no modeller/modder. Can anyone else weigh in?

I think itd be great. Only issue i see perhaps would be the side nodes (nodes not inline) could clip objects through if you used the \u0027move part\u0027 function. Like when you click the arrow. The part moves a bit in/ or away from the parent part being attached too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JokesCompany","CreatedById":189266,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-28T21:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also struggling in it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-02T04:33:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand you correctly - at least the extra nodes should be doable with a ModuleManager patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust tested this and it adds four bottom nodes to the stock 2.5 service bay:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PART[ServiceBay_250]\n{\n\t//                    Position       Direction\n\t//                 X    Y     Z     X    Y    Z     NodeSize\n\tnode_stack_n1 =  0.6, -0.5, -0.6,   0.0, 1.0, 0.0,   1\n\tnode_stack_n2 =  0.6, -0.5,  0.6,   0.0, 1.0, 0.0,   1\n\tnode_stack_n3 = -0.6, -0.5,  0.6,   0.0, 1.0, 0.0,   1\n\tnode_stack_n4 = -0.6, -0.5, -0.6,   0.0, 1.0, 0.0,   1\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could use a bit of tweaking and a set of top nodes but they would be a duplicate of these nodes with a \u002BY position and a -Y direction.

You can verify this easily enough - just start a test game, launch a craft using this patch, exit the game, remove the patch and relaunch the game. On the other hand if this were a custom part you would lose the entire craft if the custom part was removed.
