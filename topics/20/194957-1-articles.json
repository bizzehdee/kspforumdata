For example, replacing a music that plays in space, or a music that plays in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is fine and all, but what I think would be more fun is a mod that has several more situations for different music. For example, instead of just \u0022space\u0022 and \u0022menu\u0022 and \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022, it could have several opportunities for several unique tracks for several situations. Imagine music for Tylo, Bop, Duna, Moho, Minmus, Kerbin, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping for this mod so I may return to attempting to make music, and perhaps creating fitting music for KSP\u0027s planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe information said here is enough, but I\u0027ll ramble further in this spoiler (to conserve space). If you want to see what I\u0027m imagining, or clarification on what I want, then go into it and see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would want from this is, from each planet, a \u0022landed\u0022 situation, an \u0022atmosphere\u0022 situation (or low and high), and a \u0022space\u0022 situation (or low and high). As well as interplanetary space and escaped from the Sun. This opens up so many opportunities for giving each planet its own theme and character to it, and adding extra polish to make the game make you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine giving each planet a new and powerful personality for the music. Imagine Kerbin having a homely acoustic guitar theme while landed on Kerbin, or perhaps while flying through its atmosphere as well. Perhaps a mix of spacey theme and homely acoustic guitar as you venture into space low above Kerbin, and it slowly blends into the interplanetary theme as you escape from Kerbin\u0027s gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine Eve having a tense and suspenseful air to it, and its atmosphere having the most dramatic tune of the game, to emphasize just how much can go wrong, and just how hard it is to escape. Imagine your heart pounding from the intense music blaring as you attempt to climb into space back from Eve. Imagine the music played while landed at Eve a kind of \u0022calm before the storm\u0022 type thing, to the point where it matches whatever theme Eve gets, but calmer and less heart-poundingly dramatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine Laythe having a dramatic and powerful yet also warm tune, to emphasize just how big of a step this is, just how important it is to not screw things up, as well as just how much this resembles home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps Dres could have a solemn and sad tune to it, to show just how lonely it is. Its character could be one of great sorrow, and players could return there just for the emotions that come with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps high and low space could be very different from one another. Perhaps it blends slowly into that planet\u0027s theme from the interplanetary tune as you go from high space to low space, and for atmosphereless planets,, low space would be the most dramatic and emotional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EJool\u0027s \u0022landed\u0022 theme could be something hilarious and immersion breaking, as you aren\u0027t really supposed to go there anyways.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have such high hopes for the possibilities of this mod and it could cover what I think is missing most from KSP: the planets\u0027 respective character and emotions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-22T23:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoundtrack Editor will do most of what you want\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9154908734\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/191467-173-18x-19x-soundtrack-editor-forked/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:210px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd someone\u0027s already released an original score with body specific tracks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022130898\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3817058494\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194039-19x-ksp-original-score-project-over-2-hours-of-music-for-ksp/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:210px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T02:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62108-somnambulist/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002262108\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62108-somnambulist/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@somnambulist\u003C/a\u003E Thank you very much!
