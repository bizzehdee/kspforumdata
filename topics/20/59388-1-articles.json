The resulting code (by Majiir) can be found in the above link; the rest of the thread is left as it was for historical purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVoluntarily Locking Plugins to a Particular KSP Version\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after dealing with the recent wave of support requests following the update to KSP v0.23, I\u0027ve come to an amazing, and yet unsurprising conclusion: the average mod user is completely unaware of the fact that plugins can be incompatible with different versions of KSP. I had thought that it was somewhat common knowledge that updates to the underlying software could break plugins, but apparently it isn\u0027t. Unfortunately, plugins that handle the upgrade gracefully only make things more confusing. And this leads to three big issues for modders and mod users following an update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUsers suffer from compatibility issues that could be easily solved by updating the plugin or waiting for a new update. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EModders get a huge number of bug reports entirely due to compatibility issues, making the standard mod support responsibilities even more frustrating than usual, as well as possibly burying bug reports in the most recent version that should actually get the modder\u0027s attention. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDue to the strange ways that compatibility issues arise, bugs are blamed on the wrong mod, causing two major effects:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u0022Common knowledge\u0022 that a certain mod causes a certain bug, even though it does not; this causes a large number of bug reports to the wrong modder as well as damaging their reputation, which is essentially all we get out of modding. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUsers attempt to \u0022fix\u0022 their installs in foolish ways (for example, deleting ModuleManager_X.dll) because it \u0022fixes\u0022 the issue, but unknown to them, causes others; this will simply lead to more issues requiring support. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is a way around this; we have access to the game version through the Versioning class. Therefore, I propose that we shift towards having each plugin check the version number against the version that it is compatible for. This would be done by hardcoding the check into the dll, like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eif(Versioning.version_minor != 23)\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E  AlertUserAboutIncompatibility();\u003Cbr\u003E  TurnOffAsMuchOfPluginAsPossible();\u003Cbr\u003E  return;\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConvenient Nameless Other Person: \u003C/strong\u003EBut Ferram, doesn\u0027t this restrict the plugin needlessly? What if it happens to work in a new version of KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, it restricts it, but that can be easily circumvented by recompiling the source code. Most importantly, recompiling means that someone has to take responsibility for it working, as well as taking the time to fix any compiler errors that pop up. If a random user decides to simply recompile the code referencing the new game files and changing the version number and it works, good for them, but a new version will probably be up changing the version restriction anyway. If it doesn\u0027t work, then the restriction justified itself, and anyone trying to use the broken version should be able to realize that they\u0027re playing with fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing is that the user gets a message saying, \u0022This plugin will not work because you updated the underlying software; you should go and update the plugin to be compatible; if a compatible version isn\u0027t out, you\u0027ll have to wait until the issues can be sorted out,\u0022 which should make sure that the modder doesn\u0027t get inundated with compatibility issues well after KSP has been updated. Further, since it does require recompiling the dll, someone has to deal with the compiler errors (which have been the source of a lot of bugs that I\u0027ve seen) and take responsibility for any runtime issues that might occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t think this is something that should be forced on modders, rather, something that should be encouraged, like not using GOTOs everywhere. The average modder is more than capable of telling if their plugin is likely to break during a KSP update, and if so, they should take it on themselves to lock it down to that version of KSP so that somewhat foolish users can be warned about compatibility issues and so that other modders don\u0027t have to deal with bug reports caused by a 3rd party mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, those are my thoughts, mostly caused by seeing a large number of complaints blaming FAR for things it doesn\u0027t do / ModuleManager getting heat for working properly, but breaking when other plugins include broken code / general mod user foolishness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-15T23:35:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2014 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour frustration makes sense, but I think a warning message is enough, especially since some developer don\u0027t open their source code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:09:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the source code has to be available if it\u0027s on the forums.
