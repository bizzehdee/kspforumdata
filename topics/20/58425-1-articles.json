It seemed to work OK in career mode but was missing a ton of options. Things like the ascent autopilot etc. I had 5 options as opposed to the 20 or so I saw in screenies/vids. I am only up to the 3rd branch of the rnd tree (90 science) as far as \u0027bought\u0027 research goes. Will i get more options if i push on further (MJ does say modules are locked, but does not specify what branch i need to get to to unlock them) as I am really getting fed up with 100% manual orbital flights!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T00:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the different MJ modules are unlocked via different researches. Opening multiple threads in this forum does not help to unlock them earlier, just like it doesn\u0027t help you get an response any faster. The unlocking research is usually sth related to automation \u0026amp; for example unlocks more unmanned control parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolidWombat","CreatedById":99358,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T01:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mistake re: 2 threads, was slightly distracted and thought I had not actually posted the first one as I had whizzed off to do some more searching and forgot this forum was vetted by mods beforeposts appeared.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
