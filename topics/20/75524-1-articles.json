Curse has very few mods on it yet and of course no docking strut or quantum strut plugin. I really want to take my ship and lander to Duna without the thing folding in two every time I try and thrust. The last thing I want to do is have to deorbit, redesign the thing, relaunch all the bits and re dock them in orbit. It probably wouldn\u0027t work anyway because I haven\u0027t got any docking struts. Still I suppose the docking practice is useful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeepOdyssey","CreatedById":91001,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T02:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use KAS[Kerbal attachment system] to make struts while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T04:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71030\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71030\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HavelockVetinari","CreatedById":90729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T19:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, i was was wondering if it was possible to use KAS but the description of the strut connector states that it can only be used for connecting together parts of the same ship and I wasn\u0027t sure if two ships docked counts as a single ship.
