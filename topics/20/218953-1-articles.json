I was wondering if theres any strategies I should use while making my new modpack (I do it manually usually but I\u0027m open to suggestions now).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davi SDF","CreatedById":197335,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-22T23:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this might work for you, but it worked fine for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI myself have about 11 Gigabytes of mods, and what i did was installing them in batches, those that i already liked and knew they worked i installed first, opened the game and checked if everything was alright.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen i added one batch of 15 mods, checked if they worked and i liked. Those i disliked i removed and those that didn\u0027t worked i took a look if i could make a quick fix. (Repeat until you tested and removed those you dislike/don\u0027t work)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did that until i got my current install, pretty satisfied with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne thing you can do narrow down what you like faster is thinking about what is your goal with that install, (like, if you want a realistic experince, a more casual one, something else entirely, etc.). This way you can decide wich mods fit or don\u0027t fit your objectives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
