If the Kerbal dies within a certain time of EVAing (say 1.5 seconds) while under that set speed then respawn him in the command seat he occupied just moments ago.\n\n-If the game engine has a way of knowing if an object is above or below the surface, then you could teleport the kerbal a few coordinate points away from his craft, and above the surface when it detects the Kerbal going underground.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI really have no idea how to solve it or if it can even be solved, but I occasionally lose a pilot like this and its always frustrating. For me its kind of like sending a Kerbal up into space accidentally... sure its easily avoidable but that doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t happen.\n\nThanks for reading this far."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:48:57Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never had that problem actually."},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T02:52:27Z","Content":"Um... doesn\u0027t it usually say \u0022hatch obstructed\u0022 and not let you EVA?"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T04:56:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Um... doesn\u0027t it usually say \u0022hatch obstructed\u0022 and not let you EVA?\n\nIt doesn\u0027t for me.
