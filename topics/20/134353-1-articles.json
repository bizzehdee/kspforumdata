I want experiment-dependent unlocking of parts. Science points aren\u0027t that fun to play with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the science team tells you\u00A0to go Mach 1 in your rocket powered aircraft. They also say that you should take some experiments with you. Preferably the barometer and the thermometer. You fly away, go sound barrier, perform the experiments and go back with the results. Now your R\u0026amp;D is all happy and tells you to wait a few days. Need some time to analyse all that data. After a few days they come to you and demand on testing this new engine (Whiplash Jet Engine) they\u0027ve come up with. You go out, test it without crashing and go back. Bam! Now it\u0027s in your parts list in the VAB/SPH. And all that thanks to performing those experiments, because all the valuable data helped the scientists to understand the physics and conditions of the supersonic flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: certain experiments under certain conditions unlock you parts that somehow are tied to those conditions of flight AKA the (sorta) real life R\u0026amp;D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T03:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t mind some challenge missions that let you leapfrog ahead of the early tech tree.
