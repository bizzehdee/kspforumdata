I\u0027ve been playing with sigma dimensions and Kopernicus to resize the planets. I am having trouble with the lighting on planets such as the Mun and minmus with only the lower terrain being lit, with the rest of the terrain staying dark. I am also using SVE, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, scatter and better time warp. I was wondering if this was possible to fix.
