I installed RP-1/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E using the rp-1 express installer and Firespitter was also via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. I see within the realism overhaul mod folder there is a subfolder named \u0022suggested mods\u0022 and then a Firespitter folder within that seems to have a config in it but I\u0027m not sure if I need to do something with this orbit can read the config from that location. Seems to be that rp-1 or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E is causing it to not show up. Can someone point me in the correct direction?
