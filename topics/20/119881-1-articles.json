This can be a bit more complicated, they don\u0027t have to be straight up and down. A real-world example was the main engines on the space-shuttle. Of course they were gimbaled, but the central position, the node direction, was slightly off-set to compensate for the unbalanced position of the External Tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last number is the node size, which can affect things like the decoupler fairing over an engine, and the strength of the connection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u0027ll see that node_stack_bottom has the same numbers as node_stack_top. It does point in the opposite direction, but how that\u0027s done is hidden inside the program code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the numbers for the same tank in v1.0.x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 3.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -3.75, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_attach = 1.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly one has been changed, the Y-direction for the bottom node.

All the stock parts are in Gamedata/Squad/Parts/* When you get down to the actual part you may see a file named part.cfg (which can get a bit confusing) or something such as fuelTankJumbo-64.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the mod was made with an Apple or Linux computer and you\u0027re using Window the EOL (end of line) marker is different, and that can confuse the basic Windows Notepad app into showing one long line. I use a free program called Notepad\u002B\u002B which handles this, and does a lot of other stuff. There are other text file editors, but the important point is that the program is saved in the text file format, not as a word processor file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were other changes for v1.0 and some of them make a big difference; engines get very complicated. This particular hack will let you assemble the rocket. Most things had their temperature limit reduced. Just doing this will let you get something into orbit as a subject for photographs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027\u0027ve made my own parts by using stock models with a new part.cfg, but there are things in there I still will not touch. As long as you have the original download file, you\u0027re not going to do anything you can\u0027t fix if you make a mistake.
