It doesn\u0027t matter what mods, just so long as they take up that much RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you\u0027re trying to do. You\u0027re trying to figure out why win64 KSP is so unstable with lots of mods. The answer is, win64 KSP is the problem. The mods are fine, but KSP simply is not capable of handling that much memory usage. I\u0027d urge you to abandon this thread and ask a moderator to close it before it fills up with misinformation and makes mod authors\u0027 lives more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talavar","CreatedById":75264,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T23:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I kind of stopped playing for a while.
