This is what I wanted more than anything from 1.0. A heavy modded install just requires more parts for the same rocket, and it sucks compromising on aesthetics just to have a functional rocket.

Say I wanted to always allow EVAs:\n\n    [KSPAddon(KSPAddon.Startup.MainMenu, true)]public class EVAAnytime : GameVariables{    private void Awake() // important that this be in Awake    {        GameVariables.Instance = this;        DontDestroyOnLoad(this);    }    public override bool UnlockedEVA(float astroComplexNormLevel)    {        return true;    }}"}]}
