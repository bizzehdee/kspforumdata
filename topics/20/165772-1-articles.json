So I am trying to upload a craft to KerbalX, but I am having trouble. It is saying that I have to include a photo, but there is no prompt to add a picture file (steam screenshots- able to get them in files). I have 3 screenshots showing up in the upload craft prompt, but none are the correct one, out of 100\u002B screenshots, only 3 show up. Any help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
