The ability to preset \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E info screen arrangements would quicken setting up the screens needed, I.E. a launch config, a landing config, an orbital burn, an re-entry config...etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Interesting idea or not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
