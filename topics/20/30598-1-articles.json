For the life of me, I can\u0027t find any parts packs with a wide selection of fairings. More specifically, three meter to two meter fairings. However, a wide variety of fairing sizes would be greatly appreciated. Does anyone know where I can find a parts pack like this? If so, can you please supply a link?
