I am mainly looking for the ability to make a rotor spin at a slower speed somewhere between 0.1 rpm and 3.5 rpm for artificial gravity rings. Even at 5 rpm that is really too fast for it to be realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally I would like to make the slider in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E logarithmic/exponential to get fine control of the rpm at low rpm\u00A0and rougher control at higher rpm where the error is less pronounced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thank you for your time,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nelind21\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
