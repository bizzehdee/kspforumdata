I\u0027ve installed several interesting mods and have a few ideas I\u0027ve been wanting to try out, but haven\u0027t found out how. So here is my dilemma:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mechjeb 2 and Kerbal Foundaries installed. I\u0027ve been experimenting with the rover autopilot function and realized that getting from one pole of the planet to the next would be impossible to do in anything less than a day. I don\u0027t have a full day to just watch a little car drive across the entire planet, so I began to try some things out. I made the one kerbal within hope out, and the rover kept going. That was great, but 2.5km\u0027s out, it halted. After further research, I\u0027ve found that the load distance for any given ship not focused on is 2.5 km. My question is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any mods out there that can allow the continuous function of non-focused ships? Say I were to start the rover on a path on the Mun, then go back to the space center and fly another ship into orbit, all the while the rover on the Mun has still been driving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"that1steve","CreatedById":150499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T15:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDont think there is any way to do what your talking about, atleast not with the current version of ksp and mechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T17:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48720\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENeverUnload\u003C/a\u003E, but it\u0027s not updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it wouldn\u0027t help you out, because you can\u0027t change to another ship and go about your business; you could only stay on the ship you\u0027re already focused on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover autopilot isn\u0027t foolproof and often gets stuck, so you need to watch it anyways. If you do want to do a pole-to-pole drive, just break it up into smaller chunks and drive an hour or two a night while you watch TV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
