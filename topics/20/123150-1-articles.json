Do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people say RSS/RO is too hard, but all it is- is relearning KSP. Your first few rockets in the game where hard, and it\u0027s the same here. You simply have to figure out how to get there. What I would suggest is getting the FULL RO package, RealHeat, RealFuels, RealChutes, FAR, AJE, and so on. Procedural parts, and especially the fuel tanks are key. Without it you\u0027ll have a much harder time, but it\u0027s not impossible. Playing with these essential mods can make RSS \u003Cstrong\u003ESO[\\B] much easier! Since the stock KSP ISPs and such are EXTREMELY unrealistic in how weak they are. Lastly don\u0027t be crushed that getting into orbit is hard- NASA and the CCCP struggled in the beginning of the space race to make working, reliable rockets.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENow if you want to enhance the game, there are other mods to add to the experiance. Id suggest failure mods like Dangit, KerbalMechanics and LaunchFailure. So every experiance is unique. Along with Environmental Visual Enhancements. As to your life support issue, I suggest using Minable Resouces (I believe it\u0027s called) which allows you to use the mining set to mine for life support. AtomicAge may be another mod for you to use as it adds .5m, 1m and 2m nuclear engines. You just have to get them to burn real propellant and it would be good for RSS. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI can add to this list as you need, but this is what I have to suggest for now.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T11:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s to lose by giving it a go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopy your KSP folder and add the mods to its gamedata folder.
