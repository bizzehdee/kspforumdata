Well here is a solution. Now i\\\u0027m not much of an RP\\\u0027er but I want the ability to do this, so I have started on my first mod project. When finished this mod pack will include DIY building construction pieces, as well as one piece houses. I have an idea for a chimney part that puffs smoke, and a lot of other things. As I am an amateur at blender and have no modding experience it will be a long learning curve, but I am determined to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I will work on one piece houses, before moving on to more complex things. I have plans for a playground for kerbals to have fun in aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me what you think and PM me if you want to help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
