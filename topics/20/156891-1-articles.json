Everything else will remain unaffected. The game will even remember that the part was already researched if you add it back later after having removed it in the interim. It\u0027s just active, in-flight vessels that disappear forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-24T14:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2017 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
