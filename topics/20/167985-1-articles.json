Been killing time waiting for the expansion (constantly stalking the Challenges subforum; lookin\u0027 for good ones), and I feel like I need some new horizons; so to speak. It\u0027s been about 2,500 hours with the stock game (and nothing really left to accomplish accept a proper Grand Tour), and I\u0027d like to see what else is out there. I\u0027ve heard the names of other planets and moons enough times that I\u0027m definitely interested. So I was curious which route you guys would go, OPM or GPP? At this point, I\u0027m leaning towards OPM. It looks like it can just be added on top of an existing game; which appeals to me. However, GPP sounds pretty awesome as well. I know I might need a mod or 2 (like better timewarp for the outer planets), but I\u0027d like to keep my game as stock as possible. Speaking of which, I play without info mods or doing any calculations, so I\u0027m wondering if that would still be possible. Basically, guesstimating\u00A0 my rocket based on distance and size of body, payload, etc (part of the reason I\u0027ve been reluctant to add planets: I know the stock worlds pretty well by now, and adding new ones will sort of put me back to square one). Anyway, curious to hear what you guys think. Any feedback would be appreciated.

OPM is an expansion to the stock system, adding four outer planets and eleven moons.\u00A0 That brings the total number of celestial bodies in the game to 32 (including the sun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPP replaces the stock system entirely with a new set of planets and moons, and a new home world, Gael.\u00A0 Although Gael looks different, it\u0027s the same size with virtually the same gravity and atmosphere as Kerbin.\u00A0 It also has two moons, though with fewer biomes.\u00A0 The only thing that makes missions launched from Gael much different than Kerbin is that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is at about 9 degrees north latitude, which introduces some new difficulty into the game.\u00A0 GPP has a total of 31 celestial bodies (including two stars), so it\u0027s about the same size as Stock \u002B OPM.\u00A0 As an option, OPM can be added as a planetary system around the second star, Grannus, which is a small red dwarf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say the big difference between OPM and GPP is that the OPM bodies are all far from the home world.\u00A0 So if you are adding it for new places to go visit, be prepared for long missions that will take years to complete.\u00A0 GPP, on the other hand, will give you several nearby places that you can start visiting very soon with short trips.\u00A0 You\u0027ll be able to delve into something completely new and unexplored without having to undertake long missions.\u00A0 So it\u0027s really more just a matter of what appeals to you the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course when you install both GPP and OPM, the OPM planets are really far away around another star, taking decades to get there where you\u0027ll be cut off from any support from the home world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as mods go, the ones I consider most essential are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Engineer

From what understand, Eeloo gets moved, but everything else stays the same. I have tons of infrastructure around Jool\u0027s moons, so I thought it would be a good jumping-off point. It takes forever to swing around of course, bit I figured each time a window opened I could send a few more ships to each planet. Not sure if that\u0027s entirely feasible, since I\u0027ve never tried, but I figured with Jool\u0027s huge gravity well (not to mention Tylo and Laythe if I need them) that the transfers would be pretty easy. Just a whole \u0027lotta warpin\u0027. I would obviously go with the better timewarp mod. Nothing really left to do in my older career game, so I wouldn\u0027t much care about the inner planets. Power would obviously need to be addressed but, as for communication, I would mostly just ignore it. Definitely not goin\u0027 all that way to send probes. Everything will be manned. If I need to make an orbital scan for ore, I\u0027ll make use (finally) of the Mk1-2\u0027s remote pilot feature. It\u0027d be cool to actually get to use it.
