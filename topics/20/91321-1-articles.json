It ensures a standstill relative to the SOI\u0027s surface as long as its active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude speed would remain unchanged, meaning your craft wouldn\u0027t stay suspended in the same place in the universe. you\u0027d have to take care to land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Higgs Anchor would solve all of those problems above, since all of them relate to excess or uncontrollable orbital velocity. For a small probe, an excess of 1 m/s can quickly become uncontrollable if you\u0027re not good at steering. Landing a fully-built colony is nigh impossible if you\u0027re in a high orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe module itself would come in three sizes, 2.5, 1.25 and whatever the smallest diameter is, i forget. It would require low power for the small and 1.5 versions but much more for the 2.5 version, and run on electricity only. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts effect would be quick under no thrust, but thrusting can resist or escape the effect. That way, course correction is still possible under the effect of the Anchor, as well as easily driving hover vehicles with it online to prevent them from floating off on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the purpose of the module is NOT to raise the mass of an object, or its drag. Mass doesn\u0027t stop an object, simply increase the force of inertia, which is the Opposite of what a Higgs anchor\u0027s purpose is, and drag is not a factor in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anybody willing or interested in making such a part? Or want any more information on the idea in case i was unclear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T23:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a neat idea, though I doubt many will support it due to it being somewhat \u0022cheaty\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got something like this planned in an idea of mine to make a bunch of parts that do various magical physics bending things like hover and cancel gravity, but I don\u0027t think I will have time to do such a thing any time soon.
