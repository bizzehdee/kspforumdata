And as the experiment parts generally have to be built, delivered, researched in space and returned to Kerbin to get the science, a reason to visit them once built. It generates Station Science contracts which pay decently and generate bonus science when completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/5477\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/5477\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s complemented nicely by Orbital Material Science which adds more space station modules and experiment parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81578\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81578\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDmagic Orbital science has a number of useful experiment parts for probes and rovers that come with a variety of contracts \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBT85","CreatedById":114980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T08:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile not yet running at full tilt, Contract Configurator will be allowing modders to make mission packs for their mods easier than before. It\u0027s only about 2 months old and already very good. Thus far only one mission pack has been made as far as I know, and that\u0027s for SCANSat (dev version) and was a demonstrator for the idea. in a few months I think we\u0027ll hopefully see mission packs for all sorts of mods including Station Science, Orbital Material Science etc. I think Remote Tech will be useable in the next version too. It also allows you/modders to disable varous types of default in game missions. So for example, if you had a Remote Tech and SCANSat mission pack installed, you might want to disable the generic satellite contracts you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck it out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you any other mods like Kerbal Engineer, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, Contract Window \u002B, etc?
