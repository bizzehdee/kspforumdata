With \u003Cstrong\u003EKIS\u003C/strong\u003E/\u003Cstrong\u003EKAS\u003C/strong\u003E you can (dis)assemble ships in orbit. A debris lab (left over from a rescue contract) for example can be captured with a claw and brought to a space station. Once there an engineer can attach it and make it a permanent and functional part of your station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T20:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question then becomes, is it worth it to fly all over the kerbin system instead of just lifting up what you want? \u00A0It makes more sense for throwaway rockets that docked with your station.
