However, with my style of play and being as frugal with my monies as possible, is there a mod that\u0027ll let me send a \u0022service ship\u0022 to orbit and change out parts on a satellite/probe keeping it in orbit? I already have the setup to use a cargo bay shuttle-type thing to grab a satellite/probe, and in a couple runs out and back planet-side have been able to recover it. Only problem is the destruction of the satellite/probe in the cargo bay a couple times (I did not install docking stuff on them), and the cost of sending it up on another launch. Are there any mods out there that let me do this?"},{"CreatedByName":"lazaruz76","CreatedById":93846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:39:52Z","Content":"KIS Might let you do this. It just depends on how much and what you want to change. you can find it here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-0) \n\nTry that out. It lets you use Kerbals on EVA to add and remove parts. I have not tested to see what size limits on parts are tho. Also it\u0027s companion mod KAS add some cool winches and grapplehooks, Here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-1-0-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-5-0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-1-0-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-5-0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher48","CreatedById":135642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:42:58Z","Content":"Yeah, I think KIS would work. You would load a container with the new antenna, then send a kerbal on EVA to attach it to the probe to upgrade its capabilities."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T21:16:47Z","Content":"There is one in development Re3 - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663) - Check the fourth (last) modlet.
