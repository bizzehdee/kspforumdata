I immidatly checked if Kw Rockety was updated and it wasn\u0027t. Then I noticed it had a cool feature, that I didn\u0027t know it had. Now i\u0027m desperatly hoping they update it. After searching the web, I saw that Kw Rocketry was basically dying. So I just was wondering if its going to be updated or do I have to downgrade(If possible, just joined in .24) to .24.2. So will Kw Rocketry be updated?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T00:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rainstorm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T00:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekw is a parts pack, so it may or may not be broken by the update. try it to see if it works\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainstorm","CreatedById":125090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T00:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did, it seemed to work a bit, but the 1.25 fairings wouldn\u0027t close all the way and the engines arn\u0027t flush with the part their being attached to.
