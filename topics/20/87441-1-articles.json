It looked just like the opening payload on the RAH-66 Comanche. Things could actually be attached to the moving doors and the attached item will move with it, something all my other cargo doors don\u0027t do. Unfortunately I lost the mod and don\u0027t remember the mod name. I find myself greatly missing it. If anyone knows a mod like this please tell me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T00:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnimated parts in KSP can\u0027t move other parts via their animation; there is a mod that permits this, Infernal Robotics; but it will take a considerable amount of work and I believe you will have to use a stack attachnode instead of surface attach nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
