It\u0027s only got a couple of options for food/water containers, none of which I particularly like all that much. I\u0027d love to expand the number of cargo options I have, and I really like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E inline container models. I\u0027m attempting to add Food/Water to these containers, but nothing I try seems to be working. Either the parts load in normally, or they fail to load at all - never with food/water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally I\u0027d love to have something like a B9 part switch option that allows me to switch from a cargo container with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E inventory to something carrying food/water, to something carrying just food, and finally just water.. if not that, I\u0027d take simply adding the food/water to the container with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E inventory as well (I rarely use it anyway).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far, I\u0027ve tried simply adding something like\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Resource\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0name = Food\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0amount = 8200\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0maxamount = 8200\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the .cfg for the part, and that made them not load at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCreating a .cfg in the gamedata folder with something like\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n@PART[KIS_Container3]:NEEDS[Kerbalism,\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E]\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Resource\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0name = Food\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0amount = 8200\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0maxamount = 8200\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0}\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nmakes them load, but doesn\u0027t add the food to them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t know a lot about modding in KSP to be honest. I\u0027ve modified plenty of parts before to make them more to my liking, but mostly by ripping out chunks of one part and simply dropping it into the .cfg of another. Bluedog Design Bureau had a comparability folder filled with\u00A0.cfg\u0027s making the mod compatible with various other mods. Kerbalism wasn\u0027t one of those, but I was able to take the Snacks! compatibility .cfg and alter it to create new B9partswitch tanks for food/water, then get those parts to load those tanks.\u00A0What\u0027s particularly frustrating is that BDB has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank of its own that now has food/water as I\u0027d like (though it maintains the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E inventory as well).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone have any idea how I could do this, or what I might be doing wrong? Even something as simple as just adding these resources to the normal part would be a workable solution for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T04:19:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh.
