In life the more you do something the more experience you get at doing it and thus become better at that thing. E.g if your poor at playing football, the more you play the better you get, in your job the more you play with excel the better you get etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso would it be possible to increase the experience stars based on time in space?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo so to get the first star you need to get a year in kerbin orbit (makes space stations have a little purpose)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto get the second star, spend half a year in orbit of a moon or land and spend a quarter of a year on a moon (bases make sense)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto get the third star, spend half a year in orbit of or land on Duna or dres\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto get the fourth star, spend a year within jools sphere of influence\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nland on eve and return to obtain the 5th star\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni realise this may be difficult, but something along those lines seem a bit more realistic to me than being able to get up to 3 stars for just getting to orbit, plant a flag on the moons and escape kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na time based system makes more sense to me, thoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaff","CreatedById":172505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-24T16:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else not think this would be a good mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor is there one similar currently I could play with?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-24T16:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood idea!
