I made some tweaks on the parts so that extraction is a long process and takes weeks to months to fill a tank with 1600 units of space (with one drill that is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i build me a big Kerbonite rig with lots of drills and im loving it. The next thing i want to do, is have a seperate refinery for my fuel production project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could just build it next to my rig and go on with the converting but i want the refinery to be in Orbit around the Planet (for some reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem is, i cant think of a reason why i would do that (other than i want it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI adjusted the converters so i can fill 2 Tank(LFO) with 1 Tank(Kerbonite) of the same size, so it is a good idea to ship the lighter karbonite up to space before it gets converted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not a physicist but im pretty sure that that solution is scientific nonsense. Converting 1 pound through some mysterious Process to 2 pounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now im looking for ideas, how i can force myself to build a Orbital refinery, without resorting to some magical conversion :-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appriciate any (half) plausible suggestions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreez\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T11:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Grossbeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T12:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekarbonite, I thought was heavyer then LFO ?
