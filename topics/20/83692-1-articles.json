Since when does a rocket do that ever? Why would I fire my spaceplane\u0027s Nuclear Engine at sea level? When I\u0027m checking the main thrust engines I don\u0027t want the VTOL engines throwing off the indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like is the ability to see the CoT of individual and groups of engines. That way I can make sure each stage or possible combination points where I want it to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T06:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E does this (and lots more).\n"}]}
