I\u0027ve been (manually) keeping a spreadsheet for over 500 mods since 0.23 or before... So I defiantely feel your pain...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEspecially since 1.0.5 hit.... I think Squad\u0027s fast turnover time between releases has finally cuaght up with a lot of the major, and long-toothed mod devs, as burn-out...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLots of great mods havent been updated since 1.0, or 1.0.2 (also eyeballlin\u0027 KW \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )... Again, for good reason, people are getting burnt out having to work on mods and updates, instead of probably even getting time to play the game... I\u0027m sure it doesnt help when you have hundreds of people screaming for immediate updates and bug-fixes...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith 1.0.5 bringing lots of changes, and it basically being a hold-over version till 1.1 which is gonna be one MAJOR update, probably like never before, I\u0027m sure devs are just holding out till it drops and do major mod updates then, instead of wasting time for 1.0.5 fixes... Unfortunately, i think I see a LOT of mods being dropped, or changing hands, due to having to be basically re-written/modelled due to 1.1 coming... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can see where some community fixes, or even forks, may or may not get incorporated into mods after that, but I\u0027m sure some devs have their own ideas and directions they want to go with future updates... Also, like Kerbas said, when a mod gets abandoned, there\u0027s no real way to tell right away that it HAS been actually abandoned... So yeah, you dont get co-operation there...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I guess my post is pointless, other than to just say I agree with you and completely understand...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess my advice is just, when you come across these situations, the best thing to do is post on the mod thread, asking for clarification on the issue... I guarantee, you dont have to feel stoopid doing so, because I know there will someone else who is wondering the same... If you\u0027ll notice, I probably irritate mods quite a bit, since I\u0027m always asking for clarification on fixes, updates, links, forwards/backwards compatability, or unclear items in the OP...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know its helped me when I come across these posts from other people....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-19T02:09:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
