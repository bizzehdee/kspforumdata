I\u0027ve been using Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp mod for a few days now. It looks amazing, actually it looks so good, I can\u0027t go back to stock parts. The thing is, this mod seems to have some physics changes, what ends up happening is that I have a simple rocket, in orbit, no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E deviations, but under thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the nav ball goes insane. Not completely insane, but I can\u0027t go in a strait path. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while, and though the farthest I\u0027ve gotten is duna, I\u0027d like to point out that it\u0027s not a rocket design problem. IDK, it feels like the gimbal has been changed and the game doesn\u0027t work the way the mod author intended. Also I would point out I\u0027m playing 1.2 for mod compatibility, no idea if 1.3 breaks anything but I don\u0027t want to update unless this would magically fix my problem, but I doubt it since the mod seems a bit old anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also willing to replace it with a mod that has only stock parts, or maybe at most extra fuel tanks, but it has to look good. Please help!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
