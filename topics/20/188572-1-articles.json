I want to ask because I don\u0027t want to run into problems later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m making some patches to parts to make them use TexturesUnlimited. Makes things look better, a lot better. The main focus is on Ven\u0027s revamp.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart of that is making some maps to tell the engine what parts of a mesh to make how metallic, and here\u0027s my problem: I copy the original diffuse texture, modify it to fit what I have in mind and then use that as the metallic map. While Ven\u0027s is released under Creative Commons, which allows this kind of derivative work, I am not at all sure about Squad\u0027s original textures and I want to make absolutely sure I\u0027m not crossing some legal bounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I do happen to cross said bound I guess I\u0027d have no choice but to either leave the parts without metallic maps or make them from scratch, either by guessing where things are or by using the UV layout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize: As part of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch I\u0027m making I\u0027m copying Squad textures to make derivative work to use as a metallic map.
