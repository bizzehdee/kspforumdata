I use mod-admin (a great help btw) and i noticed that sometimes after swapping mods in and out to test things, for example toolbar would not function properly. If this is important, which mods install first, which last?

Install order will only matter if a mod overwrites shared files using an older or different version of the shared plugin, breaking the other mod in the process. see if you have an older version of one of the mods and update?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T16:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the specifics of any mod managers around here, but I\u0027d recommend installing the Toolbar Plugin last so as to overwrite any potentially older versions bundled with other plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T17:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t matter for most mods.
