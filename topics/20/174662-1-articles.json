Flight computer recognize node and start burning in time and it also aim right maneuver node (blue). But it doesnt recognize delta v difference and burn whole tank empty. Is there a way to fix it ? I play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E 1.22.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA other thing are perfomance problems. With about 40 mods (all only by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E) my KSP was Stable. After few hours mybe ram shortage so restart and have fun again. Adding principia whole ram is full after a start ( no other flight and no debris). There are Freezes every 5 minutes even with low predictions via principia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry my english is bad but i hope u understand my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
