This is a hidden\u00A0value\u00A0not normally shown on the UI but whenever a part is currently taking damage, remaining structural integrity is shown on the part itself similarly to the overheating overlay. The exact value might also be shown in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E while in EVA construction mode.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStructural integrity decreases in response to the following, with the mod\u0027s code hooking into where part destruction would normally happen:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nImpact exceeding the part\u0027s maximum tolerance. How much structural integrity is lost depends on both the part\u0027s maximum tolerance and\u00A0how much the impact exceeded said tolerance. Impact tolerance is now \u0022upper threshold for no damage\u0022, rather than \u0022lower threshold for instant destruction\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCore or skin temperature exceeding the part\u0027s maximum tolerance. Similarly to impacts, overheating now causes constant\u00A0damage over time while the heat is sustained, rather than instant destruction. How fast damage is accumulated depends on both how far above maximum tolerance the part is heated and how long the part is subjected to that temperature (eg. overheating once for five seconds will do more damage to a thermometer than overheating five times for one second each).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAmbient pressure exceeding the part\u0027s maximum tolerance.
