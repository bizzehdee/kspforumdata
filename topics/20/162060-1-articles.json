I downloaded the mod, and the installation instructions said to:Now, for a normal install simply unpack the GameData folder included in the download\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; MERGING \u0026lt;\u0026lt; the folders when prompted. This should be all you are required to do\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor a basic install.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat simply tells me to extract the GameData folder (which I can\u0027t do, since the GameData folder isn\u0027t compressed (zipped), so that\u0027s an issue). It then tells me to \u0027merge\u0027 the folders when prompted. So where do I extract the GameData folder \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T06:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Merge\u0022 means \u0022drag and drop the GameData folder from the download archive into the KSP root directory, upon which Windows will notify you that there is already a folder of that name in the destination and ask you if you want to merge, which you will answer with yes\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t see a GameData folder in the download, that means you simply need to click through one level down the folder hierarchy in the zip file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T08:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for helping me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
