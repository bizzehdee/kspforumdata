I am currently trying to make a Mig-15 but i can\u0027t get the right parts to do so, Could someone please edit, and give me an AV-R8 Winglet about the same dimensions as the Swept wings? Also could you give me another AV-R8 Winglet that\u0027s just a little bit smaller? And lastly, can I get a Turbojet Engine that is REALLY small? Thank you for the help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ThatOneGuy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/9/99/AV-R8_Winglet.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AV-R8_Winglet.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ummwut","CreatedById":29846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T06:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to try copying the parts you want, rename them, and set the rescale factor to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
