I know that BDArmory has a camera part, but that mod basically kills my PC (since I play on a potato), and I know that ALCOR had a camera part that only worked with RPM. Is there another mod that offers a camera part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ebookah","CreatedById":104280,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T20:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spacedock.info/mod/885/HullcamVDS%20Continued\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spacedock.info/mod/885/HullcamVDS Continued\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ottothesilent","CreatedById":146852,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T20:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ebookah","CreatedById":104280,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T21:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyour welcome\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
