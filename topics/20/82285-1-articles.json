The kerbals will only start to consume resources after they are first come into physices range - 2.5km. Before instalation I checked up on all my kerbals to see if they were in a station where I could add resources to keep them alive. After instalation I built supply ships to go to each station, or rescue ships to bing back the kerbals with enough supplies to get them back ok.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
