That is to say, when it loads on the launchpad or runway, the engines of the command part fire, regardless of how the staging is set up. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O, monoprop, solid fuel, it doesn\u0027t matter. The craft loads, and those engines fire. Sometimes I can work around it with action groups and quickly killing the throttle, but that doesn\u0027t help with solid fuel engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s not just a staging thing, because is it ONLY parts that have command AND engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s not a specific mod, because it happens with every part of that sort I\u0027ve found: Tundra Exploration (and any other Dragon replicas), Contares, Taurus HCV, and a bunch I can\u0027t remember at the moment. Since it\u0027s not one specific mod, I don\u0027t even know where to start looking for a fix. Nothing useful comes up in the log, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the REALLY weird thing: I recently got a new computer, did a fresh install of kerbal on it, re-downloaded every mod... and the problem has followed me. Obviously the one thing that did carry over was the LIST of mods I use, but none of the actual files or configs that might have gotten broken on the old system could be here, because everything is fresh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah. A big old what on this one.
