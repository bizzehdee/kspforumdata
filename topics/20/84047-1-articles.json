I notice it\u0027s been a while since the last post in this thread and would be interested to know if any progress has been made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting mechanic I noticed in this game a while ago, was that if you have a ship in orbit somewhere with most of it\u0027s fuel spent, and you then use Hyper Edit to instantly refill all the fuel, you\u0027re ship experiences a sudden decrease in velocity as the forces of gravity pull harder on your ship due to the substantial new mass you\u0027ve just cheated in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing this effect reminded me of a Sci-Fi series in which spaceships tend to slow down rapidly without the use of reverse thrusters or something similar. I always thought of this as the writers neglecting certain aspects of physics in favor of providing a better spectacle. But then I thought about it, and the series does use Inertial Dampners as an excuse for a large number of things. So I realized that if they turned off or turned down their Inertial Dampner systems, it would in fact cause the ship to slow down without having to use reverse thrusters. I don\u0027t know if the writers actually went by that idea(it\u0027s likely they didn\u0027t based on their track record of other things in the series), but it does work out. The Inertial Dampners reduce the mass of the vessel, and so by reducing their effect the vessel would gain mass and experience a greater pull from gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy they turn down the Inertial Dampners at certain arbitrary points, as well as any kind of direct correlation between mass of the ship, it\u0027s speed, and nearby celestial bodies that would be exerting meaningful gravitational force are never addressed at all. So if they have the technology for Inertial Dampners, then I can forgive them some aspects of their depiction of space travel, of course a lot of Sci-Fi series tend to gloss over the more technical details of their technology because it wouldn\u0027t appeal to most people. I\u0027m not talking about waving the magical science wand, but actual theoretical or actual concepts they could have used to explain certain technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I went off on a tangent there. The point is. I\u0027d really like to see an Inertial Dampner mod in KSP, something that reduces the overall mass of the entire vessel it\u0027s attached to in proportion to how much energy is used. Also, if you add it to the Intersellar mod tech-tree, I think it should come after Warp Drive research, or at the same time if you can\u0027t extend the tree further easily. Afterall, in real life there are some possible theories for warp-drives, but to the best of my knowledge, Inertial Dampners as seen in Science Fiction are still very much in the \u0022completely magical\u0022 part of sci-fi technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T08:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to throw an idea in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey say (= according to standard modell of particle physics) the Higgs boson gives all particles their mass.
