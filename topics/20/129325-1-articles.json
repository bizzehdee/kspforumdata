I\u0027m just getting back into KSP after a little break to deal with the headaches of Christmas. When I left, 1.05 was fairly new and many of the mods I wanted to play weren\u0027t compatible, so I was still playing on 1.04. For the last couple of days now, I\u0027ve been trying to get a modded 1.05 install working and running into constant problems with CKAN not installing mods or not updating them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate, I finally got it working by simply giving up on some of the mods.\u00A0I started a career up with the\u00A0following list of mods installed (copied straight\u00A0from AVC)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nKSP: 1.0.5 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\nUSI Tools - 0.5.4\nCactEye 2 - 0.6.11\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.8\nContract Pack: Bases and Stations - 3.1\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.5\nCrowd Sourced Science - 3.0.2\nDangIt - 0.6.2\nDeadly Reentry - 7.3.1\nEngine Lighting - 1.4.1\nFerram Aerospace Research - 0.15.5.4\nFirespitter - 7.1.5\nInterstellar Fuel Switch - 1.18\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.24.2\nKerbal Attachment System - 0.5.5\nKerbal Construction Time - 1.2.3\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.2.3\nkOS - 0.18.2\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.4\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.1.2\nNearFutureConstruction - 0.5.5\nNearFutureElectrical - 0.6.1\nNearFuturePropulsion - 0.5.4\nNearFutureSolar - 0.5.5\nNearFutureSpacecraft - 0.4.4\nFinal Frontier - 0.9.1.1749\nPlanetShine - 0.2.4.2\nProcedural Parts - 1.1.11\nQuickScroll - 1.3.2\nQuickSearch - 1.1.4\nRCS Build Aid - 0.7.6\nRemoteTech - 1.6.9\nSCANsat - 1.1.4.5\nSETI-CommunityTechTree - 0.9.5.1\nSETI-Greenhouse - 0.9.3\nSETI-BalanceMod - 0.9.5.2\nStageRecovery - 1.6.2\nTextureReplacer - 2.4.11\nThrottleControlledAvionics - 2.3.0.2\nTAC Life Support - 0.11.2.1\nTrajectories - 1.4.5\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.5\nTransfer Window Planner - 1.4\nTweakScale - 2.2.6\nUSI Core - 0.1.2\nKarbonite - 0.6.6\nNuclearRockets - 0.1.1\nUSI Survivability Pack - 0.3.3\nUniversal Storage - 1.1.0.8\n[x] Science! - 4.12\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, some of these I don\u0027t even know what they are as they installed with SETI. I read the brief description, but that often doesn\u0027t really say what they are for, such as the Throttle Controlled Avionics.

I assume they came from the Procedural Parts mod that I didn\u0027t realize was in there. I\u0027m on the fence regarding the realism or whatever arguments for or against using procedural parts, but from what I understand about how KSP works, they (procedural parts) are definitely better in terms of system resource usage. As such, I\u0027d like to try a game using only procedural parts and getting rid of any stock parts that fill the same role. For example, procedural boosters would override the stock SRBs, so there is no need in having both in the game, taking up resources and space in the build menus. How would I best go about identifying the stock parts that are replaced by procedural ones and then how do I remove only those parts, without loosing things like command pods and science modules and such?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think mainly what I\u0027m wanting here is to use procedural parts for things like boosters, fuel tanks, fairings, and wings. Maybe cargo bays if there is a procedural version of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry if this sounds like a stupid noob question or something. I\u0027m still recovering from a heavy bout of the flu and I\u0027m not quite firing on all cylinders. That\u0027s probably why I\u0027ve had so much trouble just trying to get things working again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T02:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would I best go about identifying the stock parts that are replaced by procedural ones\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing specs would be about the only way as far as I know.

Take the noted names you saved from the first step and look through likely looking .cfg files for the same name. Usually but not always the cfg file will have a similar name to the part name. You can remove that cfg file from the GameData folder and the part will not be loaded - though the part its self doesn\u0027t uses many resources - it\u0027s the textures you want and they\u0027ll still load even if no parts are using them (unless your using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128660-1051-0-dec-25-2015-dynamic-texture-loader/\u0022\u003EDTL\u003C/a\u003E). Next look for a texture name that appears to be associated with the cfg file - if your lucky it might be mentioned in the cfg file but usually not. One thing to be careful of - sometimes multiple parts use the same texture. If you see three cfg files and three .dds files chances are your OK. If you see three cfg files and one dds file it may be shared. For this reason I usually copy the cfg\u0027s and dds (sometimes tga or png) to another location outside the GameData folder. If I restart KSP and I have plain white pieces or missing pieces I have probably removed a needed texture (or a wrong cfg file) and I simply restore them. Can be a bit of a pain but will also get you familiar with the cfg files and soon you\u0027ll be editing them to better suit your requirements!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-06T02:53:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2016 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
