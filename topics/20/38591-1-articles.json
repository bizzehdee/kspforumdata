The Mechjeb control part won\u0027t attach to anything at all, so it\u0027s unusable. Novapunch caused my copy of KSP to get stuck in some loading loop. Impossible Innovation\u0027s fusion engines are now one-shot. Once throttled up, they will not shut down or allow any throttling. I had a couple other parts only mods that the parts won\u0027t attach to anything else properly. They act like they will,(snap in place and turn green) but when you click, they turn red, detach and jump to the cursor. The point of attachment disappears from the object and you can\u0027t use any others until you delete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. back to the basics for now.
