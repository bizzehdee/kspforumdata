You\u0026#39;d have to \u0026#39;crew transfer\u0026#39; kerbals from their pod or crew cabin to the airlock, then eva from the airlock... but... that\u0026#39;s a pretty realistic addition to the process anyway. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone have thoughts on which of those approaches sounds better?\n"}]}
