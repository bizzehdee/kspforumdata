With the Eve core built on a ThunderMaximus tank with its matching 9 engine mount (that only has four Kerbodynes mounted) I\u0027d like to connect the older Duna core to its bottom end. The Rockomax size will snuggle into the middle of those big engines just fine because the big mount can fit a Rockomax size engine to its center node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I didn\u0027t have the foresight to pop a Clampotron on there before setting off on my \u0022real\u0022 Eve mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried poking it with a claw mounted to an R1 RCS tank with a docking port on it, using Quantum Struts for bracing. That didn\u0027t go well, could not keep the two ships aligned once they got close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be cheaty about it and use Hyperedit to replace that returned and parked in high Kerbin orbit part of the Eve ship, but attaching a port in orbit, and getting it dead center and rotationally aligned would be more fun. Need to be able to make a docking type approach to a part that\u0027s not a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Which was in a retrograde orbit around Kerbin.
