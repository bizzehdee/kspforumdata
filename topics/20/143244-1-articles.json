word starting with \u0022K\u0022). \u00A0The only thing that ever got done was this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/jrossignol/FullContract/wiki/Agencies\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elist of agencies\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0One neat thing that I was planning was to have 3 main agencies, and when you take the starter contract for one agency it locks you out of the others (giving 3 ways to play it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it aimed to do stuff that has since been done many times by other authors. \u00A0So I\u0027m unlikely to pick this one back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract Pack: Space Objects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was intended to by my fourth contract pack after\u00A0Tourism Plus. \u00A0The idea would be to expand on the stock generated asteroids. \u00A0I wanted to do generated comets (and I wanted to make them look\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enice\u003C/em\u003E) using a similar system. \u00A0Killer asteroid redirect contracts would be a must. \u00A0In the end though, I couldn\u0027t think of many more ideas, and hit technical difficulties on the asteroid stuff. \u00A0I never made\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Emuch headway, so I switched over to Field Research and never looked back.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan

has a chance of ever seeing the light. \u00A0The idea is that this would be a sort of Anomaly Surveyor 2 (where the original has some 2001 tie-ins, this one would have 2010 tie-ins). \u00A0It was intended to be more of a story based contract pack, and I\u0027d spent a fair bit of time mapping out the story and working on some of the effects for the cut-scenes (yes, \u003Cem\u003Ecut-scenes\u003C/em\u003E!). \u00A0Of course the key moment of 2010 is when the monolith-builders compress Jupiter to start nuclear fusion. \u00A0So naturally, I had to reproduce that in KSP:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IhyqCbN.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IhyqCbN.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also put some

them to be successful. \u00A0So it\u0027s hard to tell what level of interest there is in a story based contract pack (there doesn\u0027t actually seem to be that much, from what I\u0027ve observed). \u00A0So this one will likely stay on the backburner for some time yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, as always\u00A0if you like what you see, make sure to head on over to my \u003Ca

the story mode for career could be a fun idea, giving a purpose and progression to career mode. I think your initial idea was a bit large to start though, having multiple agencies adds 3X the work- I think starting off with a short-ish progression, say 10-20 steps to complete the storyline, would be a better start.
