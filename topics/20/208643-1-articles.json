I\u2019m currently at the point where I have completed most of the nodes before upgrading R\u0026amp;D to level 3, so everything under 500 science points per node. I also have OPM and DMagic Orbital Science installed, so I have a good amount of science sources available \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t have a good feel for how difficult it is to get the rest of the science required to finish the tech tree, and am wondering how much I should use science labs on my science data. I just sent a big mission to Eve that includes a lab, but I am worried that processing all of the science through the lab will net me too many science points and lead to me completing the tech tree before I have had the opportunity to go to many planets.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any insight into roughly how many planets worth of science are required to complete the extended tech tree, and if it would be satisfying to have some moderate use of the science lab? I usually avoid using them in vanilla playthroughs because I don\u2019t enjoy have the entire tech tree unlocked without leaving Kerbin\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I am trying to avoid a similar predicament.

The more distant planets and moons have large multipliers compared to nearer planets and moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually if I have a large number of added science experiments available I greatly nerf the labs. I would still include a lab on all long range manned science missions even if only for role play purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
