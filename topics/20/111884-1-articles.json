Seems redundant now that we have stock ore and drills.\n\nI\u0027ve searched and asked around, but it doesn\u0027t look like EL has any support for stock ore.\n\nWould someone be able to please make a small mod that adds the ability to convert stock ore into EL-metal? Perhaps a new function on the ISRU the same way that it can convert ore to fuel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T19:56:22Z","Content":"You just want it to covert to MetalOre ?\n\nEDIT- This should work \n\n    @PART[ISRU]{\tMODULE\t{\t\t name = ModuleResourceConverter\t\t ConverterName = MetalOre\t\t StartActionName = Start ISRU [MetalOre]\t\t StopActionName = Stop ISRU [MetalOre]\t\tAutoShutdown = false\t\tGeneratesHeat = false\t\tUseSpecialistBonus = true\t\tSpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2\t\tSpecialistBonusBase = 0.05\t\tSpecialty = Engineer\t\tEfficiencyBonus = 1\t\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = Ore\t\t\tRatio = 0.25\t\t }\t\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\t\tRatio = 30\t\t }\t\t OUTPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = MetalOre\t\t\tRatio = 1\t\t\tDumpExcess = false\t\t }\t}}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T20:01:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:15:01Z","Content":"Oh, that simple?\n\nI should look into scripting MM myself some time, haha ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks a lot!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T12:51:44Z","Content":"I wonder if this might be what you are looking for?\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/80988-102-50extraplanetary-launchpads-extended-part-pack-and-extras/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThere is a mod there that changes EL to use the stock Ore instead of Metal ore. so you only have to mine stock ore.
