Ram so far ive found slowly reduces itself overtime and stabilizes, only increasing when there\u0027s a lot of stuff happening on screen (such as a part loaded rocket taking off)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mr.gvozd","CreatedById":186109,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-24T13:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224172007\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221662496130\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222641\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FusionNexus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/6/2022 at 11:28 PM, FusionNexus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003Eheyo again! lately my ksp modded instance has been really all over the place in performance, and I\u0027m not sure how to stabilize it. without removing mods, id rather not remove mods outright, I run precisely 123 mods, all on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, with in game showing 91 active mods (I\u0027m assuming this number is reflecting mods that actually make changes/additions to the game, and doesn\u0027t include core mods basically).
