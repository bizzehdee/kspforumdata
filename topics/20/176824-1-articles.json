There are mods that do just about everything, from airplanes, to mecha, to other star systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s one thing that feels left out of all this. One thing that should be important, but feels perpetually neglected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planet Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like this is a mistake. Kerbin is the Earth-equivalent of the Kerbol system. I feel that it should be the very first place of exploration, as the Kerbal species\u00A0makes its first baby-steps towards the Mun. Right now, though, there just isn\u0027t much to explore that isn\u0027t a stone\u0027s throw from the Kerbal Space Center. I\u0027d like to fix that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod project has the following goals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOne:\u00A0More and more regional Kerbin biomes.\u003C/strong\u003E This should encourage exploration far from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, flying to other continents and the far side of Kerbin. Why fly far away if there isn\u0027t science to be done out there? A grasslands biome is the same in every part of Kerbin, but can it be said that the African savannah, the Midwestern prairie, and the Kazakh steppe are truly all the same? Is a tropical rainforest in Thailand the same as in Brazil, or the Congo? Of course not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo:\u00A0Cities and city microbiomes scattered across Kerbin.\u003C/strong\u003E Right now, Kerbin, the only planet on which life is known to exist, feels fairly dead. The Kerbal Space Center, the island airfield, and a few launch pads scattered across the planet are the only signs of intelligent life-- or, well, whatever Kerbals are. I\u0027d like to see more in the way of wild flora, habitation, and obstacles that reward precision in landing as well as in launching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThree: More interesting landmarks to discover and visit\u003C/strong\u003E, with associated microbiomes like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has. Easter eggs scattered across the planet, with science rewards for finding them. Maybe with a somewhat randomized exact location so that some searching and aerial recon is required, to make aircraft even more useful. Kerbin feels boring-- and I don\u0027t think it should!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFour: Underwater biomes and science below Kerbin\u0027s oceans\u003C/strong\u003E and other planets with water in the Kerbol system. Wouldn\u0027t it be an interesting project to launch a submarine to explore the depths of Laythe to do science at the bottom of its oceans? Wouldn\u0027t it be exciting to discover and do science in a barrier reef, or a mid-ocean rift, or a deep ocean trench?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFive: An optional,\u00A0slightly reworked tech tree\u003C/strong\u003E that locks rocketry behind science requirements in Science and Career mode, and makes allowances for early aviation, to further encourage exploration of Kerbin before venturing to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESix: Compatibility\u003C/strong\u003E with Sandbox, Science Mode, Career Mode, and\u00A0other mods, especially ScanSAT, submarine part mods, and Firespitter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve read all of this so far, thank you. I really appreciate your interest. I can\u0027t do this alone; while I brim with enthusiasm, I lack the know-how to make a mod on my own. If anyone is available to be a mentor, a tutor, please contact me; I would be in your absolute debt for any teaching you could provide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
