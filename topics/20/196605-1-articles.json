Namely, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, which if I\u0027m not mistaken is 10x stock scale. So far I\u0027ve just been winging it, but what I want to know is how to adjust the mission specifications (orbital altitude and delta-v requirements, mainly) in a systematic way. Let me give you an example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSTS-3 involves launching and assembling a space telescope.\u00A0Pilot level is just getting it to any stable orbit.\u00A0Commander level is getting it to a 5\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#272a34;font-size:14px;text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E50\u002B km circular orbit inclined at 25-30 degrees. When I flew the mission at Commander level, the total delta-v\u00A0expended\u00A0was roughly 5000 m/s. So if someone runs the challenge in JNSQ (2.7x scale), or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E (replacing Kerbin with Earth), or some other scale, what should the minimum altitude be to make the challenge proportional to the scale factor? Specifically, is there a formula I can use to at least get a first approximation?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
