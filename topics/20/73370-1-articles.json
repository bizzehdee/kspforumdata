If you can manage to get a bit of infrustructure in place you can easily set up a funtioning colony in any SOI you want. I\u0027m a fan of colonizing the Jool system as you can get prety much anything there. lots of antimater for KSPI, an ocean on layth to get lithium/deuterium to power fusion. plenty of metal/kethane on bop/pol for easy ship construction as well as fission materials. I think the only thing I cant replicate out there is solid fuel for makeing sepretrons though they are not all that required when your constructing in space anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
