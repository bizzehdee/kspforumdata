Does that mean for each unit of Kethane I should be getting 1 unit of either fuel? How does the \u0027cooling efficiency\u0027 rate affect this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be, say 100 units of Kethane at 80% cooling efficiency could give me 80 units of oxidizer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the medium converter making monopropellant (rated at 30%), and used 66 units of Kethane to make 10 units of mono, shouldn\u0027t it have been 30?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help of links to an explanation of how this works would be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
