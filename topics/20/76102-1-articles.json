To do this i would randomly place a hacked sepratron and reduce the fuel and thrust values of the original engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroken Nozzle - This is just a combination of Efficiency Problem and Thrust Limit but combined in a way as to maintain the same burn time with reduced thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have thrown together a basic test mod implementing the Explode result as it is the easiest to program and tested this with the LV30 and LV45 in the early stage career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found it changed my design style and launch method a bit as I now have my launch towers on a separate stage so i can test my engines on low power before launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also try harder to not layer my rocket with extra engines in separate stages as i know there is a chance they will pop when i light them up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final change its forced on me is to maintain a low level of thrust for the full orbital insertion as apposed to reaching a targeted speed and shutting the engines off until AP is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for fun hears the chance table for 30 engines each having a 5% chance of error\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEngines\t| Chance Change\t| Chance Of Error\u003Cbr\u003E----------------------------------------------\u003Cbr\u003E1\t| 5.00%\t\t| 5.00%\u003Cbr\u003E2\t| 4.75%\t\t| 9.75%\u003Cbr\u003E3\t| 4.51%\t\t| 14.26%\u003Cbr\u003E4\t| 4.29%\t\t| 18.55%\u003Cbr\u003E5\t| 4.07%\t\t| 22.62%\u003Cbr\u003E6\t| 3.87%\t\t| 26.49%\u003Cbr\u003E7\t| 3.68%\t\t| 30.17%\u003Cbr\u003E8\t| 3.49%\t\t| 33.66%\u003Cbr\u003E9\t| 3.32%\t\t| 36.98%\u003Cbr\u003E10\t| 3.15%\t\t| 40.13%\u003Cbr\u003E11\t| 2.99%\t\t| 43.12%\u003Cbr\u003E12\t| 2.84%\t\t| 45.96%\u003Cbr\u003E13\t| 2.70%\t\t| 48.67%\u003Cbr\u003E14\t| 2.57%\t\t| 51.23%\u003Cbr\u003E15\t| 2.44%\t\t| 53.67%\u003Cbr\u003E16\t| 2.32%\t\t| 55.99%\u003Cbr\u003E17\t| 2.20%\t\t| 58.19%\u003Cbr\u003E18\t| 2.09%\t\t| 60.28%\u003Cbr\u003E19\t| 1.99%\t\t| 62.26%\u003Cbr\u003E20\t| 1.89%\t\t| 64.15%\u003Cbr\u003E21\t| 1.79%\t\t| 65.94%\u003Cbr\u003E22\t| 1.70%\t\t| 67.65%\u003Cbr\u003E23\t| 1.62%\t\t| 69.26%\u003Cbr\u003E24\t| 1.54%\t\t| 70.80%\u003Cbr\u003E25\t| 1.46%\t\t| 72.26%\u003Cbr\u003E26\t| 1.39%\t\t| 73.65%\u003Cbr\u003E27\t| 1.32%\t\t| 74.97%\u003Cbr\u003E28\t| 1.25%\t\t| 76.22%\u003Cbr\u003E29\t| 1.19%\t\t| 77.41%\u003Cbr\u003E30\t| 1.13%\t\t| 78.54%\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am testing with a 5% error chance and trying to do Mun flybys using a 19 engine design. The 1st stage of 12 booster engines has had problems a few times and i can just shut off the opposite engine and still reach orbit with no problems. If the 2nd or 3rd stage engine breaks on ignition it is a fail and we have to shutdown and recover. Iv not had the 3rd stage engine break whilst attempting reentry yet but 5% is a bit steep so it will happen one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T18:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be interested by this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81794-Alpha-2-2-Dang-It%21-A-random-failures-mod-%2818-june%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emod\u003C/a\u003E from Ippo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget engines may failed, but also everything between the switches and buttons and the engines themselves (kind of loose of throttle control, a tiny electric wire melt and engine get an odd behaviour, leak, ...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mpink","CreatedById":57827,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T20:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou may be interested by this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81794-Alpha-2-2-Dang-It%21-A-random-failures-mod-%2818-june%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emod\u003C/a\u003E from Ippo.\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget engines may failed, but also everything between the switches and buttons and the engines themselves (kind of loose of throttle control, a tiny electric wire melt and engine get an odd behaviour, leak, ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI most certainly am interested thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure at this point that its going to be at the same level as what i was thinking as we seam to have a very different idea as to when errors could happen and what they should be but then i have only just read about it and not played it so i should go investigate..............\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
