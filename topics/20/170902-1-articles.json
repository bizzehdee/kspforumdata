What I would like is to be able to add the action to the staging sequence editor so I can have the action only happen when I activate a particular stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example it would be nice to have my solar panels and deploy-able antennas extend on the same stage that my fairing is deployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is something like this out there already and I have not found it please point me in the right direction. If someone would like to create such a mod I would love to get this in my game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
