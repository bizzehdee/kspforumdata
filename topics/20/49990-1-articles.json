If not just search for Kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery planetary body has a scan mask (map of scanned areas) represented by a block of characters, which shows how disclosed (after scanning) your planet is. Incidentally, if you want to make the planet fully scanned you can just overwrite all these characters with full stops (.) and in-game will show a fully scanned planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as far as I\u0027m aware Kethane generation is done by starting with a \u0027seed\u0027 which reliably generates the same pattern of Kethane every time that particular seed is used. The persistance file just stores amounts of Kethane in each deposit, so you can\u0027t alter the location or spread of the deposits without changing the random seed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still using Kethane 0.7.7 or haven\u0027t upgraded to 0.8, change the seed number (to anything!), remove the SCENARIO section in your persistance file that contains the Kethane information (being careful to leave the other SCENARIO section untouched) and it will regenerate a different pattern, but there\u0027s still no guarantee the new pattern will have Kethane where you want. The seed number can be found in the resources.cfg file in the Kethane folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that new Kethane deposit generators will be coming soon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want Kethane and Ore in the same place, just regenerate both resources by deleting the SCENARIO section in your persistance file, edit the resources.cfg so that Ore and Kethane have the same seed, and voila. Ore and Kethane in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neiromaru","CreatedById":35074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T14:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
