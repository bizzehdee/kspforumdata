If you want to sell metal that you mined from the Mun, you\u0027d have to get the ship to Kerbin orbit first, and at that point you might as well land it.

Found out that a fully loaded 2.5 kontainer is too heavy for a single skipper or mainsail engine for reentry (even with a lot of parachutes). ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThen I kinda tweaked Stage Recovery\u0027s minimum reentry speed from 12 to 16 :\u0022\u003E which didn\u0027t work under 70km altitude but does fine with a 80km altitude. My 2 tests at that height, going.... retrograde or prograde (I forgot which is which :\u0022\u003E ) with a burn that would make the lowest altitude of my decent be between 5k - 10km while still above 70km while I can still switch focus to another ship. I get the notice of a successful stage recovery having a refund of 70%-80% that included the cargo.\n\nAm gonna try out the same approach starting with a Mun orbit and doing the burn for Kerbin with the same ending altitude. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Hopefully it will still work :\u0022\u003E\n\nRegards and thanks for your insight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vist","CreatedById":146781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:52:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Am gonna try out the same approach starting with a Mun orbit and doing the burn for Kerbin with the same ending altitude. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Hopefully it will still work :\u0022\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nI take that back ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) it\u0027s harder than I thought ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) :\u0022\u003E\n\nI think am going to do the transfers using a series of Colony Logistics Hubs of MKS/OKS :\u0022\u003E it\u0027ll take awhile but at least it\u0027s a sure thing to sell mined materials without the need to actually land. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
