If one tank happens to contain a larger amount of mass in the same volume than a different tank, that results in a smaller ship... but that small ship will have the exact same dV as a giant ship which has the same amount of fuel and dry mass, just packaged in a much larger container. Ultimately, every single volume unit in KSP is arbitrary, and they\u0027re not even consistent between different materials. One unit of monopropellant has a different volume than one unit of liquid fuel, for instance. It\u0027s like one thing is labeled in gallons and the next in liters and the next one again in pints and the final one in fillings of Kerbonaut helmets. In other words, if you\u0027re trying to balance something by volume, \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u0027re going to have a bad time.\u003C/em\u003E \u0026lt;/meme\u0026gt; \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for changing an engine\u0027s fuel consumption - you can\u0027t. At least not directly. The volume flow rate is computed by the game dynamically depending on various factors that you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E adjust. First, it computes a mass flow rate based on thrust and Isp; then, it looks up the arbitrary density of the resource in the resource definition and uses that to calculate a volume flow rate using the equally arbitrary volume units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relationship between thrust and Isp is a physical law; you cannot affect it. There is no way you will ever be able to keep thrust the same and also Isp the same, yet get a different mass flow rate. You could get a different volume flow rate by changing the resource density, but all that you do with that is exchange one arbitrary measurement for another. The actual fuel consumption in terms of mass per time remains identical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has a convenient effect: assuming you do not change the thrust, and you do not change the Isp, then you do not need to worry at all about adjusting the fuel consumption of the engine to a specific value. It is \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically correct\u003C/em\u003E, because the mass flow rate is always the same, and dV depends entirely on mass. If your kethane tank has the same wet and dry masses as your iquid fuel tank, and the engine has the same thrust and Isp, then you get the same dV. The propellant used or its density is irrelevant. If said kethane tank happens to contain 5.5 times as many arbitrary volume units, then the engine will also automatically display that it is consuming 5.5 times as many volume units per time. The underlying mass flow rate is still the same, though, and therefore the fuel consumption is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if for some reason you really wanted to make sure that a kethane tank of the same size (do the models even match?) as a liquid fuel tank has the same dV as it does, despite having a different wet and/or dry mass, then you need to change the base values that influence the mass flow rate. For example, if a kethane tank of the same size has a higher mass, then you need to lower the engine Isp. This will cause it to require more mass flow to achieve its rated thrust. I\u0027m not sure about the exact math involved, but for starters, divide Isp by the mass difference between the tanks. For example, the kethane tank has 1.5 times the mass of the liquid fuel tank, then do 800 / 1.5. Or, if the kethane tank happens to be 20% lighter, then do 800 / 0.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever even if that hits it pretty well, it will never hit it exactly, because even if the ratio of wet mass to dry mass used by kethane tanks is the same as that used by stock liquid fuel tanks (for which there is abolutely no guarantee), then the fact that you had a higher or lower wet mass also means you have a higher or lower dry mass, and that will throw the numbers off. And if the tank\u0027s ratio of wet to dry mass is different, then things get even more screwy. In that case it might be easier and quicker to edit all the kethane tanks to match stock liquid fuel tanks in wet and dry masses than tring to fiddle with the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T12:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit the tanks ... !!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what does ratio do for me then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tPROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tname = Oxidizer\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tratio = 1.1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much mass it pulls from which fuel type?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-23T12:21:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2014 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T15:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s a mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a single fuel, just put 1.0 there and call it a day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T00:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope I:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- switched the nukes to Kethane -
