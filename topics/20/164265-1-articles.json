However, I\u0027m yet to see one that tailors towards more graceful fuselage design for aircraft. I doubt I\u0027m the first to think of this, but I haven\u0027t yet found any topics that discuss this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe would only feature one part - a regular procedural fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsers can edit the same properties that current procedural parts mods allow, such as textures, width, length, part type (fuel, structural, battery, etc), and so on.

These would be unique to each end. For example, you could have a fuel tank that starts as a tall ellipse and ends as a flat ellipse, or a square with small chamfer corners growing in size as you move down the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSection width\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSection height\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChamfer size\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFillet radius\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECross Section Smoothing: \u003C/strong\u003EEach end of a fuel tank has optional smoothing. What this means is that you can make a tank change shape smoothly, rather than instantaneously. This would allow you to have multiple parts inline that gradually change shape so that your fuselage doesn\u0027t have any jagged lines. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qDARDbZ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis imgur link describes what I\u0027m talking about\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESection Offset: \u003C/strong\u003EEach end of a fuel tank can be offset vertically and horizontally.
