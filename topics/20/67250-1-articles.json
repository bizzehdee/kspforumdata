Low gravity of Pol woudl allow to make my ship big and carry much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI woudl probably loss some fuel because of carring kethane generator with me all time, instead putting it on space station waiting on me, but if it means it decreases number of randezvous i have to mmake, its viable option for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T19:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it more efficent to mine on a low gravity world and fly it where it\u0027s needed, or mine it on laythe and use turbojets to get into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T19:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it more efficent to mine on a low gravity world and fly it where it\u0027s needed, or mine it on laythe and use turbojets to get into orbit?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that getting landmass and kethane to intersect on Laythe is a tricky proposition, and pinpoint landing can be frustrating on Laythe as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T20:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you could just, y\u0027know, collect all the gasified Kethane that is Jool, and turn it into fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T20:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to land a refinery and have a tanker ship land(with kerbal) to use KAS to transfer fuel over. The refinery\u0027s tend to be a bit overengineerd so they do work as tankers in a pinch but mostly they just mine out a location and lift up and over to a new one. Out at jool I might actualy have the tanker delivering to an orbital fuel depot and have a different tug shuttling fuel to its final destination, depends on the volume I want to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELayth IMO isnt worth the effort of seting up a kethane opperation, too much trouble for a pinpoint landing in atmo and not enough land/kethane overlap in the equatorial zone. A ground base can be useful for other mods such as interstelar but I think for a fueling depot your just wasting alot of fuel to get it into orbit when there are the far easier low gravity options of bop/pol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aerandir","CreatedById":64613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T20:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust been from an external solar system tour starting with EEloo and then moving to jool and visiting with the same craft (but not the eeloo lab, I launched a jool one) vall, pol and bop, laythe I did but with a different lander (it had to work with FAR and DR), mined a lot of kethane on eeloo, vall and especially bop and pol that are very useful for that purpose, there are always at least 2 craft, an orbital mobile lab and science/kethane miner vessel, all highly modular, with external nukes, senior docking ports and so on, the jool lab was recycled in a very recent tylo landing mission with a dedicate lander (also with kethane). prepare your kerbals for a ten year trip \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
