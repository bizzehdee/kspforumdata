I played 2 months with horrible FPS and told myself I have to live with it. By chance I removed the wider contracts mod and installed Contracts Window\u002B, my FPS skyrocketed! I\u0027ve installed all kind of fluff like Astronomers Pack etc, my FPS was still high.\n\nThen I installed AmpYear Power, I noticed some FPS drop again, but not that bad, I can still play fine. \n\nAny ideas what can cause this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T09:53:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 09:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hendrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T09:59:37Z","Content":"Most likely the mod does something each frame that could be done only one.
