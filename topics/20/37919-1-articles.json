We are currently looking for a new plugin coder, who can work with us to create a plugin for our mod, which is already about half complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This mod will bring life support systems, and realistic needs for your Kerbals, into KSP. Although there have been many of these life support mods before, it is very clear that they have not been very well thought through; with our mod taking direct inspiration from the universal laws, and our life support mix fused from oxygen, and nitrogen, our mod will bring unprecedented realism to KSP. We are now looking for a coder who can write us a nice little script, which will kill off the Kerbals, once their food/water/oxygen is depleted, or when other gases are too high. This can be written in C\u002B,C\u002B\u002B,C#, or Python (as I believe), and we shall require completion within one month of you accepting this task. We will be working very closely with you, and more information shall be given, once you have been accepted for the task. Please apply by sending me a PM, and I will get back to you very soon. I will also accept anyone who has the necessary skill level, so don\u0027t even bother worrying about providing me with anything like a Portfolio, as I can guarantee anyone with the correct skill level a place on our team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EsvDefcon,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Defcon Corporation\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
