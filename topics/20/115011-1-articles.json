I have a feeling it would make a lot of peoples lives easier when it comes to take-off and landing, after all, that is what they\u0027re designed for, isn\u0027t it?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T06:26:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 06:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jumpyyoza**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T06:53:53Z","Content":"Hmm...I thought B9 has some, but it has been a while."},{"CreatedByName":"SchweinAero","CreatedById":126909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T07:54:41Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t there an option to make any control surface function as a flap?

There is a weak version of this in Stock that allows full or no deployment, which is actually closer to spoilers. There is however no mod that adds flaps without changing the aerodynamics. \n\nOP: If someone took the portion of the FAR code that creates the flap functionality and added it to stock without changing the aerodynamics that would be ideal, according to a comment by Maxmaps a few months ago (pre release) it should \u0022just work\u0022 as far as interacting with the stock aerodynamics, hopefully that hasn\u0027t changed. You might even ask ferram4 if he would be willing. If he is not, it\u0027s GNU licensed so I might give it a shot for you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T00:30:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T04:21:56Z","Content":"\u003E OP: If someone took the portion of the FAR code that creates the flap functionality and added it to stock without changing the aerodynamics that would be ideal, according to a comment by Maxmaps a few months ago (pre release) it should \u0022just work\u0022 as far as interacting with the stock aerodynamics, hopefully that hasn\u0027t changed.

Better results are observed when placing them close to the CoG (on the longitudinal axis). Sink the Slat in the leading edge for better results. Most impressive results are with really really heavy planes powered by those weak jets (think 100 tons mk3 planes with airliner wing).\n\nProperly simulated consequences are:\n\n- Higher lift for the same speed (aka, lower take-off and landing speed). (also means you can break your wing by deploying them above the safe speed)\n- Higher lift for the same AoA (aka, level flight possible at much lower approach speeds, and less rotation needed for take-off)\n- Higher drag when deployed\n- Instant \u0027KSP stall\u0027 when retracting the flaps while flying too slow for a clean wing configuration.\n- Ballooning effect induced by flap deployment\n\nCaveats:\n\n- Sunk slats/flaps will still produce lift with AOA, which means they will increase your wing area when then shouldn\u0027t.\n- sunk slats/flaps will still produce drag with speed, which means adding flaps to your design will probably reduce a bit the aircraft high speed performance.\n- You can\u0027t \u0027stage\u0027 flaps (unlike the picture above, no double slot system) since control surfaces attached to another control surface don\u0027t move when the parent control surface does. [1]\n\n[1] All objects display the same behaviour. Which is really weird visually, and quite a shame when trying to do multi-positions flaps. However you can have several flaps along the wing and have them bound to different action groups. This way you have the desired intermediate lift/drag configurations.\n\nI could provide pictures if someone is interested."}]}
