Cause I use KCT, and I keep getting contracts that expire in 1-2 days. It just isn\u0027t possible to make an orbital station around minmus in a day! Are there any mods that make it more realistic?

A year?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T08:55:36Z","Content":"\u003EIt just isn\u0027t possible to make an orbital station around minmus in a day! \n\nIndeed, it normally takes about 8 days to get to Minmus even if you build instantly (not using KCT).\n\nNormally there\u0027s two dates on the contract. The first is how long the contract is offered (1-2 days), and then how long you have to complete it (usually months or years). Are you sure you\u0027re not reading the first date when you should be looking at the second?\n\nIf you have a contract that is showing you only have a day to accept and complete it, please take a screenshot."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T08:59:11Z","Content":"The expiration time of 1-2 days is for accepting the contract.\n\nFor actually fulfilling it, you generally have a very long time. Even contracts to \u0022test part X while landed at Kerbin\u0022 give you something like 5 Kerbal years worth of time."},{"CreatedByName":"C1maCat","CreatedById":121247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:31:15Z","Content":"Thanks!
