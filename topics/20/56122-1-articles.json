I\u0027d be happy if someone could point out where I can find the features I\u0027m listing later in this post, or whether anyone would be willing to create a plugin or integrate these ideas in theirs. I know how to program a bit, but not enough to make a KSP plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never used any mod (crappy computer: don\u0027t touch it when it runs!), but I\u0027m running into serious planning probloems when my missions get more complicated. I went to Duna and back, visited Eve and landed, orbited Jool, orbited Moho with a probe. When I design my ships there\u0027s still so much uncertainty that it\u0027s hard to get to business with an actual Moho lander/return mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve figured out the details that I need/want to know, but couldn\u0027t find any plugins delivering this sort of thing. Here\u0027s a draft (sorry for the scribbling): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s30.postimg.org/5z37uj3gh/20131214_133545.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220131214_133545.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/index.php?lang=german\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebilder uploaden\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I want the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. flight path on a graph with height vs. speed over surface, including a prearranged \u0022optimum\u0022 and current data to see how you\u0027re doing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. flight simulation plot: sort of like the flight path, but with more parameters regarding stages. height vs. orbital speed with end-of-stage markers and indicators for atmospheric drag\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. landing simulation plot: height vs. orbital speed as above, plus height vs. inversed vertical speed, also including plan and telemetric data with staging/chute points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. as a requirement or the abovementioned plots I would like an in-game calculator for delta-v for prearrenged stage packages. My rockets have 10\u002B stages, and I want to be able to categorize them so I have an atmospheric stage, an orbital inserter, a payload delivery and a return vehicle. I know mechjoeb lets you display dv, but not in the way I would like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. a stallr boy MAP. I haven\u0027t found anything like this for in-game yet. Sure I could plot out delta v vs. distance for kerbin, but a dynamic calculation for every body (including traversing from Eve to Jool for example) would be awesome, along with a current delta-v meter so you can see where you can go with what you have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a lot to ask, and I might get down to fixing a solution for myself some day (maybe in a year or two if I stick with it).
