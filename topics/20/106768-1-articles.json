Many add-on parts packs used legacy stack node definitions that with oriented incorrectly, and so this is why the parts don\u0027t stack properly in 1.0.\n\nThere are numerous threads explaining the finer details on how to specify the correct node orientations, but that\u0027s mainly for add-on authors to worry about.\n\nIf you experience such issues when using an un-updated add-on in 1.0, please submit bug reports in the appropriate add-on thread."}]}
