Think of it as amount used/made per cycle.\n\nThe false on outputs means that it will stop converting when full, true would keep it converting.\n\nThis is handy for recipes where you may have a waste product. Look at the LH2/OX converter from Karbonite. LH2 set to false, and Oxygen set to true, means that it will dump oxygen as long as there is room for LH2. If both are set to false it will stop when one of them is full.\n\nYes there can be multiple inputs and outputs. Look at Karbonite and MKS/OKS modules (the Mk3s in particular) for examples."}]}
