already on this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModuleManager is, as has been pointed out, a tool rather than a behavior-changing \u0022mod\u0022 in its own right.\u00A0 As far as you-the-player are concerned, there are really just two things to know about it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s used by a very large fraction (I\u0027d say the majority) of mods out there.\u00A0 Because ModuleManager is so small (just a single DLL) and is needed by just about everybody, most mods that require it just install ModuleManager along with themselves.\u00A0 So if you install any significant number of mods at all, ModuleManager is likely to be along for the ride.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt allows doing an amazing amount of stuff to KSP without needing to write a single line of code.\u00A0 This means that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyou can mod KSP yourself\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, up to a point, without having to write a single line of code.\u00A0 You would be astonished at how easy it is.\u00A0 All you have to do is create your own text file with ModuleManager config in it, name the file so it ends in \u0022.cfg\u0022, and put it somewhere in your GameData folder.\u00A0 The syntax for ModuleManager is well-documented, plus you can look at lots of examples from various mods that do ModuleManager things.\u00A0 You can\u0027t do \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeverything\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E with just ModuleManager, but there\u0027s a lot you can do-- in particular, you can tweak the behaviors of parts to what you like.\u00A0 Wanna make it so that all wings have liquid-fuel storage, proportional to their mass?\u00A0 Simple, it\u0027s just a few lines of ModuleManager config.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I would suggest, when you start using mods:\u00A0 add them a bit at a time.\u00A0 Don\u0027t install a dozen all at once-- do it one at a time.\u00A0 Rationale:\u00A0 Changing just one thing at a time helps you understand the changes better.\u00A0 You\u0027re less likely to end up confused.\u00A0 In particular:\u00A0 although lots of mods are excellent, their quality (and their interactions with each other!) aren\u0027t necessarily up to professional QA standards, and odd behavior can happen.\u00A0 When it happens to you, you\u0027ll want to figure out \u0022which mod is causing that?\u0022\u00A0 And doing so is a lot harder if you don\u0027t have a feel for which mod works with what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also the case that if you have odd mod-caused behavior, you\u0027ll find it a lot more difficult to get help in the forums unless you know which mod is doing it, because other forum posters aren\u0027t running the same combination of mods that you are, and just posting \u0022here\u0027s a weird behavior and I don\u0027t know why and here are the 30
