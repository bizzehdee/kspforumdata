I also like the idea of creating my own custom flags in KSP. As far as I know, there are no mods that fix either of these issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be a great idea if someone made a mod that either adds a simple flag designer into KSP or makes it possible to add flags while the game is running. I have no clue if this would be possible and have no modding experience myself, so that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-17T03:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/223531-spacedude9/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223531\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/223531-spacedude9/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spacedude9\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0You\u0027re better off using some free in-browser art app and deciding on your flags far in advance (which would easily count as part of your mission planning). As far as I see things, it\u0027s not worth the effort to make an in-game art app.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
