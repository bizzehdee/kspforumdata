If \u0027Ignore Max Temp\u0027 is enabled, the part will not explode before transferring heat to other components of the vessel.\n\nIn the above examples, knowing the more advanced details of the thermal sim lets you provide a more detailed explanation of whats going on. From what I gather, *this* is what you should be trying to learn. There\u0027s plenty of player documentation and testing out there as well as people who will happily teach you."}]}
