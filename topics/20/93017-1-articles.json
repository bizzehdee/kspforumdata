I\u0027m working on a mod that has a solid rocket booster. This booster on earth weighs 168,200 kilograms or approx. 185 tons, most of it fuel. This is way larger than the Kerbal stock parts. Should I resize them to fit Kerbin? Should I keep them earth sized and all proportional? What are the proper converions for earth to kerbin measurements? And finally, how much does a unit of fuel weigh in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T02:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would say \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966-0-25-0-Realism-Overhaul-7-0-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekeep them 100% Earth-scaled and statted\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T05:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want parts that are useful at stock scale and balanced against stock, the rule of thumb is about a 64% linear scale.
