This would allow construction of spaceplanes made specifically for atmospheres on bodies such as Duna and Eve. Perhaps even including special methane-breathing engines that require ONLY oxidizer to run in atmospheres containing the combustible substance (Eve?)\n\nBefore anyone suggests it, I am not looking to run Kethane mod. I want something simple that adds only 2-4 engine prototypes and maybe special air intakes for this specific purpose and doesn\u0027t need exotic resources to work. My VAB has enough useless parts already."},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:24:51Z","Content":"Jet engines efficiency lies in the fact you don\u0027t have to carry oxydizer.

Kerbalnauts may want for example to operate an aircraft on Eve for short distance, low-speed flights, and the cost of fueling it would make efficiency gains easily outweigh those of raw speed or thrust. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sir, that\u0027s called a hybrid rocket, less efficient than a jet engine and less performance than a rocket.\n\u003E But, may I interest you in a [Nuclear Thermal Ramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto)\n\nI don\u0027t need anything especially exotic. Anything is more efficient than a jet engine that produces no thrust due to lack of breathable oxygen. \n\nThat said, thinking outside the box here, it makes sense in a non-terrestrial environment to pursue alternative propulsion engines capable of utilizing compounds present in alien atmospheres.

Instead of fuel all you need is an oxidizer.  I look forward to any mods on this.  I found **[Fireheart318](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159932-fireheart318/ \u0022Go to Fireheart318\u0027s profile\u0022)** It\u0027s Just Air mod on Curse but there is no download link.  Picture looks like a J-X4 Whiplash engine that has been modified.\n\nI miss the Kethane mod and would like to see something replace it.\n\nAlthough it\u0027s not working completely as I like I have been messing around with the J-90 Goliath\u0027s .cfg file with much success as part of an Eve return mission.  I just changedcheckForOxygen to False, added an oxidizer, and deleted IntakeAir.  It works.  Although I would like to assume Eve\u0027s atmosphere is combustible considering it has Explodium Sea\u0027s and only an oxidizer is required I looked up Saturn\u0027s moon Titan which has lakes of methane and found that it\u0027s atmosphere is 98.4% nitrogen and only 1.4% methane, and 0.1-.02% hydrogen.  Comparing this to Earths 20.95% oxygen atmosphere and I have a hard time justifying using Eve\u0027s atmosphere as a fuel source.\n\nIn conclusion even if you have to provide both a fuel and an oxidizer, turbine engines are far more efficient then rocket engines.  Real scientists are working on the subject of atmosphere breathing engines in non oxygen atmosphere and I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be part of Kerbal Space Program."},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T16:26:06Z","Content":"M2X and Atomic age have what you\u0027re looking for"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T16:49:26Z","Content":"You can do it all in module manager - you just need an intake which mixes inert atmosphere ( usual resource name is IntakeAtm ) \u0026 O2 using the stock converter module.
