Specifically something similar to the way Stock separates Lander/Stations/Debris but hopefully expandable and customizable. My saves always end up with too many probes and relays cluttering my display. As a use case, I have a fairly complex Iridium inspired network around Kerbin I would like to isolate from my other Satellites to show off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried searching for this feature, but if I\u0027ve missed an obvious answer please forgive me. If a mod doesn\u0027t currently exist, I would also appreciate any tips on how other players reduce orbital clutter. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKrez\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-19T02:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare you talking about flight or tracking station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntracking station has Tracking Station Evolved\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257416\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4585638915\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172162-141-dmagics-evolved-mods-tracking-station-evolved-v10-3-13-2018/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-27T17:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to set up your own classes of ships in any mod (that I know of), however you can change them to something that you don\u0027t use elsewhere e.g. call them all \u0027bases\u0027 and keep them separate that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTracking Station Evolved does a good job of keeping things tidy in the tracking station, you can sort by class (probe, relay etc.), by the body it\u0027s orbiting and by launch time and it will also show anything with a maneuver node planned at the top of the list and let you rename/reclassify vessels any time you like.
