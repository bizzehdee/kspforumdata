As you can see in the three views of my rough sketch. I picture this as holding two kerbals in tandem with an EVA hatch at the front. I think it would be great for rovers, landers, and space only craft.\n\nThe second idea here is a \u0022command Deck\u0022 module for those deep space interplanetary missions we all like to build. I\u0027ve just become frustrated with the looks of using the cuppola or a capsule in this capacity. I think there should be a part that fits the end of a hitchhiker and gives the impression that the ship is run from there. You can see a rough idea for it in the image below.\n\nAnyway, just a couple of ideas for parts I thought I would throw out there for anyone of our talented modders to get ideas from. If someone does take these up, please just let me know so I can be the first in line to use them!\n\n[![radialcockpitandcommanddeck.png](http://i479.photobucket.com/albums/rr153/seattle221/Kerbal/radialcockpitandcommanddeck.png)](http://s479.photobucket.com/user/seattle221/media/Kerbal/radialcockpitandcommanddeck.png.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T03:36:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sojourner**"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:30:51Z","Content":"I had a similar idea myself, even drawn some designs."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:32:31Z","Content":"I like the second one, it could be really cool."}]}
