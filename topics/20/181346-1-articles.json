There is already an option to reverse spin in the engine options, but that also reverses thrust. The torque created by two props spinning in the same direction can often unbalance or negatively affect flight characteristics on many of the builds I attempt. Especially with more than two propellers.\u00A0 I know this is an old, old, old problem going back before the P-38 Lightning. And I understand that there\u0027s a vast difference between a real-world solution and coding a mod; but it seems like a sensible fix to a problem I continually encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Perhaps it could/would/should be linked to the mirrored symmetry option,\u00A0 just a simple \u0022counter-rotate on/off\u0022 button available when engine are mirrored.\u00A0 Perhaps a sub-option for selecting inward spin and outward spin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had this problem? How complicated would this be?
