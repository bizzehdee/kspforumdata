If not, is there any information on how their algorithms work, or could anyone recommend some papers I can look at to get started? (I\u0027m familiar with basic flight dynamics theory already, and am more interested in the actual computational component.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-23T03:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2019 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by cwk0219\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
