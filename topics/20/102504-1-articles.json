Due to life support (I use [IFILS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92011-Release-V2-4-90-0-Interstellar-Flight-Inc-Kerbal-Life-Support-Mod)), I was planning on setting a longer commsat network and launching an unmanned mission. Problem is, using RT2, signal delay makes this impossible (at least for me).\n\nI\u0027m used to use RT2\u0027s flight computer to execute maneuver nodes. But what if I need to execute more than one in a row? Or for a precision landing? And for other tasks like docking, for example?\n\nHow do you deal with this problem? Using the flight computer provided on RT2? Using MechJeb? Using kOS? Disabling delay signal?\n\nWhat is the best way (easy but not immersion breaking)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T06:45:27Z","Content":"Since your question seems to be about mod usage, this thread has been moved to Add-on Affairs."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T08:51:21Z","Content":"\u003Ewhat if I need to execute more than one in a row? \n\nYou can add a delay to all commands. Calculate your maneuvers using [KSP TOT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476) (it can read your ship\u0027s position directly from the game) and then input the manuevers manaully:\n\n1h 13m: point normal\n\n1h 14m: burn 2.5 m/s\n\n1h 20m: point retrograde\n\n1h 21m: burn 73 m/s\n\n1h 34m: point 5.2 degrees off prograde, 21.7 degrees anti-normal\n\n1h 35m: burn 5.6 m/s\n\netc\n\nYou normally don\u0027t need to do that though; the only time-sensitive thing is the capture burn. Changing your inclination can wait for the next orbit (or be done ahead of time); a Hohmann transfer can wait for the next alignment, etc.\n\n\u003E Or for a precision landing?\n\n[http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2g1jbd/programmed_unmanned_landing_on_ike_with_remote/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2g1jbd/programmed_unmanned_landing_on_ike_with_remote/)\n\nAtmospheric landings are even easier; just aim into the atmosphere and have [Smart Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227) pop the chutes at the right time. [Trajectories](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694) is great for predicting landings.\n\n\u003EAnd for other tasks like docking, for example?\n\nIt\u0027s possible to dock with the signal delay to Duna. Not fun, but possible. \u0022Point at target\u0022 on both sides comes in handy (TGT and GRD\u002B), as does target relative velocity retrograde (RVEL and GRD-) to \u0022stop\u0022 relative to your target.\n\nWith the delay to Jool.. no. You need full scripting like [kOS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089)."},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:38:47Z","Content":"Thanks!
