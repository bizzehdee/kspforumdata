Besides, the Sepratron and the motors in KW Rocketry are often too powerful when all they need is a gentle push (even limiting the thrust to 0% is too high). I feel like the decouplers themselves should be more powerful.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T19:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could make a ship with just that part in it (If you can\u0027t start with the part, start with a command pod, attach the part to it, then set the part to root and toss the pod) to see the COM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you empty the fuel from it to make sure you\u0027re looking at the correct spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T05:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could make a ship with just that part in it (If you can\u0027t start with the part, start with a command pod, attach the part to it, then set the part to root and toss the pod) to see the COM.\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you empty the fuel from it to make sure you\u0027re looking at the correct spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, but I\u0027d like to see the CoM while attaching the part to the ship.

But you\u0027re right, the booster itself isn\u0027t always the only thing attached to the decoupler. I was going to suggest being able to view the CoM of a subsection rather than the individual parts. So for example if you clicked on the booster and toggled the plugin, it would factor in all parts that are children of the selected part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T16:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust having the COM show for all disconnected collections of parts (if - of course - you have the COM indicator turned on) would be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes I agree with you, I was just suggesting a workaround until someone writes a mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
