SO... my suggestion \u0026lt;something I do when station building\u0026gt; is, if you want more than 1 mechjeb, add a decoupler to a spot, then put mechjeb on said decoupler. This way, if you are doing this to make a station, you can dump the extra mechjebs once you dock the thing on which MJ was on, leaving 1 active MJ on the core item of your station \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T08:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWeird, I had MechJeb installed few days ago and there were no parts.
