I tried it with and without Unity. Structural parts work like a charm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried to make an engine and for that I copied a part.cfg from one of the stock engines. I changed the part.cfg only slightly and copied the original model files of the engine and no problem occurred. Then I tried to make a very simple model of my own. But though the model is perfectly attachable and everything in game, at launch my rocket does not want to move at all. When right clicking the engine it says it\u0027s outputting a very high power. I tried both .dae directly from blender and importing the .blend file in unity and export it with part tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I need to enable physics-wise in blender maybe? The few tutorials around don\u0027t have any information on this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease enlighten me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMorolas\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T18:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if you did this, but there is some vector that needs to be part of the 3d model that tells unity which way the engine exhaust goes so it knows which way the engine thrusts. I\u0027ve read about it in the tutorials, but haven\u0027t actually tried it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly as Eric says, you need to add an object in Unity that will tell the game where the thrust is coming from, and the direction it\u0027ll go in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake at a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24878\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26118?p=343215\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post343215\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E for more information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for any other information I suggest looking at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E in future, I\u0027m trying to collect everything into one place for people to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Morolas","CreatedById":62725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T23:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!
