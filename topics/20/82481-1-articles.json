In order to keep things interesting I would like to add some mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy laptop I am using g is not awsome at all. Decent processor, 3 gigs ram, no video card. It will not be upgraded I am actually playing g on my work machine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have graphics turned waaaay down. This prevented crashes but recently I added some more mods (satscan and orbital science) and am getting more crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my new career game on want lots of potential station and science, and ground bases. As such I planned to add msk/osk and station science. Along with tac life support to make things a little more interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also contemplating interstellar for some extra later game variety, and methane so I could do some resource e ploitation and refuel at colonies. And maybe the biomes mod to make it worth visiting a planet more than one or exploring a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am worried it will be too much for my minimal system. I keep the graphics down low but right now I am getting a lot of crashes when I switch screens (like from VBA to space centre, or reverting a launch). As ksp takes a few minutes to load up this is super duper frustrating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also probably want a few system addons like docking mechjeb improver navball and engineer. And .maybe the hooligan labs airships : D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? Would these mods work well together? Would oak/msk plus interstellar be to much. I am knew to mods and want stable set of choices making for a full , expanded game starting from scratch with full career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Mechanic","CreatedById":119038,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T08:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first I would advise you to use Active Texture Management. This might help you to reduce the crashes, especially if you use the \u0022aggressive\u0022 version which reduces the textures quite a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are quite a lot of lightweight mods that are really useful if you want to build space stations. Enhanced Navball and the Navball Dockingport Alignment Indicator for example are both useful and lightweight. I also use Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb and find them both to be very useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must admit I first thought MechJeb isn\u0027t for me but I changed my mind after trying it because the automation of some everyday tasks is nice to have. Some of the guidance options (aero-braking nodes, landing guidance) are also quite helpful if you don\u0027t want to eye-ball everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for little plugins that help you while flying I can also recommend the Vertical Velocity Control which is basically a cruise control for ascend and descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to extend the VAB/SPH toolbox you could use Editor Extensions, Tweakable Everything and Select Root.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout parts I would say that I would at first install all the small stuff I want to use and then check for stability. With my new career in .24.2 I started using MKS/OKS and Karbonite (now bundled with MKS/OKS). I haven\u0027t played with it much because I\u0027m not that far into my career but I took a look at them so as for now I would recommend them. Someone else might be able to tell a bit more about them. If you like some additional challenge while building bases and space stations you could use TAC Life Support with is supported by MKS/OKS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...that\u0027s it for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are too many awesome mods to use in one save anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You can find a nice overview \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T08:29:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The Mechanic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot the link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
