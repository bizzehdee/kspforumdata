I can say this. The MechJeb losses are not do to drag, they are due to lower engine ISP in lower atmosphere. I can\u0027t explain the science but the atmosphere rolling around the nozzles outlet causes a loss of ejection force. Toroidal Aerospike rocket avoids this by thrusting at a conic using momentum induced turbulence in the atmosphere to dissociate the atmosphere momentarily from the ejection resulting in high takeoff ISP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If you are going to make a tall ship, do it with tall starting parts, there is segmental flexibility as each node, and lots of short part stacked causes bending particularly in lower atmosphere. If you are doing a 20 stage rocket from scale mods, (I do 1.414x from 0.5 to 3, 0.625, .85, 1.25, 1.7, 2.5, 3.75) you prolly should avoid very tall engines like LV-N unless u use struts to stabilize. dV is something like 23000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There are better ways, ION drives can get very high dV without all the stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tall ships should be shaped like an inverted cone, very tall sections will tend to be less stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T08:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou...really should have looked at the [RO] tag before posting that.
