Turns out I am far too much of an idiot to get my head round all of it. I did notice that once it was installed the part tabs had been extended to include separate tabs for docking ports, electrics, control surfaces, wings etc. It was mod friendly as non stock parts were all in the correct places. Once i\u0027d done a fresh install and had my usual mods back on it reverted back to stock. Must be something in KSPI E or one of its dependencies. \n\nI find the stock filters to be a little bit finicky and busy for my OCD. Think i might just have to make custom sets with my mods and stop being lazy ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"lazaruz76","CreatedById":93846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:29:04Z","Content":"You could try the Filter extensions mod. it can be found here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231-1-0-x-Filter-Extensions-2-1-2-%28May-17%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231-1-0-x-Filter-Extensions-2-1-2-%28May-17%29)\n\nThis is one of my \u0022must have\u0022 mods.
