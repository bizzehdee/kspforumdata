First off the file for this railway will be ENORMOUS! Around 20Mb minimum simply due to the terrain not being flat, and texture \u002B models. And that brings us to the other point. There would be 2 ways to implement this in Kerbtown: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make one giant model for the whole train track, this method would cause texture ripping due to the size this model would have to be, on top of this, such a model would take AGES to design and test, and in the end it would be useless anyway due to texture ripping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Split the model into many separate pieces. This one would be. Much more practical than #1 but still be nearly impossible to design and test. On top of this, such a runway would be purely cosmetic and add. Rey little to Kerbin in general. Not many people would be willing to spend thier time on such a project. But hey, prove me wrong, I\u0027d be glad to have a non performance dropping trans-Kerbin-railway! Oh and it takes a lot of data to make moving train animations with collision boxes over long enough periods of time to allow them to get from one side of the tracks to another!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T04:24:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spacepetscompany\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FormosaT_9","CreatedById":229418,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-01T16:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PPk-H7aCrP8?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022beta from xuan_de\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EI just want to tell you, someone (not me; a friend in CN) try to do it after almost \u003Cstrong\u003E10 YEARS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
