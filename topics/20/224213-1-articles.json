I was barely able to limp to orbit in the early game, and after that, I found myself hamstrung by a lack of funds and science. I still want a challenge, with the need for larger rockets, more fuel, and longer distances, but for it to be less grindy than the base-scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/142336-122-half-size-rss-v17-updated-2-8-2017/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHalf Size \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E exists, but I was unable to get it to work on an up-to-date current version of KSP.
