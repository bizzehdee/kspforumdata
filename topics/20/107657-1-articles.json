As such, it\u0027s obviously not possible that squad will ever incorporate such things into pilot experience.\n\nI was wondering if anyone thought of writing a mod to integrate it?\n\nFor instance: \n\nLevel 0 pilots have SAS stability\n\nLevel 1 can point at all 6 primary directions\n\nLevel 2 can point at AND execute maneuver nodes (using mechjeb)\n\nLevel 3 can execute ascents and orbital insertion (using MechJeb)\n\nLevel 4 can execute transfers (using MechJeb)\n\nLevel 5 can execute targeted landings and docking (using MechJeb)\n\nOr something of the sort?\n\nFurthermore, perhaps engineers, rather than gaining piloting skills, can gain access to information from MechJeb and/or use of Kerbal Attachment System (KAS), for instance:\n\nLevel 0 engineers can fix broken parts\n\nLevel 1 can use Kerbal Attachment System\n\nLevel 2 has access to transfer windows (using MechJeb) \n\nLevel 3 can see trajectory in flight (to make manual targeted landings easier)\n\nLevel 4 (need ideas?)\n\nLevel 5 (need ideas?)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Other ideas to make this mod better?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:02:51Z","Content":"This wouldn\u0027t be a standalone mod, but rather MechJeb and KAS would have to be modified.\n\nIn fact KAS has been partially replaced by [KIS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111) which does require Engineers (KAS will also be updated). [EPL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545) requires engineers and the level matters.\n\nSo basically.. if you can think of a way that a mod could be enhanced by checking Kerbal skills (or SAS availability), then petition that mod to do so. Or better yet contribute a patch. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
