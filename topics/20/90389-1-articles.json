I just liked the way it integrated. But since Finepint will be coming to stock, I decided to swap it out. I am terribly disappointed. I get constant aerial survey missions, which I just find dull. Then there is the constant stream of base/station building missions. ...? How many NEW stations do I need to put around places? Why don\u0027t I ever get the chance to add-on to a station? Once a satellite is up, that\u0027s it. Might as well destroy it cause you will never go back to it again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I appreciate that Finepint did add a little onto stock, it didn\u0027t fix anything. Missions are still repetitive with no reason to actually complete them except for money. At least Mission Controller\u0027s satellite missions have a chance to spawn a repair mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe location rings and markers are a very nice addition though. Help me out guys, am I missing something?

I rationalize this by saying that I\u0027m putting some telecom company\u0027s satellite into orbit, and in exchange they let me piggyback my own deep space comm relay on top of the infrastructure they\u0027re paying me to put up, so long as I leave the equipment in place. This gives a sort of infrastructure-building feel to the contracts, in addition to how I pay the bills for my rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent people are certainly going to feel different ways about the mod, though. If Fine Print isn\u0027t doing it for you, Station Science\u0027s contract extensions might feel a *little* bit more cumulative, so maybe try that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T07:31:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 07:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by memorablynamed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T09:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHowdy, Fine Print author here. You probably aren\u0027t seeing all of my contract types yet, as they unlock as you unlock technology. There are seven contract types in the mod, though even within each type, they can be generated very differently. The reason that \u0022revisit\u0022 contracts are not in the mod currently is simple: I haven\u0027t had time to add them yet. There is no technical reason other than that. Time is a fickle mistress! If your problem with the mod is incentive, then I don\u0027t believe any contract mods will help unfortunately. Right now there are not many currency sinks in the game to drop all of that extra science and funds on. This does look like it will be getting better in the future, with the ability to improve structures and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to mention that if you are receiving a \u003Cstrong\u003Econstant\u003C/strong\u003E stream of contracts, then that is a bug, or your configuration file has been modified. You should only be receiving at most two contracts of each type from my mod at any given time. My contracts are hard capped as to how many can generate on the contract board at one time, though that value is configurable. The contract system chooses contracts absolutely randomly, but this added layer of security keeps the board varied.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T05:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for replying, and I apologize for not seeing this earlier. I missed it on my subscribed list. Anyway, it may have been messed up because I had originally installed MC2 after playing with an earlier version of FP and I don\u0027t think I ever fully deleted the original FP folder, I just removed MC2. I actually just saw your post from earlier about the new features and changes to FP coming, and was greatly impressed. The survey changes should address most of the issues I had personally with them before and make them much more enjoyable. I don\u0027t know that \u0022incentive\u0022 is really the problem as far as rewards, but more like just wanting other things to do besides random, pointless surveys. It looks like the new changes will address that as well though with actually having something to do there besides just flying or driving over it. I\u0027m glad to hear that \u0022revisit\u0022 missions might make it in eventually (if time allows) and congrats on getting into the base game! I look forward to seeing where it goes now that it has Squad\u0027s official \u0022seal of approval.\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
