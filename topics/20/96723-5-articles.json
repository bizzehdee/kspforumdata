Tail fins will manage to keep it going straight even at 5.88 (the TWR I tested, could be even more) without tumbling, because it is aerodynamically stable. However, forget any kind of maneuvers. You will be going only in one direction only at that kind of TWR and that kind of speed. A slight change in airflow direction would decimate your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doggydog","CreatedById":106996,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T08:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Here is a FUlly Stock Aerodynamicly Unstable prope launcher with no Fins going straight to orbit on 1st try.
