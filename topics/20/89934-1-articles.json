I cannot get version 24 or 25 to run on my computer. I am stuck using using 23.0 (would love to try 23.5 but it is not available for download).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have run into a problem. Two big long ships, sorta heavy at each end. When docked, they want to wobble along the docking port (1 meter port, not the shielded one that is super-wimpy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ships once docked stay together and do not bend much under full thrust. But, they have begun to eventually just blow up. A part blows, then others. I hit F9 to go back to the previous save, it blows up parts coming out of the save or shortly after. As though it had accumulated enough stresses previously that the parts can\u0027t take it (yes, I know the game does not truly keep track of stress levels or bending levels, but something is introducing an error that eventually makes something blow parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping something like \u0022Quantum Struts\u0022 could solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I cannot find the old version that would work with 23.0, only the new one for 25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone point to where I can find the older v 23 Quantum Struts, or some other mod with equal functionality for v 23.0, that would help to solve the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I did try to address some of the problem already, by redesigning the other ship. So that it was a very short but wider ship. So, less leverage for bending, but the same mass. I thought that had solved the issue before, when the two identical ships were simply bending so much they broke apart under thrust. But then I found out that while the new short wide ship does not have as much of a problem with bending under thrust, the combined docked ships eventually blows up parts. I\u0027ve not had any docked ships that have done this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is an old Kludge involving using a cluster of small docking ports, but that is not an example of crazy Kerbal stuff (like Asparagus staging), but more of a forced dumb solution to a problem that ought not to exist (I thought this wobble, and bending while docked problem was fixed LONG before 23.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- GeorgeG\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-10T18:47:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2014 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T19:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 you can use.

Neither one would load properly on my computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had to give up on functional docking, at least for leaving Kerbin (Two launches, a lander and it\u0027s transfer stage behind it for a flight back from Moho, and then a launch of a slightly bigger transfer stage to dock with the nose of the lander, as a puller, for the flight from Kerbin to Moho). I fly them both into orbit, then dock them, for the sake of accomplishing the task. But they won\u0027t survive. So, then I have both assembled in docked configuration in the VAB, four struts added, and use HyperEdit to put them into the same orbit, with the same fuel levels. They survive fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey won\u0027t be undocked until much later when the outbound Transfer stage (docked with the nose of the lander, pulling it) has run low on fuel, with the whole docked ship in orbit around Moho. The outbound Transfer stage will have some fuel left, so after the mission to Moho\u0027s surface and back up I\u0027ll want to re-dock it with the lander and its return transfer stage (attached to the rear of the lander). By that time most of the fuel tanks will be gone, as will two nuclear engines, so I expect the wobble/Kraken problems won\u0027t repeat. Although as I type this I realize ought to do a test flight in low Kerbin orbit to simulate that configuration to be sure it won\u0027t be a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- GeorgeG\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T19:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-25-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v2-4-4-10-7-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement \u003C/a\u003E has older versions available for download.
