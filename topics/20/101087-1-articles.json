At first this game wasn\u0027t that interesting to me, then I discovered the \u0022Add-on Releases\u0022 section and the game totally changed.\n\nI started using ScanSat, Remote Tech, Deadly Reentry, those loving USI addons... and few other mods for resources and space station modules. Really really beautiful.\n\nHowever...\n\nIt looked like there was always something \u0022missing\u0022, something that I could add and integrate. So I decided to delete everything and restart choosing accurately which mod/plugin/addon/whatever to install. But meh.. what a choice!\n\nFirst of all, I found my win 8.1 / 64bit install isn\u0027t -that- supported from the game and this is even more complicating things (I suppose)\n\nSecondly... if it\u0027s up to me, I would download everything and go berserk. More stuff, more modules, more everything, more fun. But it doesn\u0027t look to be such a good idea. Even because Some mods apparently don\u0027t support others.\n\nRecently I have \u0022discovered\u0022 the realism overhaul thread which is offering many interesting things, but although I do want something more realistic, I am not sure it suites perfectly to me (I like the challenge of it, but I would love to discover things using ScanSat and have fun with station modules/colonisation, still trying to figure out if it is supported).\n\nAt the end, is there any guide, or package, or anything else that helps choosing the mods in that flooded section?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T14:19:01Z","Content":"First - the Windows 64-bit version of KSP/Unity itself is buggy, so you\u0027re always likely to have problems with it. That\u0027s why a lot of mod-makers don\u0027t support it and Squad themselves don\u0027t recommend it now either.\n\nSecond - choosing mods and the style in which you like to play is very much a personal choice, so while lots of people will make recommendations there\u0027s nothing that will be \u0027right\u0027 for everyone.\n\nThird - CKAN will indicate compatibility problems\n\nFourth - the best overview of published mods is probably [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library), stickied in the add-ons forum."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T14:20:45Z","Content":"If you like [RSS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-90-Real-Solar-System-v8-5-Dec-23), but don\u0027t want to do RO, I suggest getting the[1/10th config](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-90-Real-Solar-System-v8-4-Dec-21-14?p=1599467\u0026viewfull=1#post1599467) for it.

If you use [FAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-90-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-6-12-27-14) (highly recommended since 1.0 will change the aerodynamics) you will need about 5km/s to reach orbit. With FAR I also suggest [Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-0-90-Procedural-Fairings-3-11-manual-shape-controls-%28December-17%29) (AGain, 1.0 just around the corner) to get used to using them for things.
