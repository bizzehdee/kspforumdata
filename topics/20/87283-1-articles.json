I downloaded the C9 mod, and although the upgraded mk 2 stuff looks great from the outside, the interior is utterly unuseable. Is it possible to change the interior view of this piece to that of the mk1 cockpit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is it possible to change the view point within the cockpit itself? I\u0027d like to be sitting a little higher up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
