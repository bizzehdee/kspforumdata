I am trying to make Science depend on resources without using mods ( managed it using mods but it was cranky and didn\u0027t work that well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have managed to get to a stage where I can activate and experiment and transmit the data then use a lab in another module to clean the experiment, consuming a resource (I added my own called \u0027Experiments\u0027 in this case. The consumption rate is a bit wonky but it works in principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is I can also \u0027Keep\u0027 the data, then use Crew Manifest to transfer it to a crew capsule (or other Science Container) and recover it *without* consuming any resources. Is this Crew Manifest\u0027s fault? If I remove that data via EVA will it require \u0027cleaning\u0027 and thus consume a resource in doing so?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour advice please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if anyone knows where there detailed documentation for the Science CFG configs is I\u0027d appreciate a link. It\u0027d help massively. All this is goign towards integrating somewhat realistic science into the ISS Community mod for the Destiny, Columbus and Kibo laboratories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T22:05:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MDBenson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
