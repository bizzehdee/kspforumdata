I was having a lot of fun when I came across a small annoyance that never bothered me before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen docking and undocking using the monitors from iva you have the slight pause as the vessel becomes one but it kicks you to the outside cam during this, I was just wanting to know if there are any addons out there or anyway of changing this to keep you in iva view after you have docked/undocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said it is only a small annoyance but wanted to put it out there just in case, Cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a more appropriate thread for this I apologize, I was hoping one of you talented guys might want to have a look in to it though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T17:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if Raster Prop Monitor has this function, but ALCOR might.

The issue was with using raster prop, when un-docking/docking in iva it automatically changes the camera to external, resulting in you having to change the camera back. Its a very minor thing that no doubt would need a lot of work to get around lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just think it would be awesome going the whole way from launch, rendezvousing with your target and re-entering Kerbins atmosphere without ever leaving the cockpit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T18:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s a minor thing, really.
