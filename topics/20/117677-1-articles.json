I\u0027ll start off with that. I run... okay sometimes(20-30 frames on a *good day)* and that\u0027s only while actually controling a vessel. While I\u0027m in the VAB or SPH, I run fine as long as I pull the spacecraft all the way to the top, if I look down at the ground, my framerate drops to around 1-2 FPS. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s the kerbals, or something else to do with the buildings, but I was wondering if there was any way to fix this.\n\nCheers, and thanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T06:03:27Z","Content":"Settings \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Gameplay \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Show Space Center Crew = off\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Settings](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Settings)\n\nAlso you can switch off/decrease differnt video options such as Texture Quality and especially lights, shaders and other such things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T06:05:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid**"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T07:25:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Settings \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Gameplay \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Show Space Center Crew = off\n\u003E [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Settings](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Settings)\n\u003E \n\u003E Also you can switch off/decrease differnt video options such as Texture Quality and especially lights, shaders and other such things.\n\nWow, I...
