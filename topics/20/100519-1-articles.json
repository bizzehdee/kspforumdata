It\u0027s not something I would spend a whole lot of time on, but that\u0027s me.\n\nP.S.

He had trouble figuring out how to turn it off. It was a month or two back, so it might not be so easy to track it down, but the point is it can be done if your video card supports it.\n\nWhy a manufacturer would disable a feature of an OEM part I have no idea, but with Lenovo\u0027s recent shenanigans with preloading that Superfish mal-adware, I\u0027m not surprised they\u0027d do other stupid things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T20:35:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ultrasquid**"}]}
