Basically, one of us would be a pilot (running ksp on their computer) and would only play in IVA, while the rest of us are monitoring various stats (altitude, delta v, orbital charts, etc.) on our own computers and relaying commands to the pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember that, at some point, there was a mod that had such readouts by hosting a local website that could be opened in browser on many computers on the same network, but that was a while ago and I\u0027ve forgotten what it\u0027s called, or even if it exists anymore. Do any of you have suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-13T04:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one that comes to mind is Telemachus, which I think is the one you are thinking of. No idea if its still maintained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a cool idea though!
