My visual range is limited to 15 km. Boat has several radars and everything. AA missiles are set up to target missiles and air targets, cruise missiles are set up to target surface and SLW, whatever that might be. When, for example enemy aircraft gets in range of the missiles, AI selects them, locks on, aims the turrets, however doesnt fire, for enemy missiles the same, it just ignores them until they get into the range of the CWIS. Guns work just fine. Same issues with the cruise missiles (radar guided tomahawks), selects weapon, locks on, refuses to do anything else. (Planes work just fine). If anyone knows how icould fix this, please, let me know\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
