Is there any way to consolidate these into one unifying resource database and disable the unneeded ones? Something akin to Minecraft Forge\u0027s ore dictionary, which makes similar or duplicate resources cross compatible with other mods using the same resource? So if X mod adds, say, Copper, and Y mod adds Copper, you can disable one mod\u0027s copper generation and use the other mod\u0027s copper for both mods? \n\nI currently have Ore, MetalOre, and MetallicOre in my resource scanner. Problem is I have no idea which I need for which mod. Ore is the basic KSP resource, and can be refined into liquid fuel and oxidizer, and I guess it can also be refined into RocketParts for EPL? So what are the other two for? I\u0027m not even sure what mod adds those; the only other mods I\u0027m using that add resources are KSP-I Extended and USI. A bunch of USI parts and UniversalStorage parts add storage for Hydrogen and Oxygen, but I use USI Life Support so those are useless to me to! It\u0027s very confusing; any help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:56:43Z","Content":"MetalOre is the ore used by EPL for making rocket parts.

USI, Universal Storage, KSPI-E, and EPL all use CRP, if I am remembering correctly. If that\u0027s the case, everyone\u0027s \u0022Oxygen\u0022 is the same exact resource, so there\u0027s no stomping on anything. You can have resources defined and not uses without ill effect, so if you find random ones it\u0027s not **too** bad of an issue. Just more an annoyance, I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T16:21:22Z","Content":"MetalOre is EL, MetallicOre is CRP.

As far as I can tell, the only mod I\u0027ve seen that uses just plain Oxygen is TAC-LS and similar, but I don\u0027t have those so at the moment UniversalStorage is just taking up RAM adding parts I don\u0027t need. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E MetalOre is EL, MetallicOre is CRP.

Or better yet, which EPL parts are safe to remove that are replaced by USI/UKS parts? Does USI/UKS have its own smelter, etc.?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:58:51Z","Content":"Remove all EPL parts other than the survey stake and the mallet.
