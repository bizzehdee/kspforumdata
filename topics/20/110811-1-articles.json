While perusing through this data and trying to determine which version of a particular mod is the most current, I ran into a snag. \n\nYou see, PHP has this wonderful command called [version_compare](http://php.net/manual/en/function.version-compare.php). It\u0027s pretty smart actually and when sorting through over 3,000 versions (something I am NOT going to do manually) it\u0027s a real time saver. I even read through CKAN\u0027s mind boggling explanation of how versions are supposedly ordered in their scheme of things and neither manages to completely deal with human versioning logic. For example, the below list of mod versions are just few of the truly bizarre ones I\u0027ve come across.\n\nDeprecated\n\nalpha\\_7.0\n\nRev\\_4\n\nRev\\_5\n\nRev\\_6\n\n0.14.1.1.oops\n\npre-alpha-04\n\npre-alpha-06\n\n0.000001\n\nksp1.0\\_release1\n\n1.2.0\\_-\\_KSP\\_1.0\\_Update\n\n2015-05-20\n\nyadaya\n\ntest\\_for\\_license\\_validation\n\nwhatever\n\nVersion\\_3D\\_changes\n\nVerision\\_Preview\\_3C\\_available\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0.0\n\nNow just assume that machine code had to somehow determine which of those is the most recent version, Then consider that CKAN doesn\u0027t have an \u0027uploaded date\u0027 field and all of the .ckan files have the same date when unzipped. You see my problem?\n\nhere\u0027s a real fun one.\n\nv1.0\n\n1.01\n\nIf I understand CKAN correctly, v1.0 is a newer version than 1.01. Version\\_compare gives the opposite results. And yes, I\u0027ve seen mods use both schemes in their versions of the same mod.\n\nNow mind you, the vast majority of you modders have got the art of versions down pat. And your logic is appreciated. Some of you however... wait, I have ammunition around here somewhere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T19:45:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:43:50Z","Content":"Speaking of version numbers, it would be good to bring up [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
