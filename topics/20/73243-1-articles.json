I think this may have to do with having to use a modifier key in order to do fuel transfers, as I have seen a message stating that \u0027sticky keys is ON\u0027 appear after holding the shift button down, but when I check teh settings in XFce, they claim that sticky keys are OFF. Either way, no matter what I try at times (and I have this problem in my current game at the moment), no matter what I try, whether I use teh keyboard as if sticky keys were on or off, nothing is working. I would suggest that it may be better to enable players to pin the fuel tank displays open, and if two or more are pinned open, to allow the user to transfer fuel between them. This would avoid the problems that can arise with the use of modifier keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s durned frustrating, having gotten a couple of Kerbals stranded on the Mun to land a refuel drone nearby, link up using a KAS pipe, then find that I can\u0027t get fuel transfer to work, either between ships or between the two fuel tanks on the refuel drone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crispyman","CreatedById":117201,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T01:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry using your right shift key instead of your left one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T02:55:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 02:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Crispyman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T12:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EkOS v0.13.11 has a weird issue with the Linux version of KSP 0.24.2, namely that Unity does report strange keyboard codes for some keys, including Return, making it impossible to use the kOS console.
