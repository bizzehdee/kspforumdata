I searched for a mod like this the whole day, but I didn\u0027t find any.\n\nExample: you landed a rover on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and you want to use it to scan the surface and detect the ores. I don\u0027t want to play KSP for one hour just to move my rover. I tell my rover to reach the place X and he\u0027ll get to there even if I am flying other rockets or plane. The rover should be controlled by some kind of AI, I suppose.I\u0027m not a mod maker, but I think it would be easy to send a notification when the rover gets to the designated place.\n\nI hope you understood the type of mod that I\u0027d love to play with.\n\nSorry for my english, and thanks in advance to everyone that will help me. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:44:25Z","Content":"MechJeb has a rover autopilot"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha188","CreatedById":145723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T13:42:27Z","Content":"Is there a way to install only the autopilot?
