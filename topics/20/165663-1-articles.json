Realism Overhaul, by default, comes with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E configs that add CO2 scrubbers to various capsules when TACLS is installed. This would be fine, except they don\u0027t actually seem to scrub meaningful amounts of CO2. More specifically, I load up KSP with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, TACLS, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed (plus dependencies). I grab a Mk1 capsule, shove a pilot inside, console it into orbit, and turn on the scrubber. And CO2 throughput stays at the -0.01 units it was at before I turned the scrubber on. Lithium hydroxide drain is also way lower than it should be, assuming the scrubbers aren\u0027t supposed to last any longer than any of the other life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless an engineer is aboard, in which case the scrubbers scrub just fine. The question then becomes, is it intentional that scrubbers only work if an engineer is present, or are they supposed to work regardless of who\u0027s aboard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
