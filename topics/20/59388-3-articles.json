The DLL checks against that value in that key and continues on. If it doesn\u0027t then lock out the plugin by all means, please do. However, the users that know how can go in and edit version.txt, make the change for the current version, and make it compatible to see \u0022if things have to be done\u0022. Not only is that K=V setting present in the version.txt file, there is also a large wall of text stating that editing the file MAY cause the plugin to not work, etc. TYPICALLY the people who know how to navigate deeply enough into the directory tree to find versions.txt and edit the file should already know what they\u0027re doing is changing expectations of the software. I\u0027d even go as far as NOT use an obvious name like version.txt but name it something else and put in the readme what file is needed to be changed in case of a KSP version change. That way, the user would at least have to do some research and be notified that what they\u0027re doing goes outside of the bounds of support. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#D3D3D3;\u0022\u003E(To a dealer: What do you mean you\u0027re going to warranty the obviously after-market airbag suspension I installed in my Fiat?)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to kick up a bees nest about licensing, but I\u0027d wager that 90% of the people who love to play KSP just don\u0027t know the difference between a \u0022computer\u0022 and a \u0022hard drive\u0022. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#a9a9a9;\u0022\u003E(Don\u0027t laugh.

Some mod authors just \u003Cstrong\u003EDO NOT ALLOW\u003C/strong\u003E redistribution of their work without their consent. That\u0027s fine and I can get on board with that, but if a plugin goes out of date, then the author is assumed MIA which means the author can\u0027t consent to allowing modifications and/or redistribution, then there is absolutely zero chance that the mentioned user CAN use that plugin with a newer version of KSP. However, if something external to the DLL can be modified, and the user can edit it, then they KNOW that what they\u0027re doing COULD break something. Will the plugin eventually break? Yeah, maybe, but no guarantee, of course. But if it was a popular enough mod, someone else will rewrite, and redistribute, but then again, AotF can attest to working through 4 major versions. From KSP v0.19 to v0.20, something changed that affected \u0022Actions On The Fly\u0022 in a very minor way (Just a glitch - The \u0022Enable AotF\u0022 link repeated itself on the root part), and only because of the open license I was able to affect a change, and legally redistribute. If, say, Kethane were to go stale, I couldn\u0027t do that because redistribution can only be done in post #1 of that owners thread.

They don\u0027t exist. They were never read by your eyes. If some well meaning user puts out a config out there, so be it.

Once the people who have gotten the new config note that you\u0027ve released a new version, they\u0027re PROBABLY going to download the newest version ANYWAYS. But what to do with the people sitting on 0.22 and you\u0027re DRM is set to 0.23? Well.... You can\u0027t support what you don\u0027t run? Depending on your license, and if you really want to go that far, you can even report the user who posted the config change since it\u0027d be outside of your distribution setup, and it can be considered an important part of your package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second way, develop the thick skin I developed and inform users that if they use the software in unintended ways, the software is going to work in unintended ways. LET them scream and shout and let it all out (background music). The worst thing that can happen to you is they don\u0027t use your mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third way is open a new thread for each release of your product, and start with a brand new clean slate. The forum software used here isn\u0027t the best for software distribution. Unless permissions are given to let the OP have total control over the entire thread, you\u0027re going to develop a lot of garbage that no one is going to read if you have multiple versions of your product in one thread.

It\u0027s not like plugins are created by modders to add to some great collective good of the community where we all live in a nice, happy utopian vision of rockets and happiness; most of us probably do it for our own selfish reasons.

I didn\u0027t do it to become famous as I should have been. I did it because I was driven to annoyance with the issue at hand. I also knew that other people were going to have the same problem, so with looking at the source code in PSPad and thinking I understood enough of it, I downloaded two different compilers, got both working with the OAs code, examined the code, found the fix, pushed it out the door. I didn\u0027t do anything more to it. TBQH I don\u0027t even know if my \u0022fix\u0022 is what started the null references you mentioned. It was a bit of an ego boost to have a few people thank me profusely for the fix. I even was offered a non-paying job out of it because of a discussion I had about enhancements I COULDN\u0027T do. NEITHER of those reasons were why *I* pushed myself to fix the problem, but the primary reason WAS to promote the vision of rockets and happiness. With full respect to you and EVERY other single modder in ANY game, not only KSP, if you want to throw the DRM into your tools and addons, then by all means do so.

Its there, character for character, as you typed it out and distributed. Its either packaged in the zip file or put out on a source code tracker that is accessible.

This stuff is all at-your-own-risk and a modder would have to be insane to state or imply any sort of warranty whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Faark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Faark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022cfg or recompile\u0022... if you are afraid of 3rd parties providing cfg fixes, you should also be afraid of the same for dll\u0027s that knock out the version check entirely, what would be even worse. Think i would prefer the dialog to be skip-able, but only with \u0022annoying\u0022 user interaction (maybe re-typing a sentence?). It does give them a way to ignore the version check, so they don\u0027t have to look for that from \u0022unofficial\u0022 sources, but also still a huge kick in the a** to update their addons. It would also allow it CompatibilityChecker to log that there are outdated mods, since at least output_log does not seem to mention assembly versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed. You want just enough pain to get people to clue in, but not enough to \u0022force\u0022 them into finding fixed configurations or DLLs or whatever it is you end up implementing. It\u0027s a like an aerocapture - not enough and you won\u0027t aerobrake, too much and you\u0027ll lithobrake instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
