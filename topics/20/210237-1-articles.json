Alot of people are used to where things are in ksp one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the request is, even if the game isnt out, but is it feasibly possible to re-shuffle them so it is at least somewhat reminiscent of KSP 1 UI layout\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks (In about 4 months advance)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe superluminal Gremlin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArriving at your system before you have even realized\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
