Luckily for EVE, there is one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as MERGE is concerned, most people say to extract the GameData folder into the KSP folder, and perform a merge. Personally I prefer to do Step #7 above.

Basically it doesn\u0027t look quite as nice, but might save some RAM if you\u0027re getting close to the limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
