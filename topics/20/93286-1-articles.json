When a kerbal dies you can write a little epitaph under their name and get a new tombstone.Sometimes Jeb can fly his jet out there and leave a small bouquet of flowers on a tiny grave as a tear hangs in his eye. Is there a mod like this? Flags might work but just wouldn\u0027t be the same.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T04:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure this is one of the things on the not suggested list (I don\u0027t know why). That said, a while ago there is a part mod that gives you casks for dead kerbals that you can launch to space as funeral, and have them orbit around kerbin as space graveyard. I don\u0027t think that has been updated recently though. But since it is basically just a part that does exactly nothing else than just being a part with special texture I think it might work if you manage to dig it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Emod","CreatedById":109552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat a great idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something like a hill with tombstones, one for every kerbal that gave his life to science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the amount of tombstones is a good way to tell for how long the space program have been going on, and/or the level of bad luck..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the game also can auto-fill in name, date and where it happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s somewhat the same idea from the old game Cannon Fodder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kasplutt.dlinkddns.com/iff/cannonfodder.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cannonfodder.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lowaltitude","CreatedById":121847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso what you want is a mod that adds a building to the game that contains tombstones that generate when a kerbal dies\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordmuffin","CreatedById":127240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought of this a while ago, but my idea was a memorial, not a gravestone, because (probably) they would either die in space, die in a plane crash or crash into the water.

If anyone hasn\u0027t scene the Eterno Rest 2000 mod I encourage you to look at it. How can I get my Final Frontier decorations to go with him on his journey?
