So I have a number of versions of KSP to revert to, which means I also have a bunch of mod parts from each version(Pre .90)\n\nI have tried out alot of the parts I like and they do work to a degree. The ones I have tried do not cause crashes, some work flawlessly. All the radially attached parts connect with no dramas, but node attached parts do not work well. For some reason they can attach to one node then nothing else can be placed on them. I have also seen some parts cause some graphical artifacts.\n\nI dont know how to alter these parts to work better so I was thinking maybe someone else could(licences willing)\n\nFor example I have the KOSMOS space station parts pack which was one of my favourites, hopefully someone could get it going again."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T11:45:43Z","Content":"Maybe you have met this case:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117289-The-new-Node-Direction-gibberish-Parts-won-t-attach-problem-is-becoming-annoying](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117289-The-new-Node-Direction-gibberish-Parts-won-t-attach-problem-is-becoming-annoying)"},{"CreatedByName":"Boxer_Roo","CreatedById":76359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T07:08:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe you have met this case:\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117289-The-new-Node-Direction-gibberish-Parts-won-t-attach-problem-is-becoming-annoying](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117289-The-new-Node-Direction-gibberish-Parts-won-t-attach-problem-is-becoming-annoying)\n\nYou sir have just solved my problems.
