Going to the mesh for a moment, the \u0022engine bell\u0022 and the mounting plate look like they have nothing to do with each other, they clip into each other oddly, those little finger struts are a cop-out, the base plate itself has no character whatsoever, they\u0027re exactly the same color and material, and that\u0027s not even going into my complaints about the overall design concept, the thing looks like it should be a jet engine but you\u0027re saying it\u0027s some kind of nuclear ion drive. I\u0027m willing to ignore that last part but it annoys me, an engine\u0027s functionality should be vaguely suggested by the design.
