The QBE being unlocked parallel to manned flight is so that it can take over the OKTO for this purpose.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelaying the availability of the KV reentry pods is done on purpose. In the stock tech tree, the KV-1 is completely unusable\u00A0at the point where you get it due to 1) lack of a reaction wheel or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to steer it without wasting fuel and 2) lack of a fairing to offset its enormous drag.\u00A0The first reaction wheel is unlocked alongside the KV-2, making the KV-1 immediately obsolete for all purposes other than its lower weight compared to the Mk1 pod. Here, by the time you have the KV-1 you already have reaction wheels, \u003Cb\u003Eand\u00A0\u003C/b\u003Eit\u0027s unlocked at the same time as the 1.25m fairing, so you can actually use it immediately.

Putting the ladder on an entirely separate node in the stock tech tree was always mildly annoying for me and handing over the landing strut way before the player is in a position to even consider going to the Mun just flat-out didn\u0027t make sense.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPutting the two lights on separate nodes is based on what feels to be their best use: long-range lights for lighting up the ground\u00A0at night to either locate a landing site or let kerbals on EVA find the lander in the dark, short-range lights as a \u0022docking port is over here\u0022\u00A0navigational aid when docking over the night side.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEngine-tank pairings all follow the same logic: gimballed medium engine gets the second smallest tank to start with, non-gimballed power engine gets the second biggest tank since it can lift more weight, high-impulse vacuum engine gets the smallest tank since it\u0027s the most efficient one, biggest tank is on a separate node so that the increased structural stability and reduced part count is an optional purchase.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWing parts are noded in order of how much lift they provide. Wing Connector parts are noded parallel to matching-size Structural Wings. I originally intended to put jet engines and intakes on separate nodes from each other.
