First step, once I unlocked the Communotron 16, was to establish basic coverage of Kerbin. I established a naming convention so I can figure out which relay is which in the tracking station. The first launch was \u0022CommSat SR-A 3-0-1\u0022. SR indicates \u0022short range\u0022 that is an omnidirectional antenna suitable for low orbital coverage. A indicates the first design of satellite for that purpose. 3 is Kerbin (1 for Moho, 2 for Eve, 4 for Duna etc), \u00220\u0022 because it\u0027s the basic planet, and 1 for the first satellite in that orbit. I put up CommSat SR-A 3-0-1 to 3-0-4 in a square configuration in a 1000 km circular equatorial orbit. This gives me basic coverage for Kerbin, as each satellite can speak to its two neighbours and at least one is always in contact with the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second step, once I unlocked the DTS-M1 was to launch CommSat IR-A 3-0-1 and 3-0-2. IR for intermediate range: capable of reaching the higher regions of Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Each is equipped with a Comunotron 16 and three DTS-M1. One is pointed at Mun, one at Minmus and the third at \u0022active vessel\u0022 for things like satellite contracts and rescue missions from high orbits. They are also in the same 1000 km orbit, spaced evenly between two of the SR sats, 180 degrees apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird step was to build an unmanned \u0022Mun Package\u0022. It contained a launch stage, a transfer stage (to Mun) and three identical satellites, IR-B 3-1-1 to 3-1-3. Each IR-B has a single Communotron 16 and a single DTS-M1, in each case pointed at Kerbin (the dish arc is enough to cover the full 1000 km relay orbit). I brought the package onto a collision course with Mun, then deployed the three satellites, altered them onto a non-crashing trajectory (this allowed the transfer stage to safely deorbit), and positioned them into a 600 km circular equatorial orbit, in an equilateral triangular formation. I then sent a near identical package to Minmus with IR-B 3-2-1 to 3-2-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is the LR relay, with LR-A 3-0-1 and 3-0-2 occupying the other two gaps between the SR links, each with a 16 and four Communotron 88-88, pointed to Moho, Eve, Duna and \u0022active vessel\u0022. Of course now the SR satellites around Kerbin are now redundant, but I\u0027ve just left them in place. I have a manned ship currently in LKO waiting for a Duna transfer window with IR-B 4-0-1 and 4-0-2 as well as LR-B 4-0-1 and 4-0-2 attached to it. I plan to place these in a square in a lower orbit than Ike, and the LR-B have two 88-88 each, one for Kerbin and one for Eve, so that a Duna-Eve link can, in due course, cover Ike and Sun eclipses. Once the Duna launch is away, I\u0027ll send up a similar mission to Eve with SR and LR 2-0-1 and 2-0-2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T20:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4 equatorial satellites with comm32s as relays. 2 long range satellites on 90 degree inclination orbits, Pe @100km, Ap @ SOI boundary.

When this got a bit asynchronous I added 2 more satellites. For Mun exploration I added 3 dish-equipped satellites in stationary higher equatorial orbits (don\u0027t do this). Later when I unlocked the communotron 32s I positioned 4 satellites with them in the same way as the starting communotron 16 satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor longer range communication satellites I have switched to positioning them in highly eccentric polar orbits with ap/pe over the poles. This means that they only ever get obscured by Kerbin a few times a year for less than 15 minutes or so (very fast near Kerbin), which can be covered by adding a second satellite if really necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I haven\u0027t really put much maintenance into keeping the phase angles between small satellites roughly the same recently. No matter how fine you tune the orbital periods the distances always seem to get out of whack after a while. I got sick of doing the (increase/decrease AP, fast-forward until position is ok, restore old orbital period) and have just switched to slightly accelerating/decelerating satellites based on their relative position and letting time sort it out (only check before launching \u0022launch window expeditions\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor other planets I\u0027m using more of a chaos approach but the small omnidirectional satellites are in equatorial (or inclinations \u0026lt;45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 when I don\u0027t care) orbits whereas the long range relays are in highly eccentric polar orbits.
