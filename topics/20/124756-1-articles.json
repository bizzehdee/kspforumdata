The old UbioZur Welding mod addressed this to some degree by allowing parts to be fused together into units which behaved like one part, but what I have in mind is a more complete and brute-force solution: disabling part stress physics, either entirely or nearly so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions, then, are thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs this at all possible with the modding tools currently available?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf so, would it be practical?

The welding mod would probably be the best option. This reduces the overall part count of a ship, and thus the amount of joints that have to be calculated in real time. The thing is with the welding mod is you have to be aware of how it works. You can\u0027t have multiple parts with the same module in one weld. For example, only one landing gear per weld. Also, the more welds you have, the longer the initial load time is going to be and you will have to watch your ram usage. But, I would think that you would have to use a lot of welds for that to start being a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T01:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EladDv\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EladDv\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(and yes i read your post about freezing stuff in place but it will be a total rewrite of the physics system so i\u0027ll ignore it.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was afraid of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs flex really tied in that strongly with the rest of the physics, or would rewriting just that part be at least somewhat feasible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t have a particularly good understanding of how joint stiffness is controlled - does it set the magnitude of a restoring force on the joint, or the tolerance for wobble?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T02:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere must be some way in Unity to simply shut down the joint calculation.
