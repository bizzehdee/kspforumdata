I really like the information windows. I rarely use it for docking now, but it really takes the tedium out of launching and rendezvous, so I can concentrate on experimenting with different ways of building launchers or spacecraft.

For what it\u0027s worth, you can run KSP from anywhere. I have two copies, the Steam copy that\u0027s modded like crazy, and an unmodded copy on my desktop. There are no registry entries or anything like that so windows isn\u0027t going to care where it\u0027s running from. And this far after release of a version (.22) the bugs have pretty much been identified. A lot of guys will run unmodded for a little while after a new release to do exactly what you\u0027re saying, which is enough I think to catch bugs. KSP is mod-friendly because Squad made it that way. They use their own resources to host mods.
