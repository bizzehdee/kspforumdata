IMHO essential if you have more than a couple of mods.\n\nIn Windows, 32-bit. 64-bit is not officially supported and -may- cause all sorts of issues. If you DO decide to run the community-hacked 64-bit client, make sure you mention that clearly if you need support with anything. In fact, don\u0027t even bother - try to replicate the issue on 32-bit first and if you can, only then raise a support request. (NB: support request means you think you\u0027ve found a bug, and not just a gameplay question).\n\nOn Linux, 64-bit is officially supported and perfectly stable and usable. Or rather, as stable and usable as the 32-bit client.\n\nEDIT: eh; ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:26:55Z","Content":"If you\u0027re going to play with many mods, go for the 64bit Linux version. On Windows I\u0027d rather try to get the 32bit version running within the memory limits, as many mods will disable themselves when being run with the 64bit Windows version.\n\n(If you really want to, you can of course edit the mod source code, remove the check, and use your self-compiled mod version, but as there have been some heated discussions, please do not publish such edited mods, and don\u0027t expect mod authors to help you.).\n\nSo, my personal (edit: non-sorted) top list of mods for career:\n\n- [Stock Bugfix Modules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules): Fixes some issues that are still present in KSP\n- [Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://sites.google.com/site/kerbalalarmclock/): Stops time-warp for you - no more missed maneuver nodes. Also includes a simple transfer window prediction.\n- [Ferram Aerospace Research](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-5-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-13-3-4-30-14): The stock aerodynamics model is good, Ferram\u0027s is in my opinion better. Also, this mod includes some tools for the VAB that help you design crafts that are aerodynamically stable without resorting to trial and error. Important if you play without reverting.\n- [Real Chute](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-0-24-x-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-Procedural-cost!-v1-2-4-06-08-14): Allows you to tweak the size of parachutes. Also, Ferram Aerospace comes with RealChute Lite, and adding the full RealChute one gives access to more tweakables.\n- [Vessel Orbital Information Display](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54533-0-23-VOID-Vessel-Orbital-Informational-Display): An excellent data display mod with a nice customizable layout. The code to calculate dV is the same as used by Kerbal Engineer Redux.\n- [Procedural Fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-0-24-2-Procedural-Fairings-3-08-procedural-costs-Win64-decoupler-fix-%28July-26%29?highlight=procedural\u002Bfairings): With this it\u0027s easier to get a fairing suited for transonic velocities.\n- [Waypoint Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758): Ever decided to quickly EVA to a certain waypoint, and missed a way to find it without the Navball? This places a visible marker.\n- [Addon Version Checker](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220462-ksp-avc-add-on-version-checker?cookieTest=1): Alerts you when a mod update is available.\n- [Kerbal Inventory System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-2-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-1-2): A mod that allows your engineers to modify craft in flight. For instance this allows you to add new experiments to landers.\n- [Chatterer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92324-1-0-2-Chatterer-v-0-9-5-Talk-to-me-Valentina-!-24-May-2015): Purely for the mood. This adds radio communication sounds to your crewed vessels, and beeps to probes.\n\nIf you\u0027re going to install a huge amount of mods, you\u0027ll likely want to use ckan, but as it broke several mod installations for me (for instance chatterer after the new voice for Valentina was added...), I personally do not use it, and rely on the addon version checker instead.\n\nIf you like eyecandy and you have a fast GPU, you can install Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack. This nevertheless is easiest to do using ckan.\n\nEdit: Descriptions\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T14:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:29:04Z","Content":"If you like trial and error / guessing, you can ignore this post.\n\nSome of my \u0022must have\u0022 mods are [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-17-0), [Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-1-0-x-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-4-0-0-%28June-27%29), and [Transfer Window Planner](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93115-1-0-x-Transfer-Window-Planner-v1-3-0-1-%28May-5%29).
