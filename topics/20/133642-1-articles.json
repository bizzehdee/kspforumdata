Its just a matter of waiting for launch windows and return windows... the \u0022hardware\u0022 is all up in orbit... some of it just needs a shuttle to transfer crew, other craft are already kerbaled and at the target bodies...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now my thoughts turn towards a larger solar system... and the outer planets mod seems to be the best one out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just not sure I want to install it... will I just feel obliged to visit more bodies, but the gameplay is essentially the same?From a gameplay perspective, what is added?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA moon in retrograde orbit around its planet? Yes, that sounds cool, but really it just means I capture on the other side of the planet... not soo interesting. Transfers to other moons get harder... a mission like the Jool 5 would be more complicated... but.. meh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-This moon has a really thin atmosphere? Ok I\u0027ve sort of wanted a situation more like mars, where there\u0027s an atmosphere, but not much of one... Duna\u0027s is to thick to have that feeling most of the time (though it is quite thin in the highlands)... still, I\u0027m not really convinced\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA planet rotating clockwise instead of anticlockwise... meh, doesn\u0027t really change the gameplay any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA trojan moon, Priax... sounds a bit interesting to plan a transfer from one moon to another... but it would be conceptually similar to plotting a move from one space station to another with the same orbital parameters... since theres no N body simulation here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA moon with a moon... meh... somehow it seems like it would be more interesting to me if laythe had a moon (even though that would be ectremely unstable in the Jool system, if it were N-body... although the jool system would already eject val and bop if it were n body). one airless rock with another orbiting it? I\u0027ve put an E class in orbit around Mun, and a C class around Minmus... close enough for me..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTekto... this one actually sounds interesting to me... thick-ish atmosphere, low gravity... a proper titan analogue unlike laythe... no O2... this owuld be a new experience and inspire new spacecraft designs (all the others would just use the same basic type of craft that I use\u00A0to land on airless bodies)... do I want to get the mod just for Tekto and maybe thatmo?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlock- so its really far out... \u00A0long transfers... ok? Eeloo doesn\u0027t seem so far out but a dedicated eeloo mission still takes a while at time warp. Does this change much? does the feel/ambiance change with it being so far out? would Kerbol look sufficiently small to be \u0022cool\u0022? I guess it encourages non-hohman transfers, which I could already be trying for Jool and Eeloo. Do higher dV requirements really add much? I doubt these dV requirements are much higher than those for Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I think about it, I really only want to see 2-4 new bodies in the game: Something like titan, something with an atmosphere of... lets say 1/10th that of Duna\u0027s.\u00A0If I were to do it... I\u0027d add 1 ice giant, and give it 3-5 moons: 1 like titan/tekto, 1 in a retograde orbit, 1 pseudo trojan, and maybe 1 highly inclined orbit.\u00A0I think that maybe the OPM adds too much \u0022redundant\u0022 content, and I\u0027ll just be bored with missions to the new airless bodies around a planet I can\u0027t land on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas this been the experience of others? is adding 3 new ice/gas giants too much, if squad were to add planets again at some point, how many should they add? right now I\u0027m thinking just 1 ice giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T00:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

rings is just stunning.\u00A0 Yes, they don\u0027t have any actual gameplay impact, but they\u0027re really pretty to look at and I just love them.\u00A0 Hale and Ovok are orbiting actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eamong\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the rings, and the views from the surface are great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOvok\u0027s egg shape makes for some really interesting gameplay.\u00A0 Especially when you\u0027re out at the pointy end of the egg-- the high rotation speed of the moon means that the gravity\u0027s effectively considerably less than Gilly, which makes for some interesting interactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlate is a Tylo-like experience, I just happen to like it because it\u0027s purty and much more interesting to look at than Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar and away my favorite moon is Tekto.\u00A0 It\u0027s worth installing OPM just for Tekto alone.\u00A0 A low-gravity planet with a thick atmosphere:\u00A0 that\u0027s a combination that KSP lacks, and it\u0027s very interesting to experiment with and explore.\u00A0 Plus, it\u0027s just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epretty\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, with an interesting landscape that includes lakes and seas.\u00A0 I just love Tekto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moons Polta and Priax in their Trojan relationship are interesting to shuttle among.\u00A0 I particularly like Priax, with its swiss-cheese appearance, the deep steep-walled craters.\u00A0 It\u0027s a new look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWal/Tal makes for an interesting dynamic.\u00A0 The big equatorial ridge on Wal produces some navigational challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit that Nissee is kinda not really worth the trip, other than out of sheer completism-- incredibly remote and hard to get to, it\u0027s basically just a place to say you\u0027ve done it.\u00A0 I enjoyed Thatmo.\u00A0 The atmosphere is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thin that it\u0027s a fun challenge to see what you can do with it.\u00A0 For one thing, it has quite a high escape velocity.\u00A0 I arrived with my big interplanetary mission very low on fuel, and needed to get a miner down to the surface with the absolute bare minimum of fuel, meaning I couldn\u0027t afford to just treat it like a vacuum planet and dump over 1000 m/s of dV to land, but parachutes can\u0027t deploy, so I used a lander that had wings to generate drag \u002B lift to slow to something reasonable.\u00A0 It was quite a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaven\u0027t done Plock yet.\u00A0 Sarnus / Urlum / Neidon line up nicely when the game starts, so you can reasonably do a \u0022grand tour\u0022 that hits all three in a row, but Plock\u0027s way the heck out to one side, and by the time I\u0027d done a full playthrough of every other OPM body, I didn\u0027t particularly feel like paying Plock a visit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, I had enormous fun with Outer Planets.\u00A0 It\u0027s worth installing just for Sarnus alone, even if you never go further than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing to bear in mind, aside from the actual gameplay/novelty aspect:\u00A0 the production value.\u00A0 There are a lot of planet packs out there that are kinda amateurish. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(No offense intended, I would \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elove\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to produce a planet pack myself, and I expect that those planet packs out there are better than what \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E would produce, so I\u0027m in no position to point fingers.)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 Outer Planets is a cut above.\u00A0 It\u0027s incredibly polished and professionally done, and the texturing / lighting is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etotally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E up to professional standards.\u00A0 They could include it with the stock game and nobody would blink an eye-- it\u0027s easily as good as the stock planets in terms of production value, and that\u0027s something I don\u0027t think I can say about any other planet pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T00:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like OPM.

The Mun should be close to the limit for the dV requirements for a moon. I already thought val was too high... now I see another 2 moons with a higher dV requirement than duna orbit?! Adding moons with twice the dV required of landing on Mun? seems like it continues a trend I didn\u0027t like... that the moons of a gas giant are nearly as big as planets... when they are in fact much much smaller..

physics).\u00A0 The observable symptom:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Ecrappy framerate\u003C/strong\u003E, particularly when you have lots of ships, and/or very complex ships, inside the physics bubble, or when you\u0027re doing something that\u0027s physics-intensive such as flying through atmosphere.\u00A0 But the framerate doesn\u0027t care much what the camera is \u003Cem\u003Elooking\u003C/em\u003E

\u003Cstrong\u003Ecrashes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 That is, the game seems to work just fine, no particular framerate issues... until you get to that magical number of 3.7GB or so, and then suddenly the game crashes without warning.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re having crappy framerate issues, I\u0027d say it\u0027s more likely to be a GPU or CPU thing rather than an I\u0027m-using-too-much-memory thing.\u00A0 So as long as your game is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estable\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (i.e. doesn\u0027t crash a lot), you can probably install OPM and it won\u0027t slow you down further by any appreciable amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if you\u0027re skating close to your memory limit (due to lots of mods) and getting frequent crashes already, then adding OPM onto the pile might be an issue.\u00A0 How much of an issue, I don\u0027t know-- Kopernicus is better than it used to be at memory management, it swaps textures out when they\u0027re not needed.\u00A0 Also, as I\u0027ve mentioned before, OPM is incredibly polished with a lot of production value, which is one thing that sets it apart from every other planet pack I\u0027ve seen.\u00A0 Part of that \u0022polish\u0022 is attention to system resource usage; I believe that the author has put quite a bit of effort into making it as memory-efficient as possible and not doing any of the things that a lot of planet pack authors do, which is to follow the easy path-of-least-resistance with textures that make them easy to author but very expensive in terms of memory usage.\u00A0 So I suspect that OPM will be easier on your memory load than a lot of other planet packs would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote

\u0022design a ship that can handle very high-dV landings on a vacuum world\u0022 is an interesting challenge that\u0027s different from the rest of the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elanding\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, using its atmosphere, significantly mitigates the problem.\u00A0 But it gives you a

it\u0027s \u0022build a ship that you can fly in 1% of Kerbin atmosphere to kill your velocity without faceplanting, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E which can take off like

Sarnus to Urlum, that the ship I built \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecould not handle Urlum arrival\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It had a really high ballistic coefficient (long and skinny, lots of mass hiding behind its heat shield), so it was impossible to aerocapture.\u00A0 The only way to get enough braking to capture was to go so low in the atmosphere that the ship would suddenly explode despite the heatshield.\u00A0 And I had designed the ship with only a small amount of reserve fuel-- it was critically dependent on aerocapturing at Urlum, or it would go flying out into the depths of space forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only quicksave point I had available to me was just a few hours before Urlum arrival.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run Extraplanetary Launchpads (so I can build stuff off Kerbin), and also KAS/KIS (so an engineer with a power tool can assemble, disassemble, and reassemble ships).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I had to save the mission, under various constraints including the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLimited time-to-arrival.\u00A0 That limits the size and complexity of what I can build, because anything too big wouldn\u0027t have time to finish construction before arrival.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLimited metal for building parts.\u00A0 My ship had critically low fuel, I was dependent on building a miner/lander \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E arrival that could fly down to the surface of Priax and scoop up a load of fuel.\u00A0 So whatever I build can\u0027t use up too much of my metal, because I have to leave enough left over to build the miner after arrival.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI can\u0027t actually build anything at all without jettisoning my heatshield, since it\u0027s mounted right on top of (and thereby obstructing) my orbital launchpad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... jettison the heatshield, frantically start building contraption components.\u00A0 Meanwhile Bill\u0027s outside with his power drill, feverishly dismounting and discarding any ship components I can live without, to try to to lighten the load.\u00A0 The constructed components pretty much have to be multi-part assemblies, which means that Bill can\u0027t attach them (KIS/KAS only allows you to attach/detach single parts), so Bill has to install docking ports to give the assemblies a place to fasten, then the parts need to be wrestled around and docked \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esymmetrically\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the right spots, then Bill needs to install struts because the docking-port attachments are going to be too weak and floppy to withstand the high g-forces of aerocapture, then the last thing I need to build is a new heatshield to replace the one I had to jettison...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was sheer nirvana.\u00A0 I can\u0027t remember the last time I\u0027ve had so much fun in KSP.\u00A0 And it never would have happened if I weren\u0027t running a mod that induced me to fly a stupidly high-dV

sarnus orbit (no actual intercept)... just time warping there took quite a lot of time... missions further out may require treating timewarps the same way I treat particularly long burns... start it, and then go do something else for a few/several/many minutes. After that,\u00A0I HE\u0027d to Tekto orbit... despite what it says on the wiki, and on the info screen, there seems to be no atmosphere until ~81km.. I could timewarp on rails just fine at 100km, which should be 5km inside the listed atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right, Sarnus is pretty with its rings:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GTJGjpm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GTJGjpm.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts also cool to see slate in the sky as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I feel that the vertical height is \u0022exaggerated\u0022 too much on tekto. Vertical heights can already seem to be too much for stock bodies when looking at a body from far enough away to discern the curvature (which isn\u0027t so far in this roughly 1/10th scale system)... but Tekto just really seems to me to have things too high for the radius of the moon. The slopes might be too steep too often too, in many places, I don\u0027t really look at it and think that it looks like it could be a natural landscape (though it does have some good areas, and I\u0027m of course suspending disbelief over the green atmosphere... certainly not any worse than eve\u0027s purple). I\u0027m not sure what the ring shaped oceans are supposed to be... crater related somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish we had an instrument to measure atmospheric density, not just pressure... because as far as I know, KSP properly models density as a function of pressure, temperature, and MW of the gas... tekto should be quite cold, so the atmosphere should be quite dense. The same goes for thatmo... which is \u0022based on Neptune\u0027s major moon Triton,\u0022 but its not just \u0022a slightly exaggerated atmosphere to make it more fun\u0022... the surface pressure is nearly 3 orders of magnitude higher... 700x thicker is not slightly exaggerated (assuming temperature and MW are comparable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTekto is also a good place to use one of my modded parts... an air augmented rocket/Ramrocket (does almost nothing to memory usage, because its the same model as the turboramjet, just a different .cfg file). 295 vacuum Isp, 1200 Isp at 1 atmosphere, 4:1 vacuum TWR, TWR augmented at higher mach numbers like the turboramjet, uses LFO, 1600 Isp at 5 atmosphere (ie, for use on eve). Made Tekto ascent a breeze with very little fuel usage. The electric fans(use the pre-porkjet basic jet engine model)\u00A0I use should also be usable for flying around in theory... but power generation would be limiting (as is their mach 0.8 speed cap, which is quite low on tekto)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor fun, I hyperedited a craft to nedium orbit, using gigantors... 1 gigantor could\u00A0keep a 0.625m probe powered. The one I used was supposed to drain 1.2 charge/minute. I guess the gigantor could probably supply the .625m probe cores that use 1.5 EC/min. In comparison, the RTG generates 45 EC/min... so 1 RTG was producing roughly 30x more power. So 1 RTG at 0.08 tons produces as much power as roughly 30*0.3 = 9 tons of gigantors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n23300 funds for an RTG produces as much power as 3000*30 = 90,000 funds worth of gigantors... yea...
