So the only way to build a ship would be from resources. \n\nThe mods I think that would be dependant would be Rover dudes MKS/OKS\n\nTac life support\n\nExtra planetary launchpads\n\nKAS\n\nKarbinite\n\nAnd a mod or even a save file that would Alot you enough funds and science to get you a space station and space miner in space."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T12:34:39Z","Content":"That would be interesting!"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T17:40:13Z","Content":"Interstellar launch pads and distant bodies..
