If anyone can\u0027t make this please point me in the right direction for some modding guides so I could have a go at it myself.\n\nThankyou."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:36:48Z","Content":"There is ScanSat [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-0-24-SCANsat-v6-1-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-Jul-18](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369-0-24-SCANsat-v6-1-Real-Scanning-Real-Science-at-Warp-Speed!-Jul-18) for mapping and there is Figaro Global Navigation Satellite System for GPS [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24646-0-23-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24646-0-23-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System) but none blackout the map think the GPS does or did block GPS from some mods unless you had a network of GPS Sat."},{"CreatedByName":"Swervz","CreatedById":144605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:01:23Z","Content":"Great thankyou!
