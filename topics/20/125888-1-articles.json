Turn down the weights on all the other contracts and turn it up on rescue and recover?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs your career playstyle mostly that of exploration? Turn down part testing/rescues/basebuilding\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\netc etc\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd just make a handful of differently weighted .cfg that people could pick up and swap in and out at their leisure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other thought occurred to me that the base building and station construction contract types are kind of limited, especially in the expansion sense. Right now there are only contracts to add cupola, Science lab, and ISRU parts, but why not more crew space? \u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy not add a dockable rover? \u003Cbr\u003E\nResource silos?\u003Cbr\u003E\nReaction wheels?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDocking bay extension (a part with minimum 2 docking ports, like a structural fuselage with two docking ports on each end)?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSolar panels/Fuel cells?\u003Cbr\u003E\nResource scanner?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAntenna bay (one of each)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI might end up doing it myself given how low-skill it would be, but I am leaving it open as an idea to steal :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?\n"}]}
