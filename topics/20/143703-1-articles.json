I don\u0027t know whether the default E.V.E ones I\u0027m using right now are installed properly but they\u0027re really low-res as seen from space and are quite pixelated even from orbit and especially the lower I get into the atmosphere. I always remember E.V.E in v0.90 looking really nice, whether from AP or PE, and I\u0027ve tried converting the 0.90 cloud texture (longitudinal and latitudinal map which is higher-res than the\u003Cbr\u003E\n2046x2046 cubic ones in v1.1.1) into cubic projection (6 files cubeX, cubeY, etc) and just cannot get the damn things to map correctly. And even if I do, the texture looks uniformly white and untextured. It\u0027s driving me crazy, I guess I\u0027m doing something wrong. So I was wondering if there are higher res cloud textures, maybe 4096x4096 out there for\u003Cbr\u003E\nE.V.E? Or could any one recommend a pack they use that I could try? I\u0027ve looked all over Google and Curse.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t care that much about mods that enhance gameplay or science or parts, though I do have a few. What matters to me is the visual look of the game. Yet mods for this seem lacking. Curse has so few, compared to other types of mods. Am I the only one who wants Kerbin to look nice and realistic from all angles and altitudes? Yes Scatterer and\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 PlanetShine are brilliant, and really do help. But maybe I\u0027m asking too much; it is harder to achieve, I would imagine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to illustrate, here\u0027s a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E cloud comparison. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/aff9043izywmq7v/KSPCloudComparison.jpg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/aff9043izywmq7v/KSPCloudComparison.jpg?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T13:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you enjoy eye candy,then you should definitely check this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/69702-112-ksprc-renaissance-compilation-artworks-remake-v-07-pre-release-3/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand for the clouds only\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143288-113-102-stock-visual-enhancements/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimKerbin","CreatedById":83805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T17:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0to find that it messed up my save file, meaning I couldn\u0027t access any part of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.
