I searched the forums to see if there was a mod to replace KSP\u0027s stock Mission Control screen but I couldnt find any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently dont have the skills, time and experience to make this mod myself, so I figured why not list the idea of the mod on the forum in case an existing modder finds this idea interesting and wants to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStock Mission Control and whats wrong with it.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current implementation of stock mission control and contracts is this: You get offered a limited selection of contracts out of the entire pool of available contracts. Often most of these contracts are not interesting at all, or are for a planet youve just been recently, or for a planet you dont intend to go to for a long time. My experience with the current system generally boils down to this: Spending 15 minutes declining contracts untill I\u0027ve gathered all the relevant contracts for a place I want to go, for instance the mun. To get all the contracts for this I have to wade through oodles of irrelevant contracts to find the ones I want. This leads to me being frustrated if it takes too long and I stop playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy idea for a better Mission Control\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the contracts are grouped by location (like: Kerbin, Mun, Minmus) and EACH location gives you a seperate selection of the contracts for that location. More locations can be unlocked by completing a certain amount of contracts for previous locations. Each location has it\u0027s own selection of contracts being offered, and canceling a contract for the Mun will always gives you a new contract for the Mun. The amount of different contracts offered for each location depends on the upgrade level of Mission Control. I Photoshopped an example which I added below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4442830/Improved%20Mission%20Control%20Example.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Improved%20Mission%20Control%20Example.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a mod like this would greatly increase the feeling of progression in the game and also remove a lot of the frustration around contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny questions or comments are always appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T03:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a devout extreme hard career player I can appreciate what you are suggesting.
