I was wondering if anyone would be able to make a semi realistic crew tower for starliner. If someone does I think it would be even cooler if it could be made out of different segments so you could roll it out and stack it. When I was searching to see if there where any mods for it I can across this image but when I went to see if it was downloadable/public I found out it was not. So I was woundering if anyone could try to make a tower like this but downloadable and public!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u00224anrewtammd41.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;s=84490f035a\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/4anrewtammd41.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;s=84490f035ad67ddcfb0bcb83875de1a2ffdf7ef9\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
