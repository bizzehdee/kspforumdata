Im sure it wouldnt be too hard, and the community would love it. Thanks for any support/help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mork_417","CreatedById":160932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T21:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually joined the forum today to make this very suggestion, as\u00A0I love playing Science Mode but, I\u0027m not a huge contract fan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s nothing wrong with the contract system, it\u0027s just not for me. However, if the Science Mode had the option to add the Kerbal XP leveling aspect of gameplay, that would be awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
