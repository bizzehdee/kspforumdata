I\u0027m not planning to do one because of IRL stuff, it\u0027s just a question about if it could work the way I thought to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore anyone says: I know a quite realistic solar sail won\u0027t fit at all in KSP for gameplay reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is what I have in mind: the solar sail will be just a modified solar panel (i mean:edited solar panel config) . A thrust module is added to the config, and instead of being throttled by throttle control it will be by another module that reads irradiation from the solar panel module and convert it to a throttle value for the thrust module. Ovviously power output is set to 0 unless you want a solar sail-and-panel. I don\u0027t know a lot about how to deal with modules, but I think there\u0027s nothing that module manager can\u0027t handle (again:I don\u0027t know a lot module manager).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs such a thing feasible in your opinion? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T18:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a plugin but haven\u0027t seen the thread in along time it was something *FX and don\u0027t thing you can just added a module to the solar panels to get it to work pretty sure you would have to have unity and set a thrust transformer on the panel but you could use 2 parts to do what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT- And Interstellar mod think has solar sails and frizzank did one along time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T18:58:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T20:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble is constant acceleration trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T22:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104943-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-port-maintance-thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Interstellar\u003C/a\u003E has a Solar Sail, you could start there.\n"}]}
