In future, I probably won\u0027t built quite so many different models, but even so, the general principle applies: one tends to build slightly different models which have strengths and shortcomings in different areas. Lets say I wanted to know: which ships do I have in my directory which can carry at least 5 passengers, and have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026gt; = 5,000, and include a docking port . . . Ah I see, I have two different models that fit these specifications the Wildcat and the Zenith, but the Wildcat is 15,000 funds cheaper while the Zenith has slightly higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at most stages . . . An initial prototype would barely scratch the surface of all the possible comparative indices, but as long as the initial design was coherent, it would seem that with enough typing, pretty much any and all characteristics could be incorporated, allowing a user to compare any two or more ships on virtually any attribute that is present in the game.\u00A0An in-game screen which allowed the user to compare and contrast ships based on whatever set of parameters he/she wished to compare would seem to be the ideal with an app that accessed the files, but did not run through the game screen would be useful but less than ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, orthogonal consideration: I\u0027m presently finishing up a Java III course, and I have until Aug 31 to apply what I\u0027ve learned in a small capstone project. Originally I was working on a checkers game application, but I found this to be so dreadfully boring and relatively non-instructive (not to mention NOT useful) I\u0027ve asked and received permission to do something else: A Kerbal Ship Summarizer Screen. Given that the craft files are basically just txt files with special post-script file type, I think it shouldn\u0027t be too much trouble to get Java to read them, and make use of the fields in them in order to present the information there to the user in a set of dialog boxes and tables (which along with exception handling are the main things it needs to do to fulfill the course requirements).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know the game is C## based, and I have some C\u002B\u002B skills (doing an apprenticeship in data structures and AI design in C\u002B\u002B this fall), but this course is in Java, and I reckon whatever one can do with Java source code one can do with C## (more or less), so . . . if I keep it very simple, just enough functionality to fulfill the course requirements, then rewriting it into C## this fall and expanding it into a true mod would seem to be tenable. What would be neat is if I could provide it to the Kerbal X guy, and/or run it on the web.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the prototype will be in Java, and if there is not much interest in such a thing, then it might just stay that way. But I will strive not to make it so complex and fully functional that using it as an exercise to learn how C## works is too difficult; thus if there IS any interest in such a plugin, and people tell me, then I\u0027ll have synergistic motives to do it up properly so it can run as an in-game plugin, and also as a web-based program (e.g., for Kerbal X, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions or feedback on these ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, I\u0027m GOING to do this first incarnation in Java, because I don\u0027t want to fail the fricking course! So feedback or not, I\u0027m going for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if anyone has any good suggestions that can put it into the right direction(s) for longer-term development/expansion, much appreciated. Suggestions on the name for the mod are particularly welcome, as \u0022Ship Summarizer Screen\u0022 just doesn\u0027t have much cache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-25T18:27:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2016 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarify\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-26T00:54:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is something you would use in game, you want to learn C# and you want to learn KSP modding - go for it even if no one else shows interest.
