That was when I thought about this idea, how about we could click on the kerbin\u00A0in space station (or now in 1.2 the kerbnet) and we could set the station name, color, dish range and it would be added to the config in the game data folder automatically so that the next load of the game it would be there? (I assume there is no way to auto load that config back to game without closing and re opening it? if there is a way, much better)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone pick this idea and make this mod so that we all can have easier time developing our ground stations for remote tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
