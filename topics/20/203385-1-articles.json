A bit like Nintendo xDS systems, where the game is displayed on the top screen, and the bottom shows the technical details. I think this would also help for cinematic productions so you don\u0027t have the UI cluttering up the screen. Although I guess you could set the recording program to record only the part that focuses on the rocket instead of the UI. But this would be a cool idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-28T03:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno - but KSP\u00A0has no issues splaying out across multiple monitors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neasy way to do this is to use the mod AnyRes by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you are running two monitors at\u00A0say 1920x1080 , then just double the width and keep the height - press make it so Bill... and now you have two monitors to spread out on.
