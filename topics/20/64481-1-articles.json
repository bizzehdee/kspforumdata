Standard discussion follows until the point where someone pokes their head up and says \u0022Hey, here\u0027s a mod that could solve your problem\u0022. Or \u0022Hey, if you edit one of your configuration files like this it would solve your problem\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon doing so said user is mostly met with in the best case circumstance ignored (mostly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is why are such suggestions and solutions met with such an attitude. As I see it the thought process of the person posting the solution is \u0022they have a problem, this is something that they can do right now to fix it\u0022.
