The two mods in question are the life support mods \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, and TAC Life Support, and I cannot decide which one to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one hand, we have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support which also allows for the usage of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E family of mods cleanly, bringing a significant amount of well-made content that is hard to pass up. However, the simplicity of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS (although perhaps I\u0027ve not progressed enough in a given game to understand its true potential) is acting as a bit of a turn-off for me. Additionally, it seems to be the less compatible of the two by virtue of the fact that TAC is more popular and seems to be considered first for compatibility in other mods, although none of this has necessarily been a problem yet (plus the lack of oxygen/CO2 as a dynamic somewhat irritates me).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, we have TAC Life Support, which regards a larger amount of resources to contend with and includes the aforementioned oxygen/CO2 issues, in addition to being more seamlessly integrated into things like Universal Storage. Furthermore, it doesn\u0027t have what I feel to be the strange support grace period \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E does that I haven\u0027t found a way to remove, and stocks command pods with supplies as one would expect. But still, it lacks the accessibility to the rest of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E content and is more simple on its options, as well as, I suppose I could say, the character of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are my observations anyway from my current perspective, and I don\u0027t know how to choose in a way that finishes the competition between the two for me once and for all. Any opinions at all are valued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-27T09:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can change the grace period without supplies in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS just fine.

You can tell it\u0027s a bit of a kludge. The complexity in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E is not in the life support part, it\u0027s in the resource and manufacturing part. The usage and consumption of Supplies is easy, the recycling is somewhat easy, and the manufacturing of them is hard. I really do not recommend TAC in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I don\u0027t think you will be happy, although some say they are content with it. The design of Supplies, which bundle air, food, and water into a single unit\u00A0has a lot of drawbacks, but it works in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTAC and KPBS are a really wonderful combination, along with the other manufacturing/recycling mods to support TAC. Using them is comfortable, intuitive and easy, just like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and MKS work nicely together. The overall TAC design is really nice and make a lot of sense with the separation of resources and how you need to manage them, as long as you don\u0027t try and crowbar it into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-04T14:48:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2017 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gilph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efix wrong sentence\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
