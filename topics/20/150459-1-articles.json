I tested both of them and, although I think they all work great, I wish there was something simpler out there. Hence my idea,\u00A0the Contraption-sorter-o-matic, a simple plugin to the stock craft file menu. Bear with me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qEIJOFig.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qEIJOFig.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would have no app button, no window, would be simply a matter of putting descriptions as hashtags into the craft description field for the mod to recognize it as categories. Then, on the side-menu, the player would be able to pick the tags, toggling them on or off to show the crafts described with them. Just that. Feasible? I hope so. I wish I could code that myself, but since I\u0027m an ignorant on matters of coding, I leave my idea here for anyone willing to take it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: yes, \u0022buttom\u0022 is misspelled.
