Personally I don\u0027t think it is possible directly, but maybe it is possible indirectly by replacing the part. Would that be possible? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Tech 1 adds Part A, Tech 2 adds Part B which is an upgraded version of Part A and replaces Part A entirely \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is possible, how can I do this? :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your answers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T02:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, PartUpgrade mod can help you: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123323\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123323\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stoani96","CreatedById":71886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T12:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, thanks!
