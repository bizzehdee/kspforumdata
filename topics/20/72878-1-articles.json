We were being overloaded by our crafts just being randomly duplicated at the starting point and then exploding and creating -cool looking- fireworks all over the place. But atleast we could see/notice eachother. We gave up nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis week, with my friend, I found a server that was hosted publicly by someone else which we could both join, and there weren\u0027t any bugs. I thought my dream came true, but dispite the awesomeness of no bugs \u002B multiple people at the same time, there was a mayor flaw in my opinion. We weren\u0027t able to see eachother, just debris and idle/non-controlled craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yet again, I\u0027ve been searching all over the place for a solution to play together. But sadly, my expedition has led me to empty roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd therefore, I\u0027m asking you people if you know any servers, maybe with another multiplayer mod -I don\u0027t care, as long as we can play synced together-, where I can make a jet fighter or a tank, find my friends and have awesome battles with them, on laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for taking the time for reading my story \u0026amp; question \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJembley\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jembley","CreatedById":111245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T12:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo message in a single month =(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T14:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOfficial thread is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79111-DarkMultiPlayer-0-1-0-0-KSP-0-23-5-Alpha\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
