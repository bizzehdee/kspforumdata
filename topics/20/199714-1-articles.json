I am absolutely loving the new material that\u0027s been added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am particularly enjoying the EVA construction mode. I really like the idea that I can fix my mistakes. Is there any way to remove the volume limit on parts? I would very much like to move a SEQ-24 large storage container from a rocket to mobile processing lab. I\u0027m not afraid of installing mods, but I\u0027d like to keep the game as vanilla as possible (with the exception of science here and now, kerbal engineer, and the docking alignment thingy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I\u0027m currently high up in Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. If I recall correctly, the SEQ-24 is .4 tonnes, so I should be well within the weight limit. And I set constructionWeightLimit to 9999 in Physics.cfg.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-20T01:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this would require a mod, this question has been moved to add-on discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djshaw","CreatedById":209523,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-20T01:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223911819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199714\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611105675\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this would require a mod, this question has been moved to add-on discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch appreciated.
