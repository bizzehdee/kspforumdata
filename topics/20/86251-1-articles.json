I have already been pointed to the custom kerbals mod and have considered it however that would still require writing in each kerbal manually so i was thinking of the follower applicant generation as a more viable option when dealing with larger numbers of followers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus feature: the ability to give the kerbals custom color suits (one color for follower, one for moderator and another for donator) that can be chosen manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this could be done i would be eternally grateful and would also put a dedication mention on the stream description for the modder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaLuS\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
