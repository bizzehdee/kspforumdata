Something like [SRL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93722-0-90-Simulate-Revert-Launch-v1-33-2014-12-20) but on steroids. In fact, maybe even starting with [SRL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93722-0-90-Simulate-Revert-Launch-v1-33-2014-12-20) and adding encryption.\n\nThe mod would have to save often and also when any \u0022event\u0022 happens including when parts explode, screen changes, etc... This would be to reduce the usefulness of ALT-F4 to get yourself out of a pickle.\n\nI\u0027m tellin\u0027 ya. KSP gets more stable every month.

Perhaps instead of trying to encrypt the save game, just disable reverting to launch and quickloading on launch of a new craft.

This mode allows revert to launch, quickloads, etc, only the second you go to the space centre or attempt to recover the vessel, it reverts to vehicle assembly.\n\nThe latter portion might be more \u0022tin man\u0022 and unfeasible, but I\u0027ve always thought it sounded cool."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:35:26Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see this as useful, you can simply disable reverts and quicksaving/loading."},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:41:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see this as useful, you can simply disable reverts and quicksaving/loading.\n\nThere are too many ways around that windows\\_x\\_seven."},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T02:50:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see this as useful, you can simply disable reverts and quicksaving/loading.\n\nHave you already play without revert/quickload? When we have the revert, many of our launches are just simulations to try if what we have made work ... without revert, your vessel needs to be perfect at the first launch ... sometime it\u0027s quite difficult to do it (NASA never launches a vessel without the thought that it is perfect).\n\nBut on an opensource mod, it is useless to have an encryption for the savegame, there will always be an solution to edit your savegame encrypted or not.\n\nAnd the other idea to fork SRL and to add it new features is a bad idea, as I\u0027ve said on the official topic, SRL needs to be rewrite from scratch to really be usefull ... And now there is the [HoloDock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118575) mod which will be a better SRL.\n\n(But if you want to fork SRL, you can, it\u0027s a GPL lisense)."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T08:53:14Z","Content":"And what would you stop you from restoring a previous copy of the save ?
