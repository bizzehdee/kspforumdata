But if you\u0027re looking for a niche one of the things we\u0027re seriously lacking is manned ground/water vehicle command modules and crewtanks, pretty much B9, LLL, and the few parts included with the still outdated TT-MMW are all that exists for command pods that don\u0027t look like they belong on a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T20:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeriously true.

And it\u0027s really not that good a pod for that... the hatch is on top, there is no ladder so I have to add one. The rest of the truck is cylindrical because made from 2.5m rocket parts. Ladder therefore almost always looks strange. It is not ideal at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... yes, pods for rovers/cars or trucks I would very much welcome.

The space plane cockpits in B9 seat you so low you see only sky. Even that strange pod I use for trucks only has moderate vision out the front window and more or less none at all to either side... Maybe it\u0027s the kerbals big heads with the low eyes or something, but for ground vehicles you need to see where you are going \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-12T20:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2014 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by the_bT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T21:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022the_bT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022the_bT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027s the kerbals big heads with the low eyes or something, but for ground vehicles you need to see where you are going \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the issue I tend to have when making IVAs.
