I know this probably doesn\u0027t seem like the most useful thing but I would like one so that I can more easily use older things like TT\u0027s MK4 fuselage or the mk3 fuselage without the ugliness of connecting old to new mk2 fuselages. If someone were to be such a wonderful person and make such a part I would prefer it to be about as thin as the mk2 drone core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
