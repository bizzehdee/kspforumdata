This also helps me find mods with PNG textures that can be converted by [Lilleman\u0027s tool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter).\n\nSome decisions are also made based on intuition and experience. For example, IVA props and spaces seem to be especially costly, so I\u0027ve set aside Firespitter (besides the plugin), Near Future Tech, and ALCOR/ERS, even though they\u0027re all way cool."},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T02:16:41Z","Content":"Wow, WinDirStat is one of the coolest tools I\u0027ve seen in a long time.

Nertea and alexustas make beautiful stuff, but I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027d rather spend my limited RAM on other things. (In particular, I\u0027ve just recently given up ALCOR because Lithobrake Exploration Technologies gives me a three-person lander can [and lots of other cool lander parts besides] for less than a quarter of the memory overhead, and Near Future was likewise \u0022competing\u0022 with USI Flight Transportation Tech.)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T05:39:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow, WinDirStat is one of the coolest tools I\u0027ve seen in a long time.
