Has anyone created a program for soft-landing the first stage of their rocket, Falcon 9R-style? Or would anyone be up for the challenge? I\u0027m going to attempt it, but I\u0027m certainly not the best so I was wondering if any of you pro\u0027s have done or attempted it. Or does the program stop running when it gets out of rendering distance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T08:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, that\u0027s really interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never used KOS, but for sure you have to use something that force your first stage to remain loaded and under physical simulation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember the name, but such a plugin already exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the vessel is forced to remain loaded, the auto pilot would work even if you are not focusing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T09:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Plonio!

I\u0027m gonna go try this now! Thanks for that!
