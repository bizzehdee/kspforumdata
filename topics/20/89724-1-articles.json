(Also in the other reaction wheels) This mod would be somewhat simple to remove the torque, just an MM config to remove pod torque. But the other part is adding RCS thrusters to the pods. They would be only on the Mk1, Mk1-2, and maybe something else. They\u0027d also feature RCS Thrusters set into the model/texture, and be designed by Ven for Stock Part Revamp compatibility. I\u0027m crazy for suggesting a specific modder to do the models, yes. No denying that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
