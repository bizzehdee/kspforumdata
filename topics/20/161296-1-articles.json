So what does v1.3 do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the parts-only mods that use the stock API calls. The classic example of this would be fuel tanks A really old mod would need the attachment nodes editing, so that the bottom node pointed in the correct direction, but the\u00A0only changes appear to come in the new language system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the mods which use add-on DLLs. There are already new versions of many of these DLLs. Again, that doesn\u0027t always cover the new language system. Most mods use Module Manager, and that\u0027s sorted. A more interesting example is this mod:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/598/JSI%20Advanced%20Transparent%20Pods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJSI Advanced Transparent Pods\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis changed the name used to call the DLL, several versions back,, which is a minor edit to an old parts.cfg that uses it. You\u0027ve likely already done it if you\u0027re still using an older part, so you just have to use the new add-on version. What you needed to do is replace \u0022JSITransparentPod\u0022 in the part.cfg with \u0022JSIAdvTransparentPod\u0022,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at what I have tested, most of the changes are invisible to the ordinary user. If you edited an old mod to suit v1.2.2, and the dependencies are updated, it is worth trying. You\u0027ll not have the language support, but if you already have a set\u00A0of favourite mods, how much of a barrier is that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier mods might need housekeeping adjustments: there have been changes to things such as temperature limits, but I would describe such things as \u0022wrong\u0022 rather than \u0022broken\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt almost seems usual that anything involving spaceplanes needs more work, and there seems little point in transferring a saved-game situation just yet. The transition is going far better than I have become used to, and I\u00A0have just updated a couple of minor elements, such as an old conformal antenna that worked well with spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would venture that there is a place for a version of some mods without the language support, while there are others which might really benefit. Those Mods with the Russian spacecraft are an obvious example. but would it break them to have a v1.3 interim version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-30T08:25:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2017 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Wolf Baginski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBad finger trouble on original post.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
