I have a nice idea for the panels but I think modelling the crazy animation I had in mind is a bit beyond me at the moment... also I think some tiny RCS ports would be handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey if you want to build stuff, just build it anyway even if there\u0027s something similar around \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E choice is good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T08:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVen\u0027s Stock Revamp and RLA Stockalike both already add large amounts of tiny parts, including tanks and engines.
