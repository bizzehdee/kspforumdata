I really get frustrated on how my sfs file is large so I did not look in it yet...\n\nAppreciate your input\n\nSaleh"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:30:35Z","Content":"there some more or less similars concepts yup:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:35:55Z","Content":"[Kerbin Side](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785) adds some, not sure how easy it is to add your own."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:45:50Z","Content":"Kerbin Side is good, but quite large. I personally use [KSC Switcher](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117893-) along with a config that I made to put KSC in the correct place, remove some wonky sites (as the default config has Earth sites in it), and add a few more Kerbin-specific sites.\n\nThe 2 nice things about KSC Switcher over Kerbin Side is that you just get the space centers, and they all look exactly like KSC (excpet they may be rotated)"}]}
