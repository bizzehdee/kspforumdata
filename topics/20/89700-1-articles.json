Step 1, connect science data. Step 2, new part! Haha, NASA wishes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The progression of the tech tree doesn\u0027t apply enough pressure to convince players to make due with what is available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Some critical parts don\u0027t show up early enough. Solar, batteries, docking, ilghts etc. Without these parts you can\u0027t really do anything. This encourages people to spam science points, so that they leap through most of the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a couple initial ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Parts are not simply purchased with a pile of excel charts: To obtain new parts you must first research the tech level. You can choose the type of research, but there is no information what parts it may make available. Research requires science data, money, and time. The exact amounts are random, so tech levels will be reached at unknown rates. You have to keep dumping in resources until there is a breakthrough. After the tech level is unlocked the parts have to be engineered, this requires more money, time, and a prototype (derated) version may need to be tested in various environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Multiple progression trees: Several trees would be available and each designed to emphasize a certain tech progression. Examples are perhaps planes, small rockets, large rockets, Ion, nuke, rover, manned, unmanned. And for the insane, there could be randomly generated trees (with some rules of course). This could make different saves unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think that\u0027s what it would take to get players to make do with the parts available instead of spamming easy science points until they have the parts they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T22:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ESteve\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ESteve\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*Parts are not simply purchased with a pile of excel charts: To obtain new parts you must first research the tech level.
