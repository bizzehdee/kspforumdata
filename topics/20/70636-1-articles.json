So I am wondering how close to reality do these mods get you? Is it actually harder with this layout or do I just need ALOT more practice??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T19:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you need to apply a re-balance patch for mass of items and fuel densities.
