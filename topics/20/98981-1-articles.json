I remember early on in .18~.21 when modding was everything to KSP. New mods came out nearly every day, each original and wonderful in its own special way. Today, however, I don\u0027t think this is true. After browsing the mods page on the KSP forums, I realized that majority of the newer mods are just updates or remakes of old ones. Almost every mod that I see on the mods page is something thats been out for seemingly ages now, and what new mods there are, aren\u0027t all that fascinating. Most of these new mods make the game any more fun, I think. Mostly just some fuel balancing or atmospheric tweaks or graphical improvements, or some little part that will be lost in the hundreds of megabytes of mods that I\u0027ve installed. I haven\u0027t seen a mod that makes me want to want to play the game more since probably the release of B9, and only that because I could remake military aircraft. I\u0027m not blaming the devs at all. I somewhat think that from the generic content that is put out, the community has given the player to choose between which developers to use: the modding community or SQUAD. I know that there are people that want to make KSP as serious and realistic as possible, but I just cant grasp that. It\u0027s pretty cool, sure, to fire your rocket into space with super hard aerodynamics and 20x sized Kerbin, but I think it takes the fun out of it. I\u0027ve been ruined by all the maths and sciences that need to be put in to do anything truly amusing. Personally, I enjoy just tilting and yawing the rocket is just as fun as landing on another body for the first time. Granted, I\u0027m not an adult with the kind of \u0022if its not realistic its nothing\u0022 mindset, but I understand their view. With all these mods, it seems like the developers are spending ages trying t make the perfect, next big-hit mod, and not focusing on the creativity and fun mods should have.
