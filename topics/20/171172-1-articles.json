I didnt found it on the internet. I need it to change some parts in RN_Soyuz mod (especially, to switch between different versions of R-7 details). Itll be very good if you can tell me at lesat name of the mod.

But in that case, the switching mod is a dependency,\u00A0and the RN_Soyuz mod will come bundled\u00A0with it (or, at minimum, tell you exactly which switching mod you need in its installation instructions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, the RN_Soyuz mod does not have this functionality built in, in which case no mod you install will change anything about that fact. You can potentially get differently looking Soyuz parts from other part mods, but you will not get all those variants combined into one part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akamegire","CreatedById":183868,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-23T19:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, and thank\u0027s for help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
