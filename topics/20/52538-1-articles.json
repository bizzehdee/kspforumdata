All you have to do is pretty much set a bunch of the vessel threshold values to whatever you want.

Just need something that would allow me to set that distance variable so that things within like... 20 km are still fully loaded. It opens up all kinds of in-atmosphere options.

Lazors provides object recognition loading up to 99 km, but if you\u0027re not within ~2.5 km of a vessel when it touches down, it gets deleted as \u0027debris\u0027, even if it\u0027s a probe.
