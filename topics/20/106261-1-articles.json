This has many issues, especially when testing mods, removing problematic mods or ones you don\u0027t like can be a massive pain, especially if the conflict with other modified files. **JSGME (JoneSoft Generic Mod Enabler)** can make using mods a 1000 times easier IMO.\n\nHere is a guide to installing and using JSGME I have adapted from another game forum. [thanks Ebs from forums.eagle.ru]\n\nStart with a fresh install (no mods).\n\nThe days of going through the file system to replace and backup are over! \n\n1) Get yourself JSGME.\n\nfrom here - [http://www.gamefront.com/files/21681483](http://www.gamefront.com/files/21681483) or here [http://www41.zippyshare.com/view.jsp?locale=hu\u0026key=2423962](https://www41.zippyshare.com/view.jsp?locale=hu\u0026key=2423962) It\u0027s a 7zip file so you\u0027ll need WinRAR or (shockingly) 7zip to unzip it.\n\n2) Unzip the files to their new home.\n\nA lot of people say that you need to unzip JSGME in the game directory you\u0027re using it for. this is not true, it can be placed anywhere. JSGME does not need to be \u0027installed\u0027, just run.\n\n3) Set up your short-cut.\n\nThis is very important as we need to tell JSGME where to operate. Make a short-cut to the jsgme.exe. Right click the short-cut and choose properties..\n\n- **Make the \u0027Target\u0027 the JSGME exe. Mine looks like this: \u0022D:\\Games Library\\JSGME\\JSGME\\JSGME.exe\u0022**\n- **Make the \u0027Start In\u0027 point to the KSP root: e.g \u0022C:\\Games\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\u0022**\n\nPlace the short-cut wherever is convenient for you.\n\n4) Run JSGME (NB: from the short-cut you made above)\n\nIt will bring up a dialogue box asking for a folder to be created in KSP called \u0027MODS\u0027. Agree to this.. or change the name if you want.\n\nThen JSGME will open and look like this.\n\n![UNxo5.png](http://i.imgur.com/UNxo5.png)\n\n6) Generate Snapshot of Game Files (optional step)\n\nSee that blue word saying \u0027tasks\u0027 right in the centre...you\u0027re going to want to click that. In the little menu that pops up, click \u0022Generate Snapshot of Game Files\u0022 and then sit back and wait.\n\nThe purpose of the snapshot task is so that JSGME knows what your default KSP file/folder structure looks so when you install/deinstall mods JSGME can restore your original file/folder structure. JSGME can actually restore your original file/folder structure without this step.. but it does make it more robust if somehting goes wrong. (in 5\u002B years i\u0027ve not needed this.. it doesn\u0027t take long, so no harm in doing it.)\n\n7) Installing and removing mods.\n\nAdding \u0026 removing mods is as easy as simply clicking the arrow to add or remove the mod. The trick is having the mod in the correct format.\n\nBelow is an example using MechJeb2:\n\nMODS\\MechJeb2-2.5.0.0\\GameData\\MechJeb2\\{content of mod}\n\nThe red folder is the folder created by JSGME, **where you place your mods.**\n\nThe blue folder is the folder you may have to create (depending on how the mod is packaged). This can be called whatever you want.. its what will show up as the mod name in JSGME.\n\nHere is a screenshot of my file structure to make this a bit clearer.\n\n![ksp-files.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9592060/ksp-files.jpg)\n\nThis may all sound like a bit of a PITA but trust me, its easy to set-up..just make the short-cut and once you get used to sorting your mods out to give them the correct file structure it is super easy to use. Some mod makers make it easier than others! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nJSGME has a few other tricks up its sleeve under \u0027tasks\u0027. Mainly being able to save the order multiple mods were installed (as i\u0027m sure you know the order of mods installing can be very important) and reinstall them all with one click in the right order. \n\nHope this helps some, if you like modding games this is vital software. (works on any game/software)\n\nWatoh\n\n**TL;DR?** Take a deep breath and try again. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
