I think we can live with randomness if we can see it coming and at least take appropriate action. Likewise, we\u0027d need to be sure that such random events are not \u0022one-hit kills\u0022 for spacecraft. Random events should also be rare - like, happening only once every 1,000 game-days or so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake solar flares, for example. If I was to implement them in the game, I\u0027d probably limit space weather to three states, with one state - \u0022calm\u0022 - being the normal, and the other two happening only occasionally. Two classes of solar flares would be enough. Minor solar flares would mean temporary loss of communication for ships not shielded by planetary bodies (i.e. science transmissions won\u0027t go through), but no system malfunctions. Major solar flares would introduce system malfunctions, but at a small chance of them happening. I would NOT include Coronal Mass Ejections or Carrington-level solar storms because, well, any spacecraft caught in the open when such a thing happens is fried. Period. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile ground weather would be too complex to model, perhaps ground conditions that change occasionally might help - with a weather report that can show what said conditions will be in a region. Again, for example, we can apply this to launching a mission from the KSC. When you go to launch a spacecraft from the launchpad or runway, you get, not just a list of ships and kerbonauts to fly them, but a \u0022five day forecast\u0022 with some events (thunderstorms, tropical storms, hurricanes) having a chance of launch failure. You might still lose a ship, but only if you don\u0027t heed the forecast. Knowing it\u0027s coming in advance would help to make sure players don\u0027t toss their computers through a window if their 200 ton Duna mission is torn apart by Tropical Storm Jeb on ascent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve might have a chance of malfunctions due to heat for missions that land on the surface. Duna might have dust-storms that pop up in one biome or another every so often that block communications or reduce efficiency of solar cells or rover wheels, but not so bad as to tear landers and rovers apart. Again, events that can be anticipated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for system malfunctions themselves, if an event triggers a malfunction (e.g. a probe gets hit by a major flare), I\u0027d probably have the malfunction be a one-off thing, with permanent damage limited only to non-critical hardware. So you might lose a temperature sensor or a comm antenna, but not your lander motor or RCS system. Some permanent damage could be repairable by kerbonauts - like rover wheels are now. One-off malfunctions would mean the part in question would not work, but if you tried to use it again, the malfunction would be gone. E.g. A comm antenna gets zapped by a flare but not permanent knocked out. Attempting to transmit with it once means the transmission is lost, but use the antenna gain and it works as normal (for those who would need an in-game reason, we can imagine the ground controllers finding a workaround to get that antenna working again, as has happened with so many missions in reality). Of course, having redundant systems - like extra antennas and sensors - would also offset the permanent malfunction issue. Some measure of prevention can also help: e.g. if your Duna lander is about to get hit by a dust storm, you could fold up solar arrays to protect them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of malfunctions affecting probe cores and command pods, we can imagine different cores having different levels of robustness. A Stayputnik core for example might be cheap but vulnerable to flares, but an OKTO or HEX core could be hard as nails, letting you laugh at major flares even if you have the bad luck of having two or three major flares in a row. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, improving prediction of random events can also be a feature: space and ground weather can be predicted by KSC, but putting a weather satellite (with say a special weather camera part) in orbit around Kerbin or Duna can improve prediction of events there, while a satellite in Kerbol orbit with, say, a magnetometer part or a solar telescope part can help improve flare prediction, so that forecasts can go from just \u0022what\u0027s happening today\u0022 to \u0022what will happen 5 days from now\u0022.
