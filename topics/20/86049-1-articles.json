I\u0027ve a problem that many of you may share: I have too many mods, and as a result, I\u0027ve had to target more than a few for the chopping block. My goal is to only need to run basic active texture reduction and still have a relatively stable install of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the culprits I\u0027m looking hardest at is Interstellar Lite. In my current save, while running aggressive active texture reduction, I estimate that it accounts for nearly 250MB of memory when sitting at KSC, while I only really have one vessel that makes much use of it, a space station with a nuclear reactor giving it cheap, nearly unlimited power. This makes it a clear candidate for the axe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do love Interstellar for the goal it offers you at the end of the science tree, with some spectacularly expensive nodes to chase after and cool toys to play around with when you get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings me to my question: Are there any mods out there that offer an interesting \u0022endgame\u0022 to the science tree, that are more \u0022lightweight\u0022 on memory than Interstellar? I\u0027d very much like to hear folks experiences with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T23:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you checked out Near Future Technologies? That\u0027s one similar to Interstellar, but excludes the extra science progression. NFT\u0027s challenge is more in building crafts that can manage to power the engines, which are extremely hungry. NFT is also broken up into parts, so you need not install all of its components to make it work, just the tech tree, and whatever parts packs you want to include (engines are probably recommended, electrical as well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther science mods to consider: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Materials Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar Surface Experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-Science \u0022Endgame\u0022 Mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS/OKS, build planetary or orbital bases.

Memory use in particular is a big consideration. I had seen the packs the other day while trying to browse for alternatives but I wasn\u0027t sure if they would be any lighter on resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do already have Station Science installed, coupled with fine print I have plenty of science generation at my disposal so I\u0027m more looking for new ways to spend the science than ways to generate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried MKS/OKS, however I feel that both systems have far too many parts required to actually have a sustainable base running, particularly volume wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also gave Karbonite a try while it was bundled with MKS, but it was nearly half the size of the mod\u0027s install, and ultimately it wasn\u0027t really of much use to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T01:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI honestly can\u0027t answer that question, as I haven\u0027t tried detecting how much memory they use. My suggestion would be to backup KSP to another folder, and delete all the non-stock mods from that KSP install. Run KSP to get a baseline of memory usage on your system. Then add in Interstellar, run again and check memory usage. Swap with NFT, run again and check memory usage. Then compute for your normal install to see if swapping with NFT would be beneficial for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
