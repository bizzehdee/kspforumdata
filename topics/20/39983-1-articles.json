Yes, I know there are tutorials on the wiki, but some require Maya and others Unity and blah. So I picked up Blender and Gimp and would like to see what I can conjure up; I was thinking just a basic fuel tank. Does anybody have any get-me-started tips, tricks, or suggestions? The wiki can be a bit vague at times so I would like to make sure I\u0027m not doing something terribly wrong. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T02:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience the majority of tutorials deal with the Blender/Gimp-\u0026gt;Unity-\u0026gt;KSP pathway, I can\u0027t directly point you to one at the moment for time limitations but I did want to touch the topic because it appears you\u0027ve got a misunderstanding about Unity. The purpose of the Unity program in making parts is to serve as a prep and finishing suite for models made in other programs. Unless you want to do things the wrong way and develop without Unity, it does not matter what modeller and what image editor you use, you will import the assets created there into Unity, make sure everything adds up correctly, and export a .mu file which is used in KSP. You will need PartTools as well, it\u0027s a script that runs in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T03:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProgress Report!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, after much hard work and tomfoolery, I finally got a part to appear in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/snm9l3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022snm9l3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a red cube. However, contained within the same file is the texture I thought I assigned it. I was not sure how to reference this, though, because the the part.cfg that I am using is a copied Skipper .cfg with my own values. In order to reference the desired texture, I simply added a line below \u0022mesh = (insert mesh here)\u0022 that stated \u0022texture = Kyoob.png\u0022 (the name of the texture). As you can see, it did not work, whether or not the .png was in a folder titles \u0022Textures\u0022. But I believe that mesh and other such things are set classes, so I can\u0027t simply add my own code willy-nillly.

First of all, you got to assign your diffuse texture inside unity, then you can choose to export the model with it in .mbm. Just import the texture then apply it using one of the KSP shaders. You don\u0027t have to name the texture in the cfg file. About the collision mesh for your first model, don\u0027t even bother making a node_collider in blender.
