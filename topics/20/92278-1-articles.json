Its not to that hard to bear, especially if you run KSP in windowed mode (just switch to the internet browser for some time on the forums!). Also, if you plan on doing lots of small sessions in a day, just let KSP run. However, we\u0027ll have to get NathanKell here for any confirmation on the progress bar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T19:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, Squad doesn\u0027t have KSP open enough to allow that, the way most mods work is we have to let Squad\u0027s code do its thing and then undo it and redo it the way we want it.
