I sometimes find myself wanting to do a specific project, but have to grind through a bunch of contracts to even be able to partly afford it. I do like the fact that there are contracts, but I notice they mostly don\u0027t have a point beyond completing them."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:59:58Z","Content":"There is a non-modding solution to this for your consideration - open the cheat menu and add some funds."},{"CreatedByName":"Gampersnaz","CreatedById":147919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:19:11Z","Content":"I don\u0027t like using the cheat menu for serious save files... but I also realize that if there was a mod that added this feature, it would basically do the same thing. I like the idea of it being based on reputation. If they hate you, you get no money. Maybe I\u0027ll look into making something like this myself. I have a little code experience."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:56:20Z","Content":"Take a look at [GovFunding](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95865-CaelumIre-Technologies-%28CIT%29-General-Thread?p=1460619\u0026viewfull=1#post1460619)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gampersnaz","CreatedById":147919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:14:21Z","Content":"Cool idea, but it seems to me like you can just put in how much you want when you want, which kind of kills the challenge a bit too much. Thanks for your suggestion. As I stated before, I may do a little work and make something that I think would be appropriate."}]}
