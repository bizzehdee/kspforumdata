Imagine something like the realism overhaul, but for the stock universe instead of the up-scaled RSS universe. Is there anything like this, which makes SAS and solar panels not so overpowered, and the like? Better than Starting Manned, and the associated tech tree, look really good, but don\u0027t support enough mods for my tastes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T18:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo such thing AFAIK. However, you can use tools from the Realism Overhaul to make this happen. For instance, if you use RSS with a bare solar system config file (no changes to stock), and then change the values for solar panels and such, you can arrive at the desired changes. Some of the Realism Overhaul mods may also be used as-is, although you probably don\u0027t want to change the engine and tank values or you\u0027ll end up with ridiculously over-powered parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might want to try is Realistic Solar System with the config file in my sig, plus Real Fuels and an engine config, Stretchy SRB, and maybe a few other mods to taste. This will give you a more \u0022gamey\u0022 feel for RSS (higher payload fraction, less delta-V needed for orbit (about 7km/s, IIRC), etc...) without going to full realism route. It\u0027s an easier way to have a more realistic-feeling Kerbal Space Program without all the \u0022realism\u0022, and you don\u0027t need to write your own configs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T18:28:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
