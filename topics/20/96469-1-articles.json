No guarentees i\u0027ll make them, but I want ideas for simple, stockalike (simple really means no animations, etc.) parts. Basically, structural parts, engines, and fuel tanks are all fair game. (Just don\u0027t expect textures to be of the highest quality, so it\u0027s probably best to ask for small parts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fuel tank? Sure! An engine?
