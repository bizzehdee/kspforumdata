Didn\u0027t expect a reply from the main guy currently supporting Novapunch. I should qualify my previous statements-- I ran novapunch for a long time, think it\u0027s a great mod, and think that its author has added far more to the KSP community than I ever will. Mostly it came down to that unfortunate 3.7ish gb limit, too many parts to dig through, and that 5 meter Saturn V base. It was too easy to take designs that wouldn\u0027t work any other way and stick that engine on a standard asparagus stack to make them work. I also used that little orbital achievement device more than anything else, which made me decide that it must be OP and I should uninstall it for my own good. I did no mathematical analysis to validate such an opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may dig through NP and pull out those big nuke rockets in the future though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T04:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of you might remember the early days of KSP.
