I checked the config file, but there\u0027s nothing indicating such behavior: the config simply quotes \u0022ModuleGimbal\u0022 and how many degrees it can gimbal. I then went to check the config for a liquid engine, and as far as I can tell it is the same ModuleGimbal with basically nothing different... how comes it only gimbals in one plane? What can I do to make it does both plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
