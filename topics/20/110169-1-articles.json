One that would be great for use in shuttle cargo-bays. It does not have to extend very far, maybe a meter or two. Ideally I would like one in 1.25 and 2.5 sized docking ports. \n\nI know LLL has one, but its ..square and for LLL parts mostly and last I checked it wasn\u0027t updated yet for 1.0.2. OPT has one that has the OPT form factor can not be used for Stock designs.\n\nIf anyone else knows of a mod that has this, please point me to it. \n\nThank you in advance for anyone who can provide this for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:23:01Z","Content":"you can do this with Infernal Robotics, but IR has a lot of other stuff that you probably don\u0027t want."}]}
