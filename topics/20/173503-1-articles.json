Up till the start of the year, I\u0027ve had nothing but loads of free time, and spent much of that time modding games and playing them. I would spend a solid work week\u002B just on mod huting and isntalling, testing, before I even set foot into the game itself, but am finding it very hard to do so nowadays with real work and time constraints!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recently reinstalled KSP after a long break, came back for the expansion really and caught the modding bug once more. I go to work, come home, check spacedock and the release forums here for new mods, checking for updates to already installed ones, etc. and end up not playing/barely playing the game at all. Part of me is super frustrated by this, but another part of me, the modder, really enjoys all the work that goes into it, almost as enjoyable as playing the actual game in some respects I\u0027ve found, but never truely the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what about you all, do you ever find yourself torn between getting all the shiny mods put into a nice, playable package. Or, do you just play stock/grab a handful of essentials and just go with that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i_like_kerbals","CreatedById":156131,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-05T14:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndelete next time, dont edit my excrements amazing person\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-06T16:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2018 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by i_like_kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDELETE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I first started editing individual parts configs, but when a mod updated, I had to redo everything. So I went deeper, I started making patches.

I may need to add/change some paths for the models/textures/sounds etc. to make it work intially. But this way, it is always waiting until I install the mod again. For example, I really like the Smart Solar Panels from Dr.Jets Chop Shop. So I have made mutliple configs of them up to 10M. All with the appropriate stats changed. But since I link it to the model and texture still in the mod. It will not load unless I have the mod installed.
