Here are some easy types of parts to start...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel tanks:\u003C/strong\u003E very common but that doesn\u0027t mean there isn\u0027t room for more especially if you are efficient with your textures. there are some gaps in the coverage of sizes offered by stock tanks or since stock parts are not efficient with their ram you can create flat out replacements. A popular demand right now is pure LF tanks for nuclear engines, another innovative idea to add to that is making pure oxidizer tanks as well for an important reason. Early career makes you stack tanks which make your rocket flip as they drain from top to bottom but if you put a stack of oxidizer on top of liquid fuel the center of mass won\u0027t shift as bad when you drain them. This is a trick some tweakable and procedural tank mod users use but those mods rely on plugins that can get buggy if you simply made parts you\u0027d be making a reliable option for when those mods fail, aaaand pure oxidizer tanks open the door to hybrid rocket motors which next to no one has done already though making your own engine parts are a bit trickier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbe cores:\u003C/strong\u003E little less common most mod wise people take to just clipping the stock ones into stuff to hide them so there isn\u0027t that big of a demand practicality wise so most mods are replicas instead. still you can try for making more ram efficient versions or more shapes and sizes across the various tech levels and see what sticks there should at least be demand for more 3.75m cores\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimple Science Parts:\u003C/strong\u003E no experiment really needs an animation to show its done so you can get by with just a mesh and a config file. Also the same niche of ram efficient replacements still applies here as does different sizes (heat resistant nose cone materials bay anyone?) or you could come up with your own they could even be silly like testing ping pong paddles in microgravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStructural parts:\u003C/strong\u003E stick parts together the way you want them to be, and distribute them in the tech tree the way you want. Anything is better than what squad\u0027s done with the structural parts tree branch. Also landing skids are a popular demand the stock girders are sometimes used as makeshift skids thanks to their high crash tolerance what you could do is make a statistically similar part just in a more aerodynamic skid like shape\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T06:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest inflatable parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually there are mods with some inflatable parts, but they\u0027re most for crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome inflatable fuel tank or greenhouses for LF mods will be incredibly useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T13:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThings that I have not yet found in mods that I would like to see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-High Powered, 5 way RCS thrusters for large craft to save on part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A new greenhouse (an inflatable/deployable one would be nice.
