You can edit the \u0022Ascent Profile\u0022 if you like. The only big downside with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0is that you need to reconfigure the ascent profile for every planet/moon, which is made for Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA very good alternative is TCA. It can be used for\u00A0hovers, to jump to other places in ballistic trajectories and much more. One function is to go to orbit, which I think is little better than MechJeb, and can be used in rockets without any gimbal or control surfaces, as long you have 3 or more non-linear engines. If you need to pitch or yaw, it throttles down the engines in that direction. Very useful for aerospikes or any vehicle with misaligned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has an different and optimized ascend profile for every planet/moon. The default is 1 km above whats is considered space. For Kerbin, it is\u00A071 km (70 \u002B 1). If you want 71 km, it will act like Mechjeb. If you want higher, it follows a slight better approach.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nExample, for 100 km:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E: Goes straight up, gravity turn, put the apoapsis in 100 km, circularize at 100km.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTCA:\u00A0Goes straight up, gravity turn, put the apoapsis in 71 km. At 71 km will burn until the Apoapsis is in the other side and at 100 km. Then it goes to the other side of the planet, and circularize. TCA is slight better IMO, and seems to have a better gravity turn, but it takes more time. AFAIK, you cannot tell Mechjeb to do the same, since it will only start circularizing after reaching space (70 km). Most ships will not have sufficient time for the maneuver.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTCA profile allows to use low trust engines (ion, nuclear) early. I use it when I want to send payloads a little heavier than what my launch vehicles are capable,\u00A0when going to orbit from different places other than Kerbin or for rockets SSTOs with very little spare delta-v. Mechjeb sometimes cannot control some vehicles I make, and in TCA they work normally. TCA also handles other things \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E does, but lacks many orbital maneuvers, as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E lacks the main functions from TCA. I think the best option is to use both.
