As engine i use Ion Engine from DynaSat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion solar panels have too much efficient for now. Maybe when all of parts of ship will be use a power, not only engine that will be more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T22:27:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by ri00t\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
