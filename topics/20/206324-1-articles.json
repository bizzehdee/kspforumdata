It will download the missing files. I believe the mods should be safe but just back them up or if you do not want to take the time to copy just cut and paste to desktop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-08T19:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsteam also has older versions (like 1.12.2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-09T00:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
