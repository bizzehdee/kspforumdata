Attach wheels to a girder that itself is attached to the module via a radial decoupler, like so for instance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_024/screenshot314_zps9eda41c5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot314_zps9eda41c5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I didn\u0027t even bother with a lander, as it got tedious with all the docking, refueling and so on just to land down one module at a time.
