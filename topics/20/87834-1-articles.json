The end result is rarely good and you can never get the fuselage shape right. I know the likes of NathanKell are skilled enough to make good replicas and make them look faithful, but think about the newbies, who could be WWII fighter enthusiasts, and don\u0027t know how to make their replicas look good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at planes like the fan-favourites Spitfire and Mustang, to name a couple, don\u0027t have perfectly circular fuselages, or rectangular, or oblong, they are ovular.

The aforementioned ovular fuselage is also shown here. And one final thing, and this goes for most aircraft, be it WWI, WWII, Cold War, Modern, Civillian, etc. The wing, in-game wings have no curve and it can be very hard to make a, say, Spitfire-style elliptical wing (as shown above) or a general rounded wing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, cockpit canopies can be incredibly varied from the sleek Concorde canopy/windscreen -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.concordesst.com/model101/taster/sd11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sd11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the clunky Messerschmitt Bf-109 style (there is actually a mod with two 109 cockpits -http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94142-Stryker-s-Aerospace-Restored-Cockpits-Corporation) -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPitHkeU4ScT_J14SGODzpGPkCmGbfJxehBO9KBSZwA3FrY3MPeA\u0022 alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPitHkeU4ScT_J14SGODzpGPkCmGbfJxehBO9KBSZwA3FrY3MPeA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the heavily framed B-58 Hustler\u0027s cockpit -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS5EKoBNxR6wt0yEdcADOmRQKsFXDQCTxaVjd2thU1vosAEFPelDg\u0022 alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS5EKoBNxR6wt0yEdcADOmRQKsFXDQCTxaVjd2thU1vosAEFPelDg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the clean, sleek allied bubble canopy (spitfire, mustang, p-47, typhoon, tempest)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.jerrybilling.com/images/IMG_1323.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022IMG_1323.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery few mods have cockpits that look like the ones found on real planes, Retro-Future or Firespitter or Stryker\u0027s Restored Cockpits to name a few that do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBack To My Little Request\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, what my request is, is a mod which focuses on making WWII plane-replicas easily and simply.
