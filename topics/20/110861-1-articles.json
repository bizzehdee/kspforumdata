You fly your primary payload to wherever it goes, and along the way, FMRS keeps track of anything that you drop that has a source of control on it (i.e. a probe core or cockpit). Once your payload is in a stable situation, you can jump back in time to the moments of separation, stabilize the spent stages, and then jump back to your main mission, with everything taken care of.\n\n[StageRecovery](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29) does something similar, but simpler: it just intercepts the deletion of a discarded stage (whether it has a probe or not) and turns it into recovery. You get science, crew, and funds back, depending on its terminal velocity (read: if it has a parachute or two attached) and how far downrange from KSC it is. You don\u0027t get any control over the recovery, but it\u0027s a simpler process, so there\u0027s less risk of anything bugging out (FMRS is pretty stable now, but I\u0027m always a bit wary of weird temporal mechanics).\n\nYou don\u0027t even have to choose one or the other -- StageRecovery won\u0027t recover any spent stages that FMRS is \u0022tracking\u0022, so they can coexist peacefully. (I use them both myself.)\n\nFor coordinating multiple Kerbals simultaneously (including setting patrol patterns), there\u0027s [EVA Follower](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93653-0-25-EVA-Follower-v1-03-05-Nov-2014?p=1924364\u0026viewfull=1#post1924364), and for ships there\u0027s [Burn Together](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75170-WIP-Plugin-%280-90%29-Burn-Together%21-Alpha-v7-0-%283-29-15%29) (which BahamutoD indicates seems to work in 1.0, despite being built for 0.90).
