The aircraft would likely be already pre designed for vanilla and the mods dependencies, which would be BDA,\u00A0Vessel Mover, and Physics Range Extender\u00A0at least. The aircraft can be a number of roles based on what your current craft type is, such as if you\u0027re a lander type it\u0027ll spawn an A-10, SU-25, or some type of ground strike vehicle, where as if you\u0027re a plane it\u0027ll spawn a fighter, so on so forth. If you enter a region and shoot down an\u00A0aircraft, public relations will drop like 10% with that Nation, If its under 50% you\u0027re at war, and have to place defenses in order to protect the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, or wherever you\u0027re launching from.
