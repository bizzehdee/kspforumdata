Kp controls the slope of the linear response so reducing Kp increases the error required to reach a certain output.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ki is how hard it will try to turn to correct over small distances.\n\nIntegral response is based on a continuous sum of error (the total area bounded by the error function if we weren\u0027t bound to discrete measurements). The longer an offset remains, the greater the impact it has. Ki controls the amount of time it takes for a certain error to create a certain level of output (increasing Ki increases the rate at which output will change in response to an error). It is required because proportional response tends to zero as you get closer to a setpoint, causing output to fall to zero. If there is an offsetting force present (ie. asymmetric thrust) this will end with the controller not quite pointing where you told it to go because it can\u0027t compensate for the assymmetry with zero error. The integral term allows the required offset to be generated.\n\nNote that the integral reduces stability due to it\u0027s oscillatory nature which is why it rarely gets used in KSP where asymmetry is rare\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kd is some kind of multiplier for Kp.\n\nDerivative response is based on the rate of change of error. It acts against any change causing a reduced response. If you want your object to stop turning further away, you reduce Kp/Ki (less acceleration force) and increase Kd (more braking force). Increasing Derivative action too much causes it to fight it\u0027s own movements (move left =\u003E Kd pushes right =\u003E now moving right =\u003E Kd pushes left etc.) because we are limited to discrete time steps so if you see a vessel jerking it\u0027s way towards it\u0027s goal, you can probably blame Kd being too high\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Tf is how many times a second the circulations are run.\n\nYes and no. The rate of calculation is constant, Tf scales the result such that the rate of action is reduced so if everything was constant, it would take Tf seconds longer for the same result to occur compared to if it didn\u0027t exist.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ki\\_limit is needed because Ki and Kp can over lap and so Ki needs a limit to how much it can do.\n\nThe integral is just a continuous sum. When you have a big vessel with a large angle to turn through it could take you tens or hundreds of seconds to get all the way around to your target position. During that time the integral sum will have been adding on that large error and have become very large itself. This will require an opposite error to cancel out and so the vessel will swing right past it\u0027s target.\n\nThe limiter prevents this from occurring to an extreme degree (it\u0027s an inherent property of the integral to need to go slightly past it\u0027s target) by placing a limit on that sum, reducing the time it takes to bring integral response to the value it actually requires to set dead on your target.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Will Kp and Ki also counter my turn acceleration as the error decreases?\n\nKd will counter your turn speed/acceleration, not Ki/Kp\n\nManually tuning MJ\u0027s PID controller was a bit wierd last I used it because Kp/Ki scale with Kd (industrial standard is Ki/Kd scale with Kp which is much easier to work with (IMO) because you typically set Kp first).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T08:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:12:27Z","Content":"This affair about an add-on has been moved to Add-on Affairs."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:07:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Manually tuning MJ\u0027s PID controller was a bit wierd last I used it because Kp/Ki scale with Kd (industrial standard is Ki/Kd scale with Kp which is much easier to work with (IMO) because you typically set Kp first).\n\nIf you have some advice on changing the UI or the under-laying math I welcome suggestion.

What I couldn\u0027t understand at the time was why it insisted on running manually input factors through the same calculations (which means the Kp you get is based on the Kp AND Kd you enter. Ki being even worse, depending on all three factors)."}]}
