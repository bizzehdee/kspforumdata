I\u0027ve got very little experience with planes, much less space planes, but want to build a space plane capable of bringing down 6 kerbals from my space station without killing them. I don\u0027t have KW or B9, and want to know if it\u0027s possible to reenter a space plane with the stock parts (including Deadly Re-Entry parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning on waiting for 0.23, so I can use the R.A.P.I.E.R. engine to get it to space. No big payloads, just space for a few kerbals. I\u0027ll be bringing back (hopefully) 6 of them from Duna (and later Jool) in orbital assembled ships with no re-entry ability. Hence, go to space station, and re-enter from there. Right now, I have a bunch of 3 man capsules, but would prefer something more elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PapaGuido","CreatedById":70376,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T17:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have much experience with space planes either... but why not just send up a rocket with some modules that can dock and then bring them back down?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T17:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause space planes are cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound 2 episodes of Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar series that covers it.
