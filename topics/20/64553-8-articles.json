Although I haven\u0027t got experience with the desirable node.js or mongodb, outside of using node.js to compile mobile apps using Phonegap. I do have PLENTY of PHP, MySQL, Javascript/jQuery and REST experience. I have built many custom CMS\u0027 for clients over the past 8 years, but have never done anything large scale concerning file downloads. I have built websites which required support for 4000 concurrent visitors, but those were all text based on an nginx system. My most popular e-commerce project had 12,000 visitors in the last 30 days. I\u0027m curious what scale KSPort has in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current job is primarily management of WordPress websites, although I do occasionally get involved in some serious db-driven apps or custom CMS, and even a no-cms html website recently (yuck).

A mod could be a custom post type, for example. 3.8 offers a RESTful syntax to query posts, and it is easy enough to add your own methods to retrieve download links, meta data, etc. All of the tags and categories can be created as well, quite easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe performance is obviously the concern there. I quite frankly just don\u0027t have the experience in high-capacity websites. If I were to build this in WordPress, as a proof of concept. I can build this sort of system for WordPress relatively quickly, compared to building everything from the ground up. I do know that WordPress is a bit beefy, but you can do AJAX calls outside of wordpress and access data directly that way, often cutting the request time in half (or less, easy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes someone with more experience have any suggestions as to where I should look? Especially coming from PHP/WordPress development into something more streamlined/higher preformance. I am interested in Node.js, but I do not have an environment set up for it and have not really spent much time researching it. I assume it is a replacement for Apache, but it seems like a command line utility, like CMD.exe. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made sure to read all 19 pages of this thread to catch up, since I\u0027m not particularly active in the KSP community, this is all news to me (Thanks \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/24yufz/a_bit_ago_i_built_kerbal_space_station_a_quick/#siteTable_t1_chcipz0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETiberionKSP\u003C/a\u003E). I did notice last year, when 0.23 had just been released, that the kerbal space port was severely lacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the features that was only slightly touched on, that I think would make all the difference in the world, would be to \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly show mods available for your selected KSP version\u003C/strong\u003E. As such a requirement for the website would be to allow both mod developers as well as the community to notify if a version of the mod is compatible with said version of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a feature exists for WordPress.org\u0027s plugin section, which is the only website I can think of that has this sort of feature. It is quite neglected after viewing a few plugins trying to find an example, but see this screenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://radleygh.com/images/chrome_2014-128-01-32-57-63.png\u0022 alt=\u0022chrome_2014-128-01-32-57-63.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that would be one of the \u0022wishlist\u0022 features. If you can filter by version, we must consider those which have not been confirmed to work. As well as if naughty users have said a mod didn\u0027t work - especially if it is due to their own incorrect installation, or incompatibility of mods. The more you think about each feature, the more daunting each feature becomes (Yes yes, KISS, I have read that on almost every page! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that seems to be fairly popular for you KSP modders is to have something similar to Github, with advanced jargon and features that a normal visitor wouldn\u0027t understand or even be interested in. I always imagine trying to tell one of my friends who barely knows how to play video games to download a file. I personally tend to ignore readmes and go right into the zip, try to locate the folder which should be dropped into gamemode, then see if it works. Only after it breaks do I read the instructions. I would think most people are like that. Impatient. Lazy. Just like me. Cater towards them, but of course still offer the installation instructions, readme, changelog, source code, forum link, etc! But most of that can be secondary information.
