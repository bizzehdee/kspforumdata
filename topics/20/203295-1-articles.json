Since it always happens to the part attached to the heat shield, it seems like the heat shield is somehow transferring heat to that part. How can I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T10:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes your heatshield have ablator on it?
