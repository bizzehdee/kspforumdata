I\u0027ve been doing some exploratory work, and I\u0027m fairly confident now that I can write a mod that will sort kerbals by various variables, including:\n\n- name\n- profession\n- level\n- gender\n- total flight time number of flights\n- time since last flight (looks like there\u0027s not an actual entry in there for this! oops.)\n\nand any combination of the above, ascending or descending. I\u0027m still unsure about whether I can sort by profession (I\u0027m still trying to figure out how to determine a kerbal\u0027s profession), but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to do it. I just figured out how to determine a kerbal\u0027s profession! I don\u0027t really have any code to show yet -- I\u0027ve only got some really hacked together code that swaps a couple kerbals in the Astronaut Complex -- but I\u0027ll definitely share when I get a proof of concept.\n\nWhat kind of interest do you all think the general community would have in this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T12:48:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JonDahm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T13:11:36Z","Content":"Yes, this should be stock!

Usually I\u0027ll never have more than 6-8 Kerbals hired. For that number I won\u0027t need a sorting button.

They might be interested in your mod.\n\nIf you add a small window (with show/hide button) to the flight scene which tells the player what Kerbals are on board \\_and\\_ their professions more players will be interested.\n\nI can help you with that.
