Now if you do this, there is no way to fix it but to reload the game. There are plenty of other things that can be fixed by EVA, like landing legs and rover wheels, why can\u0027t solar panels be fixed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could just make it repairable by editing the parts file and such, but that is not to my likings. The reason being that with solar panels, parts actually get torn off and fly away as debris while those repairable in the stock game don\u0027t break away. It would be unrealistic to just allow instant fixing with EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought, what if I could bring spare parts into space, and if I have the proper parts I could fix those panels on EVA? That would be realistic enough. Also best if it could be compatible with KAS so that the spare parts could be stored inside KAS containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself can\u0027t create mods so I\u0027m relying to whoever reads this post to step up and make it happen!
