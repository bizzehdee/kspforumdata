To me, Restock looks better, and has mostly better art. Restock also fits in nicely with Nertea\u0027s suite of mods. If you want to use a more\u00A0improved stock, use Ven\u0027s. However, if you want something that mostly replaces stock, use Restock. Restock also uses less storage because it blacklists the stock parts, so it doesn\u0027t load the stock textures. However, Ven\u0027s uses variant switcher, so it has to load all of the textures, even if you don\u0027t use them.
