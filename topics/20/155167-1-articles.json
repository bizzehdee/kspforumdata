But unfortunately, you will want to remove that link before a moderator sends you a sternly worded message. You\u0027re redistributing Squad\u0027s property, which is not permitted by the EULA. Specifically: you\u0027re not allowed to redistribute the art assets (models and textures) of the parts. No, not even for free. You \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E allowed to make new config files and distribute them, because that is something you made (and Squad graciously decided to let you call even small changes to their config files \u0027yours\u0027). But no files directly taken from the game. Not even unmodified stock configs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, installing your parts the way they are right now will probably cause conflicts with either stock KSP or other mods. If you install them separately, you will have duplicate parts, which look the same, have the same name, and even carry the same internal identifier (which is not allowed and will cause stuff to break). Or, you overwrite Squad\u0027s own parts, and you end up with a \u0022dirty\u0022 installation - something you cannot roll back from without completely deleting and reinstalling everything. And when you install a mod that makes changes based on the expectation that Squad\u0027s own parts are present, it can result in that mod not working as designed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can easily see that creating and distributing a mod this way is not a good idea, for many different reasons. Instead, I recommend that you learn about the wonders of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-121-module-manager\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EModule Manager\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s a small mod that lets you write a patch config file that changes the behavior of an existing part, or safely make a clone of an existing part with different stats, while the game is running - without any need to change or duplicate the source files of that part itself. Then you can just distribute the patch you made as a mod, and you circumvent every single problem I pointed out above at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when you do decide to upload another mod, please observe the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154851-add-on-posting-rules\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eadd-on posting rules\u003C/a\u003E.
