Only really useful for a single refinery setup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way is to use radial attachment points around a regular rocket and attach the small nodes of the ISRU to those points. This is really the only effective way to use multipules on the same craft. a useful trick if you go the multi rout is put landing legs on the refinerys and build the rocket in such a way as they are supporting a good chunk of the rockets weight while landed (extra legs supporting the core of the rocket if its heavy) Scott basicly uses this method in the video posted above with the added twist of useing Infernal robotics to make them fold away instead of attaching directly to the radial points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T00:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I found his video later that night... not too sure whether I want to add infernal robotics to my current career at the moment though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I was fiddling with the ISRU in the VAB some more today and it seems that the big bottom attachment point is unusable when the ISRU is not the root object? That\u0027d be a shame, really since I figured out a semi-large (by my standards anyway) station to deploy on Minmus. Not 100% convinced it will survive the deceleration but since its Minmus we\u0027re talking about it probably will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like your design by the way merendel, seems very compact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post a pic of my station if it makes it to Minmus\u0027 surface in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T04:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with the refinery stems from a limitation of KSP itself. To put it simply it does not play nice with attachment nodes that are not in a strait line. If the 2 primary nodes are in a strait line like most stack based parts (fuel tanks and such) it will happily attach to either when you place a part. However if there are also nodes at 90 degree angles from the primary one it wont let you attach to them as you are initially placing the part. In effect only 1 of those two nodes in that configuration would work as the first attach point even though you could attach to the other once place. Folks voted on the thread when it was introduced which node they wanted the primary and the consensus was to make the small one the primary as otherwise it was useless as anything but a place to dock a small ship. Personaly I wish 2 had been added, 1 with the alternate configuration to make some designs easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T09:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh that makes a lot of sense actually, thanks for clarifying this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T21:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHooray it worked.
