Hope everyone\u0027s doing great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this has already been posted/suggested in the forums but if so I\u0027ll say it again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it not time that we have a Realism Hub in this forum to discuss all RSS-Realism Overhaul related stuff?\u003C/strong\u003E I am an assiduous RSS/RO player (in fact I have never played stock KSP - I started with RSS/RO right from the start [man, was that tough!]) and became almost obsessed with turning my KSP into the real thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a Realism Hub in the forums would help encourage discussions, exchanges, mod development, issue detecting/fixing, tutorials, story-telling, social bonding/connecting etc. for all of us who only really care for the Realistic KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started thinking in this idea while following the RO Discussion Thread, in which I see people posting crashes/bugs, stories and mission reports, design queries and ideas, etc. etc. indistinctly. I find it quite hard to follow it and track the content I\u0027m interested in (in my case alone, I already have RSS/RO working so I might not be as interested in other people\u0027s technical issues but design discussions, craft exchanges, compatible mods, etc.). Basically I think the aforementioned thread is now holding a multitude of different type of posts that I think would be good to have them separated \u0026amp; organized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcluding, I think this Realism Hub would be a great addition to the forums. We could track RSS/RO compatible mods (which I\u0027m always out on the look for), discuss building/design techniques without having to worry to specify all the time that we work under the RSS/RO suite, share our stories and mission plans, post challenges and defy other players and\u00A0have an organized\u00A0sub-forum for technical aid (between RO \u0026amp; RSS\u0027 Visual Enhancements\u00A0threads, the amount of technical issues and people asking the same things over and over again without providing the minimum information for those experienced users to help them is excruciating and I can\u0027t imagine what\u0027s like for \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002275006\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0022\u003E@NathanKell\u003C/a\u003E, @pingopete and the rest of the guys that are always willingly trying to help every single day [we super thank you for that guys, you are pillars of this community which I am just trying to begin to be a part of!!!]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully you agree with me and we can get this going on!

It\u0027s mainly for organization purposes; i.e. I see in that discussion thread many many different types of posts (technical issues, design ideas/queries, mission stories/descriptions, queries regarding compatible mods, etc. etc.) and I just thought it would be better and would drive added value to have a specific subforum for all RSS/RO/RP-0 things related \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0just a humble thought though, if everyone\u0027s doing fine with that single thread then that\u0027s OK \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T17:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK then.
