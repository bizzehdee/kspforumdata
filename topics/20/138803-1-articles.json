It\u0027s going to be a sci-fi / quantum\u00A0\u00A0physics themed mod, with an emphasis on using real-world quantum physics principles to make space travel easier. I think it\u0027s safe to say I\u0027ll be doing plenty of background research for it. I\u0027ll end up using plenty of quantum physics jargon, but I assure you it\u0027ll at least be appropriately used.\u00A0And because I have a background in 3D, aesthetics are going to be a major focus. Actual game balancing is\u00A0going to end up taking a backseat to the models.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod is mainly going to focus on high-thrust, high ISP engines and high energy output fusion reactors, the only catch being that they are \u003Cem\u003Every expensive\u003C/em\u003E and produce a \u003Cem\u003ELOT\u003C/em\u003E of waste heat. The only ways to keep them from overheating and exploding are to vent them manually (which disables the functionality of the part while it\u0027s happening), or to attach a closed-loop superfluid cooling system. This allows you to continue to use the part while it is cooling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cooling system was the first part I\u0027ve made so far, and besides a few tweaks I\u0027m going to make to the animations, it\u0027s essentially done. The cooling system uses Helium-4 in a superfluid state, and passes it around to keep high-heat parts at safe temperature levels. As the liquid helium-4 is warmed up by the waste heat, it will convert back into gaseous helium-4. However, if the cooling system is turned on (not just deployed), it\u0027ll use a set of radiators and \u0022polarization gradient\u0022 lasers to condense\u00A0it back down to superfluid state (while using large\u00A0amounts of energy to do so). Polarization gradient lasers are in essence cooling lasers. They are currently used in laboratory settings to reach temperatures near absolute-zero.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanned parts:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMagnetoplasma thruster: This 2.5m engine uses large amounts of energy to produce high thrust, with high efficiency. It uses hydrogen gas as a fuel. As a catch, while\u00A0it is burning, it will also heat up very quickly. The only way to avoid overheat (and the subsequent explosion) will be to stop your burn, and vent the engine by passing gaseous hydrogen through it. This hydrogen will be wasted by being blasted out the sides of the engine, but will help cool it down to reasonable levels. If you don\u0027t like the prospect of constantly stopping your burns to cool off the engine, you can attach a superfluid cooling system to it. This will allow you to burn all you want and not have to worry about engine overheat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMiniaturized fusion reactor: This part will produce high amounts of energy for long periods of time, but because storing ionized plasma at 100 million degrees is no small feat, you\u0027ll need to either vent it or attach a cooling loop if you want it to continue to function without exploding. It will use custom fuels such as Deuterium and Tritium, since I feel like using regular hydrogen gas would probably make it overpowered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPre-built science probes: Since I\u0027ve had problems with building rovers and surface probes in the past, I figured it\u0027d be interesting to try making surface drones that already have all the parts you need built into them. Since they\u0027ll already have their own power supply, science parts (possibly interchangeable ones), thrusters, crawler legs, and cameras (possibly hullcam-enabled) built into them, there\u0027s no need to mess with Tweakscale or IR to make a space probe. Although, because they\u0027re pre-built, you\u0027d have limited (if any) ability to customize it.\u00A0I\u0027ll be designing them for my own use, personally because I think it\u0027d be really cool (and good game asset design experience), but I\u0027d like to know if you want them to be in the final mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience parts: These may include mass spectrometers (lasers which can analyze rock content, like ChemCam), Infra-red cameras, X-ray imaging systems,\u00A0so on. Realistic science results like mineral composition would also be incorporated into science messages.\u00A0Not sure how much community interest there\u0027d be in this, though, so I can\u0027t say with certainty that it\u0027ll end up in the final product.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a Youtube video showing off the model and slapped some music on it\u00A0(Disregard complete lack of tech specs and info, it\u0027s a model showcase as well as a proof of concept\u00A0and not a mod outline):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJBxH5_tRwk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not worried about the polygon count, even though it looks excessive in the video. Right now it\u0027s floating around the 45,000 mark. For a point of reference, the Mainsail is 10,000. Polygons are usually less game engine intensive than collision meshes and textures, both of which I\u0027ll try to keep as simple as possible. I\u0027ve done all of the part details in 3D anyway so I don\u0027t see how I\u0027ll be needing anything more than solid colors (and perhaps metallic shaders) with the final product. Unity makes a pass for every 66,000 polygons, so any less than that shouldn\u0027t tax any modern computer too extensively.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shared this all with you because since this is my first mod, I wanted to know what kind of community interest there would be with something like this, what other kinds of related parts the community would be interested in, and which direction I should take this mod in. That\u0027s why this is posted in add-on discussion as opposed to add-on development. When I make some more progress on modeling, I\u0027ll create an add-on development page.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T02:05:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by IAN 4000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T08:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is some pretty kick-ass model and animation work! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E I like it a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to your plans - are you going to make your own resources, or are you going to hook into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007-11-community-resource-pack\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECommunity Resource Pack\u003C/a\u003E?
