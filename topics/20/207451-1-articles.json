Im using 1 on the second stage, and an other 10 more on the first stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts quite getting there, using spin stabilisation and all that business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT,\u00A0 im getting fuel crossfeed for nitrogen. When I try to look it on realfuels, it says that that source it drains along the vessel.....WHY?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way that i can deal with that is using \u0022ksp resource blocker\u0022 (I mean, clicking on the \u0022menu\u0022 button to avoid the first stage to counsume the resources of the top tank). But it just gets anoying to remember to unlock it just before the staging time. Is there no other way to avoid bottom engines to take the fuel from the top tank? Do I have to install any mod? Is it there an option to avoid crossfeed, or am I doing something wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
