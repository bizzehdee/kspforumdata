If you mainly launch rockets and spend most of your time in space, the stock aero model is perfectly adequate for your launch and aerobraking needs and you don\u0027t need the associated overhead of the mod, nor adjustment time to its own quirks.

Arbitrary/inconsistent drag cubes and\u00A0part configurations, special handling for lifting bodies that only affects a handful of parts, \u0022cheaty\u0022 exploits abusing the simplified calculations like covering engine nodes with clipped nosecones, node vs radial attachment, determining what\u0027s shielded from the airflow and what\u0027s not, etc. Practically all of these are resolved by using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s voxel model, which calculates the aircraft\u0027s flight characteristics based on the actual shape of the exposed hull rather than predefined values and hokey abstractions meant to paper over\u00A0edge cases for the majority of gameplay situations. It resolves problems that make some parts over or under-perform for no good reason, like the dreaded Mk2 spaceplane parts that look great but are unreasonably draggy in stock.

They do, and the \u0022rejiggering\u0022 required is less significant than you\u0027d think, often none at all depending on the craft in question. They\u0027re two different aerodynamic models but they perform the same basic function, making planes fly, just achieved via different methods of varying complexity. Once the centres of lift and mass are in the right place (with the caveat that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E can be more sensitive to this) the plane will fly just fine in either.\u00A0The small differences only become\u00A0apparent\u00A0under specific flight regimes, like breaking the sound barrier, exact stall speeds and flight ceilings etc. where one model is intended to\u00A0better reflect\u00A0reality while the other is tailored for more general\u00A0gameplay. I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E sometimes gets an undeserved bad rap for being \u0022too complicated\u0022 or \u0022too different\u0022 to get into, especially with all the graphing and \u0022wind tunnel\u0022\u00A0tools you get in the editor, but after getting over that number fear I found it remarkably straightforward to adjust to.
