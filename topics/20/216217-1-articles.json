When running BD armory, after firing a missile or releasing a bomb, parts on the vessel shift position. The parts that get shifted are different from one vessel to another, but it\u0027s always the same parts on a particular vessel that shift. The effect also seems to occur incrementally with the number (possibly mass?) of each item released. \u00A0There also seems to be a relationship between the mass of the vessel and the mass of the items dropped, although i\u0027m not 100% on that. In other words, if you have a craft in the 15-20t, \u00A030-70 parts range, and you drop 2 mk-82\u0027s, you may not even notice the tiny amount of part shift depending on where it is, but if you drop 3-4t of ordinance from that same vehicle, say 6-8 weapons, now i have things like engine offset on the Y and Z axis, or B9 Procedural wings rotating. Even at that level the effect can be subtle, but it\u0027s ALWAYS there. It\u0027s similar to flipping \u00A0a rover or hard landing a plane and then some of the parts are like \u0022bent\u0022 where their position is tweaked, or when you pull a high-g maneuver and the wings/fuselage flex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t seem to matter if i use rigid attachment or auto strut, one seems better than the other, i can\u0027t remember right now, but it still happens either way. Using actual struts also helps reduce the effect, but IT\u0027S STILL THERE. Turning up the breaking force and breaking torque to 200-300 doesn\u0027t help, I know that you can input in MUCH HIGHER values there, but so far it didn\u0027t help. Also, it doesn\u0027t seem to matter if the weapons are attached to a node or a surface, although that may effect which types of parts get tweaked, because i have noticed that sometimes it seems to be \u00A0node attached parts ie-engines that get tweaked, whereas sometimes \u00A0( B9 Wing) it\u0027s a surface attached part.\u00A0Unbreakable joints don\u0027t help, and neither does \u0022repair broken parts\u0022 from the cheats menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, ive noticed this for years, but only recently joined ksp forum, and i haven\u0027t been able to find anything on this. I can\u0027t be the only person to experience this as it\u0027s happened across multiple versions of ksp, bdarmory, many, many other mods, different computers etc lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping this is something relatively simple, like the order/type of attachment, or something that can be edited in .cfg\u0027s, but so far nothing seems to stop it. I\u0027m going to do some more testing on the relationship of the part mass and count of the dropped items, because there\u0027s seems to be some correlation there, but at this point i\u0027m just shooting into the dark lol. \u00A0I mean it\u0027s definitely not game breaking for me, but i don\u0027t like it lol. It does seem to shift the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E of the effected parts accordingly, so if you\u0027re running a sketchy or very nearly unstable aircraft, the cumulative effect can be more than \u00A0visual.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KlunkWorks","CreatedById":227815,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-10T17:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: attaching weapons to nodes seems to be the cause, surface attaching them instead seems to be the solution. To be clear, even when attaching a rail to a craft, and then attaching a weapon to the rail\u0027s node, this will still cause other node attached parts on the craft to shift slightly by an amount relative to the mass of the released weapon. Sorry if this isn\u0027t news to anyone, not sure if this is a known thing, but i couldn\u0027t find anything on it, and it\u0027s happened to me so much that i figured it can\u0027t just be me, or a one off weird bug or something. \u00A0I will do more testing as i have time, and I\u0027ll post some pictures when i figure out how lol (just haven\u0027t looked lol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
