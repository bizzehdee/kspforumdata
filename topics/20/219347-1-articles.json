However, I have been having problems with making maneuvers to celestial objects - namely, I cannot see the approach information on the orbit or display screens, though the approach icons do show up on the orbit line. As you can guess, this makes it almost impossible to not use map view, as maneuvers are already impossible to make. Is there some control, setting, or mod that would allow me to do this? I have seen IVA mod missions have this functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
