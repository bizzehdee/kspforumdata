But even using the 5m and 7,5 SpaceY fuel tanks ang engines, I lack a bit of delta-V to get to Moon with three-staged rocket. I looked up the specs of Satur V and found out that while the first stage engines had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 260 s (pretty similar to the first stage engines in KSP), second and third stage had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 420 s, which is much more than all the chemical engines in KSP. And that is huge part of why I can\u0027t reach the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know about a mod that adds engines with more realistic values, but that use the stock Liquid fuel/Oxidizer mix? Or should I ditch SMURFF and start learning the whole Realism Overhaul thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichal.don\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-10T14:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not just change the engines you have to the settings you want it\u0027s just alittle CFG edit ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michal.don","CreatedById":150623,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-10T14:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I would prefer some kind of a mod that is not wildly unballanced.

It\u0027s not as gamey as stock KSP, but it has it\u0027s own niche. If you feel the stock game became too easy, and you wish for additional challenges... well, you start adding mods: Life support; engines with limited ignitions; ullage sim; no overpowered gyros... once you feel comfortable with all that, you jump into the Solar system, and say: \u0022We choose to go to the Moon...\u0022 and then do your thing.
