Is the vehicle stable or not? Well, it depends on the relative strengths of drag and lift, which you\u0027re not gonna get clearly out of the indicators at all. If drag is much stronger than lift, then it will be unstable. If lift is much stronger than drag, then it will be stable. In both cases, though the vehicle dynamics will be completely different, the indicators will show the same thing, which makes different center indicators useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, NEAR and FAR change the center of lift into a center of pressure indicator, which accounts for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd whoever named it the center of lift needs to be smacked for making something so confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jab136","CreatedById":102504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T15:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use FAR, so I guess that is why I figured they were the same\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
