That may change in future releases. Once you have a plugin to do that, you may be able to add a new class and create new traits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that explains why there are no mods for this.

I think a mod that provides a bunch of different traits that people could put together however they like would be very cool (hey, that\u0027s basically what Contract Configurator does for contracts!) but ultimately might be of too narrow scope to see much use. Why is why you just see modders adding them ad-hoc here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, to expand on this a bit, this is the kind of mod that I\u0027m most interested in - the ones that don\u0027t necessarily do anything on their own, but open up tons of stuff for others. A few examples of mods that fall into this category:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EContract Configurator\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EModule Manager\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom Barn Kit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKopernicus\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo although I don\u0027t personally have time to work on a project like this, I think someone should totally build a mod with a bunch of \u0022interesting\u0022 experience traits.
