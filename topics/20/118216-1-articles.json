Those are not only very unrealistic they look absolutely horrible.\n\nI use [HeatWarning](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116773-1-0-HeatWarning/) and it seems to disable the eye-gouging glow you\u0027re talking about and also replaces the stock temperature gauges with something that\u0027s arguably better.\n\nEDIT: Why is the thread\u0027s rating one star? Guys, this isn\u0027t reddit, don\u0027t give something a bad rating just because you disagree with it. Be honest, the heat glow they added is incredibly rushed and an eyesore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T23:44:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T05:28:42Z","Content":"I\u0027ll look into that.
