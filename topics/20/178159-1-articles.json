tank\u00A0size unlocks might need tweaking in the tech tree.\u00A0 Maybe\u00A0also want to tweak some of the science part sizes.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSurface attachable

in the tech tree.\u00A0 (Maybe just consider KSP\u0027s fuel \u002B oxidiser to be RP-1 \u002B Lox and monoprop to be hypergolic.\u00A0 That allows\u00A0an automatic minimum level of compatibility with\u00A0engines added by mods without compatibility patches).\u00A0 Engines with different performance characteristics (isp curve, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E, max burn time, restart capabilities, engine vectoring, throttability,\u00A0fuel density, fuel boil-off)\u00A0add to\u00A0potentially interesting design time choices and trade offs.\u00A0 Personally I don\u0027t need ullage requirements or test flight type random failures (far too often I simply revert or reload if test flight kills an engine\u00A0during launch, but limited relights and a\u00A0deterministic max burn time adds potentially interesting design time constraints).\u00A0 Similarly I don\u0027t need RP-0\u0027s highly pressurised tanks.\u00A0 I think that it is better if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E/mechjeb will show zero \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E if the wrong fuel/tank type is selected for a stage.\u00A0 That is preferable to getting suborbital over the Mun and\u00A0discovering that your landing engine won\u0027t start because the fuel tank isn\u0027t highly pressurised.\u00A0 Similarly make any insulated tanks visually distinct\u00A0from non-insulated tanks, so that\u00A0provided players grab the right tank type in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they don\u0027t suddenly discover that half\u00A0their fuel has boiled off just because they didn\u0027t toggle insulation in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Maybe only allow insulated tanks to be used for fuels subjected to boil-off.\u00A0 Possibly have a tech tree unlock for upgraded insulation for reduced boil-off for\u00A0longer missions, again meaning that once you have it unlocked in the tech tree, you don\u0027t need to toggle it on individual tanks to get the benefit.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you have the different fuel types from the above, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E should be adjusted\u00A0so that not all fuels can be refined on every planet/biome.\u00A0 Again more design time considerations that affect the choice of fuel/engine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome players will want reaction wheels nerfed (some players will even want them removed).\u00A0 I\u0027m fine with nerfs, as long as MechJeb/Stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E can hold an alignment before/during a burn.\u00A0 (Assuming a symmetrically balanced\u00A0spacecraft).\u00A0 Relying on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0to hold attitude for all maneuvers seems to\u00A0lead\u00A0to oscillations and too much wasted monoprop.\u00A0 Leaving reaction wheels torque untouched when you rescale mass and length should already be a significant nerf.\u00A0 A\u00A0lite version of persistent rotation (only need the bit of persistent rotation where rotation isn\u0027t stopped by timewarping or switching scenes).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome players will want Remotetech integration.\u00A0 Personally I\u0027d be fine without it (stock\u0027s comnet\u00A0is enough for an\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E-lite.\u00A0 I always find remotetech\u0027s flight computer to be too limiting\u00A0and awkward to actually\u00A0use.\u00A0 Plus I\u0027m still annoyed by\u00A0the times it just cannot reliably point a vessel without reaction wheels towards a reaction node.\u00A0 Far too often it just oscillates around the node, wasting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I still remember the time it burnt through a

days I would just manually align and spin up whilst have a connection, then just have remotetech\u0027s computer burn for the appropriate number of seconds for any burn that is required\u00A0without a connection).\u00A0\u00A0If you want a Remotetech lite implementation then ditch the com delay, allow antennas to be deployed/pointed without a connection.\u00A0 (So that missions aren\u0027t toast if you are late\u00A0deploying your antenna, and for easier handling of antennas\u00A0for landers on bodies with an atmosphere).\u00A0 Possibly allow the player to manually execute full throttle engine and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E burns without a connection, but require a connection for manipulating maneuver nodes and science transmission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMight also need landing legs in either more sizes or a larger range of sizes than stock.\u00A0 (The tiny legs are potentially still the right size for small unmanned landers, even without being rescaled.\u00A0 The large ones are potentially too small for a large lander, especially a single stage to orbit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E refinery/tanker, even if they\u00A0are rescaled by the same amount as capsules/tank\u00A0etc).\u00A0 Might be solved by just using different scaling factors for each of\u00A0the stock legs, and/or adding a couple of copies stock landing legs with different scale factors.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne thing I haven\u0027t talked about (but which is probably implicit is some of the points above is the scale factor.\u00A0 If we want to go realistic, but with round numbers, then a Mercury capsule was roughly 2m in diameter, Gemini was 3m, Apollo\u00A0was 4m, Orion is 5m.\u00A0 So from that view point using tank and engine sizes in multiples of 1m seems reasonable.\u00A0 But even 1m seems large for probe cores.\u00A0 (Google says Sputnik 1 was 58cm).\u00A0 So I\u0027d be tempted not to rescale probe cores and some of the tiny probe class engines by\u00A0the same factor as some of the large engines.\u00A0 Maybe even leave some of the probe cores at stock scales.\u00A0 If we are talking tanks sizes without using procedural parts or tweakscale, then I think I\u0027d probably want a 0.5m (or 0.625m) size 0, then a 1m, 1.5m, 2m, 2.5m, 3m, 4m, 5m size progression of tanks/fairings/heatshields/adaptors to give the player adequate choices and smoother transitions form one size to another.\u00A0 \u00A0There are also\u00A0plenty of stock parts where the\u00A0size and mass just don\u0027t make sense. (Rockomax multihub 1.5 tons !!\u00A0 Also why isn\u0027t this a 2.5m part.\u00A0 It\u0027s only real use is in space stations, where most\u00A0stock modules are 2.5m).\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0When rescaling it would be nice to fix some of\u00A0these for a more reasonable size and mass, rather than just use a blanket rule\u00A0to rescale everything by the same amount.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI realise this isn\u0027t quite what you are asking for, (and adding all those lite implementations of existing mods is probably too much work, unless you can convince the\u00A0corresponding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E versions to accept patches to add an optional\u00A0lite mode) but it\u0027s my thoughts on something that is a lightweight\u00A0alternative to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 There is also Sufficiently Realistic Progression Zero by\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172906-nottherealrms/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022172906\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172906-nottherealrms/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NotTheRealRMS\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that might provide some ideas/an opportunity for collaboration.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154041-wip131-sufficiently-realistic-progression-zero/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154041-wip131-sufficiently-realistic-progression-zero/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T21:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223447787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178159\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536455993\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150244\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nightside\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/8/2018 at 6:19 PM, Nightside said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m working on a \u201Clight\u00A0weight\u201D alternative to Realism Overhaul to use with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or 10x Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod will resize parts to realish sizes and resource volumes, but maintain the stock \u201CLEGO-style \u201C rocket building experience.\u00A0The patch should work for almost all mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my question\u00A0for discussion:\u00A0what \u201CReal\u201D features are important\u00A0for enjoyable gameplay?
