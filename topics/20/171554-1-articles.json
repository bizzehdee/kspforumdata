I am build ships that are intended to fight each other but it just doesn\u0027t feel realistic when I hit a part and a entire string comes off... I was wondering if there was a mod that allowed for parts to be connected to more then one part so one specific part doesn\u0027t kill the entire ship if it blows up.
