I am able to run 500 part stations with no fps drop but I recently built this thing in orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img845/5121/q9sk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q9sk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img841/5816/mfvx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mfvx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 180 parts and lags like crazy (\u0026lt;10 fps, yellow timer on the top left) and im 99% sure it has something to do with the interstellar parts. Anyone know what it is and how I can go about fixing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gajbooks","CreatedById":98553,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T22:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also have this problem. I have built something larger than this with higher computer specs than yours, and the vehicle still lags me down to really low FPS. Only when I\u0027m controlling it specifically though. If I\u0027m in kerbal EVA right next to the thing it runs at a smooth 60 FPS. I can\u0027t think of anything that would cause this other than a mod bug. Graphics settings have no effect and changing the Delta T only masks the lag problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
