Also imagine artificial gravity, shields, ultradense or ultralight materials, and science telekinesis and other things, but that is for another universe (and game series).\n\nI am just interested in seeing a Mass Effect Core part in KSP. Obviously power requirements scale exponentially with vehicle size to achieve the same percentage reduction in mass.\n\nHow to balance?\n\nLike Interstellar Mod Antimatter, Element K can\u0027t be found on Kerbin, and must be discovered. Like those mystery ruins on other planets. Once harvested, then you can use mass effect cores on ships, resources withstanding. Also, will need power generators, like big part reactors and things to run the big Mass Cores. Basically, more power consumption than ion engines.\n\nAnd to add that little bit of extra, you need to skim an upper atmosphere to discharge the drive core after using it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T20:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T08:35:21Z","Content":"I wonder if you can have negative mass parts in KSP, because that would probably be easier than modifying all the masses of the connected parts.

(I haven\u0027t played Mass Effect) It seems to me the obvious place to discharge extra electricity would be into batteries/capacitors, to save the power for next time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Element K can\u0027t be found on Kerbin, and must be discovered.

While Mass Effect focuses on Commander Shepard, leaving the Normandy more as home base / fast travel vehicle, the lore fluff is that ships going interstellar have to discharge mass effect cores upon entering the system, usually at gas giants, which may also double as helium-3 refuel station locations or ramscooping passes (fusion torch drives). Mass effect cores build up static charge while in use at ftl speeds, and the charge has to be dispersed at a planet, or the buildup could jump into the ship\u0027s hull and cook it. And this assumes the buildup is in excess of the ship\u0027s power storage and consumption.\n\nAs for how to implement, there needs to be a way to divide or multiply the ship\u0027s total mass. Using a part with negative mass would not work, as it will just upset the centermass of the ship.\n\nThe field needs power depending on how much percent mass is being reduced or increased and the volume of the field of effect, which needs to be at least the ship or bigger.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T18:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T18:23:57Z","Content":"[Kass Effect](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79169-WIP-Kass-Effect) (defunct, but the idea was there)"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaster","CreatedById":69150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:08:46Z","Content":"Sadly, I very have no time, or I would be hacking into this old mod and making it myself."}]}
