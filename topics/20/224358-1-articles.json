I have downloaded the mod CH4 from GitHub and manually dragged it into my GameData folder. I am encountering quite a few problems with getting all of the engines to appear in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for some reason. A few examples of these engines are the AdvancedOTV engine, the Merlin2 engine, and I could go on. Only a few of the engines seem to be appearing in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, for example, the E2 Vac and the E2, and I do not understand why the other engines don\u0027t register or appear. Any ideas of why this could be the case and how to fix this issue?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to anyone in advance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
