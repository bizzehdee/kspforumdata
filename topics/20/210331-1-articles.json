behavior in videos I\u0027ve seen, is that the Nerv continues to produce a little bit of thrust, and only slowly reduces thrust to zero, after I\u0027ve set thrust to zero.\u00A0 All other engines go directly to zero thrust immediately upon command.\u00A0 This may be a KSP Interstellar behavior, but I also have plenty of other mods that may be doing this.\u00A0 Or, maybe this is standard behavior for the Nerv now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"olieeee","CreatedById":222950,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-05T16:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

\u0027LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 Atomic Rocket Motor\u0027 with the \u0027\u0022NERVA\u0022 Solid Core Fission Engine\u0027.\u00A0 I found these 3 differences (maybe more that I might have missed):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0KSPIE causes the Nerv engine to slowly thrust up, and slowly thrust down.\u00A0 This is what I was referring to above.\u00A0 When you go to full throttle, you don\u0027t have full thrust immediately.\u00A0 When you cut throttle to zero, you still produce a little bit of thrust until it falls off to zero.\u00A0 I have found this to be a difficult and frustrating feature to deal with.\u00A0 Putting exact amounts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E into a maneuver node, for example, is difficult\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKSPIE causes the Nerv engine to produce electricity.\u00A0 I have found this to be a useful feature.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKSPIE changes the

the Nerv.\u00A0 For the NERVA, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is fine once launched, and seem to match the Nerv.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock
