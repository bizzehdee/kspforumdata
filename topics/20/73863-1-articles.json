I need help installing the Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack, Chatterer and other mods. I download them but am obviously doing something wrong on the install. I have read install guides but can\u0027t figure this out. Is there anyone who would be willing to talk me through this?

Its a special mod. It has very specific instructions. You should be able to figure out from the included readme file. I\u0027m not sure about chatterer try looking in the install for the readme too.
