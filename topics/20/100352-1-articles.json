If you have a circular orbit before and want a circular orbit after, you have to offset it with adding a retrograde component to your maneuver. How much retrograde will you need? That depends not only on the maneuver, but also on the velocity you have as you enter into the maneuver.\n\nTL;DR: it\u0027s diffcult.\n\nThe only mod I know that does anything like that is Mechjeb; but (as you said) it just sets up the right maneuver and you won\u0027t really know how it happened.

In the end it means you\u0027ll have to change your current prograde velocity to 0 m/s and your (anti) normal velocity to orbital speed. You\u0027ll usually can\u0027t do that when orbiting in a low orbit around a heavy planet/moon because you most likely don\u0027t have enough thrust to do that fast enough. In orbits around light planets or moons it is possible (i. e. Gilly).\n\nI don\u0027t see a way for a mod to help you with that. In my experience you\u0027ll always need at least two maneuvers (first: inclination change; second: inclination fine tuning \u0026 circularize again). In my opinion it is best to either launch directly into a polar orbit on Kerbin (if you need that kind of orbit there) or plan your transfer orbit so, that you\u0027ll end up in a polar orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:07:37Z","Content":"I don\u0027t find the given example (changing from equatorial to polar) to be a particularly big issue. If you need a very specific longitude of ascending node, then yeah, things are going to be tricky... but creating the maneuver node is going to be the least of your problems. Far more important will be your precision in executing it, and the amount of thrust you can put to the task. If you need so much precision that you cannot simply eyeball it, you\u0027ll likely end up having to make an extra longitudinal plane correction burn over the poles anyway.\n\nAnd if you don\u0027t need a very specific longitude... why are you making a maneuver node at all?\n\nThe thing with maneuver nodes is that they\u0027re always relative to your current orientation and position. Because of this, you constantly need to fiddle with the prograde and retrograde markers to compensate for the fact that applying normal/antinormal dV would actually move the normal/antinormal markers - which is something the maneuver node only improperly reflects. This is precisely the problem you experience.\n\nThe simplest way around this: do not use a maneuver node. Instead, point your ship towards normal/antinormal and start your engines until your orbit is polar. Boom, done! If you follow the marker on your navball as it moves while you burn, you never need to correct for anything. And in .90, it\u0027s even easier: you can just ask your pilot Kerbal to keep the ship pointed towards the marker for you."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:25:55Z","Content":"MJ allows you to tweak the maneuver node via Maneuver node editor.

Not exactly on topic, perhaps, but I\u0027m curious.\n\nWell, an inclination change for a 90 degree turn like that is something like 2\\*v \\* sin( di / 2), or about 224.86 in this situation. I\u0027m not sure of the extra overhead from following the normal marker around, but I suspect it might be something like 1.0-cos(45) extra? My off the cuff guess would be then 290.72..ish\n\nBasically..it\u0027s like taking a curved path between two points that are in a plane. If you fight with the maneuver node, it will eventually settle down to being on that \u0027135 point\u0027 (90-135 = -45, 360-45 = 315 in this case), which implies to me that it is in fact the shortest route to that direction (well, unless you wanted to go south, but that would just be 90\u002B135 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )\n\nI did some empirical testing around Minmus, thanks to VOID and autosave:\n\n135 test: 5,135 - 4,911 = 224\n\nnormal test: 5,135 - 4,891 = 244 (\u002B20)\n\nWell, it looks like my off the cuff overhead guess isn\u0027t right. Maybe it\u0027s more like 1.0-cos(22.5) as you\u0027re only on average about 22.5 degrees off the correct vector? (that woudl imply 17.05 which is close to the observed 20)\n\nAnyhow, it\u0027s about 9.2% or so cheaper to do it the 135 way. Not much at Minmus (this is why I love Minmus-sized planets so much) but at Kerbin it would save you nearly 300 dv. Also, this is a simple method too once you know it - you just roll around about 45 degrees past the heading you want to be at, and let \u0027er rip until the orbit is correct. You don\u0027t need to upgrade your SAS or anything, just basic SAS will do (and basic SAS is a lot less wasteful of monoprop and such than the new fancy SAS for some reason)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T08:03:53Z","Content":"Thanks for the analysis! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T13:06:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the analysis! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNo problem, it\u0027s fun, and navball-only maneuvers are a bit of a specialty of mine (like the OP, I find that there are certain limitations of maneuver nodes, the large-inclination change being one of \u0027em.
