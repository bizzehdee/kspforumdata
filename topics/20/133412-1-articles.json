Is there something or the best solution is to put a satellite in equatorial orbit and use it as comparison (not the best in carrer and especially in RSS where you don\u0027t launch from the equator)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T12:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use Kerbal Engineer. It will show you your inclination, and the angle to the equatorial ascending and descending node. Burn towards the normal on the DN, and burn towards the anti-normal on the AN. After doing it a couple of times it shouldn\u0027t take more than two burns to be within 0.001\u00B0 of an equatorial orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue_Eagle7","CreatedById":158984,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T12:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already use KER and MechJeb but I\u0027m looking for a graphical indication (like the ones of the satellites\u0027 contracts)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
