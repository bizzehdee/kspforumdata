Pictured here is a mission to Gilly, currently inbound to an Eve aerobrake/aerocapture. My Flight Computer has stopped working. When I issue a command, it is sent to the Flight Computer\u0027s queue. However, the actions are never executed, and my attempts to cancel the commands just pile onto the queue and sit there.\n\nI would just ignore the Flight Computer and play it manually, but the Flight Computer is preventing me from using timewarp. When I try to increase timewarp, it automatically and immediately throttles the timewarp back to 1x in order to execute the next (instantaneous) command from the queue, but the command does nothing. \n\nI suspect it may have something to do with the fact that I recently switched over from playing with time-delay to playing without time delay. \n\nIs there a way to delete the Flight Computer\u0027s queue for this vessel in some config file somewhere? I looked around a bit, but I can\u0027t find where RemoteTech stores current Flight Computer commands. Or is there some other way to clear the queue?"}]}
