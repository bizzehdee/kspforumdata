I\u0027ve always like the idea of playing with life support, but it always ended up to be tedious and all the extra parts are just too much sometimes. So I created Snacks to fill the casual life support gap. The main goals of this mod are one resource(snacks) and no new parts. Kerbals and the agency are penalized when snacks run out. Kerbals will not die from lack of snacks, they simply get very grumpy, perform poorly and your reputation will go down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Functionality:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSnacks are added as a resource to every module that can carry crew 50 snacks per capacity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSnack capacity of non-command modules is 200 snacks for each capacity. Some modules may have more or less depending on built in snack compartments, or lack of space! The idea is that non-command modules are the main means to transport snacks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals randomly consume snacks on average every 6 hours, 1/2 snack each time. This averages to 1/2 snack per Kerbin day or 2 snacks per Earth day. You cannot predict with certainty how many will be required for a given mission. There are a few extra twists here as well. Some Kerbals, especially courageous ones may sneak an extra snack at snack time, others may forget to eat if their stupidity is to high.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals on EVA take 1 snack with them. This should be enough for about 2 Kerbin days. Plan accordingly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down. Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases. Reputation decrease is based on your current reputation. If you are a reputable space agency, your reputaion will drop faster than a less reputable agency.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92011-Part-Release-25-0-Interstellar-Flight-Inc-Kerbal-Life-Support-Mod\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInterstellar Flight Inc.
