I can sit on the runway and even see their target indicator 100km in the sky, but as soon as they hit ~25km they poof into nothingness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know any way to make it work so that they can come all the way down and crash into Kerban? I really want to get this to work for a video I\u0027m doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a clever modder can put together a quick mod to disable the 25km unload?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T14:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a fixed hard point where unactive craft always disappear.

It would be so much fun to set a bunch of rockets in orbit on a trajectory for the KSC and watch them all crash down. Could even make a missile satellite in orbit to play with. Or even a kinetic bombardment satellite using heavy equipment pieces. Or possibly even send an asteroid on a collision course for the KSC, and it\u0027s up to you to stop it (maybe in contract form?) and if you fail a Building(s) will get hit and destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of fun possibilities there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
