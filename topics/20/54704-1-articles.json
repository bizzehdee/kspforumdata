So, I\u0027ve decided to get into mods to make my game more interesting, because I am not creative enough to make do with stock parts. I turn to you, O mighty Forums - what mods and plugins do you suggest to make my game more interesting, but not more difficult? For example, I don\u0027t want one of those planet rescale mods, because I have enough trouble making it out of a tiny orbit alone. However, I would be fine with re-entry and all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you suggest?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T18:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEither KW rocketry or NovaPunch (or select parts from both) are great for making more elaborate rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane and Extraplnetary launchpads are a couple of my favorites, gives you lots of stuff to do on other planets, via mining, processing fuels and parts, and eventually being able to launch craft from any planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also really like KSPIntersteller...lots of high-end tech in that pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as far as parts go you really cant go wrong with anything made by BobCat...I use the HOME and Soviet packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from parts there are some other helpful mods, ones that dont really add gameplay features, but help with piloting or building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActions on the Fly-lets you change/assign action groups at anypoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor Extensions- extends VAB/SPH functionality in several ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalJointReinforcement- this one sures up the joints between parts, cutting down the need for struts on big rockets\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T19:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d Honestly suggest MechJeb.

Add on some parts mods; I like AIES, KW, Spherical Tanks, and some other minor stuff. Flight aids are awesome; I stopped using MechJeb once the 0.21 SAS was fixed, now I use Improved Navball, Engineer, and PreciseNode. I might try out VOID instead of Engineer because Engineer uses the terrible stock GUI L\u0026amp;F.
