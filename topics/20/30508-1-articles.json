Just build a probe with the Sat part on it, do a mission with it to a planet and place the probe in a near polar orbit (75-85 degree inclination) and just sit back as it orbits and collects the data. Once you have the surface scanned you\u0027ll know exactly where any anomalies are and can then plan further missions accordingly. Or if you\u0027re really slick you can package a lander probe in with your orbital probe, and once you find a target of interest decouple both parts, and land the ground probe and have a look while the orbital probe continues it\u0027s scanning task. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are really any number of ways you can do it.
