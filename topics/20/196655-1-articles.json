So i want it to change, is there any mods that add in stockalike rover parts based off of real rovers and rover based contracts. Basically making rovers useful again, maybe even skycrane parts too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souptime","CreatedById":204451,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-01T20:51:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wait whoops, wrong place. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002264714\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gargamel\u003C/a\u003E can you move this to add on discussion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-02T06:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-02T13:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried Bon Voyage? Rover autopilot, comes as a separate part but also integrated with the RoveMate probe core (and some mod rovers like Buffalo), it\u2019s easy to use and can drive to waypoints (for contracts), targets (to meet up with other missions) or to any point on the map you like. It also has a boat mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only downside is that it will drive exactly to where you tell it- half way up a cliff, inside another vessel, sometimes even under the ground if you don\u2019t have terrain set to the highest detail- so it\u2019s always a good idea to lop a few digits off the end of the target co-ordinates to prevent any unwanted explosions when your rover ends up inserted into your crew lander or base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor rover parts, there are a few out there- Buffalo and FUR are two that I can remember and I\u2019m sure Angel125 has a few more rover-related mods. There\u2019s also the Bumblebee quadcopter\u00A0drone if you want to take to the air without the hassle of building with breaking ground motors and rotors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
