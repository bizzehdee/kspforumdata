I spend 75% of my time looking at Kerbin from space, Kerbin is the most important. Having the others look nice is great, but if Kerbin doesn\u0027t look good then you might as well not bother. I haven\u0027t seen any other cloud pack for EVE that makes Kerbin look like Earth (the clouds are usually way too thin, like Interstellar or Renaissance). Same reason I don\u0027t use Scatter, it makes the planet look awful from space, almost Cyan instead of Blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I was talking about is that every \u0022cloud pack\u0022 out there either redistributes EVE changing its files (KSPRC) or requires the installation of EVE and then overwrites EVE textures and configs (AVP, AVG).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes it (almost) impossible for me, or every other modder, to check which cloud pack the user has installed. so you end up having to maintain 5 different downloads, one for each cloud pack. Like Eleusis was doing for OPM clouds before I gave him some help to merge everything into a single download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix would have been very simple, it would have required no more than 10 lines of code on each clouds pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe older cloud packs are not being updated, so they will never get a compatibility boost. and I cannot see the new versions (EVE WIP and KSPRC 2.0) changing attitude towards this problem. since I\u0027ve been asking an nobody ever cared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut it\u0027s fine. I see absolutely no reason for a whole community to change its approach to modding just because there is one crazy guy asking for something that ultimately nobody else cares about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T22:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand the complication, but KSP loads all textures. So if you don\u0027t overwrite or delete them, they still get loaded even if you don\u0027t use them. I\u0027m not sure if there is a way to circumvent that.
