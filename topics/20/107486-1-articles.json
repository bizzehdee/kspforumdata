Again, depending on difficulty selected, KSC facilities would either already be fully upgraded or not at game start. At this point, you would fulfill contracts to gain revenue (depending on difficulty), to be used to build rockets. Here\u0027s where it gets wonky -- you could still perform science experiments, but instead of getting Science points you get Revenue \u0026 Reputation.\n\nYes, I realize most of this can already be done via the cheat menu, but it\u0027s kind of a pain to keep having to go back and set it all up at the beginning of a game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:00:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GrimJim**\n  \n\\*Bah, stupid speeling!"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:37:24Z","Content":"That actually sounds like quite an interesting idea.
