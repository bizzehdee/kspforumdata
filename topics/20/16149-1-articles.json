Now if you want to write one because you like practicing, go ahead, I\u0027m just pointing out a few relevant things. People wouldn\u0027t have to \u0022get their hands on command line tools\u0022, it\u0027s just a simple, automated built-in script. There are a few other pros as well, e.g easier editing, since the language is simpler. To finish off, no, just because I can write it in 20 minutes does not mean everyone else can do as well, some are even quicker. The file I submitted is about 20 lines of code. If you think about it I was really slow. Considering this is a relatively simple project, consider it an opportunity to familiarize yourself with other languages. If batch or shell scripting doesn\u0027t interest you, then perhaps you would like to try out Python with a relevant library to ease interaction between the code and the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-07T18:35:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2012 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Anonymous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybutek","CreatedById":32393,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T18:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/19146-KSP-Part-Lister-v1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHREAD DEVOTED TO THIS APPLICATION!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe version in this post is now obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly new to this forum, as you can probably tell from my lack of posts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E...
