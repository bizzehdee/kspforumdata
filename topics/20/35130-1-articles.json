Generally, a mass apply of modifiers and locRotScales is good before export. If I can venture an opinion, your ingame renders would look about 47.2% sexier if you selected everything (object mode), set shading to smooth, then added an edge split modifier (the default 60 degrees will work fine). Alternatively, recalc the normals in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-28T20:57:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2013 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lillegre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESPAG\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
