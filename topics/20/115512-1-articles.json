It will let you build simple probes and stations KIS EVA style, I find the process quite fascinating. It still has KIS limits outside of VAB (no angle snap or symmetry).\n\nThere\u0027s usually only one reason for modded KSP crashes, which is RAM issue. I don\u0027t find many mods which conflict with each other these days.\n\nThere\u0027s also a reason why my 100\u002B mods never crash my game.\n\nAlmost all of the mods today come out with converted .dds textures and Active Texture Management can\u0027t do anything with them. On my install I scanned the GameData for the biggest folders and went over part textures in each of them. Many parts made by Squad and modders have overly big and detailed textures for parts as small as Telus Mobility Enhancer, plus some parts don\u0027t really need normal maps. The rule of thumb was: No small part should have texture sizes over 1200Kb (which is 1024x1024px), so I downsized most of the textures to 512px and even 256px in some cases, and deleted many normal maps. In total my 100\u002B modded GameDada folder now weights only 610Mb, Squad folder included. KSP never crashes.\n\nThis is my recipe."},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T03:39:57Z","Content":"Wow I have been away for a while!

The [Field Research](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123892) contract pack fixes stock research contracts in a very pleasant way. After installing it you will receive science contracts only for biomes and science instruments that will actually give you science. This contract scans all the biomes of planets you have orbited for available science and gives you contracts with appropriate instruments.\n\nOther contract packs:\n\n[Anomaly Surveyor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109471) - will send you on a journey across Solar system to find all the easter eggs left by developers\n\n[Kerbin Space Station](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113642) - will reward you for building stations and will provide many missions for vessels marked as station.\n\n[Tourism Plus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113621) - a better alternative to stock tourism contracts (tourists will want to visit your stations)\n\nTo get more contract offers you can change a line this file: GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg\n\n**AverageAvailableContracts = 20**\n\nDefault value is 10, which is a darn small number if you love contracts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T15:19:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:21:34Z","Content":"I was feeling a bit of frustration myself with the scaling differences between Tantares and the other bazillion mods I use.
