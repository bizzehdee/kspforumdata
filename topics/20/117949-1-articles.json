I have an old 0.23 version of KSP that I fired up. Immediately I was amazed at how cartoon it looked compared to my 1.04 version. I have slowly added mods and knew it was beautiful but didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t realize how much difference it really made. The beauty mods I have installed are EVE 7-4, EoO, OPM EoO cloud pack, DOE, Planet Shine, and Scatterer. Not sure at what point I picked up auroras and dust storms on Duna, but they are awesome. It also appears my skybox has changed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at least in appearance and now has colors. It had to be with one of the last three mods. \n\nI am really happy with how everything looks now but one thing I think should be different is, in my opinion the sky should stay blue up higher in the atmosphere. Shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t it remain blue beyond the reach of turbojets. They cap at around 22k? Is there a way to adjust settings to start going black between 30-35k? If someone can explain why it should go black as I break through the clouds I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll change my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T13:42:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E in my opinion the sky should stay blue up higher in the atmosphere.\n\nI agree 100% with this.
