To me they look like 3.75m cylinders with the sides cut away. But I dont know how much to cut away. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T10:12:15Z","Content":"You might be able to search around in the part file and figure it out.

The B9 HL parts come with a fully circular version anyway. The reference is 24 sides for a cylinder for most KSP parts, so that should be enough as it is. You can load any part into Blender with Taniwha\u0027s .mu loader to get the basic mesh to use as a template - you don\u0027t have to use Blender to model further, obviously ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nB9 HL compatible part on the right, 24 sided cyl @1.875m radius in yellow - where to slice should be obvious ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[![16892424717_57d70f6bec_c.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7659/16892424717_57d70f6bec_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/rJJ6m2)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T09:54:18Z","Content":"Hey,\n\nthat image tells me everything I need to know. :]\n\nthank you!"}]}
