I should set out my stall by saying that to start with stock Career grinds my gears a lot, but by far the worst thing about it is how much I want it to work. So I\u0027m trying mod/career combinations to try and make it a more compelling, more rewarding and all-round more satisfying experience. The mods I use/that I\u0027m talking about aren\u0027t supposed to be shortcuts to anywhere or anything, they\u0027re supposed to add depth - in many cases actually utilising their parts ought to make the game a little harder by increasing your payload costs. As such locking that depth away up the tech tree is just frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe broader, underlying point is I just don\u0027t like how stock Career plays out.
