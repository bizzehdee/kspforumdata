I graduated from NC State, undergrad and Master\u0027s, class of 2008 and 2010, (Go Pack!).\n\nFor my senior design project, my team and I built a drilling platform rover for Mars exploration.\n\nIt was obviously never launched, but we built a real working model of the rover itself.\n\nI\u0027ve got a few photos from the project that you can see here.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Great for scouting."},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:29:27Z","Content":"Awesome! I actually want to go to NC State for the same career choice - Aerospace engineering!\n\nI am not a modder, but I am glad that you have passed the finals!\n\nDo you have any tips for me on Aerospace engineering?\n\nThank you and Congrats!"},{"CreatedByName":"Odyssey","CreatedById":28858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T02:00:41Z","Content":"Astro- Not sure about your background or age, so I\u0027ll be generic. Obviously math and science and get a good SAT score. I assume they haven\u0027t changed too much of the course catalog since 2008, so I\u0027ll say not to worry about chemistry too much as you only need 101 and 201. Physics and equations are everything. Dr. Mazzoleni was head of the space division in my time and he\u0027s the nicest dude ever. Try to find a smart TA in your first aero courses who can guide you a bit. Also, just enjoy the labs. \n\nAlso, I took summer session courses every year (even straight out of high school). It\u0027s a great way to get a jump on things. If you go that route, use your summers to do something totally different, otherwise you just go blind on calculations.\n\nI got a history minor with mine.\n\nAnd study up on NASA history. There\u0027s a lot of solutions that have already been done that you can reuse...\n\nSend me a private message and I\u0027ll keep an eye out for you as you go through.\n\nGood luck kid!"}]}
