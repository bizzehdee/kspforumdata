I have also finally decided to start the path of making my perfect game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy question is: can i unlock / upgrade a part, based on future tech tree nodes?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo get more specific: i have an engine from a mod, which i\u0027ve managed to edit into a multimode engine, similar to the famous rapier... and through the use of GT industries, i am adding more capabilities (air breathing, closed cycle, as usual... but also an ion/xenon mode, and something akin to nuclear). what i would like to happen, is, when this engine gets unlocked via the aircraft row in the tech tree, it is only capable of airbreathing and closed cycle.... then, if and when i unlock ion node, or nuclear node, the additional mode(s) unlock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nis this possible in any way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T10:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically? Yes. Some mods have done things like it in the past. MechJeb for example has, or at one point had, a system where the mod\u0027s capabilities would be incrementally unlocked with tech tree progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically? Well, you will need to write your own plugin code for it. KSP has a basic upgrade system built-in that can be used to do things like uprate engine thrust after a specific node is researched, but it is (AFAIK) incapable of doing stuff like adding entire new partModules, such as additional engine modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T13:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307462\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519901572\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb for example has, or at one point had, a system where the mod\u0027s capabilities would be incrementally unlocked with tech tree progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt s still there but needs to be rewritten to use the stock upgrade system...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saiko.Systems","CreatedById":185475,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T04:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright, thanks for the information.... i guess in that regard, its outside my scope.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould it be possible to have a part require multiple different nodes to unlock? so, instead of getting the part at one node, i only get to use it if three seperate nodes were all researched?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd i suppose along the same line, would it be possible to remove/replace an item, if you have it, when a node is unlocked? example being i have three nearly identical part files.... one unlocks at node A, like normal..... when i get node B, that part is removed from availability, and a different part becomes available?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barar","CreatedById":184076,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T09:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the mod below, it has parts that get upgraded as you unlock tech nodes.
