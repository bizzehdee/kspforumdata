Despite having a higher mass, the b9 HL fuselage has less drag than MK 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe b9 hl fuselage has the default drag type, whereas mk3 has override with a lifting body module.

Further, the override does not actually do anything if the lifting body module is not applied. Finally, when the lifting body module is not applied by the game (which it is not, because it is commented out), FAR will treat it as if it is the same as any other fuselage without wing lifting surface parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are identical in every way that matters to the HL fuselages. They will behave identically to the HL fuselages. I know because I\u0027ve made planes with them, and they behave identically.
