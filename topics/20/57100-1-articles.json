Save your game and set your Pe a little inside the atmosphere and make a fly-by. You will air break and your escape trajectory will become an orbit, with no fuel used. Do it several times and eventually you will land. For Kerbin the safe height is 40km. It is enough to air break and not enough to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave first, because if you set your Pe too low you will burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe optimal height where you can do it directly in one shot depends on how fast you are and how high you are.
