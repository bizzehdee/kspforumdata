That being two changes\n\nFirst: parts have no cost to unlock in the R\u0026D building, although some cost might be appropriate as a negative advance in the second change.\n\nSecond: after a tech node is unlocked, a series of \u0022test part\u0022 contracts are offered with little to no reward BUT the part \u0022tested\u0022 is unlocked after the contract is completed.\n\nSo I put it to those more skilled at modding than me (being almost anyone) to determine if this is possible, and if so I ask you to please make this mod."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T03:03:34Z","Content":"Been poking around that thread myself, and it\u0027s certainly given me the bug to perhaps try my hand at a part test revamp, using your idea as one of the key features. However, I\u0027m currently working a different contract pack for the Contract Configurator 0.7.0 release, so this would be for 0.8.0 - likely looking into early April. And I may get interested in something else, so no guarantees.\n\nIf someone else does want to take this on using Contract Configurator, let me know and I can tell you more about some of my ideas, as well as giving you any support with Contract Configurator itself."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T17:39:03Z","Content":"Also, I forgot to mention that voidheart started a contract pack mod called Better Parts Testing ([see here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107661-Contract-Packs-for-Contract-Configurator-General-Thread)). It doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s been on the forums or has touched the mod on GitHub in about a month now - so it looks like it may have been abandoned."},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T14:10:34Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nDid someone say more challenge ...\n\nCmdr Zeta"}]}
