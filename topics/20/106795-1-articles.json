(And lots of mods to fix ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) So I decided I\u0027d started posting my creations here. I will make concepts and will create as accurate as possible recreations. I got lots of mods and many to fix. I have to constantly update. Anyway below is an album of Things I\u0027ve made and at the end some of the mods I use. (Those mods where from awhile ago.)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
