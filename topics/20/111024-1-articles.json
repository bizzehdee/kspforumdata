Maybe have some rewards after completing a given mission, stuff like that.\n\nBasically, the career mode, but without the science.\n\nI think I recall there was mods like this way back when, back in the time when science was not yet here, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen anything like that in recent time.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T16:24:15Z","Content":"Why not play career mode but without science?
