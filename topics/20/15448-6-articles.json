Then when ASAS arrived that was the first part to be placed under the capsule and with a combination of RCS and rudders I still kept my rockets straight.

If you reduce your throttle 50% you cut your acceleration 50% therefore it takes twice as long to get to the same speed. At no point do you somehow magically increase the specific impulse efficiency of an engine allowing you to somehow travel farther on less fuel.\u003Cp\u003EAny craft made in version .16, unless you downloaded the hacky fuel consumption fix posted somewhere around here, is experiencing a fuel throttle bug. They all are. Any throttle less than 100% is abusing the bug, and the lower the throttle the more you gain from it, because of the code that was accidentally left in place, as stated by the Devs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say my premise is silly, but you obviously have a misunderstanding of how specific impulse, thrust, and delta-v all relate to each other. Because thrust has \u003Cstrong\u003Enothing\u003C/strong\u003E to do with delta-v requirements. \u003Cstrong\u003EAt all.\u003C/strong\u003E Specific impulse is the engines efficiency rating and that is what is used in delta-v calculations.(with fuel amount and total mass) Thrust only tells you if your craft has enough thrust to push the mass it is carrying to escape the affects of atmospheric drag and gravity. That is all. As long as you have a T:W above 1.5, you can then forget about thrust unless you need to know how long to burn your engine for a particular maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would not be \u0027saving\u0027 fuel, you would be halving the fuel rate. There is a difference. The second craft at 50% throttle would merely be consuming fuel at the same rate as the first craft, yet they would travel the exact same distance on the same amount of fuel (all other things being equal). What you are saying is that somehow throttling down increases your fuel efficiency, and it doesn\u0027t. Throttling down would just increase the time it takes to perform the maneuver, yet it would still use the exact same amount of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou keep talking about \u0027saving\u0027 fuel. You aren\u0027t saving fuel. You are reducing thrust, which increases the length of your burn time, which is all proportional. It doesn\u0027t matter it still takes the same amount of fuel to get a specific mass amount into orbit. You can waste fuel by trying to accelerate too fast against the much thicker atmosphere, but once you pass Max-Q it doesn\u0027t matter. You can accelerate fast, or slow, as long as you maintain momentum to reach orbital velocity it will use the same amount of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know why you are trying to explain this. I completely understand how delta-v, mass, amount of fuel, and specific impulse all relate to each other. They aren\u0027t separate, they\u0027re all tied to each other. Changing one affects the other. Decreasing mass, Increasing amount of fuel or Isp, increases the delta-v a craft can achieve. Increasing mass, decreasing fuel, decreasing Isp, all decrease the delta-v a craft can achieve. You can muck about with the amount of thrust all you want but it won\u0027t ever change the delta-v a craft can achieve, because that is based on total mass, fuel, and Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here I will provide examples to prove you incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboth test flights were done following the same exact course. straight up until 10K meters, then a turn that ends at 80K meters for a 100K meter orbit altitude. the only difference is that one was at full thrust the entire time, while another was at 75% thrust after hitting 10K meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y789B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y789B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal delta-v expended: 4438\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evelocity:2491\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity losses: 24.5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edrag losses: 21.2%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esteering losses: 2.4%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeed gained: 52.3%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealtitude: 51K meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RgMer.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RgMer.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal delta-v expended: 5433\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evelocity:3300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity losses: 21.2%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edrag losses: 19.1%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esteering losses: 2.8%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeed gained: 57.2%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealtitude: 76K meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esame amount of fuel, different throttles, different heights, different delta-v\u0027s.

Or perhaps both?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much the crux of the argument. I can understand how people that play KSP mostly to pilot rockets and have the necessary motor skills and maybe fine tune hardware for that will probably have more fun doing a full human controlled mission, but the people that have inate or hardware related issues controlling the rockets would be heavily frustrated with the game fast if there isn\u0027t any way of removing that stump block of their path and the persons that play the game to build rockets would probably dislike that emphasis in hard-stick piloting. And let\u0027s be honest, RL automation is here for a long time ... in fact the overwhelming majority of the global lot of space missions made so far was made in a automated or at least in a semi-automated fashion, even if you don\u0027t include the routine sat launches :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CobraA1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CobraA1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve noticed practicing orbits around the sun is that I really don\u0027t do a good job of planning orbital transfers. I can see already that planning interplanetary transfers will be much harder than planning a moon transfer. I don\u0027t think I could eyeball it. As this game scales up, it\u0027s going to very much require some automation if they want to keep the game accessible to most people.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed. Orbital transfers are a precision issue by itself and only the fact that the relatively big angular dimension of the Mun and Minmus SoI seen from Kerbin makes it possible to use eye balling with consistent success for most people ....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T11:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs per mechjeb being available in the stock game in its full form, I would figure it should be the similar to how cheat codes exist in many single player games. They exist for those who find it more fun to use them, but there should be some slight barrier to using them, perhaps having to edit one line of the settings file where it says \u0022Mechjeb=\u0022OFF\u0022\u0022 to on, and then it will appear in the VAB. This would prevent ruining new players experience with a part that takes away the fun of flying, while allowing those who know a bit of what they are doing to use mechjeb when they wish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
