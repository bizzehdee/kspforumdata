From what I last heard, wasn\u0027t Majiir helping Kerbal Stuff hosting as a reward for the winner of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/64553-community-mod-repository-and-the-majiir-challenge/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EMajiir Challenge\u003C/a\u003E? (That was two years ago, can you believe that?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened to Kerbal Stuff should not have happened. \u003Cs\u003EFirst, a system should have been implemented in order to make sure that an archive of mods could be properly hosted in case KS ever had to shut down. Yet we tripped on the licensing problems \u003Cem\u003Eyet again\u003C/em\u003E because we allowed mod authors to prevent archiving in their licenses, and this mistake will be perpetuated as the KSP mod websites balkanize after the fall of KS. And one by one they will shut down, and others will spring up and we\u0027ll be back with the mess we started after Spaceport shut down.\u003C/s\u003E I applaud SirCmpwn for posting a torrent of the archive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, there should have been express warning that without donations KS would have reached the point of shutting down. Granted, I never went to KS to see for myself, but last time I checked, everything looked fine. But if everything\u0027s not fine and finance endangers KS, one should not humble himself over it. Communication is key. Word about KS\u0027s shutdown had never even reached out to me until 3 months after it happened. Actually, I had not found out that KS had shut down until about an hour before I wrote this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, what happens to all the dormant (but otherwise stable) mods? Every time a shutdown happens, the impact increases almost exponentially, with more and more authors hoping that a new rising mod site is \u0022better\u0022 and \u0022more stable\u0022 than its predecessors and thus more willing to put their (figurative) money on it. I have no data to prove this, but I hypothesize that it falls in line with the amount of effort that goes into the making of such mod sites such as KS. It is so disappointing to see tens of thousands of lines of good working code go to waste due to its abandonment. Even if someone uses KS\u0027s code for their own continuation, they will not know how to improve or maintain the system. KS was unique and I thought it to be the alpha and omega of KSP mods; I thought in the beginning that once SirCmpwn was done with the site, it\u0027s done. Nobody ever has to do this again, and the site will go on to the end of KSP. But ultimately I was wrong. I fail to understand that often times things, despite being taken for granted or looking \u0022okay\u0022, can get shut down overnight for just about any reason in the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not aimed to be a criticism of SirCmpwn or the decisions he took. I understand that they are properly justified. Rather, I simply express my disappointment that there could have been an alternate course of events which could have prevented KS from shutting down altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have few remarks on SpaceDock. I wish VITAS good luck, but my hopes on it seem rather grim right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is all I have to say. See all of you after exams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T02:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222576460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002275985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463020426\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217521\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022longbyte1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, longbyte1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, what happens to all the dormant (but otherwise stable) mods?
