I even tried to make my own mod but i wasn\u0027t very succesfull so i wondering if any good modder here wants to make a pulsjet mod if you doesn\u0027t have anything els to do. I am thinking that it would be like an air breathing booster.\n\nHope someone likes my idea and wants to make a pulsjet mod.
