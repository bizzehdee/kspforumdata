My computer went to sleep with KSP running, and when it woke up KSP was gone, now every time I try to load a game all of my ships say all parts are missing. Checked task manager and no KSP, but I bet it\u0027s still running somewhere. Gonna restart and try again, thanks and sorry for the necro of the old thread. Would it be better if I had made a new post and linked this one?
