What makes you think they\u0027re not working as designed? What are the \u0022proper pitch angles\u0022 that you think they should do, and what are you observing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T01:03:08Z","Content":"Ok, for canards, there are specific pitch-directions that are required for the various forces needed to move the aircraft properly.\n\nPitch:\n\nPitching down causes the wing-edge to point down. Up causes the wing-edge to pitch up.\n\nRoll: \n\nFor a right roll, the right canard should point up on the leading edge, with the left-side canard pointing down. The directions are opposed for rolling left.\n\nNow, for some unexplained reason, the edited parts from Vens Stockalike 1.8.1 version do not do this. I am concerned as to why, as it throws my aircraft into uncontrollable tumbles."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T01:38:52Z","Content":"I have not seen any issues with stock parts. Please post examples (in pictures).\n\nVen\u0027s control surfaces were deflecting (visually) opposite to the way they should be, but that is either being fixed or was fixed. The actual physics was fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T02:58:21Z","Content":"Oh... Nevermind then."}]}
