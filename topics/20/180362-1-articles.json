If you\u0027re having a serious bug it\u0027s a lot easier to troubleshoot if you can add and remove individual mods to see which one\u0027s breaking your game. If it were all one monolithic pack it would be much more difficult to sort out the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother reason is tied to update cycle. If you\u0027re using a mod pack and the game updates the entire mod pack is limited by the last mod to update and if certain mods never update the pack is stuck.\u00A0Customization is the last big non-technical one - mod users use mods so they can customize their experience and a mod pack limits that flexibility\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re looking for recommended mods\u00A0go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E page.
