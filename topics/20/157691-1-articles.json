Ideally, 2 resources (coolant and hot coolant) and coolant lines (redone fuel lines is fine), that can also leak, with engines converting coolant into hot coolant, cooling it down in the process, whilst radiators turn hot coolant into normal \u0027cold\u0027 coolant.\u00A0This is for my WW2 and Korean War reenactments for better engine damage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus points for oil/coolant differentiation, or coolant leak effects (toned down and recoloured jet exhaust textures?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP 1.2 and above please\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimmy Stiff-Fingers","CreatedById":175656,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T12:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds cool.
