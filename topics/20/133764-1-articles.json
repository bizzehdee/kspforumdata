I\u0027m starting to design a new spaceplane that\u0027s going to be exclusively for space, and I want to make it ion-powered for a sort-of low-signature SR-71 meets EA-6B Prowler sort of plane.\u00A0I\u0027m still looking at exactly which plane parts I want to use, but with either mk1, or mk2 plane parts use either LF or LF\u002BO, and even the smaller engine shells hold the same. So to make my plane exclusively ion, means I must use radially attached xenon tanks, and then figure out how to properly conceal them, without making it ungodly hard to refuel the spaceplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, wasn\u0027t there a fuel mod that allowed you to set relative fuel priorities? Something about fuel automatically \u0027flowing downhill\u0027, so you\u0027d set fuel tankers relatively high, stations somewhere in the middle, and everything else low, so upon docking to a station you auto-refuelled? I can\u0027t remember the name for that, but it should help me with refuelling hidden xenon tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T15:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58236-105-real-fuels-v1084-feb-28\u0022\u003EReal Fuels\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0lets you put any fuel in any tank, and it adds a bunch of real world fuels also.
