Just give my engines/tanks new fuel choices please! This means mass and (base) thrust are kept the same, and all that\u0027s changed is adding some new fuel modes (and giving each mode a realistic Isp). This is what the \u0022stockalikes\u0027 config currently does. Engines will not be at all realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Realistic Stockalike: this means keeping engines\u0027 roles just as they are, and keeping thrust more or less the same, but changing mass and Isp for realistic TWR and performance (and using realistic dry mass for fuel tanks). This is like playing with the current \u0022stockalikes\u0022 config in realistic mass mode. Note: you may get engines that look *so* wrong for their role (Squad, and most modders, don\u0027t make the appropriate engine bell for the engine\u0027s reputed role).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. 100% Real Engines! This means having a set of 100% real-stats, real-size engines (drawn from current and former existing rocket engines). This is SFJackBaeur\u0027s RealEngines pack. Note that this goes from real engine to KSP engine, so only those mod engines that look like real counterparts will be used. Sizes from \u0022tiny\u0022 to 10m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Real engines....but don\u0027t change their size! This is like RealEngines, except you won\u0027t be able to build rockets larger than Proton or Saturn IB (unless you cluster engines), since no existing engine is larger than 5m. Options further limited since many RealEngines are rescaled, even if they\u0027re rescaled to diameter 5m or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Realistic engines from RftS: Tries to convert all stock and most mods\u0027 engines into realistic engines, rescaling and changing roles as necessary. No 100% matches with real engines, but you should be able to replicate most real-life rockets, from the WAC Corporal to Saturn V or even more. This is the Reaching for the Stars engine pack. Because I\u0027m not limited to finding models that look like real engines, I can go from KSP engine to real engine, and thus support most engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.

Im all for 95% Real Engines: I like the whole, 1:1 scale, and rescale of RO, but I like being able to control my throttle and restarting my engines, that\u0027s just how the game works to me now. If I could have this, then I would be playing with RO, but for now just many mods, RSS, RF, and no rescale. (I do have the 1:1 soviet engines though. Those are very nice. All I want is the American engines, and I will be very happy indeed.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T16:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s easy: open the real_engines_stats file and search/replace the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echange all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrottle =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrottle = 0 //\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand change all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = ModuleEngineIgnitor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = DISABLEDModuleEngineIgnitor\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
