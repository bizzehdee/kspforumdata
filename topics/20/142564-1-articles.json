I thought it might be a part of one of the mods I had installed so I usually got around it by making clusters of 5 engines and shutting off 2 at a time. It usually let me use all of the fuel in a stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yesterday I was playing most of the day when things just started to go wrong. Every simulation I\u0027d run the rocket would take off and slowly drift sideways and then get ripped apart like it was under a lot of aerodynamic stress. After a few reloads my Kerbal construction time upgrades had reset and it showed I had -56 upgrades available.
