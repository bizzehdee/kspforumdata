For the KW pack, there should be a \u0022gamedata\u0022 folder within the ZIP file. The KSP directory should be located in the Applications folder on your MAC. Copy the \u0022gamedata\u0022 folder, open the KSP directory and paste. Ensure to select \u0022merge files\u0022 so you don\u0027t completely replace the stock gamedata folder. Once you do this, you\u0027ll have a KWRocketry folder within the KSP gamedata folder containing all the goodies you desire. From my understanding, most of these mods will not work by just dragging their part folders into the KSP directory parts folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
