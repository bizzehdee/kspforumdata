But for the moment KSP is small and relatively simple. The easiest game to modify out of all the games I\u0027ve played. Installing a mod for KSP is quicker then Skyrim WITH the NMM. ( Depending in the mod. ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sure is a hell of alot easier to trouble shoot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that will change. I\u0027d like to think I speak for everyone when I say I see a bright future for this game. A game that inspires and entire generation of Astronauts. Mods are going to go through the roof. And for all I know ALL the present mods will be obsolete come 1.0. It will be Squad themselves who\u0027ll ultimately come up with this \u0022solution\u0022. Which IMO is SpacePort 2. But severs cost money and money is money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETl;dr ...

A few major developers have made appearances here, to be summarily dismissed and disrespected when their feedback doesn\u0027t resonate with your grand vision.
