If it is in front it will update. A simple workaround is to place another maneuver node on the opposite side of your orbit to look half an orbit ahead."},{"CreatedByName":"quyxkh","CreatedById":78547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:16:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E KSP only calculates one orbit ahead.
