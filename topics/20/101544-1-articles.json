I am using USI Kolonization mod, and I\u0027m trying to make a skycrane for my base elements, I can\u0027t use the parachutes because no atmosphere. I need wheels as well so I can move the element closer to the base. I\u0027m using KAS too, I\u0027ve seen a nice skycrane on ShimmyTheJJ\u0027s livestream, he called it \u0022The Crab\u0022. I don\u0027t know how to build one myself. Does anybody have a craft file or a subassembly of a similar design? Or maybe there\u0027s some blueprint flying around?"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:10:49Z","Content":"No craft file, but this is my Mun crane. An OKTO probe core with a seat above, reaction wheel and KAS winch below. Girder segments radiating out from the probe core then down, with wheels and KAS containers full of assorted bits and bobs at the bottom. There\u0027s also a few struts added on the sides to help keep the legs rigid. Most useful thing I did was including some KAS pipe connectors. When I pick up a module I then bolt it in place with a couple of pipes. The resulting contraption is rock solid cruising across the surface at 20m/s.\n\n![txUCjAc.png](http://i.imgur.com/txUCjAc.png)\n\nIf I were building this again I\u0027d try to get the unladen centre of weight lower by adding something to the bottoms of the legs, and definitely add some RCS. It\u0027s very hard to move around and prone to tipping when it\u0027s not carrying anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Spaps","CreatedById":83083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T12:39:57Z","Content":"I found a mod, Stork lander or something in that fashion, and that is a really nice and huge landing gear with room for 2 mks modules inside it. Just make the engines on top of the lander and it will be fine. Also, I think I will build these landers in orbit, there\u0027s no chance I\u0027ll send them into space with FAR."}]}
