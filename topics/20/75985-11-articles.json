A mod discovery site (KerbalStuff/Nexus/Curse) is needed, although I also tend to find mods on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReddit\u003C/a\u003E, or from watching videos (like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1upc6g/scott_manleys_interstellar_quest_modlist/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest mod list\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually don\u0027t really have a problem with Curse. I developed a mod for WoW way back when, so they gave me free premium membership. I have AdBlock installed and used the Curse client on a Mac (back when it worked), so no ad-related malware for me. I really liked the mod auto-updater for WoW, and would like to see something similar for KSP (of which there are a few projects floating around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENexus is \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too complicated and detailed, both as a developer and user. It\u0027s definitely a site made by nerds for nerds. The required fields to upload a mod were just never-ending. I don\u0027t like it, and apparently the KSP community doesn\u0027t really use it (as download stats show).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor KerbalStuff, I disagree with a lot of the visual design decisions, but it wasn\u0027t particularly difficult to add my mod to, and doesn\u0027t look like it will be hard to maintain.
