It is my opinion, but I think that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS suffer from being designed as the LS system for MKS, and not a standalone mod. It introduce too much parts and resource for the purpose of a simple life support system. To someone that only want to add life support to the stock game and not extend the game too much, it still is an allright option, but I would recommend Snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for TAC, it is realistic because it use realistic values (not gameplay balanced ones) and do not provide a recycling / greenhouse option like others, something that\u0027s needed maintain the possibility of interplanetary mission duration with stock engines/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E/parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough. \u00A0Just making the distinction that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS doesn\u0027t perform anything like snacks. \u00A0And I would still disagree that it offers nothing more. \u00A0If Lifesupport = food in your mind then maybe, but the addtitional habitation requirements add an element of life support realism as well. \u00A0Shoving someone into a 1 seat capsule for a year isn\u0027t very realistic from a \u0022life support\u0022 point of view. \u00A0And even without MKS this adds interesting design challenges as you can\u0027t build a super compact vessel with no room to move around anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, most, if not all LS mods are based in reality. \u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0built \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS around NASA data so it isn\u0027t just some arbitrary numbers he came up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T19:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
