Typically, a spacecraft first initiates a\u00A0soft dock\u00A0by making contact and latching its docking connector with that of the target vehicle. Once the soft connection is secured, if both spacecraft are pressurized, they may proceed to a\u00A0hard dock\u00A0where the docking mechanisms air-tightly seal together, enabling interior hatches to be safely opened so that crew and cargo can be transferred.\u0022 ~\u00A0Wikipedia\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
