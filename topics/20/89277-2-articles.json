I\u0027ve used ModuleManager to move all tech from one node to another before, so one of the possibilities that came up chatting with Nathan is to have everything place its parts as per normal (batteries go in electronics or whatever), and then as a final pass we swap everything to where it needs to be. That means part authors and tree maintainers still use the labels they expect (from stock/CTT), but the end result is functionally identical to us having swapped the nodes about. This can include renaming the user visible elements, so it\u0027s indistinguishable from the users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could also swap the actual nodes using MM, but that feels a little more fraught with danger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, here\u0027s what part sweeping looks like (from RPL)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART\u003Cbr\u003E[*]:HAS[#TechRequired[actuators]]:Final\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    %TechRequired = OutCast\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our case, we\u0027d move A to TMP, B to A, and then TMP to B in order to swap A and B.

For example, using electrical energy as a resource: the first tech nodes rely on batteries which have substantial mass, so only shorter missions are possible, and the batteries get more efficient as you progress. Solar panels start out relatively heavy in order for the player to be able to trade spacecraft mass for energy production, and get lighter and more efficient later in the tech tree. Probes start out large and power-hungry, but as you progress they get smaller and more efficient. Science experiments can either return 100% science on transmission, or 0% on transmission and 100% on return to Kerbin/Earth; even without adding any new kinds of experiments, the existing ones can be made to work much better than currently. Launchpads start out being able to support smaller rockets and are upgradeable to launching bigger rockets. All of these things are pretty realistic in addition to improving the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think there should be two versions of this mod, one which focuses more on historical accuracy and one which focuses more on gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
