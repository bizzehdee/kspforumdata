Just finding out what explodes and what strands Jeb out past the Mun (answers: too many rockets and hitting space bar too soon).

I am reading a couple of Mission Logs and see things like SatMapping technology, which seems cool, and then something like MechJeb, which people seem to either love or hate. I\u0027d like to play the game as it was intended to be played (albeit changing through the constant updates) while also getting the best value for someone who isn\u0027t the most scientifically-inclined. The Plugin Essentials Pack seems to be a strong selling point, but again, I don\u0027t want to make it so easy that I just click buttons, as I enjoy learning that not attaching fuel lines and silver tanks makes orange tanks go KABOOM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on all of this?
