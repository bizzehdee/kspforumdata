Basically, Kerbals would use require food, water, and oxygen to survive, as with TAC-LS. Then make some kind of plugin that automatically converts other resources into those three. That way, Kerbals could still use Supplies as they would be converted into the needed resources on the fly. Supplies could then be seen as something like an emergency rations pack, providing all the needed supplies to support a kerbal for a length of time, but still allow segregation of the different resources for on the fly production reasons. There would also be a converter of some kind to convert a certain amount of food, water, and oxygen into Supplies. I have no idea if this is possible, or if it\u0027s a good idea.
