Not sure on the engine and that nuclear reactor, but might be from them, has the same style.\n\nNoticed some B9 parts in there (all the space planes are from B9 parts, a B9 body on the big ship, along with air brakes and RCS)\n\nSome hex truss: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86388-1-0-Speedy-s-Hex-Truss-System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86388-1-0-Speedy-s-Hex-Truss-System)\n\nRPM screen for IVA\n\nThere is a SCANSAT radar in there, but undeployed.\n\nHmm, the fuelcell might be custom too, I thought it was modular rocket, but that is different.\n\nNot recognizing the cylinders next to the KAS boxes. Nor the top of the small ship at the end...I guess I can\u0027t find anymore.
