Since JNSQ, other planet mods have picked up and featured a grain effect in their ringed planets\u0027 rings. But quite a few months have passed now and nothing has turned up that tries to bring substance to Kopernicus rings. There is one solution that can be done and that\u0027s simply to create an asteroid field that clips the ring, but it\u0027s far from impressive, and has no option for balancing abundance (when you want asteroids) and performance (when you don\u0027t want them-- when you\u0027re in every situation other than actively cruising through rings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here are my ideas (well, not entirely mine, or grown with input from others) for ring matter solutions, or for features that can be rolled together for one complex, feature rich solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003ELocalized Dense Debris\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main feature, with similarities to the stock asteroid spawner and the ground scatter loader. Here, when you approach a detailed ring, rocks of various sizes (and adjustable colors and resource configurations, see: Custom Asteroids mod) spawn. These rocks are basically parts and they have their own size class system, and size curves just like stock. However, they have their own physics range. They will load in (without physics) at 15km or further, but only have physics at the basic 150m roughly. They can and will be spawned with great density by default, and so, will have many orbits for KSP to track and will take a bite out of performance. However, they only persist until they leave their physics range or will persist permanently if you interact with them, just like when you go to the Tracking Station and start tracking an unknown object, making it a known asteroid. Once you\u0027re far enough from the field, they all despawn, except the ones you chose to keep, and KSP no longer carries their weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdeally, this spawner should be able to accept single parts and even craft files (mostly for the purpose of spawning multi-part asteroids that can break up if you happen to ram into them, but also for the secondary purpose of sneaking in alien artefacts or a new breed of magic boulder-- the parts for these would need to be hidden from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and R\u0026amp;D). Science-able ones would have their own unique experiment module in them and you could use these like usual-- a new opportunity for science gameplay.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003ESpace Dust\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(yes, this is a play on Nertea\u0027s mod) Kopernicus rings are basically 2D. Rings can be wide and tall/thick, not just wide and flat, which makes for the opportunity to add some meat to black hole accretion disks, proto-system dust disks, and settled planetary rings that are mostly pebbles and droplets (like, say, the rings of Jupiter and Uranus?). In comes basically the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E volumetric clouds effect, just for that feeling of stealth (or being blinded) while cruising through a dusty ring. The haze effect could partially be helped by a translucent square that\u0027s near to, and covers the camera to potentially reduce the need for particles when inside an especially volumetric ring. This would pair absolutely well with Nertea\u0027s mod and add wow factor to harvesting belts and rings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuminance/Emissive should also be available, which would add to the immersion of passing through a fiery disc around a black hole or proto-star.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EImpact Hazards\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis leads back to my complex\u00A0 idea for environmental hazards, titled \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/197829-structural-integrity-environment-wears-down-your-parts/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EStructural Integrity\u003C/a\u003E.
