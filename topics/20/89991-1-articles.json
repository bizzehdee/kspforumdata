When you drag them they move in wrong directions, rotate at some weird angle and snap (or not snap) incorrectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am seeking is a way to find a way to restrict the part movement when I drag them along any of X/Y/Z axes (or their combination) - for example - when I restrict the movement along Z-axis I could only drag in in the X/Y plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be also nice if I could set the pos manually (by typing in the coordinates of the part, ie: X:0.25, Y:0.15, Z:-6.2) and their angle of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to create such a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T12:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the improvements to the editor that are coming in 0.90 should help considerably but you may also find \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390-0-25-Part-Angle-Display-including-seamless-highly-accurate-rotation-v0-2-4-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPart Angle Display\u003C/a\u003E useful.
