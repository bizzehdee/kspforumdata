I like to keep it near stock, but extend it a little bit to make it more realistic(FAR) and/or immersive(EVE) or usefull stuff( like KAC, SCAN) but no big PartPacks(no B9, no Interstellar)(i tried them, didnt like the overload of parts in the VAB and the \u0022far away from stock\u0022-gameplay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about something to give extensive Surface missions more sense, but keeping it mostly stock, so i finally tried Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i was surprised how few parts are included, which i liked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E But i think its making the game way too easy for my taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the mining ability and refining and it only adds one new ressource so its simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i decided i will edit the configs of the Kethane parts, as soon as the updated 0.24 version is out. And when i\u0027m finished i think i will share the configs with everyone who\u0027s interested here in the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat i aim for:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei dont\u0027t want to be super-realistic with my game, but i want it to be somewhat believable and challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i don\u0027t aim Kethane to be Methane, that woul limit the possibilities pretty much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of Kethane as a all-soil-gas/liquid-mixery containig a lot of usefull stuffs from the soil in one Ressource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i want to achieve is, that it should be not possible/usefull/economic to design single ships, that they can refuel themselves so easy on every planet, but that it can be usefull to actively build a big Mining-base to refuel ships far away in the system. So Mining gets usefull if done on a bigger scale, so its an bigger achievement to build a working base, but if only one mission is planned a stock normal ship is always better than a self-mining-ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto achieve that i think refining speed has to be drastically reduced and power usage of refinery and drills drastically increased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou should have to run your base few ingame weeks before you have refined gazillions of fuel. And REAL refineries do need huge amounts of energy too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now for the efficiency. Pretending Liquid Fuel is some kind of Hydrogen, Kethane certanly contains Hydrogen(like Methane) which you can extract.But Hydrogen is a light Element compared to say Carbon so e.g. : 16 u Methane = 12 u Carbon \u002B 4 u Hydrogen , and other gases and liquids contain even less hydrogen so i think 1 Unit Kethane should refine to 0.2 Units of Liquid Fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s even less Oxygen in the Soil-Mixery (like in Water or Alcohol) so i thought of 1 Unit Kethane should refine to 0.01 Oxidiser (Oxygen is rare).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut big and long running Mining bases would still be creating lots of fuel if you dont refuel an orange tank every minute. And that would actually give a big long running base a purpose economically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntother thing i don\u0027t like is the Kethane Jet Engine. It can run wherever is an atmosphere, so its pretending it uses \u0027any\u0027 kind of gas. But you can\u0027t burn Soil-Gases(Kethane) with any gas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you could pretend you can burn any gas with enough oxygen so i thought about switching the use of Kethane to only Oxidiser. So Oxidiser in Tank \u002B Kintake-Air = Thrust. That could be more believable and also utilisizes all atmospheres. Do you have any other believable idea for that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think? Would you be interested in a more challenging and believable Kethane, but also have a Mining mechanism and a purpose for Bases other than RPG(unless you use Interstellar)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Umbrae","CreatedById":97131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T23:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat do you think?

I fully understand the point your trying to get to, but for my usage, I would not. I think the idea of a realistic mining an resource system would be nice, I think you will need to use more than one resource. You need a way to refine oxidizer too, even if it comes from a separate resource. Otherwise your are just going to end with refining stations with huge oxidizer stores instead of fuel stores. The huge power requirement, and time requirement I am all for but with time warp the amount of time that conversion takes is almost pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest you try and go full realism (multiple sources of fuel), and use fuel types from the real fuels mod. Add different soil refinement rates per biome... some with large amounts of oxidizer, some with more fuel, although both can be rather rare. The problem I see is right now, I think kethane fills the nitch that I think you are looking to be in, the simple resource non hard core people. What nitch is not filled is the hardcore realism style. And for part mods, just delete the parts you don\u0027t like. for example I like Nova Punch Engines, and tanks, but the farings and near everything else I delete. Many of the larger part mods are well organized so you can simply remove parts you would not use or do not want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is my opinion, I hope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T00:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane is pretty easy to modify and you can write custom cell generators for it. For instance, my old 23.5 install had Dres as a proper Ceres analog where you could mine regolith and convert it into plausible fuels under RealFuels. My only problem with it is that the timeframe and scale of an average KSP mining operation makes pretty much any minable resource effectively infinite (IMO, obviously), and you can\u0027t really set Kethane to be infinite. ORS handles it that way, though, so if you\u0027re looking for an alternative, check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T07:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRex94\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAntother thing i don\u0027t like is the Kethane Jet Engine.

Meaning, it produces pretty much all its thrust from shoveling whatever air/gas it finds, and hardly any from actually running its jet turbine. Said jet turbine is probably fueled by a bog standard LF/Oxidizer combustion, since kethane can be converted into both. It would just need a tiny internal converter handwaved into it that runs off of the electricity produced by the turbine. Yes yes, sketchy thermodynamics and all that jazz, but it is still consuming a resource while running. Also kethane is a highly abstracted approach anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn engine like that could run in any environment, but it would (simplified) produce no actual thrust unless it had some form of gas to shovel with its fan. Which is exactly how the kethane jet engine behaves in gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T07:46:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 07:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
