The extractor stops, and the \u0027Drill-O-Matic\u0027 Mining Extractor reads \u0022status: Resources Depleted\u0022. This is repeatable on at least two different asteroids. If I revert to the last quick save it happens again and again, but I\u0027ve actually seen the harvester work correctly three times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship has water (form MKS/OKS), xenon, and ore tanks. The ore tanks (250 units each) fill in that instant, the other tanks get nothing. The Community Resource Pack is adding the extra resources to the asteroid, but the drill is stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI though it might be a bug in either MKS or Stock, but that would affect everyone trying to mine an asteroid and lots of people would have noticed. I also though it might be accumulation of cruft in my installation, but I re-installed KSP and re-downloaded all my mods from CKAN and it persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone ever seen this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T01:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve moved this over to General Add-on Affairs, the spot for mod-related questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ididitthestupidway","CreatedById":153089,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T21:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same problem, and I have no mod installed, so it definitely happen in stock too.
