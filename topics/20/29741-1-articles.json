I saw it while back, but can\u0027t remember the name. It let you save parts of craft in VAB, then you could load it while building another. I remember it had purple-ish button with a puzzle piece. Can anybody tell me the name, please? Or any similar mods that have the same functionality. I need it so I can properly load payload to my freighter craft. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T12:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-saver-loader/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-saver-loader/\u003C/a\u003E its broken for .20 though\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere is a fix \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30696-0-20-Subassembly-Loader-0-20-Compatibility-Patch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nostur","CreatedById":10400,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T15:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh thank you very much!
