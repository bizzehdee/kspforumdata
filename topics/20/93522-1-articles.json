Then level2 you get 255 parts(I never even build a ship that big) and 140ton launches(do just about anything in kerbin SOI and a lot outside of it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust hoping at least these 4 buildings can have a bit more progression, from 30 parts to 60 and launchpad from 18t to 40 so you can have some comfortable mun/minmus missions, maybe send some small/light probes outside kerbin SOI but still need to upgrade for larger missions, space stations and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erest of the buildings feel fairly fine, science might need 1 or 2 more steps for surface samples and a step between 100 and 500 sceicne research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if its possible and how hard it would be, even when keeping current building models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T15:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad still has a tier 0 space center in development that just didn\u0027t make the cut for 0.90 quality-wise.

So once that makes it in, you get that extra step in the middle back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T21:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, it\u0027s all hardcoded. :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mudkest","CreatedById":115812,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T10:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eshame it cant be modded \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E thanks for reply you 2, nice to know, nice to know it will get \u0022fixed\u0022 with next update if all goes as planned\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this still something that can\u0027t be modded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T22:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one has responded, so I will take that as a no.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T22:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121100\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121100\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
