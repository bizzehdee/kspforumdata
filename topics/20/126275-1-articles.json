However, BDA\u0026#39;s author limits the loading of landed vessels to ~11km being beyond that the ground colliders get a bit lax. However you are right about Krakensbane because going 750m/s (or was it 850m/s?) and loading a landed vessel is a great means of making a land torpedo. AFAIK distant loading of vessels in orbit seems to be fine.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T20:41:13Z","Content":"\nYou may get more useful ideas from the cloud if you tell us a bit more about what you want to do with these giant parts?

The best I can say is that the only way this would be possible is if it only acted like a space elevator (allowing resupply and whatnot) but was merely a normal station in keo-stationary orbit with a special part or two. However the limits of KSP would prevent the cable from being a tangible object, and wouldn\u0026#39;t really support the existence of an actual elevator either.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T18:39:51Z","Content":"\nThe physics range exists for a reason.
