But, I\u0027ve always felt that they were a little lacking some \u0022prettiness\u0022 factor. Now, I know SPs come in all shapes and sizes and shades of blue and grey. Some are highly reflective (practically mirror like) some are not so reflective. Inspired by Yogui87\u0027s solar panels, want to create a compendium of optional graphics for solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexturing a 2D image is a cakewalk, for most.
