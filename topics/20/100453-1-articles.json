Since we already have Procedural tanks, wings, etc. I think capsules should be included in that procedural mess. Similar to Procedural Parts, the crew capacity should be measured by volume, multiple textures should be possible and a few shapes should be allowed.\n\nWhy? Because when you\u0027re trying to build (for example) Soyuz, Vostok and Buran designs, it\u0027s very hard to get circles, kind-of-cockpits-but-actually-not, etc. right. Also, it would save a ton of memory.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about it."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T13:49:56Z","Content":"What about IVA?"},{"CreatedByName":"O Nerd","CreatedById":90266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:47:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What about IVA?\n\nI have no idea.

Do you mean the number of modules, IVA, stylization?\n\n**zxczxcbfg**, I\u0027ll list my replies one by one.\n\n*No! Bad idea! Acceleration, remember!* - Hm... I have a funny idea for that. Depending on the tech level, when kerbals were subjected to acceleration (any form), they could be thrown on the ground while one kerbal sits on a chair and controls the craft (low level), be holding onto something (mid level) or all sitting in chairs (high level). But I think that would take a lot of programming skills, and i think that it would be very hard to do. Also, it was just an idea.\n\n*I just think we need more \u0022regular\u0022 capsules.* - I agree on that.\n\n*Crew capacity wouldn\u0027t scale linearly.* - I think that a developer of this mod (in theory) could just round down the number of kerbals. For an example, an capsule can hold 4,759 kerbals. The dev would round it down to 4, so that one kerbal doesn\u0027t lay down on an edge of the cabin (lol).\n\n*the weight would go up much faster than the diameter (square-cube laws, heh)* - Of course.\n\n*any integrated ladders would have to scale as well* - Don\u0027t forget that Kerbals don\u0027t scale. But you could also use TweakScale for that.\n\n*any hatches would specifically have to not scale* - The hatch could be a part, so that when a Kerbal does an EVA, the mod would search for the closest hatch and put him there. Or we could have giant hatches.\n\n*the RCS capacity and internal batteries would be hard to scale accurately if the crew capacity changes (more space for Kerbals means less space for anything else)* I think that if you have \u003E6 crew members, you are probably going to put batteries, RCS, etc. somewhere else.\n\n*reaction wheel strength would have to scale nonlinearly (due to the aforementioned square-cube laws)* Well, same answer of the previous objection.\n\nI think that sums it up. Let\u0027s keep discussing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T16:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by O Nerd**"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T08:24:10Z","Content":"Sounds hard, but it could be done in theory, I\u0027d think it would be cool, even if a few more normal capsules would be good too, maybe a few more inline 1m(and at least 1 2m?) spaceplane cockpits?"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T10:50:41Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see this working for command modules, but it wouldn\u0027t be too unreasonable to make a stretchable passenger compartment.
