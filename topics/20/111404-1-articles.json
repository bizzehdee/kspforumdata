A reminder: if you see a thread you think is in the wrong location, hit the report button rather than posting about it in the thread.\n\nDeadpan110 is right that you not only need an equipped tool, but also left-click while holding the X key. If you have other questions, you can post them here in General Add-on Affairs, or in the KIS thread. There\u0027s also a manual in the game as a part. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
