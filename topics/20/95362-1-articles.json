They produce the worst chemical ever when burnt, and to keep all the propellants there liquid, you have to have hugely complicated tank design. Not to mention the fact that liquid lithium is essentially a molten metal that will screw up all the electronics. There is an advantage, however. On paper at least, a Tripropellant rocket gets an Isp of 540 seconds.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot just on paper - an actual ground test got 542 seconds Isp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HF in the exhaust is indeed an issue on the ground, but wouldn\u0027t matter much for use in space.

The kind of tri-propellant rocket I was talking about was one that burns liquid fuel, oxidiser and oxygen from the atmosphere all at once (yes they are all propellants), or that uses intake air as working mass to increase thrust and efficiency as mentioned by Red Iron Crown (but doesn\u0027t burn it).\u003Cp\u003EThe idea would be that the first can use only oxygen atmospheres (Kerbin/Laythe) and the second any atmosphere. I reckon that the ability to increase your efficiency in a non-burnable atmosphere would be a hugely cool thing in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I\u0027m getting off topic though because the main question was whether such an engine would be redundant in burnable atmo because we already have jets and RAPIER that we can stick on launchers etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I already set rapiers to closed cycle then I get low on air, typically at 35 km and 1800 m/s, this takes me too 2200 m/s with the same benefit, downside is that this reqire 3 or more engines\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T09:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen there\u0027s what the OP is referring to, an engine that makes use of both external air and onboard oxidizer. There\u0027s all sorts of ideas on this front; we have the SABRE-alike in the game already, but there are air augmented rockets that would use air and oxidizer at the same time, nuclear thermal jets (which KSPI has I believe), and more. More choice of engines like this are always welcome. In particular there\u0027s still a hole in the stock game for an engine for Eve, Duna, and Jool planes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI\u0027ve been fascinated by the idea of a turbine engine for use in non-oxygen atmospheres.
