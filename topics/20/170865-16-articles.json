I can understand why a mod creator might be unhappy when someone creates something meant to alter their mod (like a 64-bit unlocker), but I don\u0027t see why a hosting site should do anything about it. The same goes for someone releasing a fork of a non-restrictively licensed mod (which also doesn\u0027t seem like something that is very likely to happen); I guess some measures could be taken to clarify that the fork is not the same as the original and may not be supported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T00:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222423450\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456101746\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257416\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, DMagic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would any of this be a problem, or something for SpaceDock to handle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m mainly concerned that (to my knowledge) Spacedock doesn\u0027t have a content-reviewing system beyond virus-scanning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example of undesirable content that not even the original Kerbal Spaceport handled properly is dummy or placeholder uploads - a user once uploaded to Spaceport what he claimed to be a multiplayer plugin, but the zip file turned out to be a \u0022Hello World\u0022 .bat file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I don\u0027t plan on using Spacedock, but at the very least, I want to help you guys C.Y.A. when it comes to potential problems now, rather than dealing with them belatedly as they occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T01:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with trying to moderate the contents in some way is that beyond the actively malicious (viri and such), it\u0027s hard to tell the difference between a mod that is doing something wanted and one that isn\u0027t - \u0027actively interfering\u0027 for instance could apply to the UKS suite of mods with regards to Extraplanetary Launchpads: The UKS mods redefine the build materials and disable all but a couple of the EL parts.\u00A0 But that\u0027s as designed, and they are intended to work together.\u00A0 Or you get the various Kopernicus mods that add extra planets - at what point does the fact that they don\u0027t play well together become \u0027actively interfering\u0027?\u00A0 Does it really matter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar applies to placeholders - Some big, popular mods appear to have started with one or two parts.\u00A0 Would you have dumped them at the beginning because they didn\u0027t do what they were planning yet?\u00A0 How long do they have to \u0027get where they are going\u0027?\u00A0 (And if they develop in a different way than the developer intended, is that a problem?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in favor of the \u003Cem\u003Ecaveat emptor\u003C/em\u003E approach, in general: SpaceDock can certify that this won\u0027t be a virus, or try to destroy your computer.\u00A0 What it does to your game is up to you to research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Table","CreatedById":158269,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T01:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222421722\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456022781\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154544\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ouyin2000\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, ouyin2000 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t say you\u0027re an idiot.
