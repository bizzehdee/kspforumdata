I just don\u0027t see a lot of difference in ending up ten or fifty kilometers away with mj or doing it by my own guesstimation, if I\u0027m 200 or 20 kilometers away I\u0027ll need to adjust my orbit anyway to get closer so it makes no difference. I\u0027ve had mechjeb launch to rendezvous and ended up over seventy kilometers to target so it\u0027s not exactly precise either. Well okay I\u0027ll need to wait with timewarp on a few more orbits to catch up the longer distance but that has no implication, no more fuel is used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torminator","CreatedById":78617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T11:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to keep in mind, is LtR needs to know your rocket\u0027s launch phase angle.
