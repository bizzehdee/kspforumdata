While I do have Mechjeb downloaded I only used it to learn how to setup for planet changes (now I just protractor you help line up the planets and do the nodes by hand). After smashing my lander into the tug too many times to count I decided to put Mechjeb on both and see if maybe there was an error, and there was.... me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings up my dilemma; while I dislike using a mod to do things for me I feel this is not as big of a deal as setting up and flying to a moon or planet and letting it land for you.

My main issue with docking is trying to find a camera angle that is good, but having a X,Y,Z to worry about it is a bit harder to do than say backing up a trailer. I did learn to set focus on the port and control from the port of the vessel you are driving, but even then I am seeming off either too high or off to one of the side while the pink node says I am on target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to recall if Apollo used a autopilot for the docking of the lander to the Lm and the command module, if so then my reasoning is justified and dilemma averted.

If you\u0027re not good at something then it\u0027ll come with practice, and chances are that if you spend time doing something else you\u0027ll come back and be more successful at docking because you won\u0027t be quite so impatient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, one question: Are you using chase cam? If you\u0027re not, then it saves a lot of mind-ache because the RCS keybinds line up with reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do understand the camera angles problem, even if you are in chase cam; it can sometimes look like a craft is going to dock perfectly but is actually 2m away from where it should be. The only solution I\u0027ve ever come up with for this is to deal with each dimension one at a time, or rather 2 of the dimensions because if you can keep the craft a constant distance from the docking port it saves messing with forward/backward until the end. Targeting docking ports as you have done helps out immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, if you want to use a mod for the time being, go for it. In fact nobody can ever put you down for using a mod because it\u0027s your game and you can do what you like with it. You can come back and master docking at a later date when you feel like trying again, and in the meantime make use of MechJeb for missions which require docking to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T19:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-22-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-2-2-Updated-10-27-13%29?highlight=docking\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator\u003C/a\u003E mod or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERomfarers docking cam\u003C/a\u003E mods.
