The most extreme form of this is where a player loads a heavy vehicle, and the launch site is destroyed immediately, without giving the player a chance to launch. However, I also suspect (but have not confirmed) that landing on the runway may also cause it to explode. The only stock workaround is to make all buildings indestructible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI request that somebody make a mod that addresses this problem in one of two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAllows destructibility to be toggled independently for different buildings.

This would be much harder to calibrate, but if properly done would allow launchpads/runways to survive normal use while still being destroyed by debris that falls on them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T23:25:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T16:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the launchpad is supposed to be easy to destroy given the abuse it receives from engines, and stabilizers are generally enough to ease that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for very large ships, where you may be forced to reduce part count for the sake of CPU, having to use a lot of stabilizers probably doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, not a bad idea for a mod....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T23:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that was fast: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97957\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97957\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
