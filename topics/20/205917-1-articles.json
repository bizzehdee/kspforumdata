For years, one of the mods I used would cut my time warp whenever I pressed \u0022x\u0022 to cut throttle. I fell into the habit of always using \u0022x\u0022 to stop warping, whether engines were firing or not. It was just faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I\u0027m back after a long time away, I can\u0027t figure out which mod that was. I went through an old Gamedata folder looking up every mod, but this was apparently a minor side-effect rather than an advertised feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody know which mod that was? Or another way to accomplish the same thing? I\u0027ve used \u0022x\u0022 to cut time warp for so long it\u0027s become a conditioned reflex. Every time I have to stop warping now, I lose a couple of seconds from finger-confusion. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-10T01:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an option in the stock settings (Input \u2192 Game) to choose keys for Stop Time Warp.
