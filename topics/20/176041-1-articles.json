My problem is that when I open up the menu and KSP started running as slow as a single NERV attempting to de-orbit the Mun. But, I sat through the bone-crushing 15 minutes it took me to get to my save, load a basic rover, and realize THERE WERE CLOUDS!!! All of the planets looked pretty when I went into the map. Dres still looked boring as ever, but that\u2019s normal. I wanna keep the fluffy clouds and the realistic water, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: I saw an image where laythe looked super pretty, it was this aqua blue colour and you can see the clouds from orbit.

It can all be done in game through the menus but it is not easy to find the parameters. You may ask for help on the forums. I use SciFi graphics for now that is for potato\u0027s pc.

It WILL take longer, but 15 minutes is a lot. Maybe try upgrading a bit your RAM, or if you don\u0027t have a solid state disk, then maybe try using a usb to launch the game or even to use it as RAM (windows has that option in the last versions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-20T13:13:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2018 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Agustin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
