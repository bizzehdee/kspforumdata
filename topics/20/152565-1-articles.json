Along with this, the base pieces, which to my knowledge, should be less difficult to also add in, but would be equally appreciated. Same goes for the Cyclops, Seamoth, and Exosuit. Now, I would absolutely LOVE to work on this idea myself, but I never got time to delve into coding, so, if anyone DOES know how to code, and would be willing to teach me, I am all ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T09:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would require little to no coding to start off with. It\u0027s all modeling and texturing work, unless you want to give something a functionality that cannot be achieved with stock KSP partmodules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
