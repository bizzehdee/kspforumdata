I love both B9 Aerospace AND KW rocketry, but I cannot seem to run them along-side of each other without frequent RAM crashes. So, that\u0027s your first decision, as they are large packs. B9 might not play well with other packs, but I\u0027ve gotten KW to run alongside several other mods. I don\u0027t mess with mods that don\u0027t provide a part I will use frequently. I also will NOT sacrifice and install PART of a mod. It\u0027s all or nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s what I run on my current install...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KW Rocketry. (This is the absolute staple of my space program, everything else takes on a lower priority for this to run.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RLA Stockalike pack, Electric Engines pack, and Power Generation pack. (Provides a nice selection of additional ion engines, as well as a complete .625m set of fuel tanks and engines, plus some other bits I\u0027ve found very useful for making tiny craft, or increasing the efficiency of my operations. I liken this to a sort of newer version of KSPX, since KSPX has had most of its vital parts more or less integrated to stock.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Near Future Propulsion pack. (Introduces several more engines that run on Xenon, or one of two new resources: Argon and Hydrogen. They are rage-inducing to provide power for, but Nertea has implemented some interesting solutions to the problem of the power hungry engines. They\u0027re relatively balanced, and reasonably not bugged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-FusTek Karmony station modules. (It\u0027s a pack of station modules and it comes with a pretty useful large static solar panel.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-FusTek Expansion pack. (More, varied station modules that are based on the FusTek style and (I believe) use the same textures, so this doesn\u0027t use a TON of RAM, to my knowledge. Also includes a common berthing mechanism that\u0027s based on Fusty\u0027s old one, but behaves much better. Think of it as a super-rigid docking port. There\u0027s not many IVA\u0027s yet as they are a WIP, but that\u0027s okay because the basic functionality is there. Not sure if my install will be able to handle the added RAM usage from the IVAs when implemented, so we\u0027ll see.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kommit Nucleonics. (A small pack of a few nuke engines and a larger toroidal fuel tank. Expands upon the nuke engine and gives several new options for a low-thrust, comparatively high efficiency LF/O fueled engine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Attachment System. (While not quite as complete as I might like it to be, it\u0027s quite a good mod and adds a whole lot of functionality that I think is necessary to have.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-PWings. (Procedural Wings, make wings of any size or shape you need! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Crew Manifest. (Move Kerbals between modules without EVA, do a bit of other cool stuff. Plugin only, no part associated with it so it\u0027s low RAM usage. I have a lot of little plugin-based things that really add a lot of good stuff to the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Engineer Redux. (Yes, it has a few parts, but it\u0027s useful to me in the editor to see how a craft might perform on another world. A useful build aid, I might say.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KerbCam. (A camera pathing tool that a lot of video makers use. I\u0027ve not yet used it to create anything meaningful, but it\u0027s there and takes up almost no memory space since there are no parts to associate with, so it\u0027s like \u0022Why not?\u0022 Mostly a result of my half-baked ideas to make Youtube videos.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SelectRoot. (It lets you select the root part of a vessel to something new without manually rebuilding the whole craft. Another useful little plugin, and REALLY useful since the new subassembly feature has been implemented.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Editor Extensions. (Adds a few cool things to the editor that really should be in the stock game, but meh. I don\u0027t know if this is even updated anymore, as the version I\u0027m running has a plugin in the legacy \u0022Plugins\u0022 folder in the root KSP directory. It\u0027s the only /old/ mod I\u0027m running. Also, if someone ever tells you that the legacy folder structure doesn\u0027t work, they\u0027re lying. It\u0027s in there and it still works, though it\u0027s largely unused. Butttt.. If you try to load up an old mod from way back when, it might actually work. Maybe.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improved Maneuver Nodes. (Helps with maneuver nodes and lets you change your conics patch mode on-the-fly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improved NavBall. (Makes markers ghost on the edges so you always know where to turn for retro/prograde, and adds normal/radial \u002B/- markers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NovaSilisko\u0027s Audio Muffler Plugin. (It\u0027s a simple plugin that filters out sound, making it more muffled as you approach vacuum. In vacuum, sounds are much different with this, though it affects all the audio channels in the game, so it also muffles the music in-game. Rocket engines are a low rumble, decouplers sound like a distant TNT explosion, explosions sound more like a loud thud, and some of the engines in the Near Future pack sound like a low droning sound.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MechJeb 2.1. (Use it if you want. It\u0027s really not that bad. I don\u0027t use it for all the automated features, but the Smart ASS, Translatotron, and the Utilities window, as well as the simple, sparse, yet informative in-editor and in-flight Delta-V/Vessel Info are staples to all but the simplest flights. Since I use a lot of low-thrust ion engines, my burn times take forever. Smart ASS is very helpful to keep the craft pointed prograde precisely through the burns, and the Translatotron is extremely useful for hovering landers. I still fly all my launches to orbit manually, and do mostly manual landings, but some of these tools are indispensible, especially for testing/debugging of craft. Don\u0027t let other people\u0027s opinions influence your decision on whether or not to use MechJeb, it\u0027s a tool, not a crutch, and it\u0027s very useful. That\u0027s the objective truth.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also currently following development of two new small part mods, and am considering adding them...
