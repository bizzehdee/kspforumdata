Will increasing this value speed up the light turning on or slow it down instead? I can\u0027t tell from my outsider\u0027s perspective on configs and modules whether the relationship is directly proportional or inversely proportional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T18:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with many things in KSP, unless someone knows the answer and answers your question (not me alas) you\u0027ll just have to test...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T18:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would only assume it is how fast the light turns on. The module plays the unity animation which animates a light object on the model that actually produces the light. They also can use an emissive texture for the bulb and animate both with the module. The dim speed is how fast the light fades to off I would assume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest it and see for yourself.
