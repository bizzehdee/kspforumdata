Parts for the heatshields (and fuel tanks, RCS tanks, SRBs, structural pieces, nose cones, etc etc etc...). Procedural Fairings gives the most dynamic and easiest to use fairing system in KSP, in my opinion. Procedural Wings has stockalike wings in the form of the new Mk2 style, as well as B9 and \u0027old stock\u0027 style as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for science parts, DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science is my go-to pack for that.

The parts are incredibly well done, and the science texts you get when you run the experiments is very well written.
