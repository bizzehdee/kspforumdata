When playing with a keyboard it\u0027s hard to keep g-force to sane levels at high speeds in maneuvarable planes, and it tends to end in explosions at really high speeds, and even when it doesn\u0027t I always feel bad for the poor kerbals getting squished into little green pancakes at 25g. If you try and turn slower it can be really jerky, and if you reduce the maneuverability of the plane you lose low speed turning ability. If you could set a g-limit of say, 9g (which seems to be the standard for modern jet fighters), then you could yank and bank as much as you like without worrying about breaking your plane or kerbals. This wouldn\u0027t be at all unrealistic since a lot of aircraft in real life have them, and would ideally be a thing you can quickly turn off if you need to do any particularly high-g maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T23:39:00Z","Content":"\nThere is one mod that makes you black out if you pull too much G\u0026#39;s.

That could be a new feature to implement if noone has done that yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBlueCanary, if your major goal is to control your G loads, you could try Analog Control mod [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116888\u0022]from here[/URL]. It lets you use your mouse to carefully control your aircraft thus dosing G forces precisely. Once I installed it I forgot flying with keyboard as a nightmare.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:48:45Z","Content":"\ncheck my signature\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:51:51Z","Content":"\nYes, this mod Exists!\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138332-PLUGIN-AtmosphereAutopilot-1-1-%28Fly-By-Wire%29[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe UI is kinda raw around the edges because the mod is new, but it is invalueble to flying bigger spaceplanes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy default, the Plugin will limit your AoA to 15 and your G\u0026#39;s to 10.
