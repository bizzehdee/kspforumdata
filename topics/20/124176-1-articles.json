And to do this, I\u0027ve been using the B9 HL parts because they look better and give me that classic heat shield under belly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what I\u0027ve found is that depending on my reentry trajectory (Be it higher, or lower, short or long, etc etc) sometimes what I have in the cargo bay will explode. Thus far I haven\u0027t actually brought anything down yet, but my docking and airlock apparatus (built with CX\u0027s space station bits, which obviously aren\u0027t meant to survive unshielded reentry) is exploding. Now, while I can reenter in such ways that it doesn\u0027t explode, it still kind of defeats the point as then I\u0027ll be doing extra maneuvers to get into position for the right reentry just to avoid something that shouldn\u0027t be happening anyway. And it definitely doesn\u0027t make sense seeing as the rest of the vehicle isn\u0027t even affected when everything in the cargo bay starts exploding and rattling around. (which is awesome, but still) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is, what is there that I can do to fix this? Once the game loads back up for me I\u0027m going to try unclipping the docking apparatus (I had clipped it into the cockpit for looks, but I think that might be why the cargo bay isn\u0027t working, as it not all of the apparatus is actually in the cargo bay) and see if it works better, but if it doesn\u0027t, is there something in the cargo bay cfg I can change or fix to make this work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using FAR but not DR or Real Heat. I do realize that B9 isn\u0027t fully updated for 1.04, but I also can\u0027t imagine that a fix for this would be so involved that I\u0027d be better off waiting for an official update. It seems to just be the HL parts that are problematic, as I made a smaller shuttle type craft using the S2 parts and had even more parts clipped in the S2 cargo bay/cockpit and that craft works perfectly no matter what kind of reentry I do (aside from anything stronger than a Mun reentry anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
