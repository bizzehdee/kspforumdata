However, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a single massive bug standing between me and a releasable version of the mod. \n\n Every time I launch a vehicle, it explodes. \n\nThe ships seem to be appearing inside the sun, and the game says the vehicle was destroyed by overheating. \n\n If I try to revert to launch, the vehicle turns itself into an asteroid. \n\n If I revert to vehicle assembly, and launch again, everything works fine. \n\n This bug has me utterly baffled. Any suggestions?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T06:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 06:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dunrana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunrana","CreatedById":138830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:28:03Z","Content":"I found the cause of the bug myself.
