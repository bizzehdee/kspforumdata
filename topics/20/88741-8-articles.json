My suggestion is that even if the \u0022mod\u0022 is just one tree.cfg file, it should be in its own directory, and either be co-bundled with TM, or have big ole\u0027 warning text that TM is a prerequisite. Personally, I\u0027d go with co-bundling it (if the license allows, I haven\u0027t read the license). This would be akin to the co-bundling of MM and Firespitter that so many mods do. TM and CTT are relatively small mods, so byte-bloat isn\u0027t really an issue. Version checking in TM would solve overwrite issues with that. That leaves two issues: CTT overwriting \u0026amp; CTT usage checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECTT Overwriting: I\u0027m not sure we can prevent overwrites, unless the file is also named with the version number, in which case the user has to be sure to choose the correct version. Or if TM incorporates a way to do versioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECTT Usage Checking: This is the tough part. How do we check that the user is actually using the CTT? How can we communicate that back to MM? Assuming use case #1, the additional MM patches should only be applied if CTT is the \u003Cem\u003Eactive\u003C/em\u003E tree, not just if it\u0027s installed. I don\u0027t know what could be done with a simple plugin that checked which tech tree is being used, and unloaded itself if it\u0027s not being used (allowing :needs[CTT]), or some other method for toggling MM processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill there still be problems?
