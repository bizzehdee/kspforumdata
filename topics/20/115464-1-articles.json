There were pen recorders for some instruments, but when Chuck Yeager, in the movie \u0022The Right Stuff\u0022 is reading out the speed, it\u0027s not to dramatise it for a cinema audience. He\u0027s telling an engineer something that might be useful, via the radio, if he doesn\u0027t come back.\n\nIn the tradition of Chuck Yeager and \u0022Winkle\u0022 Brown, we can write things down as we fly, but it would be nice to have a few tools to help us record things. Speed and altitude, for instance, maybe plotted on a graph.\n\nThis might be something that could usefully go down the path of a connection to a browser. I don\u0027t have enough RAM for that, but if an HTTP connection can feed the data on speed, altitude, attitude, and time to an external program it could bypass a few problems for somebody wanting to log flight data."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T08:05:55Z","Content":"Looks like you might want [Telemachus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594). ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T10:37:18Z","Content":"kerbalEDU"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:25:00Z","Content":"[Graphogtron](http://www.kerbaltek.com/graphotron) by kerbaltek"}]}
