In particular, in the following scenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd-on X ships with plugin x.dll (under Gamedata\\X\\Plugins\\x.dll). Author of X later updates the plugin but the player doesn\u0027t notice or update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer then downloads add-on Y, which relies on the plugin from X, and bundles it with the latest version of the plugin. The game now has:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex.dll v1 under Gamedata\\X\\Plugins\\x.dll\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex.dll v2 under Gamedata\\Y\\Plugins\\x.dll\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does KSP load the plugin(s) under that version? What happens when parts from either invoke properties that are defined differently in each version? And what is the recommended best practice for curating the plugins folders? Should both X and Y bundle as above, or should Y bundle x.dll under a X hierarchy, even if nothing else from X is present than the plugin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghost010","CreatedById":57302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T17:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is something that has been bugging me sins start of using ksp(18) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy dont the moders just let you DL the dll apart from the mod pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis saves allot of trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this probblems with couple of mods.dling bobcats home firts(new dll) than dling the mk4(old dll) and overwrite it(i always over write).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always had to keep a log on what to install the last.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
