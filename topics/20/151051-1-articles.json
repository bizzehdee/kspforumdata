However, there\u0027s only a state for the angle of it being opened, and not any control of it being closed for the angle. I\u0027m wanting this so that I could have multiple cargo bays configured in a way so that I could store more than the first one originally could. Is this possible at all to\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Econfigure both the closed and open state\u0027s angle?\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
