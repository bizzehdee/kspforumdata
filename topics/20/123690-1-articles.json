These mods in particular would, I think, be really beneficial to have in an RPM IVA (Both in terms of Gameplay and Immersion) and if combined with ProbeControlRoom it\u0027d be even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without further ado:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Manifest (Basic crew, science, and fuel transfers are something really missing in IVAs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech2 (The Flight Computer would be amazing to have in IVA as an alternative to MechJeb\u0027s Autopilot functions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer (Basic volume controls, possibly disguised in an immersive way as communications controls)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVOID/Kerbal Engineer (Much of what these two provide in-flight is already provided in one way or another, but some of the options more specific to these two would be useful info screens to have)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor and Precise Node (I think it\u0027ll still require a hop to map view for nodes, but a way to go from launch to splashdown and literally never leave IVA or otherwise break the immersion of it would be amazing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories (Not sure how hard it would be to implement this into the Orbit views, but it would be nice to have some trajectories plotted in IVA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECactEye and Tarsier Space Tech (Meant more for PCR gameplay, it\u0027d be cool when in the control room to be able to control the telescopes in this mod via RPM)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
