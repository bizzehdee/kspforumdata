I\u0027m interested in REMOVING planets. I use different \u00A0builds of KSP for different types of craft, and i got to thinking, in my aircraft build, i never use the other planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs\u00A0there a way to remove planets/asteroids/etc, basically everything BUT Kerbin and Sol? deleting stuff/and or mods basically any way of accomplishing this short of getting into unity, or writing some type of patch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I were able to do so, would there be any noticeable or even measurable\u00A0gain in performance due \u00A0to running\u00A0\u00A0a less populated\u00A0environment? (not sure if that\u0027s even how that works lol) \u00A0i have a big kid PC,\u00A0but also frequently run ksp on a MacBook, so every little bit helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gotmachine","CreatedById":163039,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-06T15:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

I doubt it\u2019ll make much of a difference to performance though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KlunkWorks","CreatedById":227815,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-10T17:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! yea i\u0027m not expecting much. I\u0027m probably a little on the obsessive side with some things. I use a build of KSP where i\u0027ve removed everything that i can from the files - parts, sounds, fx etc and the game still load lol. No Squad parts, nothing, just whatever is currently being tested. It loads up on a 2015 MacBook pro in under 15 seconds lol. \u00A0It\u0027s been a curiosity over the years as to how much can one actually remove and still have a playable game lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
