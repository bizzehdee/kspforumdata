I load the game, and the progress bar freezes halfway-ish on a mod. So, i exit, and delete the mod since it won\u0027t load. Then I reinstall the same mod. I load the game, the progress bar freezes halfway, with a different mod. First Kerbal Engineer Redux, then TAC life support, then stretchy tanks. I continued doing what i did. If i wait a while when the bar stops moving, the screen that normally has a picture goes away and turns black. Could it be actually loading, but the progress bar just doesn\u0027t work?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what to do.

I get the same screen and it does load slowly, but then again I probably shouldn\u0027t be running 20\u002B mods on a 4 year old laptop that sounds like the Kraken whenever I open a browser.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
