There is no modifying of Squad\u0027s code going on. In fact, that would be against the EULA. People are creating 100% original code and adding it to the game. Yes, some may take vanilla parts and modify them, but anything beyond that is adding not modifying. It\u0027s these works that are 100% original that would be the focus of making money as you wouldn\u0027t have license to sell modified vanilla parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T19:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see your point Captain, but I\u0027m not clear about the specifics. It seems to me that even if you are writing all the code yourself, but the product still wouldn\u0027t run without being part of someone else\u0027s software, then you owe something to the originators of the parent software. For example, you couldn\u0027t take a KSP mod and run it as a self-contained game, nor insert it into World of Warcraft and have robotic spaceships fighting orcs. The resulting product may have been indepedently produced, but still requires and profits from the work the guys at Squad put into the original software, so wouldn\u0027t they have a right to compensation?

Lots of companies make parts for cars that can be considered addon and/or mods, but the car manufacturers see no income from these products.

Is that correct? Perhaps if Squad gave the incintive of adding certain mods to future vanilla versions of the game, and possibly paying the modders for their work, that might stimulate a lot of very high quality works. You could very well expand your team pretty easily this way. As an indie game fan, I love the idea of a game created by a massive community of modders.
