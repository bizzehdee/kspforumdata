If you\u0027re running on Mac, you don\u0027t have 64-bit, so it\u0027s required. If you\u0027re running on Windows, it depends whether you care about the various 64-bit-specific bugs (if you do, you might want to still use 32-bit, which is more stable, and then ATM matters). If you are running a TON of mods on Windows with the 64-bit client and have not a ton more than 4 GB free (given that other programs and background processes can take up a fair chunk of RAM themselves, meaning that KSP brings you down to minimal free memory) you\u0027ll still want it -- minimizing RAM usage then is still a good thing. If you have 16 GB RAM and 12 GB free before launching KSP, probably not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T19:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
