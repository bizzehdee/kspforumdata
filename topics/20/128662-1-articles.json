Or is there a mod?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf there isn\u0027t a mod wich mods do you guys recommend to get some new planets? I know the outer planets mod, but I already installed that one :P, ohh and I love the outer planets mod. But for me there is a saying less is more, for me less is less en more is more so actually I\u0027d like to get some extra planets or solar systems.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks guys!!\u003Cbr\u003E\nBTW I\u0027m new here so if I\u0027m doing something wrong please tell me \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T13:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a bunch of mods here on the forums that add new planets or rearrange the Planets in various ways.
