I\u0027m really into building large/heavy VTOL type vehicles and I want them to be controlled by RCS without having to add 10 or 20 thrusters just to make them responsive. I need to keep the part count down and uprating these thrusters is the best solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to edit the part, or can someone recommend another way to achieve this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T19:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d keep the original RCS files and make a copy in which you can edit the config file; the thrust value is probably in there much like other engines, but I\u0027ve never actually poked around the files for the RCS thrusters, so don\u0027t hold me to it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fiddlestyx","CreatedById":57329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T19:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think in the part file you change \u0022thrusterPower = 1\u0022 to \u0022thrusterPower = 10\u0022.
