That 3rd party would then have their own timer to make the fixes before another 3rd party could attempt it.

I think it can be done with old .bat text editing commands. Then it would just be a matter of adding all else via MM config. Granted though, my school of thought on this has changed somewhat to a more Darwinist perspective. If something is no longer viable, a new mod-maker can basically re-make it (but better), especially while this game is still undergoing relatively rapid changes.
