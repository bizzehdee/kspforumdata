Just with names would be ok. May be a premade list?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T20:04:59Z","Content":"Can you give an example of how you would use it? A bare part lying on the ground probably isn\u0027t terribly useful. You\u0027d have to connect it to your ship via KAS I guess.\n\nI believe KAS generates Part objects in-flight when you take a part out of a container, so it should be possible. Designing an interface to choose the part might be difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"Locob","CreatedById":51811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T20:26:27Z","Content":"Yes.
