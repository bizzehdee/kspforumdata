I want a mod to make the surface tests actually useful. \n\nAs in \u0022 Perform stress test on mk1 capsule\u0022 and the reward would increase the crash tolerance from 6.0m/s to 7.0m/s. Or \n\n\u0022Run test on fully loaded solid fuel booster while on the surface.\u0022 and the reward would reduce the chance of breakage. \n\ni feel this would give us a reason to actually test objects on the ground before launching.\n\ni am looking for a modder willing to take up the challenge. i would do this, but i have no modding experience.\n\nThanks y\u0027all."},{"CreatedByName":"C1maCat","CreatedById":121247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T03:33:52Z","Content":"I would love this.
