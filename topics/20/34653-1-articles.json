Seems odd that they\u0027d just get stuck like that.

When I have the fairing ejection and the fairing base ejection in the same stage, it seems the fairing base ejects first, and the fairings don\u0027t get the command. When I put the fairings in a stage before the fairing base, they ejected, then I could eject my payload from the fairing base. It\u0027s honestly very strange. I thought they\u0027d all decouple fine in a single stage, as I\u0027ve never had this issue before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
