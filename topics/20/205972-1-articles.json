In reality the star, if real, was probably a conjunction between Venus and Jupiter (or Saturn I forgot). But basically lets imagine this a legit star that has been there forever. I had an idea for a planet pack with the Kerbal version of the star of Bethlehem, it would be a brighter star, maybe a high mass yellow dwarf or a low mass white main sequence star. And to top it off all of the planets could be Christmas themed, there could be a gas giant with Christmas colored green, red, and white cloud bands and some fun snowy moons. There could be a habitable planet that looks like Israel (maybe it could be called New Israel) and it could have some habitable moons like New Bethlehem and New Nazareth, and their environments would be based off the real places. There could be one final gas giant in the outer parts that is green and has different colored storms and hurricanes to make them look like ornaments on a Christmas tree and it could have some colorful Christmas themed rings and some colorful moons that look like little ornaments too. Please tell me your thoughts/suggestions and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!\u003Cimg alt=\u00224kt1qke9ng581.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.42\u0022 height=\u0022503\u0022 width=\u0022861\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.redd.it/4kt1qke9ng581.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(not my image)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
