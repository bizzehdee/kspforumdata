I read where you can change the DR settings to make it \u0022easy\u0022, but that seems like cheating. Here is my specific questions: is it at all possible to make a non-powered landing from orbital speeds in a Mk1 pod on Kerbal without exploding?

But that wasn\u0027t it, actually. I figured it out. The Mk1 Pod\u0027s pods\u0027s built-in heatshield was the problem. I guess the configs don\u0027t update the pods. Adding a regular heat shield worked. The pod by itself is popcorn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T02:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I guess RedAV8R pulled that out of the alternate config then.
