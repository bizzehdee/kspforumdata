While I can see the difficulty of choosing a category for a mod that could potentially fit in separate categories, it is my opinion that the mod author will need to choose one or the other. Here is my reasoning: Many mods are \u0022Packs\u0022, or large groups of parts with each part possibly fitting into a different category. KWRocketry, for instance, is grouped into four categories in Curse (Parts Pack, Sub-Assembly, Structural \u0026amp; Aerodynamic and Command \u0026amp; Control). Just from having that particular mod I know it could also be added to Propulsion too. So, what is going to happen when the user starts browsing the different categories? They are going to see the same mods at the top. To increase the exposure of the other mods in those categories we need to limit mods to a single category. However, categories still need to be thought out carefully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, Tags are a terrible idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirCmpwn","CreatedById":112036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T22:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that Kerbal Stuff is a curated repository.

However, some basic guidelines for such issues should be in place. Using the example of the KWRocketry again I do not believe it was an attempt to abuse the system but rather place the mod in the categories it fit. And it legitimately fit into several. What kind of guidelines would the mods use to determine where a part would go and, if using multiple categories, are you concerned about the more popular mods \u0022stealing the spotlight\u0022 from others in those categories?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
