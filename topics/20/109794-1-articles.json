I love messing around with this mod, making Gilly crash into Kerbin, and you can also use it to move crafts instantly to any orbit, anywhere. For adding planets, I remember seeing a planet factory mod somewhere, and I think they have changed it so it is now an interstellar mod with multiple suns and a super massive black hole in the centre of the galaxy. \n\n[HyperEdit](http://www.kerbaltek.com/hyperedit)\n\n[New Planets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106765-Kerbol-Planet-Pack-for-Kopernicus-Version-1-0-2)"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T12:51:07Z","Content":"Try [Outer Planets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-1-0-2-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-7-Beta%29-Biomes-for-Urlum-s-moons-the-new-moon-Tal-and-more-5-May).

There is a mod that attempts to make it appear that a planet has an axial tilt by texture shenanigans, but nothing real is possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:44:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I might be wrong, but as far as I know, you can\u0027t give a planet an axial tilt due to the game engine limitations.
