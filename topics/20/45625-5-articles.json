Source code must accompany mods on the KSP network, and it\u0027s generally accepted that modifications for personal use are allowed; some licenses, like Kethane\u0027s, even explicitly allow it. Even if one mod\u0027s license choice did prevent someone from learning, there are a large number of mods licensed permissively. Your list assumes it\u0027s a binary choice where \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E mod goes one way or the other. Even then, if \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E mod were restrictively licensed, nothing stops an aspiring modder from reading the resources available in Addon Development or reading source code from successful mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen licensing doesn\u0027t provide any guarantee that people will actually use your work. (It could simply be unpopular.) It also doesn\u0027t necessarily increase quality; Kethane was restrictively licensed precisely for quality purposes. It\u0027s developed slowly as a result, but it\u0027s undeniably a high-quality mod. If Kethane were openly licensed, it\u0027d have become bloated with lower-quality content that nobody wants to remove for fear of hurting someone\u0027s feelings. (I\u0027m guessing on the feelings part, but I \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E seen content built for Kethane that I decided not to include.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonetizing mods isn\u0027t really on the table. Spaceport was built for selling content (just take a look around the site and legal agreements) and modders overwhelmingly \u003Cem\u003Eresist\u003C/em\u003E that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure why you think \u0022extensive resources\u0022 are required to enforce mod licenses. In Kethane\u0027s history, I\u0027ve had to deal with fewer than ten license violations, and usually I just IM a link to the offending thread to a forum moderator. You can ask the forum staff if they find licensing to be a big drain, and I suspect they\u0027ll say policing threads like this one takes far more work than policing the actual mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s why Kethane is restrictively licensed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe art assets were restrictively licensed from the get-go, and the new modeler who joined the project also wanted his works protected. You\u0027d have to ask them why, but at the very least I\u0027m bound to respect their wishes. I\u0027m simply a user of their work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFor a time, technical support for Kethane was a part-time job. I\u0027ve been able to reduce that load through a combination of control over the codebase (restrictive license), some unusual preventative measures (incorrect install detector) and lots of bugfixing iterations (the current version is 0.7.7). There was a brief experiment where I authorized the release of a single Kethane fork, \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E I personally reviewed the code, and even then it was a complete disaster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShortly after taking over the project, I made it a goal to make Kethane among the highest-quality mods available. I already had access to some of the best part assets of the time, and I could tackle the code. Open licensing is great for high-quality security software; it\u0027s not so great for game mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI derive very little real-world value from working on Kethane. The best I can do is track download counts over time, and this is exactly why I don\u0027t allow redistribution.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are drawbacks, like slower development cycles and a lot more personal responsibility for the mod. I don\u0027t have a team of people willing to contribute patches. I choose the license terms with all of this in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbsolutely valid points, there\u0027s definitely a niche for someone to make or update user-friendly documentation, as well as try to establish some kind of minimal quality standards that beginning modders should aim for. Unfortunately, I haven\u0027t seen any kind of standardization among the \u0022elite\u0022 either, and most seem violently opposed to it, so asking the little guys to fall in line would be hypocritical.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s really no \u0022modding elite\u0022 in KSP.

There\u0027s little standardization among KSP mods because there\u0027s just not much to standardize. The best example I can think of is the folder structure of mod downloads; you\u0027ll find some have GameData/ in the root, and others simply have the mod folder; a few bad apples will have {modname}/GameData/{modname}, which can cause quite a few problems! We\u0027ve had discussions in modding channels about the best approach, and I\u0027m personally happy it seems many have settled on the first approach. This is a decision that affects users and the choice isn\u0027t arbitrary, so it\u0027s a good candidate for standardization. There just aren\u0027t many similar opportunities. I\u0027m interested to hear where you think the \u0022modding elite\u0022 are resistant to standardization, and just who those elite are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greys\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greys\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStandardization is pretty much a pipe dream.
