So, I\u0027m looking for a working solar system replacer, or solar system added (so Kerbol \u002B 1) to start a new game in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little confused on how to go about it though. Mainly I just want ready made system, but not one just adding new planets to Kerbol, but an actual separate/different system. Which mod is best for that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
