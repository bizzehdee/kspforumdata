It\u0027s a low-grade alt to stock Ore (literally, low-grade ore) and represents the continuous but tiny presence of all other crustal resources that you happen to need and do exist on the current planet but might not exist in the current biome. MKS has parts and processes for sifting Dirt. If you don\u0027t use MKS then help yourself and write a converter recipe for yourself for (inefficiently) splitting Dirt into whatever you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoil is primarily the waste resource of the Snacks! LS mod (equivalent to Mulch in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS) but is treated differently by another mod who\u0027s name I can\u0027t remember and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a LS mod. Part of how Snacks works is that it adds the Soil Recycler converter to some stock parts (namely the Hitchhiker can) and it adds resources to crewed parts at the points of reloading a craft file in the editor or launching from the editors. I don\u0027t think it adds Soil tankage to every affected part so be mindful of that. Snacks! adds a few 1.25m tanks (they look like the un-Restocked FL-Tx00\u0027s. Can\u0027t miss the green on them) which are switchable between Snacks and/or Soil. They\u0027ll be in either the Utility or Payload? category or the CCK LS category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoil is not a CRP resource, I think, so expect it to be inaccessible without the mods that use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
