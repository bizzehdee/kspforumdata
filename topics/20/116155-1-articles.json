Then you fly to the destination planet.\n\nAnd, obviously, this vessel disappears from the source world.\n\nAs an example: a vessel contains a special \u0022Hyperdrive\u0022 part. When you right-click it and press \u0022Prepare to jump\u0022, you get a dialog with KSP instances and saves, choose the desired one and press OK.\n\nThe vessel id is written somewhere.\n\nYou exit the KSP\\_OuterPlanets and run KSP\\_NewHorizons, the mod checks if there are vessels to be jumped, and you get the vessel appeared somewhere and disappeared in the initial persistent.sfs.\n\nMaybe only a vessel with some part or some fixed coordinates as \u0022portals\u0022 - not essential.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T07:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid**"}]}
