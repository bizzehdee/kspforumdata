Now I make sure to slow down to an orbital speed of about 2000m/s and things seem OK. But I don\u0027t know what the magic is to decide what is/isn\u0027t a safe re-entry speed (one could argue that the experimenting is half the fun of the game).

Yeah, sure, you bleed off speed faster while doing that, but you can only get away with it in the upper atmosphere where there\u0027s sod-all drag anyway. It\u0027s usually quicker to dive to 30,000m, keep your angle of attack close to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and toast your plane as close as you dare to burning up. Keep descending as fast as you can get away with. A sacrificial battery or something near the nose acting as a coalmine canary may help you learn the limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Circularise first. It\u0027s a lot easier coming in at Mach 7 than Mach 12.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Open your intakes as soon as you hit air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Think about using spoilers and flaps to enhance drag. Make sure you balance \u0027em right if you do, though; involuntary pitching at hypersonic speed is not a long term survival strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* S-turns. Not yawing, but a proper 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 bank and a very delicate pitch-up. Just keep an eye on your sink rate while doing it; not a lot of vertical lift when you\u0027re standing on a wingtip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Get your aero design smooth enough that your plane can cruise with 3x or 4x physics acceleration, in both descent and level flight. Just remember to turn it back down to 1x before you touch the controls, and keep an eye on things while cruising. Return to 1x and restabilise if the plane starts to oscillate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve lost plenty of planes to Ferram on reentry, but I\u0027ve never lost one to overheating.
