For example, you can climb to the top of the VAB and plant a flag there. (Don\u0027t know if you can target flags, though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasier to do: make a plane that drops a probe core and parachute out of a cargo bay and have that land atop a building. It\u0027ll be tricky, but rewarding, as you will be able to mark the targets with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said... most of the missiles are NOT going to be able to attack the VAB/SPH and successfully take them down. I dumped 228 Hydra-70 rockets into each, and it still took a tank gun to finish the job on the SPH. The VAB just shrugged it all off. It may take up to 5 Cluster Bombs to trash the VAB, and those are unguided. Sorry. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
