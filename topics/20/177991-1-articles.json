I assume that changing every instance of this function with a \u003Cem\u003Etrue \u003C/em\u003Evalue should fix the issue. That is, of course, based on assumption that this works like I just wrote.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould someone with knowledge of programming make such a modification, please? Going through this and other forums, I gathered that there are a lot of people who would want this requirement removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
