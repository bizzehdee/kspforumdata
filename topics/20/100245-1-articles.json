It\u0027s a big favorite of mine and it could become a practical replacement for KSP\u0027s NERVA.\n\nThe neat thing about it is that you can \u0022gear\u0022 it for thrust or ISP, which means it could effectively act as two engines on vacuum-only spacecraft.\n\n![VASIMR_system.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/VASIMR_system.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T22:42:10Z","Content":"This is included in Interstellar and I think also Near Future Propulsion."},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T22:57:38Z","Content":"[Near Future Propulsion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042) as parameciumkid said as some, as well as many other electric engines, and the other Near Future mods are amazing for powering them."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshua A.C.

It uses a blue million kilowatts of electrical power, too. I built a ship to send to Moho that initially had something like 35,000 dv when I first started building. By the time I had included a nuke reactor (also from Near Future) to power the engine, it had dropped considerably. I began my transfer burn (after adding RCS, a lander, and all the various doo-dads and whatzits I needed) with around 8,000 dv. Still impressive, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T20:43:01Z","Content":"NFP rules. Try it."}]}
