I want small wings that I can fold, and I tried doing this with the infernal robotics mod, but the wings become really unstable when flying or deployed. I also tried D12 mod, which has some really nice parts, but the foldable wings are just too big for a one seater aircraft.

Although I think the robotic struts only disconnect, I don\u0027t think they reconnect. I\u0027m trying to get the quantum struts to work, but I cannot find the part when I install the mod. Anyways, the robotic mods with the struts does work very well for the foldable wings. They are more stable, but still need some struts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T15:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe quantum struts look like stock linear RCS thrusters, they are in the utility tab.
