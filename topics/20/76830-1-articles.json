I expect I\u0027d thrive on tasks and goals assigned by others, and as a writer who liked to craft a narrative around their missions, I expect at least some other forumites would show an interest in this story of a growing space agency! The notion is that I\u0027ll build craft and fly missions based on assignments given by other people posting in the thread, and then report on those missions as if they were part of an actual ahistorical space race. I\u0027ll work on a budget external to the game itself, most likely. Not sure yet about a tech tree. I\u0027ll post mainly write-ups but I\u0027ll consider videos, I\u0027m sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking to work my way from basic missions to celestial bodies, to impressive orbital and planetary infrastructure, megacraft, working to restrictive specifications and other such things.

Members can propose a mission (put a kethane scanning satellite in a polar orbit) or project (replicate the Apollo Program!) and assign funding, or contribute their funding to an existing proposal. This way, the more call there is for me to complete a particular project, the easier it will be for me to do so, given the expanded budget.

(Proof reading STILL required, if you can bring yourself to it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour core mods look like a good set. You might want to consider Ship Manifest instead of Crew Manifest - it does fuel and other resources as well - or add TAC fuel balancer if you feel the need.

RT2, on the other hand, is fun \u0022in itself\u0022 but can take a lot of work, especially at the start. I suppose it comes down to how awkward you want to make it for yourself - FAR, DRE, Dang It and Construction Time are in the same category; good, but you\u0027ll have to change the way you play. The life-support mods may fall into this category as well but there is a bit of variation amongst them as to how onerous the extra considerations will be. With some you can just add a \u0022life support\u0022 grab-bag and more or less forget them, others will need constant attention. Kethane, KAS and IR are really up to you. Certainly if you\u0027ve got Kethane then KAS is a useful addition but while I love the idea of building \u0027interesting things\u0027 with KAS/IR I never actually have wanted to!

It\u0027s a bunch of part packs that work both stand-alone and in any combination together. Depending on your tastes, you can get advanced electric engines, new batteries and solar panels, nuclear reactors, large-scale girder trusses and more. Thematically it aims in a similar direction as KSP Interspellar, but confines itself to the eponymous \u0022near future\u0022 rather than going deep into speculative tech.
