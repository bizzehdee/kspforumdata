Then there is the task of trying to unravel the knot I\u0027ve make for myself. Deciding what mod/s to remove so I can get back into \u0022green\u0022 time is not fun with all the restarts to check for minimal performance differences and weigh up it I \u0027really\u0027 want that QoL mod or not...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFigured I\u0027d ask if there was a performance metric for mods that could be used for installed mods to aid this decision process? # module calls per second? Processing duration? No idea but thought it worth a discussion that might prompt something of an idea from the community.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
