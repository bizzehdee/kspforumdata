As the name suggests, the Hardlight Parts Mod allows users to modify procedural parts outside of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. This will change the object\u0027s mass, resource capacity, aerodynamics, etc. etc.. The mod would work similarly to the existing Procedural Parts mod (maybe it could be an extension/plugin for it?), except it would require a special part to function\u00A0(if you have that setting enabled), namely, the Hardlight Projector. The HL Projector would require some electric charge to function, and all hardlight parts will shrink and eventually collapse if the charge gets low enough. More about that later\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, parts such as fuel tanks, engines, cargo bays, wings, and other stuff can be created, just like the procedural parts mod. They also have some additional \u0022solid-looking\u0022 textures, as well as several hardlight textures, such as \u0022tron\u0022 (pure outline of a part, able to see the edges but not the inside), \u0022ward\u0022 (appears one continuous color throughout, like the Defender titan\u0027s Ward of Dawn in Destiny (1)), \u0022bridge\u0022 (like a Portal/Halo light bridge), and some others. The hardlight color(s) can be modified like a stock light can. This can also be done in flight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA craft spawns on the launchpad and immediately starts using electric charge from the craft\u0027s batteries. I don\u0027t think it should be a realistic amount of electricity, as it would require such a huge amount of charge that it would be beyond the feasible scope of otherwise stock KSP, and adding a part that can supply this amount of charge would unbalance the entire rest of the game (that\u0027s not inherently bad in a single-player game, just undesirable, at least in this case). Instead, the charge needed will be easily obtained with moderate amounts of solar panels or fuel cell arrays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may recall that I hinted at what happens if you run out of electric charge with hardlight parts. Well, when you get below a certain threshold (determined on a user-set\u00A0part-to-part basis), the parts will shrink to the minimum size required to contain the resources inside, or just disappear depending on an individual part preference. Say you\u0027re in space with a hardlight \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. You could make the wings disappear when you run out of charge, just stay there, or go away until you need them. But what if you run out of charge with a half-empty fuel tank? (Side note - A glass is half full if liquid was most recently added. It is half full if liquid was most recently subtracted) Well, that tank will fully collapse and the fuel will be erased. Gonzo. Done. Outta there. RIP. You get the idea. The safeguards you\u0027ve put in place should (hopefully) protect you from that, but they\u00A0might not, so plan in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines work like the procedural SRBs in the Procedural Parts mod, and are adjustable on the fly, providing massive efficiency in all situations, if you set them wisely. This is ideal for SSTOs, although somewhat-difficult to build due to the electric charge required\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone picks this mod up, as I have no clue how it works (lol).
