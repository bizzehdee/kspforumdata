For example when we pass a rocket plume over a part the part becomes blackened where the flame hit. Same with reentry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an idea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T09:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would take a lot of work. As it is now, a part has a static image attached to it. A mod would have to be created to where it detects both the part and the \u0027thrust\u0027 or \u0027heat\u0027 being applied to that part. Then you have two options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) Change the image of the part, showing the charring on the actual part itself\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) add \u0027splashes\u0027 to the part like they do in fps\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe splashes would be your best option. Yes, it looks ugly when you can see that the splash is clearing just an image pasted on, but it\u0027s the best option. Like in COD, when you shoot a wall, the wall doesn\u0027t get deformed, it just gets applied with a splash image of a bullet hole. The same would have to be done with KSP parts, because you would have to make an image for EVERY single postion to be charred, like pixel by pixel. Splashes get ugly fast especially when they overlap one another., but it\u0027s the only option really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL:DR: Can be done, hard to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t mind having this as an addon as well, but it would have to be good, really good for me to decide to even try it because of how hard it would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
