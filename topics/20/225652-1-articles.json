Im absolutely new at modding. I used to be a 3d enviromental and concept artist like 6 years ago, but that dont pay my bills in the country i live. anyways you can see some of my personal artwork here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.deviantart.com/arielmultimedia\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.deviantart.com/arielmultimedia\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresentation done, i want to read your ideas or advices about this mod i have in mind. Firstly, i wanted to bring to the game the Hermes spacecraft from The Martian movie, just bc is more cool, but then i realize the craft from the books is also very cool too. Here is the thing: there is already a lot of mods that allows you to build the EXACT hermes from the books, and even perform a similar profile mission to Duna/Mars. And in the other hand, the vessel form the movie is also almost buildable in KSP, except for a few parts, so my idea is to bring those parts to the game, im talking of the Command module, Antenna and Relay module, spherical xenon tanks, and the VASIMR on esteroids engine. If i want to put effort in this mod is bc i want to build it from scratch, and make it as high quality as possible for today KSP standars. Let me know what you think. Any advice from the most experimented guys out here it would be really welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-08-05T23:57:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2024 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 dy\u0022\u003EMonday at 11:57 PM\u003C/time\u003E by Ariel Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
