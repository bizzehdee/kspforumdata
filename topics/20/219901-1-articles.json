I\u0027ve been doing some digging and I found a mod called OPM. This mod seems really good, and I am going to download it, but along with it I feel that my playthrough would be cool with some exotic planets, like a water world or a carbon world. Are there any mods that add things like this?\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for helping out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat Liao\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Watermel00n","CreatedById":217752,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-17T01:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuackPack adds some planets close to the sun.
