I want to make a mod that takes place eons before the base Kerbal Space Program.\u00A0 There is only one other mod that does that, Its called \u0022Before Kerbin\u0022 and its no longer supported. I like this idea for a mod, so I think i want to make one inspired by it! (Before Kerbin made by Gameslinx, check out his new mod Paralax 2.0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if Kerbals did not evolve on Kerbin, but on DRES instead! Yep, you heard me, Dres in this mod is like a lost city of Atlantis, they evolved on Dres, but Kerbol is starting to cool! The Kerbals need to get of Dres, and head to Kerbin, a world discovered as the cradle of all life, by the ascent, Kayan Civilization!\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/L7gEUbv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/L7gEUbv\u003C/a\u003E (Image of a concept art for Dres)\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat to expect from this mod:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn enterly new solar system, 2 Billion years in the past\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew planets, and changed stock planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLore on each one!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTell me what do you guys think about this, and ill start making it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
