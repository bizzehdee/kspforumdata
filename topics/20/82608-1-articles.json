The next number is for major releases (currently 7), the next for bigger patches that may include new content or multiple changes (2), and the last number is for minor hotfixes (3). Bringing it up to 0.7.2.3. StageRecovery follows a similar pattern. Many people use the last number for the build number (github commit, or the actual number of times the plugin has been built).
