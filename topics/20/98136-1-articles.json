I Just Want a Simple Mod that Allows Kerbals to actually Die or Sustain Horrible Injuries rather then just Poof out of Existance. A little bit of Gore in the Mod would be a nice touch. Also Maybe the ability to Pick Up Dead Kerbal Bodies using KAS Would also add to this Mods Realism. List Of Injuries and Deaths I want to see in this Mod -Broken Bones -Brain Trauma -Organ Failure -Suicide -Getting Crushed -Murdered -Poisoning -Being Exposed to Vacuum -Being Too Badass -Chestbursters -Lack of Food -Getting incinerated -Dying From Anything That Involves a Rocket -Getting Melted -Insanity\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T05:48:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HuntsmanThe8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T06:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals \u0026amp; Insanity?
