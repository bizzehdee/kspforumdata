As stated, some mods\u0027 parts reference each other in the cfgs to reduce memory footprint. It\u0027s entirely possible to move these parts but it requires some more advanced level tweaks to make sure you don\u0027t break anything (disclaimer: this only goes for parts-only stuff -- Adding plugins into the mix means you can still screw things up, sometimes very badly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to move them, you\u0027d first have to identify all the parts (anywhere from zero to two dozen or more) that reference it\u0027s model or texture (or both) and then edit the .cfg file to make the game look for those files in their new location. You\u0027ll need some basic knowledge of folder structure and of the model node system to do this correctly. Now it should work, but this is no guarantee as some mods have woven a very complicated web of part interdependency, particularly those that use master texture sheets like the FuzTek station parts expansion by Sumghai. It\u0027s generally something you really don\u0027t want to do unless you really know what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Al-Rabban","CreatedById":62488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T01:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply Fractal_UK,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for my own clarification, do you mean the part file as in the .cfg?
