It\u0060s free and it seems to be the thing most people use to make parts. AFAIK You would load your .obj or .dae into blender, make a UV map (texture) and save it as a .blend which you can load into unity. Once you have it in unity you can save your part and load it into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few more steps like parttools but that is the basic process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few youtube videos showing how to do it too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sethnizzle","CreatedById":22985,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T17:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart here, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-23-Last-update-24th-Jan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-23-Last-update-24th-Jan\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the stickied threads and the sub-forums of the Add-on Development section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T19:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECATIA is not directly capable of outputting assets that can be used in game. You must transport the geometry you create in CATIA into a poly based 3D modeller such as 3DSmax or Blender in order to create the UV unwrap, and you will likely need to optimize the faces a bit by hand. Once you\u0027ve prepared the mesh you can then transport it into Unity and use PartTools to compile it into a .mu file which KSP will accept; you will also need to use an image editing program such as photoshop or GIMP to draw a texture matching the UV map. And then you have to write a cfg file describing the part, it\u0027s properties, functions, how it attaches to stuff, and so on. When using CATIA as your primary modelling suite you must take care to keep your faces relatively simple and avoid using circles, arcs, curves, splites, and ellipsis at all cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T08:17:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so I have to use polygons instead of circles and cylinders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-sides cylinders are ok or not?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
