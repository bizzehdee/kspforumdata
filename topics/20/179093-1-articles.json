I installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and then installed realism overhaul for KSP 1.3.1 and it took several tries. I kept on getting messages and trying to solve them. it was stuff like delete the mod that owns E43 in @thumbs/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (the rest is unimportant) so I delete @thumbs and I end up getting the error message cannot find E43. so I let it install most of the way then I delete E43 before the message appeared about delete the mod that owns E43. it works, and realism overhaul is finally done installing. I then want to play so I click launch KSP. KSP then opens into a black screen. that\u0027s the problem. I restarted my computer, too. HALP. PLZ. I opened task manager to find my SSD wasn\u0027t loading anything. after the mod it was at most 5GB so that shouldn\u0027t take that long. my graphics card somehow was at 80%. how is the graphics card maxing out when the game wont even load?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I actually found the issue. needed to open with the x64 launcher manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-19T01:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2018 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Shuttleman27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
