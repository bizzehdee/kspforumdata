That scheme makes a lot of sense to me -- is there a way of having them sorted like that in the game? I only see them sorted by fuels which gives a rough approximation (lower stages won\u0027t be found on the hydrolox tab, for example), but there\u0027s still a lot of tabs to be checked for any given task. I may be missing the obvious -- as mentioned before, it took me a while to spot the field for surface-level TWR even though I was expecting it to be there.

Well of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the way it\u0027s done... there\u0027s a host of upper stage engines in the 60-80kN range with no clear indication why I should chose one over the other (except for ISP of course, which beggars the question why the others even exist). 70kN is barely enough to make orbit as a second stage on my design. However, the next strongest engine is five times more powerful -- totally overpowered, uncontrollable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t even looked at the 212 different SRB\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery tank requires me to select the proper fuel. This requires some attention even if you have a combination of Kerosene and UMDH on your rocket; but when I was presented with a choice of either 41% or 43% UMDH, I was positively confused, double and triple-checking which needs to go where. I don\u0027t doubt that there\u0027s people who enjoy this, but I\u0027m not one of them. Coming to think of it, why are tanks only 83% full by default?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still wonder how I should make a nice circular orbit on engines I can\u0027t throttle. I guess that in real life they have a predetermined flight profile and some control system that follows it to a fraction of a degree.

I\u0027ve now uninstalled RO and will try RSS Stock Parts -- though at first glance, it seems as if this will swing the pendulum too far in the other direction. I probably wouldn\u0027t see it that way if I had gone with RSS-SP right away, but after a taste of real fuels, RSS-SP comes over as incredibly shallow. On the other hand, the RO approach is just too damn much: too many fuels, way too many engines (also too many that seem to be quite similar, while some large niches remain unfilled).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of this turns into a major UI problem. Other than that, my first impression is that RO requires too much planning. You have to design a rocket precisely to spec... and also fly it precisely to spec. I wasn\u0027t aware of this, but having a throttle is what allows one to just assemble a rocket of about the right delta-V and then make things up as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comes after I\u0027ve put a whole six or eight hours into RO, so my comments should probably be taken with a whole bucket of salt.

Read the guides linked in the OP for RO on how to launch your first rocket, Ferram\u0027s tips for launch vehicle design, etc. They will help out a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use procedural tanks and procedural tanks only. Customize the tank sizes and shapes for that particular mission, taking into account fuel types and TWR from the beginning of the stage to the end of the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

If you need to make fine adjustments to a satellite or orbiting pod, it works best to use hypergolic propellants and deep-throttling engines once you\u0027re in orbit (and be sure to use the service module tank type). The LM descent engine is a good one. I ended up making several 4-stage rockets. First two stages together were about 9 km/s delta V, (kerolox for stage 1 and hydrolox for stage 2 a la Saturn V) then the last two stages were both hypergolics to actually put the satellite where it needed to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. For lunar transfer, put a small pathfinder satellite in an orbit that is coplanar with the Moon\u0027s orbit. Then for future launches you can then see exactly when the satellite\u0027s orbit crosses over KSC, and launch into that plane knowing you\u0027ll be lined up with the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
