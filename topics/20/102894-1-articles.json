Somewhere you can run you missions from in a more detached manner as opposed to the very omnipresent way in which the game is currently structured to play.\n\nI should state at this juncture that I have absolutely no skill in programing what so ever! I am a drawer, artist, thinker. I have about as much programing knowledge as a dead non-programmy thing that can\u0027t program.\n\nThis is a quick conceptual idea of how the mod may look.\n\n![Mission%20Control_zps8muuos2j.png](http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a27/OrkHarrid/Mission%20Control_zps8muuos2j.png)\n\nEach screen could/would be interchangeable with the main screen (the one in the middle). The screens themselves would be customizable dependent on what the user wanted.\n\nThe Kerbal flag (with the light on) would be replaced with whichever flag was used by the user and the flags up top are for nothing more than place filling and aesthetics.\n\nThe idea is that the game is played from this center instead of using the 3rd person \u0027god cam\u0027 to give a more authentic feel to the whole shebang. This would kick in one the user went to the launch pad.\n\nAnyone with any ideas on how this would/could be done?\n\nCould it be done?\n\nDoes anyone want it to be done?\n\nWhy are women drawn to shoes?\n\nWhy do men refuse to hug?\n\nWhy am I asking these questions?\n\nWhy am I still up at 02:30?\n\nWhy is all the rum gone?\n\nAll this and more, for no apparent reason....\n\nThank you for your time guys \u0027n\u0027 girls."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T09:24:47Z","Content":"Check out [Probe Control Room](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450-WIP-IVA-PLUGIN-ProbeControlRoom-1-0-beta8a-IVA-All-the-things%21-new-3D-RPM-17).

Even though it appears some bits do not work well 0.90.\n\nIt is not however totally to my liking so I may have to see if I can mess around a bit. What I really want is to lay it out in a very similar fashion to the quick pic I posted, but without the people and with more MFD\u0027s.\n\nSo a cross between PCR and my piccy.\n\nAn example would be that rather than having all those chunky buttons taking up valuable space, the screens could be changed via right click menus or something similar. Leaving more room for screens and less clutter."}]}
