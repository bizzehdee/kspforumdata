This looks like a parts only mod and they typically have far fewer problems than plugin\u0027s with version changes. If you want to stick with 1.2 you might make a copy of the KSP folder and test the RSR 1.8 parts in the KSP copy - Fairings did change significantly at one point and so might not port back to 1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-23T11:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much for taking the time to reply.\u00A0 I\u0027ll just go right now and download this version of RSR; fingers crossed it\u0027ll work in 1.2!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-23T12:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there\u0027s a funny thing.\u00A0 Turns out the fairings - and a whole load of other parts too - were there all along, but for some reason the game wasn\u0027t picking them up?\u00A0 The parts that were available worked perfectly, and I admit I never thought for one minute KSP 1.2 might be recognising some and not others, so never thought to check if the fairings, struts, etc. were in the RSR file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, all\u0027s good, and these new parts will make things much easier, limiting the number of non-RSR parts I\u0027m forced to use in my RSR career game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
