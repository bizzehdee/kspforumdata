I\u0027ve seen number of topics here (or reddit and other places) regarding this topic but almost none of them (mods, not topics \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E) give the sense of any infrastructure expansion/progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll mods I\u0027ve tried use Research nodes as progression gates and research points as the only resource required. Once you get the research you can skip few progression stages without doing anything.\u00A0All of them were pretty much just about delaying bigger rockets and longer flights until you have a research that makes previous hinderance obsolete. Just unlock the parts, build bigger and you\u0027re good to go wherever you like directly from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am looking for a career mods or packs that would expand career mode and would force me to build and maintain space infrastructure (space stations, surface mining operations, refueling stations and such) necessary to progress. I know it is sandbox game and I could roleplay it, and sometimes I do, but I find most fun in overcoming obstacles and challenges made by others and career makes it a bit tycoon-ish and even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you will understand what I mean.
