My only problem is using them at later stages. Decouplers don\u0027t connect properly to the bottom and don\u0027t loosen from the engine. The decouplers do attach at the bottom node of the decoupler and so don\u0027t detach during staging. Anybody know how to fix this in the .cfg files of the parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:01:37Z","Content":"You need to flip the node\\_stack\\_bottom nodes for each of the engines.
