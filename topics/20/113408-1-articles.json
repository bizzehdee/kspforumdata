I often alter CFGs to get what I want/need in a part. I\u0027ve been adding IVAs to parts for a while not but I was curious if it\u0027s possible to combine two IVA\u0027s, (MK2 cockpit \u002B MK2 Passenger for example) and have them displayed ingame within one part. \n\nSo here is my question:\n\nIs there a way to assign two IVA\u0027s to one part in the CFG? \n\nAnd if not...\n\nCan two IVA CFGs be combined to generate a similar result? \n\nI was hoping someone who was add-on savvy could tell me how to do this if its even possible.\n\nThanks ahead of time! Any and all help would be appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Son_of_Al","CreatedById":144632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T19:55:24Z","Content":"Bump - Anybody have any idea about this?"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T20:30:37Z","Content":"I dunno hope its possible."},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T20:40:41Z","Content":"Probably not possible since the mesh on the IVA isn\u0027t designed to be connected to another one, however it could be possible to have 2 different IVAs on one part, but I do not think it is possible to have them connected."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbinspacecommand","CreatedById":145686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T22:49:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Probably not possible since the mesh on the IVA isn\u0027t designed to be connected to another one, however it could be possible to have 2 different IVAs on one part, but I do not think it is possible to have them connected.\n\nHow would this be possible?
