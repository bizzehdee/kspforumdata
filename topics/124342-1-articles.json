I don\u0027t have screenshots because, well... If I had time to think about screenshots then I\u0027d have at least one Kerbal splattered against the face of the Mun, probably joined by her colleague and debris from their lander.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 24 was going to be a routine Mun mission, just like the several that had gone before. The Mun missions involve a fairly standard Lander and a fairly standard Orbiter/Return Vehicle sitting on top of a fairly standard rocket to get them there. The design was good. There was enough spare delta-v everywhere to account for a variety of scenarios, but we\u0027d never had to seriously cut into that budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of this particular mission was to perform scientific experiments and survey the Southwest Crater. There were no special requirements for the crew, but I sent an experienced Engineer, Corgard, who had been to the Mun before, to crew the Orbiter while Pilot Shepger, and Scientist Luti would get the honour of completing their first missions to space, and their first visits to the Mun\u0027s surface. Corgard was a tried and true engineer. He had put his feet down on the surface of the Mun before, having accompanied the legendary Jeb on one of his jaunts to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger was a newbie to the Kerbal Space Program, but was intelligent and sober and came into the space program after a fairly illustrious career as a military pilot. Despite his calm demeanour, he idolised Jebediah, who, in terms of badassery was Shepger\u0027s complete opposite. Shepger\u0027s prized possession was a folded up photo of him and Jebediah that he had had autographed during training. It never left Shepger\u0027s pocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeologist Luti on the other hand was a bit of a wildcard. Devastatingly intelligent, but prone to bouts of fairly extreme silliness. She earned her PhD in geology studying the impact site on Kerbin, but had a reputation for being the life of the party, whether that party was in the academic club, the dive bar halfway down an unnamed highway or the tiny research shack on the central peak of Kerbin\u0027s impact crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch, transfer to the Mun and the various maneuvers to set up for the landing all went without any problems. Inside the orbit of the MunKISat network, they established nominal communications back to mission control and got the go-ahead for the primary part of the mission. After a couple more orbits, the Lander decoupled with Shepger and Luti burning to drop to the surface a short while later. Even the landing was absolutely perfect, with Shepger somehow managing to find a very flat spot close to the crater rim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control, Shepger, we\u0027re on the surface. Shutting down engines.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good work, guys,\u0022 came Corgard\u0027s encouragement from above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight here. Yep, good work. Luti, deploy your experimental packages.\u0022 The voice of Gene, bounced off MunKISat 2, and crackled out of Shepger and Luti\u0027s intercoms. \u0022We\u0027re going to look over a couple of things on our side, but we don\u0027t see a reason why you guys might not want to get ready for EVA. I\u0027ll pass you back to Capcom.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, with Kerbol sitting just above the crater rim, Luti could barely contain her excitement enough to punch the buttons deploying the scientific experiments underneath the lander capsule. Another short while later, and Shepger exits the lander first to inspect the landing site and place the flag commemorating their successful Mun landing. A quick check of the engines and the exterior of the Lander and Shepger was calling for Luti to come down to the surface. Luti exploded out of the airlock, jumped down to the surface, completely ignoring the ladder or common sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Calm down, Luti,\u0022 cautioned Shepger. \u0022Let\u0027s just get our work done.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Calm down, are you kidding? We\u0027re on the freaking MUN!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite her excitement, Luti worked efficiently, completing her work, taking observations from the scientific experiments underneath the capsule before spending a good long time taking happy snaps around the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, guys. You\u0027ve completed your objectives. It\u0027s time to get ready to go,\u0022 Gene\u0027s command came the intercom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger and Luti packed up quickly. Shepger returned to the Lander to begin preparations to depart, while Luti packed away her sample kits and test boxes. Luti then climbed the ladder to stow her work, before returning to the surface to take one last photo of Kerbin in the sky above the moon (observation). On a whim, she ignored what would be normal practice, to climb the ladder, and instead used her EVA pack to boost herself upwards to the airlock door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadders are for chumps, but Luti is not a pilot. She misjudged the handgrips on the door and smacked into the side of the capsule before falling in between the central fuel tank and one of radial engine pods. After a moment trying to free herself, she realised that her leg had become stuck inside the (collider of the) attachment assembly. The clangs and scrapes of Luti smacking herself against parts of the Lander were loud enough to distract Shepger from his work momentarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything alright out there, Luti?\u0022 He enquired, his finger hovering above the last couple of switches to start warming everything up for the engines to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Err, not really. I seem to be stuck. I\u0027ll just be a sec.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean... \u0027stuck\u0027?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s going on over there, guys?\u0022 Gene checked into the conversation. \u0022Shepger, we\u0027re reading that you still haven\u0027t completed your checklist.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No problem, Mission Control! I\u0027m just getting back into the capsule now,\u0022 said Luti, no hint of distress in her voice whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger shook his head, getting back to the switch-flipping. \u0022You need some help, or are you good?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m good. I just need to wiggle free.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at that moment that everything went wrong. Somehow, in her wriggling around, Luti had managed to set off one of the explosive bolts that had been designed to sever fuel lines and connections between the fuel pod and the Lander in the case of emergency (I tried to use Warp to let Luti slip through the radial decoupler in which Luti was stuck, it didn\u0027t work). The effects were very real. Luti was flung in a Northeasterly direction away from the lander, the concussive force broke her leg in a half a dozen places, and Shepger\u0027s helmet intercom was suddenly filled with Luti\u0027s incoherent, painful screaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lander, report!\u0022 Mission Control called through the intercom. \u0022LANDER? We\u0027re seeing malfunctions and a debris cloud near your vehicle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control. We have a Master Alarm. Something has happened to Luti outside the capsule.\u0022 Shepger\u0027s voice was straining to be calm in spite of Luti screaming suit-to-suit directly into his ear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Luti, Mission Control, report in. Luti?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Luti!\u0022 shouted Shepger, trying to get her attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, Medical is reporting that Luti has suffered some sort of leg injury. We\u0027re still figuring out what\u0027s happening. We have warning lights all over the place. GUIDO and EECOM say they have pressing concerns about your vehicle. Flight\u0027s orders as follows: abort your checklist, prepare for EVA.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative, Mission Control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger put away his clipboard, unclipped himself from his command seat. Something had happened outside. Something catastrophic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger? Corgard here, radar on MunKISat 2 says that there\u0027s a large object, around 0.7m in length, moving away from your vehicle at high speed. Check your vehicle. You may have lost a chunk of an engine pod.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Understood, Corgard,\u0022 said Shepger as he lifted from his seat. He glanced at the vessel status screen as he got up. In amongst all the other flashing lights, he saw that structural integrity was fine; there was no loss of fuel; but there was a flashing alarm on one of the emergency decouplers. \u0022Wait.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger had already floated across the cabin to the EVA station, but turned around once he got there. The screaming in his ear was highly distracting, but he left it aside. At the very least, Luti was alive and breathing. \u0022Corgard, is that debris a radio source? Is it hot?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Corgard here, yes and yes. What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, Shepger. We can confirm. Luti has been blown away from your vehicle. Your orders remain to abort your launch checklist, exit and check the integrity of your vehicle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger turned quickly, kicking off a panel and floating back over to his command seat. Strapping himself into his seat with one hand, he instructed his computer to target the debris with the other. She was in a suborbital trajectory, travelling at high speed to a periapsis of around 48km above the surface before a fatal fall back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No. Negative, Mission Control, I\u0027m going to leave aside the rest of the checklist, launch now and catch her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, permission denied on that suggestion. Check the integrity of your vehicle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, Mission Control. I\u0027m committed,\u0022 Shepger said, flipping switches urgently to cut off Mission Control\u0027s influence over the Lander\u0027s systems and hand everything over to his manual control in his command seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Corgard here. Shepger, even if your vehicle is intact, you probably don\u0027t have the fuel to do whatever you\u0027re planning to do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Corgard, that\u0027s your domain. Get your calculator.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, Flight. Luti\u0027s status is unknown, she may or not even be able to survive whatever has happened to her. I\u0027m not going to lose two of you. You are ordered to leave your checklist, check yourself and await further orders,\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice cut in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Negative, Control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, Flight, don\u0027t make me repeat myself,\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Shepger was too far gone to turn around now, and he could barely even hear Gene\u0027s anyway, even if Luti was finally running out of breath. As he frantically moved through the ignition routine, panicked heavy breathing replaced the screaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good to have you back, Luti. Hold on,\u0022 last couple of switches. Computer ready. Engines ready. Guidance ready. Plotting for rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger?\u0022 Sobbed Luti. \u0022Luti here, I\u0027m... I have no idea... I\u0027ve done something to my leg. It hurts so much. I\u0027m spinning, and I think I\u0027m about 8km... Above the surface...\u0022 Shepger heard a gulp over the intercom. \u0022This is it... I think.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hold on Luti, \u0022 repeated Shepger, moving automatically through the engine\u0027s ignition sequence. \u0022I\u0027m coming.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, I\u0027m... You\u0027re what? No!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lander\u0027s engines ignited and Shepger quickly turned the Lander towards the intercept course. The landing gear retracted automatically as the computer assisted Shepger to catch up with Luti as quickly as possible. As quick as possible, unfortunately, meant meeting her when she was on her way back down towards the surface, approximately 30km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Looks like you have a bit of a headstart on me, Luti.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, what are you doing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Getting you back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Drop gear away from your body, and then use your EVA thrusters to stop your spin. Follow your training.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK. But...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No buts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Corgard here. Shepger, you\u0027re short on delta-v. You\u0027re going to catch her, sure, but you\u0027re not going to able to make it back into a good orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Corgard, Shepger. Not interested.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorgard sighed audibly over the intercom. This was exactly the sort of foolhardy stupidity that Jeb usually got up to. How did Bill manage to handle it? Shepger was meant to be saner than this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was silence for a minute as the Lander and Luti flew towards their individual apoapses and started to fall back down. Shepger was concentrating too hard on finetuning their approach, Luti was still hyperventilating into her intercom, obviously in pain, adn Mission Control was too busy urgently escalating commands for Shepger to come to his senses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorgard thought to himself, one problem at a time, even if it makes other problems. \u0022Shepger, Corgard here,\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go ahead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pump all your fuel out of pods 2 and 4, and use the emergency jettison systems to lose them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll lose thrust.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ll gain delta-v.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I won\u0027t be able to land without the feet on those pods.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re not going to be able to waste fuel landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Number 2\u0027s bolts are damaged.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Understood,\u0022 Shepger broke the intense glare that he had been giving the targetting computer\u0027s display to move through the emergency jettison system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn seconds, after fuel had been pumped into the central tank, the remaining explosive bolts fired and two of the Lander\u0027s four engines flew away. Shepger allowed himself a glance at the doorstep camera which caught Engine Pod 2 spinning through its field of view. A black scorch mark stained the surface of the tank around where the triggered bolt had been, but otherwise the pod was fine. Shepger grunted, and returned his attention to the targetting display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, CAPCOM, Medical has a more complete picture of Luti\u0027s injuries.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go ahead, Mission Control,\u0022 Shepger was finally acknowledging their existence again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re pretty certain that she\u0027s broken her leg. In several places. It\u0027s going to be a very complex injury. There\u0027s likely other injuries as well. I\u0027m not sure how her suit has managed to hold together, but she\u0027s going to have to check for micro-tears, if she hasn\u0027t already. We can\u0027t tell what her suit pressure is. Her onboard computer is dead, and we haven\u0027t been able to raise her directly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Understood, Control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepger, Flight here. I\u0027m not sure what you intend to do. Heroic, but, it might be pointless,\u0022 Gene hesitated. \u0022We\u0027ve woken up Jeb. He thinks you\u0027re a legend.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Great, thanks,\u0022 said Shepger. Jebediah was his idol, but he didn\u0027t have spare time or spare energy to waste on glory at the moment. \u0022I\u0027ll talk to Luti, you guys figure out what I need to do after that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis achieved, and the Ground Proximity Warning, Collision, Fuel and Master Alarms all lit up. If he looked out his door now, he\u0027d probably see the white glint of Luti\u0027s suit in the sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Luti, Shepger. On approach.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re crazy, Shepger,\u0022 said Luti.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Get your duct tape out,splint your leg and check your suit for microtears that could burst when we move you. I\u0027ll be there soon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Understood. I think... I think my suit\u0027s mostly... Mostly fine. Just... Blacker than usual.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepger spent the last couple of minutes lining up his Lander with Luti on his targetting screen, then setting the autopilot to take over. Then he undid his harness, floated over to the EVA panel and dressed quickly. In his head, he did the maths. A minute or so to depessurise the airlock. Open the door, guide Luti to use her EVA thrusters to float over, that\u0027s another couple of minutes. Then another minute or so to pressurise the airlock again. And then, smack into the surface of the Mun. Not good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solution. He opened the airlock\u0027s computer panel and flicked through the manual controls to depressurise the cabin and airlock together. He and Luti wouldn\u0027t be able to take their helmets off until they got back to the Orbiter, but at least he could get back to his command seat in time to thrust away from the surface. Problem solved. Suit oxygen, dealing with Luti\u0027s leg and long term survival for them both were problems for later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe outer and inner doors of the airlock open together and Luti floats into view. He uses his HUD and the doorstep camera to give himself a good view of how she\u0027s oriented. The doorstep camera also lets him see that she\u0027s managed to duct her leg rigid, as well as a couple of spots of duct tape on various parts of her body. Her shredded suit is covered in black scorch marks, but nothing seemed to be venting anywhere, so the inner layers of the suit seemed to hold. She almost seemed like she was in good nick. At least she wasn\u0027t spinning any more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, Luti. I can see you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hi,\u0022 Luti managed to say through gritted teeth, obviously still in pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re going to have to orient in our direction. I\u0027m at your 10 o\u0027clock.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInexpertly, with EVA thrust spurting everywhere, Luti turned in the direction of the Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, now thrust forward in my direction.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yep.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not too fast,\u0022 Shepger noted, even as he saw the limb of the Mun\u0027s surface rear into view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nope. Not too fast.\u0022 Luti thrusted in his direction, and it was less than a minute before she collided with the airlock\u0027s door frame and Shepger helped her clamber inside. He pulled her over to her seat and helped her strap in quickly before returning to his own command seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control, Corgard? Luti is onboard.

He pushed the thrust control as hard as he could and watched the orbital information screen intently. Behind him, he could hear Luti groaning under the forces of the thrust. with 14km to go, he watched the Periapsis reading tick into positive territory and he sighed with relief. A moment later, the engines ran dry. He unfastened his harness and turned towards where Luti was sitting, still breathing heavily and painfully with teardrops all over the inside of her helmet\u0027s visor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I dropped the camera.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Seriously, this happened.
