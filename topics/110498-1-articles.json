How do I deal with heat? Or more specifically, what mechanics influence the distribution of heat, and what can I do from a design perspective to encourage the radiation of heat?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story behind my question is, I suspect, fairly typical. I got a testing contract for the LV-N (Guess what contract allowing access to a part that requires a whole research all to itself is never going to be completed?), and after some trial and error, fitted it on a Mun rocket as a personal trial for the system in a way that gained me 2k Delta V from dropping Oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI note that TWR is low, even compared to Munar gravity, so I prepare for a long burn. After I burned for a while, I notice that my probe core is overheating, as well as some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BVoVSI9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BVoVSI9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HBwgEKw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HBwgEKw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did see some of the LV-N overheating threads, and I want to be clear: I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a problem with the engine. Given that just mounting it gained me 2k Delta-V and I had to fire at maximum thrust for three minutes in a ship with no crew to get this result, it seems like a fair trade. What I\u0027m interested in is how I can control what components overheated first - I had to complete my burn at 5% power so I didn\u0027t explode the probe core. The components overheated in this order: Probe Core, Decoupler, LV-909(next stage), fuel tank, LV-N. When the Probe Core turned red is when I stopped burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the different components have different overheat tolerances - I suspect the Probe Core started complaining first because it had the lowest tolerance, but I\u0027m pretty sure the fuel tank \u0026amp; decoupler have the same tolerance, which makes it interesting that the decoupler (which is further away) started overheating first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had similar experiences with heat while using Mainsail engines \u0026amp; Kerbodyne liquid fuel boosters, but this is the most extensive example.
