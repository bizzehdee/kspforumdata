The N-600V Archelon is based around a deviantart.com fictional plane. Despite this, I\u0027ve managed to transfer most of the looks and functionality over to this Kerbalised version!\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0h9nyVB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220h9nyVB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow,\u00A0it may look like a lumbering, part clipped monstrosity, but you\u0027ll be pleased to hear... that\u0027s exactly what it is! But don\u0027t be fooled. It\u0027s surprisingly manoeuvrable for a craft of its size. The version I will leave a download link for has enough room to store at least one Jumbo orange fuel tank, but comes equipped with a nuclear reactor and crew seating as a base model. Do not fear! A couple of clicks and that can be removed, leaving a fresh clean slate inside. The plane uses 6 Whiplash engines allowing for relatively high speeds. When landing however, be careful! If your speed falls too low then, like most planes, you will experience a sudden need for lift.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AI9awTh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AI9awTh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis worked very well to say how many parts were used - I was expecting a lot more work on editing wings etc. to keep it stable. As always, I\u0027d love to see what uses you can come up with for this craft. I left it pretty simple so the possibilities are quite wide. As a side note, this plane uses a LOT of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules to maintain its speedy manoeuvrability and is thus very power thirsty. The stock nuclear reactor inside costs a lot but really serves a purpose. If you intend to take it out, make sure ample power supplies are still available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides this, have fun! I\u0027m quite happy with how this plane turned out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRyan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload (KerbalX): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Ryno/N-600V-Archelon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Ryno/N-600V-Archelon\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-19T17:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is all stock?

The thing is, I wanted to maintain most of the shape. However, this comes at a cost. The nose has to go, way too much drag. The wings are really inappropriate for such high speeds as proposed by re-entry - I tried sweeping them back but that played havoc with aerodynamics. The sheer size and scale of engines needed to lift the extra fuel and weight of this plane (note the tyranny of rockets here) means I simply can\u0027t get efficiency AND thrust out of the plane. A more skilled engineer may be able to pull it off, but the truth is even someone better then me would agree that this plane is a prime example of why we don\u0027t use Boeing 747\u0027s as space shuttles. However, I have been considering the Archelon\u0027s applications as a carrier craft (see the Russian MAKS prototype). The Archelon would provide enough thrust to take the payload up to a decent altitude and then the shuttle would detach for the rest of its journey. As much as I\u0027d love to test this more, Mass Effect Andromeda comes out tomorrow and schoolwork seems to get the best of me most times anyway. Maybe a few months into the future I can re-visit this concept but for the moment, there are much more pressing matters to deal with. However, I am pleased to see such an interest for my plane - so many people have favourited and downloaded on KerbalX and your comment makes me happy that someone truly appreciates what I do. Sorry I couldn\u0027t take this concept further for you, but when\u00A0I return to playing KSP I will develop and publish the \u0027MAKS\u0027 prototype.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, thanks for your interest and support!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRyan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
