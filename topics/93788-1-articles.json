The tended to show a lot of live footage on TV similar to today with the ISS. This was done heavily on Salyut 1 were they broadcasted live every night for an hour doing experiments and showing the Soviet public how to live in space. However if you try to search for this data today you cannot find it. No videos, hardly any pictures, you can still find scientific results. But what happened to all this footage, there should be at least 21 hours of TV footage for S-1 and then all the non public footage.
