The cryo-engine alone without fuel should be heavier than the hall thruster plus fuel just through the size difference alone. Could you share some screenshots and/or craft files?\n\nI\u0027m going to refine my statement because you rightfully poked holes in it. Keep in mind this is feedback not criticism!\n\nThe goal of these two missions was to place survey scanners into orbit around Joolian moons to map for Ore/MKS resources. When I imagined a mission to Jool with 2\u002Byear transit time and no landing requirements, my first thought was \u0027Ion engines are made for this kind of thing!\u0027 Turns out that for this mission, a cryo engine was cheaper and felt easier to execute. I\u0027ll detail as follows:\n\nBy payload I meant the essential equipment/hardware(probe core, reaction wheel, science stuff, batts \u0026 solar panels) bound for the Jool system (not fuel and engines). Thus, the payload of my two vessels was each under .5t. \n\nI built two probes, one powered by a Gyro-One, and one Powered by the 1.25m cryo. The cryo setup does weigh 4x more, and you are correct, as configured, the cryo-engine alone has more mass than the entire Ion setup. \n\nThese two configurations had similar dV values and can both perform the same mission, but the cryo version costs less (even after swapping up to larger solid boosters for a more expensive LV), and is easier to fly with 12x better TWR and no risk of losing power while in a planet\u0027s shadow. \n\nMaybe I\u0027m preaching to the wrong crowd here, but the whole thing felt like a bit of a letdown. In real life, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that cryogenic hydrogen is a) cryogenic and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) invariably leaks, then it would be the ultimate chemical fuel. Currently, those two factors aren\u0027t a part of the mod. I feel that incorporating the cryogenic nature and leakyness of LH2 isn\u0027t a nerf, it\u0027s an opportunity to add an interesting gameplay mechanic in the same way the Heat Control added a really interesting game mechanic during 1.0.2. \n\nThat being said, I feel like the mod already adds tremendously to the game. It gives interesting, powerful and realistic options for launches and upper stage boosters. I simply felt that the balance breaks down at a certain point, and it\u0027s worth mentioning since Nertea clearly values balance between his own mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T01:27:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Recently, I built two probes headed to the moons of jool, one with NFP Hall Thrusters, and one with Cryogenic H2/LOX.
