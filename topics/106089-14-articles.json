Keep in mind this is feedback not criticism!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of these two missions was to place survey scanners into orbit around Joolian moons to map for Ore/MKS resources. When I imagined a mission to Jool with 2\u002Byear transit time and no landing requirements, my first thought was \u0027Ion engines are made for this kind of thing!\u0027 Turns out that for this mission, a cryo engine was cheaper and felt easier to execute. I\u0027ll detail as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy payload I meant the essential equipment/hardware(probe core, reaction wheel, science stuff, batts \u0026amp; solar panels) bound for the Jool system (not fuel and engines). Thus, the payload of my two vessels was each under .5t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built two probes, one powered by a Gyro-One, and one Powered by the 1.25m cryo. The cryo setup does weigh 4x more, and you are correct, as configured, the cryo-engine alone has more mass than the entire Ion setup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two configurations had similar dV values and can both perform the same mission, but the cryo version costs less (even after swapping up to larger solid boosters for a more expensive LV), and is easier to fly with 12x better TWR and no risk of losing power while in a planet\u0027s shadow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m preaching to the wrong crowd here, but the whole thing felt like a bit of a letdown. In real life, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that cryogenic hydrogen is a) cryogenic and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E invariably leaks, then it would be the ultimate chemical fuel. Currently, those two factors aren\u0027t a part of the mod. I feel that incorporating the cryogenic nature and leakyness of LH2 isn\u0027t a nerf, it\u0027s an opportunity to add an interesting gameplay mechanic in the same way the Heat Control added a really interesting game mechanic during 1.0.2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I feel like the mod already adds tremendously to the game. It gives interesting, powerful and realistic options for launches and upper stage boosters. I simply felt that the balance breaks down at a certain point, and it\u0027s worth mentioning since Nertea clearly values balance between his own mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T01:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Businfu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Businfu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERecently, I built two probes headed to the moons of jool, one with NFP Hall Thrusters, and one with Cryogenic H2/LOX.
