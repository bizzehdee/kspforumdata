I decided to watch a pc performance with KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe system consumption (without apps, only task manager) is 45%. In the pc I tested (8gb ram), it\u0027s about 3600mb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI open KSP. It\u0027s modded. Probably many mods. Some visual enchancment (scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E). Parts and Kerbal Konstructs. I installed community fixes so I could prevent the leaks. I load KSP and the consumption is almost full as I expected. Then I get to the home screen. At this point it\u0027s where the question comes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt home screen, the consumption of KSP is of 2.5gb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.5gb \u002B 3.6gb = 6,1gb. Everything ok. That should be about \u003Cstrong\u003E77%\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eof 8gb. But when I check the percentage, it shows \u003Cstrong\u003E91-94%\u003C/strong\u003E. There\u0027s something wrong there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoaded KSP again, and when memory consumption was at 2,3 gb, the percentage shows \u003Cstrong\u003E93%\u003C/strong\u003E. And in a certain moment, when consumption was at 1,7gb, it shown\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E97%\u003C/strong\u003E of RAM consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all of this, I mean: what is going on with the PC? Why is there a \u0022ghost memory\u0022 consumption even when I installed community fixes, which is supposed to reduce the memory leaks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis makes the game experience a bit worse. Any help would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
