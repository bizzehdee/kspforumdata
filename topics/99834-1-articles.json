Obviously, it ain\u0027t cheap to build and launch rockets! I propose that a monthly operating budget be put in place, so that way you can\u0027t just warp through time a hundred years without doing anything and then decide to launch a rocket, and have it done as smoothly and effortlessly as when the facility was brand new. You have to pay bills to keep the facility running like that. Another part of this proposition is to have a \u0022government\u0022 subsidize you at first, and the amount payed to you from the \u0022government\u0022 is in some way related to your reputation, much like the contracts. If you don\u0027t launch rockets for a long time you start to lose relevance, and who will hand money to the guys literally doing nothing? So you will lose funding, contracts dry up and you fizzle out of existence. Same with disasters; who is going to hand money to the guy who blew up three people and intends to do the exact same thing he did that caused the accident in the first place? With an event like this you have to try to work against your failure and restore your former glory to keep the public in your favor and keep that monetary lifeforce flowing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epart of the concept is that you can, in theory, do whatever the hell you want without HAVING to slave away at contracts; by flying to Duna you raise your prestige, and then you get more government funding. With more funding you can send that second rocket, and the more stuff you can do. Contracts serve to jumpstart your projects, basically making the campaign much more sandbox than it is currently, because currently you have no choice but to grind at contracts to get anywhere, and I don\u0027t know about you, but I really don\u0027t feel like testing tons and tons of rocket parts just to make a few more bucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T19:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly what you want, but take a look at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104000\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Payroll and Loans\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102911\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScience Funding\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
