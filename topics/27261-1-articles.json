Deciding to start small, I thought I\u0027d try creating a craft that would allow me to put a 1 Kerbal capsule on the Mun, and bring him home again. That went fine but I found myself ditching stages that were still carrying fuel, Hmm, I think, I wonder if this craft could also get to Minmus and back, so I tried it, and it did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice warm fuzzy feeling from building a craft that fulfilled the original brief and was good enough to go a step further.
