Back in the day, I was a fan of the stealth warship archetype that was defined by the USS sulaco. When I read that page several years ago, I couldn\u0027t believe that something as weak the space shuttles OMS engines (which have a thrust of just 26,700 newtons) could be detected past the orbit of mars! This didn\u0027t seem intuitively possible to me, so I pushed it out of my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, though, I\u0027ve started to look back on this topic and realize that I brushed it aside too quickly. The ability to detect the exhaust plume of a rocket at tens or hundreds of millions of km with an infrared telescope is a major problem if nations are ever planning to wage war in space. I looked at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/-E6r2F8rgnQ%5B151-175\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022]the math\u003C/a\u003E by john schilling which claims to prove this, and discovered that a 2 meter IR telescope is so sensitive, it can detect a single RCS on the space shuttle firing at a range of 15 million km. I don\u0027t have the talent to verify whether this is true or not, but again, it seems pretty unbelievable!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing thats not clear is whether john is referring to the primary RCS (thrust of 3870 newtons) or the vernier RCS (thrust of 106 newtons). Does anyone know the math behind how infrared telescopes work? Is it just a linear equation, I.E, you half the heat signature and decrease the detection range by half, or is it something more complex? Also, would using a very cold jet of gas forced out by mechanical pressure be more stealthy than a chemical rocket using superheated propellent?

The people watching via telescope would know that ships had been launched, but they wouldn\u0027t know how many or where they were going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting possibility: If you equip warships with a photon sail, you could use the stations lasers to boost them to their target without being detected. There might be some waste heat released by the beams interaction with the sail, but probably not enough to pick up via IR telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T03:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GreenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GreenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis topic has been done to death so much on rec.arts.sf.science, SFCONSIM-L, Rocketpunk Manifesto, Atomic Rockets, and basically anywhere else concerned with hard sci-fi.\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to a Rocketpunk Manifesto article \u002B comments on the subject.
