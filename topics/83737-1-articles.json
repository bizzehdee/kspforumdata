On Ubuntu, with the latest nvidia graphics drivers, using the dedicated GPU requires actively switching it on in the nvidia-settings program, before logging out and back in again. When playing KSP, I have always used the dedicated GPU, and experienced a small amount of lag, especially when flying near Kerbin\u0027s surface. I always thought this was normal for my laptop!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night however, I forgot to switch on the GPU, and accidentally started up KSP with the integrated graphics chip. Whilst the game didn\u0027t look great (no in-game anti-aliasing for linux, I usually force it with the nvidia driver) it ran incredibly smoothly, with a much higher frame rate that I\u0027ve ever had with the GPU (even with all settings, AA, anisotropic filtering etc. turned to a minimum)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know of any reason why my dedicated GPU could be performing much worse than the measly intel integrated graphics? Surely the performance should be way higher with the Nvidia chip?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gue__1","CreatedById":97916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T19:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour gtx630m should indeed be way faster but.....
