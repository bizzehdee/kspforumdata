This means that your only source of directional control is the reaction wheel inside your capsule which could be very weak compared to the aerodynamic forces acting on your craft. A better choice, if you have access to it, is the LV-T45 engine. It has the same aspect and slightly lower thrust, but it does have a gimbal to allow the engine to pivot and reorient the craft in flight. You can probably even get away with using a LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022. It\u0027s much lighter and more fuel efficient, but doesn\u0027t have nearly as much thrust, which may be just fine as a final stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also guessing that, unless you have turned down the throttle on your second stage, that you are going VERY fast when you switch to your upper stage. The faster you ram through the air, the more it amplifies any small deviation from forward and tends to turn you around. If you look at your g-force meter on the right side of your navball, or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (thrust-to-weight ratio) when you expand the stage column on the right, you really don\u0027t want to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR/\u003C/abbr\u003Eacceleration much higher than about 2 to 2.5 gees at most during your ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, make sure that your Science Jr. materials bay is connected directly to the top of that service bay. In your new screenshot it looks like the bottom of the Science Jr. is clipping through the top of the service bay and stuck to the top of something inside it. This can trick the game into creating more drag than there should be because it doesn\u0027t see a smooth connection between those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(P.S. - I also noticed that you\u0027re getting the bug that creates multiple copies of the delta-v icon. As far as I\u0027m aware, this is happening on console when you switch engines in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and it adds another delta-v app to recalculate the numbers for the new engine. Until there is a fix for this I think the best way to prevent this is to try and limit how often you replace engines while building in the editor.
