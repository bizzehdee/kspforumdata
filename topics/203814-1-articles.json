The downside is that it looks like a lot of mods haven\u0027t been updated. Is there enough improvement in jank and stability to make it worth the trouble and loss of mods, or is it more of the same, just with more features?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-16T10:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, don\u2019t update to 1.12 yet. You could try updating to 1.10 or 1.11 and most mods should still work just fine (or get updates to make them better), but 1.12 is still a work in progress and will be updated again in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokamak","CreatedById":115593,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-16T17:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNoted.
