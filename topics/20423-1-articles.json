I\u0027m attempting to make a small craft that can land on a planet from about 100KM off the ground, then return to that orbit. I know this is probably impossible but it\u0027d still be nice to see if anyone can pull off- my intent is to use this as the lander for my interplanetary craft, and then rendezvous with the main ship to \u0027return\u0027 the crew member for the trip home. Anyone think they can pull this off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use mods; just list which. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote; This would be -just- the lander, re-ascent module.
