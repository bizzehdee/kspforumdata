This may complicate debugging, but I can confirm that until today, this issue did not exist.\n\nHowever, I ran into a new issue today with Procedural Fairings 3.11; fairing1.tga does not load. It\u0027s not a huge issue for me, as I\u0027m running a separate FStextureSwitch2 config with modulemanager to allow me to change between fairing textures (if fairing1.tga is in the MM config it won\u0027t load either). As a result, the thumbnails in the VAB for the parts are untextured, *but* due to the texture switching config, things work fine. If the MM config references any specific texture already mentioned in the base fairing part configs, i.e. fairing1.tga, the same error will appear, and the texture will not appear in FStextureswitch. However, the other textures will load properly.\n\nAttached is an example config for PF (I am running several custom fairing shapes as well) that I use, as well as the MM config I use to add Texture Switch functionality. *There have been no issues with this before today.* I\u0027m stumped as to what this may be. It may have appeared in Procedural Fairings before, with one other user, but there was no response to his question and it was never resolved.\n\nI will provide additional information if requested.\n\n**This is the output.log line in question**\n\n    Texture load error in \u0027C:\\Users\\D\\Documents\\Gaming\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\ProceduralFairings\\fairing1.tga\u0027\n\n**These are all plugin mods that I use**\n\n    Toolbar 1.7.8Contract Configurator 0.7.15Crew Manifest 0.5.10.0CrossFeedEnablercross 3.2Deadly Reentry 6.4.0DMagic Orbital Science 1.0Firespitter (unsure of version, included with MKS)Habitat Pack 0.4KER 1.0.15.2KJR 3.1.2Hyperedit 1.3KM Gimbal 2.2 (I believe)MechJeb 2.4.2ModuleRCSFX 3.0NavyFish Docking Port Alignment Indicator 6.1Near Future Electrical 0.3.1Near Future Propulsion 0.4.0Near Future Solar 0.4.0PlanetShine 0.2.2.3PreciseNode 1.1.2[B]Procedural Fairings 3.11[/B]RealChute 1.3.1RemoteTech 1.6.3SmokeScreen 2.5.3StockBugFix Modules 0.1.7d[B]StockDragFix 1.1 (My most recent install, yesterday.
