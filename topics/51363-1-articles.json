So the same continents are always basked in daylight or in permanent night time. Is this a feature which could be implemented in future versions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T23:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re referring to -- planets do rotate about their axis in the game.
