Efficiency is a ratio between two factors, in this case is a ratio between space travelled and fuel spent. While you proceed in the career mode, you unlock even more parts, and that make think that more is better, but it is not that simple. The best thing to do for all types of vessels are to keep things simple and efficient, and take time, don\u0027t expect to bring in orbit a 300 t probe in one shot or to fly a 100 t airship without praying the God of struts. So here\u0027s my advices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets: don\u0027t build them too heavy, do multiple modules on multiple launches. Keep things as simple as possible. For just exploring the space i usually use the lightest manned capsule, so that i can do eva and crew report with the kerbinaut. I add the minimum of science parts, i try to foresee the fuel i will spend for my destination and back, plus an extra for inconvenients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes: they are maybe the most difficult thing to build because they must be stable and manoeuvrable at the same time. Some rules are that center of mass must be slightly in front of the center of lift always, even when tanks are empty. I usually don\u0027t attach anything to the wings and keep everything on the fuselage lines, exept maybe air inlets or light parts. Strut everything, especially wings and fuselage and gear bays and fuselage, so that nothig is too wobbly. Usually i use 2 types of wings: the main couple of wings evolving from the center of mass backwards, for roll control. Two other wings on the tails as horizontal stabilizers for pitch control, one vertical of nearly the same size of the previous 2 for yaw control. Canards are helpful if the aircraft won\u0027t lift even at 120 / 130 m/s on the runway. I usually place one or two engine in line with the center of mass, so that in case one of the engines flame out i still have yaw authority. This is an example of mine: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/duf3tJm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EXF-101C\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of mass should be roughly in the center of the vessel , never in the back, so put fuel tanks in the front, otherwise you will flip over even if center of lift is behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes are even harder than aircrafts in my opinion, because you have to consider that that thing must travel huge distances, maybe enter an atmosphere, land, get out, travel again and get back to kerbin and land.. All of this in one ship, all that science in one vessel and all that fuel in one vessel. Just follow the rules for the aircrafts and your\u0027 re fine. In space your worst enemy, the atmosphere, is not present. Just make it simple and stabilize it with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefueling stations: there\u0027s not any rule, I just make it as big, deformed as i want, just make it in modules and launch them separately, otherwise you will struggle too much for nothing sending in orbit a rocket that with fairings looks like a mushroom because on top is too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel lines: asparagus are the best way to launch something in orbit.

Refueling / interplanetary\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the 1st step in everything is to decide on the mission objectives. Then think of how to accomplish them. This all determines what type(s) of vehicle(s)/base(s) you need and how many. Then start designing the payloads and their supporting infrastructure, if any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Same as you. Design the payload, then pile rockets under it until necessary dV achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The main purpose for building a ground base is to refuel things. Because landing just for fuel is bad economics, ground refueling bases are primarily for permanent residents, such as refueling non-SSTO airplanes on Laythe. Secondarily, they refuel ships that land there for other purposes, like rotating crew. This all being the case, you just need the minimal structure that can do the fueling. If you want to set up housing units, just land hitchhikers. All this worry about linking up base modules is unnecessary complication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I don\u0027t do many spaceplanes. To be useful, they have to carry some payload to orbit and it\u0027s always a lot simpler just to use a rocket for that, especially if the payload is more than a couple of Kerbals. Now, I build a lot of airplanes that can\u0027t reach orbit by themselves, for just flying around. Sometimes there\u0027s no way to get these to other planets than to build a spaceplane ascent stage for them. But otherwise, there\u0027s very little practical need for spaceplanes. About the only practical application for them would be once Laythe gets multiple biomes. Then you could have a small spaceplane flying 1 goo and 1 bay back and forth to an orbiting mobile lab/fuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A space station is just another form of rocket. It has a mission payload and it has to fly to where you park it, so there\u0027s really no difference. I make very few permanent space stations. Mostly, I make ephemeral stations by docking together various separate payloads to accomplish some task. Once the job\u0027s done, the parts separate and go their separate ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I am a firm believer in sending flotillas of relatively small interplanetary ships instead of trying to cram everything into 1 monster ship. All these little ships have their own transfer tugs and docking ports all over, so I hook them up into expedient stations or improvise new missions for them on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to refueling, within the Kerbin system it\u0027s a total waste of time, energy, and money to do Kethane. It\u0027s always more efficient to just send a fuel barge up from Kerbin. At other planets, the infrastructure varies with the specific place and what you\u0027re doing. If you want to explore lots of a planet from a hub on its surface, then you need a refueling base on the planet, which just refuels stuff flying around the planet and going back to orbit. For stuff that stays in orbit, you need to get kethane from the most conveniently located low-gravity place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a Duna expedition, you want fuel from Ike. Ike is so close to Duna and has such low gravity that you can afford to do it very simple. Just put all the kethane drills and refinery on 1 lander that flies back and forth between Ike and ships in Duna orbit, delivering finished product. For supporting a Jool-based flotialla, which is itself supporting a Laythe expedition, you need something rather more complex. In this case, you\u0027d be drilling on Vall. This is big and far away from Laythe so you have to be economical in the movement of the stuff. I\u0027d recommend a big lander that does nothing but lift Kethane from Vall to orbit, where it loads the kethane into a flying tank that goes back and forth between Vall and Laythe. The drills would stay on the surface of Vall. You\u0027d also need refineries at least at Laythe, probably also on the ground and in orbit at Laythe. At least that\u0027s how I\u0027m doing it right now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T19:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not done much in the way of docking components in orbital assembly.

For SSTO spaceplanes, I used to use a SINGLE turbojet engine, because when a flameout occurred, the craft was not prone to lose its heading and angle.
