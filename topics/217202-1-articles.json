I can clearly see additions to the names of the mod folders such as you would find on the zip file, typically the version number. That means that the contents (relative to GameData) are not where they should be so parts (and other things) will break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral mods will either have their mod folder at the very top level in their zip or under a GameData folder in the zip. The general idea is that: If there isn\u0027t a GameData folder, the first folder is the mod folder and this goes right into GameData, and shouldn\u0027t be a subfolder of something else (like the folder that is created when you right-click -\u0026gt; unzip and make folder; If there is a GameData folder then you have a reference for where everything goes if there are multiple mod folders and if there are things that shouldn\u0027t go into GameData by default, like sample ships and optional extra patches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s good to know this for the sake of understanding how mod installs work and not to be at the mercy of whether a mod manager exists and happens to provide for the mod you want.
