It also adds specialised parts to deal with this problem as well as waste heat output by solar panels and nuclear generators, being heatsink panels. The closest the Challenger has ever managed to get in a circular orbit is 14,800m, closest in an elliptical orbit (but not survived through the second orbital periapse) was 1367m. You might be able to get even closer with varying heatsink configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that being so deep in the gravity well will mean you\u0027re travelling at ludicrous speeds, exceeding 85km/s. Thrust vectoring in the wrong direction even for a second could be the difference between flying off into deep space and making a smear on the sun\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE RULES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - All structural mods valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Only attempt this challenge if you have KSPInterstellar mod installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Usual \u0022No \u0027Sploits\u0022 rules apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Your station must contain at least one Kerbal in a capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Your station must contain an electrical power source (nuclear, RTG or solar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Your orbital eccentricity must be a value between 0 and 0.99~ (ie a closed ellipse).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Your station must survive for three orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCORING:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeriapse in m.
