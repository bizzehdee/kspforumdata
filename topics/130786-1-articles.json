When right-clicking, sometimes the cursor will disappear and the camera will start spinning. This happens about 20% of the time I right-click - no discernible pattern as of yet. The problem can generally be resolved by right-clicking again, but by that point I have usually crashed. (Into Kerbin, not to desktop!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect Windows is doing something dubious with the right-click here. Any suggestions on how to resolve it? I did find some instances of this occurring back in August/September but saw nothing as regards to a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trenchfoot","CreatedById":92783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T04:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how to fix it, but I\u0027ve noticed the same thing with my game. \u00A0I\u0027ll all the sudden have a vicious change of view when I go to click the other side of the screen. \u00A0Seems to like to happen on the right click that clears context menus...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T07:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a bug. It is an annoying feature added in 1.0.5. If you double right-click it locks the camera to the cursor.

In I think the very first tab of the settings (note: NOT in the input section) there is an option called something like \u0022double click mouse look\u0022.
