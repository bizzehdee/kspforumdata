The superior tells him that the Research Facility has found something they want him to have a look at. During an operation in (insert current war), a sudden incident happened out of nowhere and a whole platoon went missing. The last transmission heard from the platoon was\u00A0a\u00A0strange blip on the radar/noise/signal cut-out/sensor reading\u00A0similar to what was observed in the classified incident back in (insert war that happened a decade or two earlier) where our pilot hero lost many of his men and which caused him to retire. Cue our hero saying \u0022they\u0027re back\u0022 for the trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur hero is taken to the Air Force/Space Force/Army Force/Underground Force/Navy Force\u00A0base, stopping for a moment to admire a museum piece of an aircraft/spacecraft/car/boat/drill tank from his days in service on display outside the building. He\u0027s then taken straight into a briefing with a live link to soldiers in the field, going to see what happened to the platoon that went missing\u00A0in the previous incident. He observes the scene for three seconds and asks one question, whereupon he scolds\u00A0the general\u00A0and scientists for making rookie mistakes, asking them at once to pull out the soldiers. Just as he does so, The Incident happens again and the link to the soldiers is lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur hero is given command of a team of special ops soldiers, and asked to investigate The Incident further. There\u0027s a scene in a big hangar-like laboratory\u00A0where all sorts of generic science/manufacturing/equipment testing\u00A0is performed at scattered tables out in the open. Here,\u00A0the team is kitted out with the best and most advanced\u00A0equipment government money can buy.\u00A0As our hero gears up,\u00A0he manages to break the fragile equipment by poking it with a finger,\u00A0but easily wins a training exercise by relying on his instincts instead of the equipment. The scientists are all upset that he didn\u0027t use the equipment the way he was supposed to. Cue a quip about the equipment not being designed the way it was supposed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe little platoon is sent out to encounter The Incident, in the best and newest\u00A0aircraft/spacecraft/car/boat/drill tank available. Something mysterious happens that disables all the equipment and renders it useless, and after a thrilling action scene, our hero and a few of the soldiers barely escape with their lives. When they manage it back to base, they hear that The Incident is spreading, and the scientists have no idea what is happening. Fortunately, our hero has made an observation nobody else has, and he knows how to counter The Incident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientists are eager to equip him with the newest and best tech. Our hero refuses. The scientists insist, saying that \u0022this is the best and most advanced piece of technology ever assembled.\u0022 Cue something breaking spectacularly in the background, proving our hero right. Instead, the museum piece from the display outside the building is brought up on the runway, filled with fuel and obsolete ammunition, and our hero takes it to The Incident. The old equipment is immune to whatever disables the modern equipment.\u00A0Our hero wins the day and saves the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, while the story might be too clich\u00E9d to ever have been written in full, the sentiments linger in Hollywood screenwriting: Don\u0027t rely on anything modern, because it will always be useless. Trust your own experience instead of that of professionals - they are always wrong. The equipment used Back In Your Day is superior to anything that has been made since. Old technology will save us. The very newest generation of tech is likely to be outright evil.\u00A0People in lab coats know nothing. Expertise is useless unless it comes from a guy without a formal education. One lone scientist may be right, but the entire scientific community is generally wrong.\u00A0And of course, love conquers all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the story is sci-fi, always expect the heroes to represent the old ways, the famers, the everyman, while the technologically advanced society is evil. The Empire furnishes their extravagant headquarters in\u00A0polished metal and sleek iPod lines where not a speck of dust is visible. The resistance base is dirty, untidy, and\u00A0full of outdated tech hobbled together with tape and wire. Small woodland creatures with sticks and stones will eventually defeat the tanks and lasers of the Empire. Sleek and modern = evil and decadent, old and used = salt of the Earth (at least up to a certain point - if the grime and wear extends to poor lightning as well as poor cleaning, it crosses over into being the lair of a serial killer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStar Wars\u003C/em\u003E is the prime example here, but you can see it in \u003Cem\u003EThe Hunger Games\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003EPacific Rim\u003C/em\u003E too. The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EJurassic Park\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0series is basically all about how teeth and claws are better than guns and how science brings nothing but hubris. Same goes for the recent\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPlanet of the Apes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0trilogy.\u00A0I believe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBattleship\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0made a similar point about old vs. new technology, although I didn\u0027t watch it. In\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EArmageddon\u003C/em\u003E, a bunch of oil drillers outsmart all of NASA for an operation in space.\u00A0In\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EIndependence Day\u003C/em\u003E, a TV repair man creates a computer virus that destroys the alien mothership while the scientists at Area 51 are killed by the very thing they are supposed to have been studying for years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a little annoyed with this \u0022science is useless and technology is evil\u0022 narrative, to say the least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T17:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ Thats the nice thing about Interstellar.

Then they arrive on that very surface to find out to their great surprise that the beacon that had kept sending emergency signals for 25 years was still active because... only one hour had passed on the surface! Who could have foreseen that! And then they go back up to rendezvous with the mothership, and are shocked to find the guy onboard to be 25 years older. It\u0027s also a plot point that massive tidal forces from the black hole would regularly send enormous tidal waves around the planet, but everybody fails to notice this before they land. In short, the entire scene portrays scientists as incompetent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then at the very end, they throw science out the window and decide to show how feelings and intuitions are better tools for making decisions rather than assessing the facts, and it produces better results too!
