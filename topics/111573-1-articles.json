There are contracts for:\n\n- Biome studies - collecting results from a number of experiments in a single biome.\n- Climate studies - performing various climate experiments on bodies with atmospheres.\n- Geological studies - performing geological experiments on various biomes of a celestial body.\n- Experimental studies - run one experiment under multiple conditions (including experiments from mods).\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Science - contract to go around and collect all the various small science around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n- Scientist Ferry - bring a scientist to a specific location to perform a specific experiment.\n- Rare Science - contract with suggested location for difficult biome/situation combinations (eg. Splashed down at Kerbin\u0027s Mountains).\n- Re-run experiment - contracts for science completionists - re-run an already done experiment to get a little bit more science out of it.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The contract pack works for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and planet packs - you will receive contracts for any celestial body that is loaded in the game.\n- This mod disables the stock \u0022Collect Science\u0022 contracts, as they become somewhat redundant when this is installed.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/R9WvJ](https://imgur.com/a/R9WvJ)\n\n**Download**\n\n***\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E***: In [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154922-ckan-the-comprehensive-kerbal-archive-network-v1251-broglio/), select and download the mod \u0022Contract Pack: Field Research\u0022.\n\n***GitHub***: For the direct download option, please ensure you have all the dependencies before raising a support request:\n\n1.

Regarding the second point, should these contracts really ask you to do science at KSC with science equipment that\u0027s like 3000 science to unlock? Especially considering what you said about them disappearing once you go interplanetary...\n\nPerhaps I need to rethink the KSC science contracts. KSC science is a silly grindy mess if you try to get it all (it was *okay* before the upgradable buildings came into play, but the fact that you can get reports for \u0022R\u0026D East Lab\u0022 and junk like that is a bit silly). I\u0027m sort of okay with it asking for the stuff that\u0027s late in the tree as long as the unlocking bugs are fixed with the mods that are adding experiments in their own way. But you\u0027re right... if the player has spent 3000 to unlock their super-late game experiment, they probably don\u0027t want to drag it around KSC for 10 science a pop at a bunch of random buildings.\n\nAnother thing I realized is broken is that some of the biomes don\u0027t actually exist until you upgrade the particular facilties (R\u0026D especially).\n\nSo, opinions, people?

Great work. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sort of okay with it asking for the stuff that\u0027s late in the tree as long as the unlocking bugs are fixed with the mods that are adding experiments in their own way. But you\u0027re right... if the player has spent 3000 to unlock their super-late game experiment, they probably don\u0027t want to drag it around KSC for 10 science a pop at a bunch of random buildings.\n\u003E Another thing I realized is broken is that some of the biomes don\u0027t actually exist until you upgrade the particular facilties (R\u0026D especially).\n\u003E \n\u003E So, opinions, people? Should I just toss them entirely? Or are there some easy changes I can make to improve them?\n\nHow about asking for experiments to be done after or with Anomaly Surveyor contracts?\n\nI am only assuming this is easy fix since you did those contracts. Additional field science trips make you add ground stations around an Anomaly. Or add research in other interesting areas. Which must be revisited as more experiments get unlocked. I agree, it would be good to check if an experiment is unlocked and \u0022owned\u0022 in the tech tree by just looking at the node. Easy said that done with way some experiment mods seem to work. \n\nI also think that station science needs looked at. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I assume that they aren\u0027t valid landed places other than KSC either, right? If that is the case it almost seems like this might be an issue with station science, as I check whether the situation (landed/flying/in space/etc.) and experiment combination is valid according to the KSP API. Regardless, I\u0027ll need to do some digging, as with Orbital Science.\n\nThese experiments seem to be checking location twice. They can only be started in orbit and finished when recovered. More importantly they require resources that can only be provided by larger station parts. I really like that as you need to plan out space station logistics. It would be great if you looked into this more if it deviates from the KSP API. it might provide a way to chain contracts together in a flexible way.
