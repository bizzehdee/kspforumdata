Once I started playing I realized that a lot of the mods I was using with 1.6.1 were not going to work with 1.7 and I had quite a few really nice ships. I therefore went back to 1.6.1 and reinstalled all of the mods that I had been using before but neither\u00A0MechJeb nor\u00A0Kerbal Reusability Expansions are working now. I\u0027m fairly new to modding games on MacOs so if there is someone that could help me out and walk me through the process I would greatly appreciate the help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-05T16:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese threads might help you out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182950-tutorial-how-to-install-mods-manually-ckan/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E[Tutorial] How to install mods (manually \u0026amp; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E) - Tutorials - Kerbal Space Program Forums\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173371-how-to-get-old-versions-of-mods/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHow to get old versions of Mods - Add-on Discussions - Kerbal Space Program Forums\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aflacfire1","CreatedById":197307,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-05T17:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Gargamel, I\u0027ve followed the instructions on manually installing mods and neither MechJeb nor Kerbal Reusability Expansion are working. When I start the game I get a message saying that MechJeb is installed incorrectly and gives me the order in which it should appear. I checked my files and it appears that everything is in its correct spot. I don\u0027t know if it matters but I am using MacOS. Can you please explain things further?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
