So you dont need permission to bundle with your mod. \n\nYou do need to include attribution, as well as a copy of their respective licenses in your download.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T21:50:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T01:18:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m also fairly certain that if you redistribute their mods your mod must have the same license they do."},{"CreatedByName":"Dunrana","CreatedById":138830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T01:43:43Z","Content":"well the post about Kopernicus includes the statment\n\nPlanned features:\n\n - Free software (LGPL) license\n\neverything i can find about this (I\u0027m not even sure i found anything *about* it) is in legal language that I can\u0027t make heads or tails of."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T02:24:24Z","Content":"It is usually better to link to dependencies rather than bundling them.
