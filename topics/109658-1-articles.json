This is against the forums rules as per 2.2. So I\u0027ve devised this for players to refer to before posting on a thread.\n\nIf the thread has not gotten a post after 2 months- please do NOT respond! The thread is DEAD. Leave it ALONE and DO NOT post unless the thread owner has done so within 2 days prior.\n\nIf you used the forum\u0027s built in search feature and or altered the order of listing on the forums then please, find the last post on that thread and see if it a abides by the forementioned rule.\n\nIf you feel the thread should be \u0022revived\u0022 or brought back- then please ask the thread owner BEFORE posting! If the thread isn\u0027t worth doing this then it isn\u0027t worth reviving!\n\nIf the thread says its \u0022closed\u0022 by the thread owner, but isn\u0027t locked then please listen to the owner and DO NOT post on that thread!!\n\nIf your trying to solve someone\u0027s technical problem with KSP prior to 2015, ignore the thread and do not respond. The problem they had is more than likely solved by the time you find it. There is nothing more annoying than reading someone\u0027s comment from 1.0 to a person who was playing in .18. \n\nIf your posting on a thread of a mod for KSP, then please check if the thread has been moved!!! Mods can change hands and or be moved to new threads for various reasons. So we ask that you understand this and do NOT post on the original thread.\n\nI hope you find this enlightening. I will be adding to it as time goes on and if you have problems with it let me know. This is just my PSA for the day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T20:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:13:35Z","Content":"\\*COUGH\\*\n\n\u0022Necromoaning\u0022 also goes against the forum rules.\n\nThough it is getting excessive, I would suggest not pointing it out."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:15:15Z","Content":"You know, there\u0027s a little button called \u0022Report Post\u0022, it\u0027s quite useful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:16:32Z","Content":"What Starwhip said.
