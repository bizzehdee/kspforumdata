This is against the forums rules as per 2.2. So I\u0027ve devised this for players to refer to before posting on a thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the thread has not gotten a post after 2 months- please do NOT respond! The thread is DEAD. Leave it ALONE and DO NOT post unless the thread owner has done so within 2 days prior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you used the forum\u0027s built in search feature and or altered the order of listing on the forums then please, find the last post on that thread and see if it a abides by the forementioned rule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel the thread should be \u0022revived\u0022 or brought back- then please ask the thread owner BEFORE posting!

The problem they had is more than likely solved by the time you find it. There is nothing more annoying than reading someone\u0027s comment from 1.0 to a person who was playing in .18. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your posting on a thread of a mod for KSP, then please check if the thread has been moved!!! Mods can change hands and or be moved to new threads for various reasons. So we ask that you understand this and do NOT post on the original thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you find this enlightening.
