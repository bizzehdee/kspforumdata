It nominally includes the map camera as a case, but doesn\u0027t render anything when that case is called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess there is something special about the PlanetariumCamera class that stops it from rendering the way a regular camera does, but I have no idea what yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am open to any suggestions, and will also ask for help on espernet and reddit, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any pointers you can offer,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAinamogel\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
