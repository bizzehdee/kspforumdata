I\u0027ve just started a career mode with the new update this week. Anyone know how to do research? Also how can i fit a parachute that doesn\u0027t deploy as soon as I launch? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard, fresh meat... I mean, Kerbonaut! You can only do research in career mode, by bringing along scientific instruments, recovering the science they\u0027ve done (right click on them), and then spending the science in the R\u0026amp;D complex. To switch around when things deploy, you can edit the staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit staging while in the Editor through klicking on the symbols on the right and dragging them into another stage. You can create new stages with the small \u0022\u002B\u0022-button. Every time you click space while inflight will activate the lowest stage. This stage will then disappear and everything still attached will shift into the new lowest stage. Thats how you can make complex rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
