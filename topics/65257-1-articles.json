You strut the two wings together, strut the near wing to the fuselage, and run one strut from the fuselage to the end of the far wing. When you stack them up into bi-plane and tri-plane configurations, you run a strut between near each wing layer near the far end (that way the wings flex the same and don\u0027t collide with one another during flight, which as with most things in the game is generally a Bad Thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam Intakes are what you want to stick to; they bring in the largest amount of air.

What does happen is that an engine that isn\u0027t getting enough air will start to \u0022roll back.\u0022 Basically at a certain level of intake air, the thrust output will gradually decrease with a continued reduction of intake air. The engine will roll back a certain amount, but eventually not enough air is available and that engine will flame out. You can reduce the air that engine requires by reducing the throttle and, hence, keep it running a bit longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis becomes more obvious when flying multi-engine designs. At some point one of the engines won\u0027t have enough intake air because one engine gobbles up all it needs, then the second engine doesn\u0027t have its full requirement. That\u0027s why multi-engine designs will begin to yaw before an engine actually flames out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in some regard, KSP does \u0022auto-throttle\u0022 in a very limited sense. The engine isn\u0027t \u0022on/off,\u0022 but the effect isn\u0027t quite the same as actually reducing throttles. At high altitude, you can sometimes run on less than one notch of throttle and it\u0027s enough thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag as you leave the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m feeling aggressive about it with multi-engines, I watch the trim axes for when the SAS inputs yaw, then begin throttle reductions.

Unlike Capi, that might be less than 1/3 thrust. Also, you can get away with starting the rockets but still flying your TurboJet profile for a while.
