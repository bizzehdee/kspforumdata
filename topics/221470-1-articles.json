Entirely solar powered (no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E). Enough battery capacity to make it through the night, and solar panels to recharge during daylight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the flying is done with MechJeb Autopilot, though there is a crew of two, and I have done a lot of manual flying, perhaps not a complete manual circumnavigation, but I have sat and watched it when not flying hands-on, and diverted manually to places that looked interesting. I don\u0027t know how many hours I have watched this plane, but I\u0027m certain that I\u0027d be embarrassed to enumerate them here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy sheer accident, I discovered the cruising speed of 175m/s seems to be approximately sun-synchronous. So while flying West (in daylight), the sun remains pinned above, and the solar panels do all the work leaving the battery fully charged continuously. Indeed, were I to only fly west, I could save a lot of weight and carry no battery at all. Flying east leaves the battery about 1/4 full when the sun rises and begins recharging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6000m was chosen as a compromise. It flys faster at lower altitude (200m/s@5000m), but you have a much higher chance of hitting a mountain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the mission elapsed time. I don\u0027t know how many circumnavigations that is, but I did leave it going while I slept. This was essentially my screensaver for a couple of days. Also, at reduced performance, it can carry 1200u liquid fuel anywhere for free, and with a very low stall speed, can land quite safely pretty much anywhere vaguley flat for refueling missions. Also Note, time acceleration does not work with these props, so by necessity, it was all realtime.
