I meant above. Previously). It affects density. If there really is a bug in RSS it can ONLY be in the temperature or pressure curve. RSS doesn\u0027t have anything else that can affect density except those two things. FAR does everything else including actual density implementation and application of the forces that are destroying your plane. You might have been playing with FAR for a year and a half but I\u0027ve contributed code and support to RSS for as long as it\u0027s been around and I know how it works internally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T21:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
