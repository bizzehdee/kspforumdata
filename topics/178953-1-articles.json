If you want realism, try \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E (if you want to go super-realistic then you could even try \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E). If you want to add to the stock system, the Outer Planets mod is awesome. If you want a whole new system, maybe try Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack. Alternatively, the unique Before Kerbin and After Kerbin depict the Kerbol System 2 billion years in the past and 2 billion years in the future, respectively. They\u0027re all brilliant, so it\u0027s really up to you which one you like the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough if you\u0027re going to go for one that replaces the stock system, make a new KSP install first! Otherwise the planet pack will most likely corrupt your saves and delete all of your progress. Kopernicus is a dependency for planet packs too, so make sure you have that installed. Happy planet-ing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
