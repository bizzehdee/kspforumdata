I clear the crew in the VAB, but every time I go back to the VAB it always recrews the vehicle. I don\u0027t want to send kerbals up until the station is done. I just get annoyed that I have to keep clearing crew and that it does not save that setting. I think it would be a good idea to have it set up for vehicles that if you dont want crew you only have to clear that once and it saves that as an aspect of the ship like action groups or what the ship is made of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T04:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes it is a bit anoying, however it is the first update since the new crew stuff so it is expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T04:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem, IIRC, is that every time you change something with your ship, the .craft file is edited, so the crew is reset.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"recon14193","CreatedById":58756,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T14:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand that because this is the first update with crew that this is to be expected, but that is the point of a suggestion.

So many times last night I was trying to launch my station core (Unmanned, obviously) and it kept putting a single Kerb in the Cupola module I had attached. Ungodly annoying, yes, and I do believe it\u0027s worthy of taking a look at integrating the crew into the .craft file, however, this could possibly break some craft that had been previously made, so we do need to think of the other implications of doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T17:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022recon14193\u0022 data-cite=\u0022recon14193\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not a computer guy, so I have no idea what IIRC means, but it sounds like it would mean a large amount of overhaul with the devs, which I would like to lessen, so they can work on bettering the game through new features e.g. resources campaign.
