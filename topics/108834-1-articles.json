Tylo is great for rovers.\n\nThe other moons are kind of boring for me. Mun, Ike and Dres are all pretty much the same in terms of appearance, terrain and gravity, same goes for Gilly, Bop and Pol (which are also kind of annoying to land on due to the extremely low gravity)."},{"CreatedByName":"KAP1985","CreatedById":140692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:46:10Z","Content":"Laythe, by far"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:48:21Z","Content":"When Valentina bends over\n\nOops, I mean Vall, the moon of Jool, without fuel from which any colony on Laythe would be cut off from Kerbin except at excessive expense."},{"CreatedByName":"Teutooni","CreatedById":76518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:54:31Z","Content":"Laythe - beautiful ocean moon with a breathable atmosphere, what\u0027s not to like?"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:00:01Z","Content":"i like minmus and laythe the best. Minmus\u0027s close range and very low gravity make it very easy to get to even with some very unwieldy craft, not to mention the gravity is to the point i can actually LAND a 500t capital ship and take off again. Laythe is well interesting for boats\u002Bjets. Get a refinery down there, and my new amphibious flying rovers can go all over the place as needed, be it driving, flying, or boating. Laythe is also in the jool system, imo the best place in the entire kerbol system due to how many planets/things to do there are there.\n\nAfterwards id have to say duna, it just look so epic with dust storms enabled using EVE mod, not to mention the sheer amount of battles ive had on that planet, and bases ive made. Its mostly my fav place to do combat due to the redness (red = violent color i think) and the fact that quite a few of the sci-fi RTS games ive played had mars or something very similar to mars in it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T01:02:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:09:46Z","Content":"I\u0027d also say Minmus and Laythe.
