And it\u0027s a fun thought, but because how rockets work, the power loss probably doesn\u0027t even have to be compensated. After all, the vehicle loses mass as it rises. If the power level reaching it goes down, its thrust will suffer, but that only means that the TWR is kept roughly stable along the way. Which you want anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\u0027m wondering more how they plan to run the infrastructure. That\u0027s the one point that wasn\u0027t really addressed... they plan to have a whole square kilometer worth of microwave emitters. Land is cheap in New Mexico, but machines need maintenance. These are going to be very complex machines, and there will be a lot of them, and they\u0027ll have to finance the entire thing up front because they can\u0027t run with half an array.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that they\u0027re actually building hardware that shows the basic premise works, the key factor in this business proposal, I reckon, will be whether or not they save enough on the launch vehicle to pay for the transmitter infrastructure... \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E do so while lowering prices. I think the guy was pretty smart noting that he\u0027s not planning to compete with large rockets that cost $4k per kg to orbit, but rather with the smallsat launchers where even the ambitious startups currently under development run around $25k per kg to orbit. For all the talk of lowering prices to three digits, I think that\u0027s pure marketing spin, and the company will rely on feeding on that huge gap between the smallsat launchers and the heavy lifters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in a way, if they can manage to bring the price for smallsat launches down to almost paritywith heavy lifters, down to say $5k per kg to orbit, that\u0027s still an enormous gain for the market - an 80% price reduction would be a major enabler, one that companies like Rocket Labs or Firefly aren\u0027t going to manage. Or let it be $15k for the first generation vehicle, it would still be a big deal if it actually works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it works out for the same cost as other smallsat launchers, then well, I suppose it\u0027s still a really cool technology (I know I\u0027d love to see launch footage of such a craft at least once), and good for them to have a viable if unexciting business, but to really move something forward it needs to actually keep those promises and be more than just competitive with traditional chemical rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T18:50:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E200 megawatts is nothing, considering how the space shuttle used like 12x that.

The concept of beamed power is actually being slapped on to a lot of concept studies in a way that almost makes them seem like a Deus Ex Machina.
