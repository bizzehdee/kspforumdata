I\u0027m looking for a mod that adds either more planets or another star with planets. I thought I saw Scott Manley have an entire solar system way way out in the distance in one of his videos. I don\u0027t really need the extra parts to get there.

It\u0027s really a work in progress, but you can use it to make planets. I don\u0027t know if they got stars working yet, though.\n\nAlso, there\u0027s some activity in the [Kopernicus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88168-Early-development-0-24-Kopernicus-Planetary-System-Modifier) thread. Kopernicus was the second big planet-creation attempt, but it\u0027s pretty much died off until recently.\n\nThere\u0027s also [Starsystems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99353-0-25-StarSystems-v0-2-%28Nov-6%29-Under-New-Managment?p=1526154#post1526154), which allows star creation and planetary system modification (though not planet creation). However, it hasn\u0027t been updated in a while.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, I think KopernicusTech does allow star creation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T17:12:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T17:45:21Z","Content":"I second Vaporo\u0027s movement.
