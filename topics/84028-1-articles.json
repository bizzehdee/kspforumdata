For some reason, and going against basic common sense, Microsoft thought that PCs were going overwelmingly switch to touch screens.

Taking your hands of the keyboard and raising them up and bending over to reach your screen is not natural.

They want the same user experience on their home PCs as on their work PCs, and they also have the same habits and muscle-memory acquired from nearly 20 years of using the Start menu (since Windows 95).

Transpose that sort of behavior to a car (inverting controls, moving them around, or suddenly replacing the steering wheel with a joystick depending on the type of road you\u0027re on) and it would be a disaster. The whole experience is utterly confusing for most users, and for those that have adapted to it, it requires constant metal gymnastics just to remember how to close an app or to access the settings, which gets in the way of concentrating on the task you are actually doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T12:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut simply if you don\u0027t have a touchscreen it\u0027s harder to use and is doesn\u0027t really make sense.

The desktop lost its start button because Microsoft wanted to push us into the Modern UI, which I don\u0027t think was a reasonable decision. Unless you took the tour, you didn\u0027t even know how to pull up the charms so that you could do anything other than run programs on the desktop or the taskbar once you were on the desktop. Seriously, if you didn\u0027t know how to pull up the charms and were looking at the desktop in 8.0, you\u0027d have no clue how to as much as turn the computer off. This led to a lot of bad impressions. They changed the way things worked on the desktop and just expected us to follow along, without telling us how to follow along. Hence the desktop felt rather neutered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the Modern UI issues. The Modern UI treated mouse users as a second class citizen, almost all of our 25 years of experience thrown out the window, replaced in favor of faking touchscreen gestures. It felt clunky, and scrolling with a mouse wasn\u0027t very smooth on the one non-touchscreen laptop I use that had Win 8.0 for a while. There wasn\u0027t much in the way of clues as to how use the new mouse functionality unless you ran the tutorial, and that lack of clues was frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did we gain for all of this? Live tiles, and in order to use those, we have to use the UI that treated us as second class citizens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, a user with experience on earlier versions of windows had the choice of running a neutered version of what we knew that gained us nothing, or something new that our experience didn\u0027t apply to and wasn\u0027t exactly friendly on non-touch computers, which if you\u0027re upgrading an existing computer, was just about all of them. On top of that, the new UI didn\u0027t let us stack windows like we\u0027re used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWin 8.0 was the New Coke of the computer industry. Not necessarily a bad idea but chasing a new market all the while disregarding the existing one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWin 8.1 helped a lot, including adding a good bit of mouse-driven functionality to the Modern UI, but it was still stuff that we had to go looking for. Then again, it at least popped up a few messages telling us where to look for that functionality the first time we fired it up. Those same messages would have made our first experiences with Win 8.0 a little less frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou know you can default it so it starts at the desktop, right?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now, but Win 8 made a lot of bad first impressions long before this option was added.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-07T20:09:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2014 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T20:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now, but Win 8 made a lot of bad first impressions long before this option was added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t know that wasn\u0027t in the original package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I had to Google how to turn off my computer in Windows 8 to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T22:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t know that wasn\u0027t in the original package.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I had to Google how to turn off my computer in Windows 8 to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe too :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d had the thing about 4 weeks at this stage, and had just been \u0022sleeping\u0022 it by flipping down the screen (which, to be fair, Windows 8 does very well, it\u0027s really quick to fire up again after sleeping) when I realised the thing hadn\u0027t been properly shut down since I got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T02:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T05:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy main problem is the touchscreen UI.
