So my question to you all is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods are you playing with?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have enjoyed playing with mods that brought the game into the style of Scott Manley\u0027s Interestellar Quest series. So perhaps something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr even something wildly different? HIT ME BOYS!

Saves a LOT of time and effort.(Although you must be careful when removing, as it often leaves some files and folders behind, which can cause problems apparently. Manually remove folders.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good thing is that it gives you a big list of mods, sortable by compatability, to peruse, instead of sifting through the forums or other sites yourself, you can just scroll down the list ticking boxes, then click install and boom, you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epart packs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely get KW rocketry, this is kept up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 parts are exceptional, but check the thread as it is not \u0022officially\u0022 up-to-date, but there is a version being worked on, and by all reports the parts are still working (I think it is mainly things like career-mode pricings that are outdated). It includes procedural wings and control surfaces, basically B9 is the only \u0022aero\u0022 pack you will need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIES is still worthwhile\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are quite a few mods now which add \u0022missing\u0022 parts, parts which fills gaps between others, such as niche engines and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet Karbonite, Kethane still works but Karbonite is a little more modern and does all the same stuff basically. In fact, go for either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet SCANSat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisuals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are quite a lot of mods now which can spice up visuals by quite a great deal, however they are memory intensive, so you have to sacrifice quite a few other mods to support them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor minimum visual spice-up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet Environmental visual enhancements, but just use one of the default configs (there are others, such as the astronomers packs, but they are VERY memory intensive, but look better obvsly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso planetshine adds quite a subtle but worthwhile effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMisc:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the mechanics that RemoteTech adds, its integrated with a lot of other mods now - not sure what will happen to this one with 1.1 coming which has its own variant of the communications mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScienceAlert is a must in my book - especially helps early on in career, when you are still bumbling around Kerbin and need to hoover up as much science as you can find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract configurator and contract packs - there are a lot of contract packs available which add some cool missions, personally I wouldn\u0027t add too many packs as your contract menu only shows you a few at a time and it can obscure the \u0022progression\u0022 of your career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou definitely need StockBugFixes, as it help a lot with weird thermal problems, which are new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t really need Deadly Re-entry, as it currently doesn\u0027t add anything to the stock reentry heating, but it is being run by master modders and I think it will be updated eventually, as the stock heating has its problems, this is probably where solutions will come from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use \u0022modular fuel tanks\u0022 as well, this allows you to customise fuel tank contents, within limits. Eg: all LF/OX tanks can be set to only contain LF if you want. Tanks are assigned types as well, so a service tank can also contain monoprop and electric charge too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried \u0022RealFuels\u0022 once as well, this works hand-in-hand with modular fuel tanks and adds realistic fuel types to the game, and the ability for engines to have different fuel set-ups (eg: an engine might have a regular setup, but can be switched to liquid hydrogen/oxygen for less thrust but greater vacuum Isp). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was cool and all, but added quite a lot of complexity for not that much gain. You always just set the engines to the most powerful config, not many engines made hydrogen worthwile and the other setups with other fuels might have been realistic but didnt really change the game so now I just play with stock LF/OX.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T11:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T12:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs said above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb that give you tons of useful information (I suggest you do not use MJ\u0027s autopilot until you can orbit a rocket safely, using it too soon might prevent you from learning how to launch a rocket properly with the new physics \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027m not going to get only friends on that one \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAlso, SpaceY is good alternative to KW rocketry, but only if you want to keep using stock parts for lighter launchers, as SpaceY provides parts essentially for larger (5m) launchers.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ERealFuels is not really necessary if you\u0027re not using Realism Overhaul (or Real Solar System) as stock engine configs/fuels are powerful enough to do what you want in the Kerbol system.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EIf you get bored of the Kerbol system, you can add mods that change the solar system, such as Outer Planets, New Horizons, RSS...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ETrajectories Predictions is also a really useful mod if you\u0027re planning to land somewhere precise, especially in atmosphere.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EPrecise Manoeuvres (or Nodes, not sure) to help you fine-tune your manoeuvre nodes.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENav HUD for docking or orienting your craft.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EChatterer adds plenty of funny noises to your rockets/probes (essentially Kerbal coms and beeps)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAnd finally, I\u0027ll add Transfer Window Planner to be able to get your interplanetary launch windows IG.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T12:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECant believe I forgot MechJeb and Engineer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Alignment Indicator is also very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
