I had just done nice burn that gave me a 300m approach to that guy. After that I saved the game ofcourse. Now every time I open the save and get close than 1km from the kerbal with my ship, the game just crashes. Every time at exactly the same point so obviously the save file is somehow not good. That is also the only save file I have from that career (I know it\u0027s still at the very beginning but I wouldn\u0027t want to start all over again) so is there any way I might be able to fix that?\n\nWell at least now I know better to make different save files before every launch to make sure I don\u0027t have to start from the scratch if this kind of thing happens again..."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T11:56:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m not really sure if their is a way to fix this particular issue.

Every time I would switch to it from my quicksave, the game would crash. Timewarping for a while instead of switching right away allowed me to finally switch without crashing. \n\nIf you have enough fuel, try avoiding the approach this time beyond physics loading range and let an orbit or two pass. You can create a secondary quicksave with Alt\u002Bf5 if you\u0027re on PC, which you will have to name, before you try it so you don\u0027t have to worry about overwriting your current quicksave."}]}
