Objects in higher orbits tend to travel more slowly on average. If you\u0027re behind your target and want to catch up, lower your periapsis; if you\u0027re ahead of your target and waiting for it to catch up to you, raise your apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Set your target, then plot an intercept. Any intercept, as long as it brings up the \u0022Closest Approach\u0022 data. Then move your maneuver node around in the orbit and see how the data changes. Ideally, you want an orbit whose apoapsis / periapsis just barely grazes the target\u0027s at the point of closest approach within a few kilometers. (You may need to make additional tweaks to the node itself to refine this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once you\u0027re within about 10-20km (depending on what you\u0027re comfortable with), confirm that your Navball is set to \u0022Target\u0022 mode, then start steering your prograde velocity marker (the open yellow one) onto your target prograde marker (the open pink one). Each burn will \u0022pull\u0022 the prograde marker towards the heading your nose is pointing to; you can thus pull your vector onto the target by pointing your nose so that, on a line drawn from your prograde vector marker to your heading indicator (the \u0022airplane\u0022), the target marker falls somewhere between the two, then burn and watch how the prograde vector moves. (A similar thing happens with regard to your retrograde vector marker (yellow marker with an \u0022x\u0022), except engine burns \u0022push\u0022 rather than \u0022pull\u0022; thus, while you\u0027re killing your velocity on your approach, you can try to \u0022push\u0022 the retrograde vector onto the target retrograde marker (pink dot with triangular crosshairs).)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T01:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust for clarification, because I think specialist290 got it a bit off, the prograde icon, when in target mode (when it says in fine print \u0027target\u0027 by your velocity), is prograde velocity relative to target.
