All of the sudden, I don\u0027t get a DeltaV or Vessel info any more, in flight or in the VAB. Orbit module is also gone. Most other modules are still there. I did NOT install any new mods.\n\nI thought my persistent.sfs file was corrupt (we had a power outage recently), so I downloaded a fresh copy of KSP and MJ and overwrote the old directory. I started a new game in sandbox mode. Same symptoms.\n\nWhat could possibly be making MJ refuse to show DV module?"}]}
