Namely, I wanted the ability to define (read: configure through .cfg files) wind patterns for any celestial body (and not in a randomized fashion, it would be based on lon/lat and maybe altitude).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m contemplating writing my own plugin to fill the need I created for myself, and I wanted to gauge interest in a mod like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krakatoa","CreatedById":175313,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T18:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething vaguely similar has been released before, though I think it may have been on the more randomized side. I really don\u0027t know that for sure, as it\u0027s been years. I\u0027m sure the interest is out there, whether you get much feedback on this thread or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CashnipLeaf","CreatedById":228418,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T21:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I recall there\u0027s mods like Kerbal Wind and Kerbal Weather Project, tho it seems like both only apply to Kerbin. The former seems to have a more randomized wind direction/speed and the latter has what amounts to a (very impressive, btw) climate simulation. I feel like what I want falls somewhere in between those two: something where wind patterns can be clearly and distinctly defined for any atmospheric body, while being more approachable than effectively simulating that body\u0027s climate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m scoping out what kinds of features I want in this plugin. Someone I talked with on discord suggested being able to use flowmaps to define prevailing winds, which I will definitely look into. If you (or anyone else reading this thread) have suggestions of your own, I\u0027d like to hear them. :3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-22T13:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest talking to blackrack. He developed flowmaps for volumetric cloud movement in his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E rework. It would probably be smart to make the two mods interact, i.e. allow syncing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E flowmaps to wind, or straight out use the same system. This would allow clouds to be synced with wind, making stuff like Duna dust storms or Jool weather patterns actually deadly instead of being eye candy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CashnipLeaf","CreatedById":228418,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-23T06:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been strongly considering some flavor of integration with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E. However, I might implement it such that the effects lead gameplay, rather than the other way around. (that is to say, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E could supply wind data based on the effects).
