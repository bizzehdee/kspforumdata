However, it\\\u0027s not strictly Kerbosynchronous, even though I\\\u0027m at ~2868.3 km there is still about 20 m/s of ground speed. It seems that around 2867.9 - 2868.1 km there is pretty much no ground speed. \n\nI\\\u0027m not pedantic enough to try and perfect it, but the information is there for anyone who needs it/wants to correct it. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
