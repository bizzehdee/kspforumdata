The last time I heard the devs say anything official about how they were handling it was over a year ago. At that time, they weren\u0027t planning on having dedicated heat shield parts, at which point I\u0027d probably go for moderate, maybe even a little lighter.\n\nBut really, the best option is to leave it up to the player. Maxmaps has already said it will be optional, at least, and personally, I\u0027d want a checkbox and a slider (checkbox is optional if the reentry heat code is smart enough to simply not run if the slider is turned all the way down) with the slider going from none or practically none all the way up to full DRE or maybe a bit beyond."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T04:12:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m inclined towards the hardcore damage so I\u0027d say medium-hardcore."},{"CreatedByName":"NWM","CreatedById":67386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T17:44:42Z","Content":"At first: DRE is realistic.
