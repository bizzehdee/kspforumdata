I realize that I need to be gentle with my gravity turn.. I\u0027d initially be sent into a tailspin around 10 KM because I think I was tipping over too drastically. Now I\u0027m having the issue of being entirely out of the atmosphere, and after ejecting 2 of the 6 tanks/engines, I spin uncontrollably whenever the engines are active, causing it to be impossible to achieve orbit, or really do much of anything. Is this a bug with FAR, do asparagus-rockets not work with FAR, or do I just fundamentally misunderstand something here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T04:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use asparagus staged rockets with FAR all the time, and I\u0027ve never seen this problem once I got out of the atmosphere. They\u0027re touchy below about 20-25km, but once that far up, it\u0027s easy to forget that FAR is installed. My guess is there\u0027s something else going on, though it could be a bug with the latest version of FAR, I haven\u0027t upgraded yet, still one version behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T04:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a FAR-caused issue; this is an issue that happens anytime in KSP when you have insufficiently secured boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s happening is that your parallel stages are flexing at the radial decoupler under thrust, and are not simply flexing inwards; they are also flexing such that each booster\u0027s thrust produces a slight rolling moment.

As someone else mentioned, it\u0027s likely that your boosters need struts, and you should disable gimballing to be safe. That said, FAR adds in a more dynamic drag model that includes cylinder drag. Furthermore, as fuel burns the com of the rocket moves up and makes it more unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found adding 3 or 4 canard type wings (the ones with control surfaces) to the bottom of the core rocket makes a huge difference. Don\u0027t put wings on the side boosters, if they flex it will really mess things up and it makes separation events dicey. Also, use the FAR setting to disable roll control. The wings will keep the rocket stable and minimize roll while providing pitch/yaw control. Adding reaction wheels helps too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the rocket is still too twitchy reduce the allowable control deflection in the FAR panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore launch open the FAR info window. During flight monitor the dynamic pressure (Q) term. Its driven by speed and air density, so it goes up as you go faster, down as you gain altitude. Whenever launch broadcasts mention Max-Q this is what they are talking about. When it\u0027s big (depends on your rocket) make gentle movements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
