Again referring to Orbiter, things like Orbit mfd, Align plane mfd, transfer mfd, \u0026amp; so on. I know that MechJeb can provide most of the information that orbit mfd does (though just for the ship and not for a target object) but what about nav aids that are not intended to simply do the flying for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is just how does one navigate without resorting to the map view other than just looking for something to appear on the horizon and then burning for it? I\u0027ve seen talk of calculating courses, angles, burn times and such but the discussions always pretty much assume that the reader already knows what they\u0027re talking about. I\u0027m familiar with some of this but in the Kerbol system I have yet to find any kind of frame of reference to start calculations from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, what about time? So far the only thing I see about that is Mission Elapsed Time, which of course is different for every flight. Is there a date / time system for Kerbin? It seems to me it\u0027s especially necessary for figuring out flight plans for the interplanetary flights that I understand will be possible in 0.17\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"opticalshadow","CreatedById":31348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T05:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas far as first person, the next patch will be introducing the early stages of it, we may eventually gain more naivigation tools there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome people have been able to do the math before launch and navigate soly by procedure after ignition without using the map, but they spent more time on the math then using the map would have ever taken so its preference at best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberChrist","CreatedById":33153,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T13:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlight Engineer displays information \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=16\u003C/a\u003E or the forum thread \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18230-0-16-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-3-%288-Sep%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18230-0-16-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-3-%288-Sep%29\u003C/a\u003E but like mechjeb it doesn\u0027t have the other things you mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pleborian","CreatedById":27820,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T13:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to use the mun as a tool for doing my injection burns, but it got to the point where I didnt have to do that anymore now I just do it off the map \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T23:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UberChrist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UberChrist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFlight Engineer displays information \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=16\u003C/a\u003E or the forum thread \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18230-0-16-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-3-%288-Sep%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18230-0-16-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-3-%288-Sep%29\u003C/a\u003E but like mechjeb it doesn\u0027t have the other things you mentioned.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a ton for that!! I just looked at that thread and it displays some of the information I\u0027ve been wanting to know.. like thrust to weight ratios and how much delta-v a ship or stages of a ship have. It\u0027s going to be a huge help in designing ships that actually work. Especially since I installed the fuel bug hotfix the other day. suddenly even just getting into orbit isn\u0027t nearly so easy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T14:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlight Engineer looks like just what I need...
