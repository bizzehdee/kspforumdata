You ask a thoroughly researched question, and you get down voted...\n\u003E \n\nPart of the problem is that those who are new to the forum do not know how to do a key word search to see if the topic has already been posted; some of us more seasoned forum users are also having issues using the search forum. I\u0027m not sure if there needs to be a tutorial or maybe an \u0022introduction to forum search\u0022 thread or even if such an effort would actually be utilized ( I wouldn\u0027t mind doing it if I knew it was warranted).\n\nAnyhow, sometimes one key word can make a difference between adding to an existing thread or starting a new thread. I will admit (and so will the mods), I have started threads that mirrored other threads simply because I didn\u0027t enter in the exact right key word, or held my mouth in a left-bent smirk, or whatever and never saw the thread in my search results.\n\nI am not complaining about the forum or its set-up, but have often wondered if maybe there were some way to add an auto-search function so that when a new thread title is being entered, it searches existing threads by title to see if there are already related threads and possibly suggest either merging the new thread to the older thread, linking to the older thread as a child thread, or maybe restructure/re-title the proposed thread."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T04:38:24Z","Content":"\\*Activate stupidity\\*  \n\n\\*Initiate Serious mode\\*\n\nWhat IS a PSA?"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T04:48:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, SpaceplaneAddict said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*Activate stupidity\\*  \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*Initiate Serious mode\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What IS a PSA?\n\u003E \n\nPublic Service Announcement?"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T16:59:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Public Service Announcement?\n\u003E \n\nYep."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T21:22:50Z","Content":"Just out of curiosity, are moderators able to change their names at will?
