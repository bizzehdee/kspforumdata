fixes","CreatedByName":"DeliriumTrigger","CreatedById":184699,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T13:59:52Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"DeliriumTrigger","CreatedById":184699,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T13:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will probably fall on deaf ears, but it\u0027s worth a shot anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a huge fan of this game and appreciate all the effort that goes into it, including the new content, even if it isn\u0027t always stuff I\u0027m interested in.\u00A0 However, objectively the 1.4.x release has been a mess.\u00A0 It\u0027s okay, these things happen, but when they do it\u0027s a good idea to look at why and how they happened so that they can be avoided in the future.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly there is some kind of issue on the testing front that is leading to bugs slipping through.\u00A0 And clearly there is some kind of push to get new content out, which is why the game is in the current state it is in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that all the new content in the world doesn\u0027t mean much of anything if the game is riddled with fairing aero bugs and collider bugs that make it impossible to land on a moon without busting out a text editor.\u00A0 \u00A0 And it\u0027s made even worse by the fact that the bulk of this new content is DLC, meaning many of us paid for this content and have serious impediments to actually using it.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I propose is that you create a beta/prerelease channel.\u00A0 Make it available on the website for people who bought it from you directly, or in the betas tab for Steam users.\u00A0 Take advantage of the many members of the community that would be willing to test new builds and submit bug reports.\u00A0 And make a stable release your primary concern going forward.\u00A0 New content should always be secondary to the stable, released build actually being stable and bug fixes should not be held up by unforeseen issues in new content releases.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be useful for everyone.\u00A0 You will get bug reports for new content\u00A0from technical users that are willingly choosing to use potentially unstable builds, instead of noise and complaints from the community at large that are frustrated that their game isn\u0027t working.\u00A0 Mod creators will get an opportunity to address issues before they make it into the stable channel, which should make transitioning to new releases a much smoother experience for them and for everyone that uses mods.\u00A0 And players like me will no longer be stuck waiting around for weeks for their fully released game to be playable without having to roll back to a previous release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis game is no longer in early access and there is literally no excuse for release builds being in this state.\u00A0 Again, I sympathize with the struggle but this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed going forward.\u00A0 Paying customers deserve a product that works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 To be clear, I\u0027m not suggesting nightly builds.\u00A0 I\u0027m suggesting that before a release is pushed out as stable and finished, that it gets pushed out to a beta/prerelease channel first, for wider testing.\u00A0 I understand all the arguments against nightly builds, makes perfect sense to me.\u00A0 What doesn\u0027t make sense is that releases with major, show stopping bugs are being pushed out to everybody whether they want to be a tester or not.\u00A0 That may have been acceptable when this was an early access game but it\u0027s not anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
