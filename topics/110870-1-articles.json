Please do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for a manned mission to Mars. We understand that an effective chemical rocketry fuel is LOX and LH2, and an effective radiation shield is water (it halves radiation for every 7 cm. What would the flaws be in creating a water tank around the crew cabin in which they can drink from and stuff and will shield the crew from radiation and splitting the fuel prior to the MOIB (Martian Orbital Insertion Burn).
