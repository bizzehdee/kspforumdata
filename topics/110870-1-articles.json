Please do.\n\nThis is for a manned mission to Mars. We understand that an effective chemical rocketry fuel is LOX and LH2, and an effective radiation shield is water (it halves radiation for every 7 cm. What would the flaws be in creating a water tank around the crew cabin in which they can drink from and stuff and will shield the crew from radiation and splitting the fuel prior to the MOIB (Martian Orbital Insertion Burn). Once landed, crews can use martian soil to cover up bases etc. from radiation. \n\nSome stuff to build up from: pumping the water to the water splitters, storing the LOX and LH2 once it becomes a chilled, condensed liquid (tools required and extra storage space) and reliability.\n\nI put this up because I have thought about it for a while and I have searched for similar results to no avail. I have heard some weird ideas for manned mars missions but this was one that, as aforementioned, I have never heard of. \n\nDoes anyone have any alternate ideas?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T07:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 07:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheGamingNoobster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:00:47Z","Content":"\u0022...which they can drink from and stuff and will shield the crew from radiation...\u0022\n\nYeah, this doesn\u0027t sound right at all."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:49:44Z","Content":"Splitting water uses a lot of energy so you would need giant solar panels or an reactor. \n\nThen you have that you can just as well use vasmir. \n\nYou still need the water on the return trip, however the idea to split water might make sense for other parts, especially the burn to getting back to earth orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"TheGamingNoobster","CreatedById":94887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:55:04Z","Content":"Thanks all for the responses.

You could probably do this with high-efficiency solar panels (especially since they are becoming better all the time). Honestly though, your idea of splitting water is really not that great if this means taking away from your radiation shield (would increase radiation exposure over time to unhealthy levels). The only advantage I can see with the splitting- water idea is that the hydrogen will be much less likely to boil off.\n\nOn the bright side though, it does consume less electricity than my Mars mission idea of using high-power ion drives for propulsion!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E it\u0027s way too much water aboard the ship. water is heavy. they don\u0027t need all of it, they can use a thin layer of titanium or something instead. like they still need water but not nearly as much.\n\nWater one of the best materials for radiation shielding- Titanium is a lot worse for this purpose (things with lots of hydrogen shield particle radiation the best.\n\nAnd yes, water is heavy, so the radiation shielding should only mainly be on the interplanetary transit habitation module."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T21:01:40Z","Content":"Also using light metals as radiation shielding is generally a bad idea, due to secondary radiation."}]}
