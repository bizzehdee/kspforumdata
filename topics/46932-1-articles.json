The question is, how far can i be from it to get caught in its gravity. I had the closest approach meter,( with kerbal engineer redux), and i kept on making it smaller, and then it dissapeared. Does that mean that when i warp there, i will be able to get caught in its gravity? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T23:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might mean you have a collision course, which is very bad. What was the lowest number you got before it vanished? Also, engineer can give you a \u0027time to SoI change\u0027. If that is a number, you know you have an SoI change somewhere, likely at Jool since, like Eve, it\u0027s gravity well is something akin to a black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dynamo","CreatedById":16626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T23:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the CPA (closest point of approach) has dissapeared, you\u0027re going to smack into the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how the mod displays that information, but that\u0027s my judgement on what you\u0027ve described.

First, make sure you did not enter the system retrograde. Second, pick which moon is your desired first target. You will want to be as far away as possible orbital altitude wise but you need to not put other moons\u0027 orbits between you and the target. Otherwise, you might catch a bad gravity sling out into interplanetary space. Execute the transfer, obtain an orbit, and then you can transfer between the moons as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T06:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen planning maneuvers, the game shows minimum distance only up to certain distance between the two orbits. Sometimes the distance may be smaller if you reduce the orbit because you get at the endpoint later - but if you reduce it too much the distance between the two orbits becomes too large and the game stops displaying the minimum distance. In that case you need to step back and try changing other parameters of the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
