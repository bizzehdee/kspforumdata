It is calculated by assuming the ship is flying forward at a set speed, and querying all lift-producing parts to find their lift forces given that same velocity. The thing is, those forces will vary depending on the angle of the wing surfaces to the airflow, so the information you get from that single node doesn\u0027t really tell the whole story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to use the CoL indicator is to grab the entire ship by the command pod, and use the Shift\u002BWSADQE keys to rotate it around. That way, you\u0027ll be able to see the CoL changing to indicate the position and direction of the net force acting on the ship, for any orientation. Think of it like holding a paper airplane against the wind at different angles, to feel how it reacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your vessel has the CoL passing directly through the center of mass at some orientation or another, well done. Your ship is very stable. If not, there is another way to test for stability: If by pitching the ship up and down you find a point where the CoL changes direction, that means that there is an angle of attack where the lift forces balance out, and you are also stable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was writing the code for these indicators, this \u0022problem\u0022 became apparent. We realized here that the ideal way to visualize the aerodynamics of a vessel would be to not have a CoL indicator at the construction facilities, but to have a proper dedicated wind tunnel facility, where you load in a vessel to test against simulated airflow. It\u0027s not only a better solution for testing, it\u0027s also a lot more fun too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough as you can imagine, it\u0027s by no means a small feature.

Basically the further aft your center of lift is, the more stable your airplane is. The problem with this is that as your center of lift moves back, your maneuverability decreases and you may not have enough control authority to trim for level flight anymore. This can be solved by increasing the size of your elevators or giving them a longer moment arm. Basically it does not matter if your center of lift is not on the center of mass to fly level, it just matters that the pitching moment at the center of mass is zero, and you want the pitching moments of disturbed flight to return the airplane to its original orientation. This would work even if your airplane had negligible drag because the lift (and therefore moment) of your wings and stabilizers is a function of angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since fuel usually drains towards the back of the airplane in KSP, it is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a good idea to place the center of lift directly on the center of mass during construction, because your airplane may be stable at takeoff, and then after a while of flying become unstable and crash into the ground.
