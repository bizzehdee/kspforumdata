Space would only be an additional combat field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo some extent, space has been used for war since the second world war: The german V2/Aggregat 4 was the first man-made object in space. These days, ICBMs use suborbital trajectories to reach their targets as fast as possible. It is known that the CCCP was working on orbital nuclear weapons, which would be de-orbited at any point of the orbit, making defense much more difficult. In combination with hypersonic gliders, the actual impact location would be almost impossible to predict. Spy satellites are essential for military inteligence, and it can safely be assumed that all superpowers have already built spy sats designed to rendezvouz with enemy spy sats. The space shuttle could have been used for that purpose as well (but was never).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that perspective, war in space is not very different from \u0027normal\u0027 war. But let\u0027s take a look at what will become possible in the near future:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear-Earth asteroids can _very_ effectively be re-directed to collide with earth; with sufficient technology, even a specific city can be targeted. The destructive force would be far higher than possible with nuclear bombs. Even very large (\u0026gt;1km) asteroids can be re-directed by using rocks from the asteroid itself as reaction mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans are incredibly easy to kill; especially in a place like space. Even with today\u0027s technology, you could build a 100,000$ cubesat that is capable of killing the entire crew of the ISS, simply by crashing into the station at an appropriate relative velocity. It could be built to be impossible to detect for radars, and will be impossible to evade. It wouldn\u0027t even be that hard to launch; just tell the launch provider that you are testing a new ion engine, or something. Even on earth, humans will soon be completely obsolete; we already have the technology to build a laser, with some attached servos, that will automatically point at the eyes of all enemy soldiers, and permanently blind them, at a rate of tens per second. To a somewhat lesser extent, autonomous spacecraft are incredibly easy to destroy as well. This is why almost any SciFi unvierse employs some magical \u0027energy shield\u0027 that will protect stuff. If you won\u0027t include magical \u0027energy shields\u0027 into your universe, you\u0027ll have a really hard time at making crewed missions make sense in any way. You could use iron shielding that is mined from asteroids, but even then 99% of your spacecraft\u0027s mass will be iron... unless you start thinking _really_ big (a sphere a few hundreds of meters in diameter, with a 1-meter iron hull, might be economic, and weigh several million tons). That gives me a great idea: Just grab a few-hundred-meter asteroid, hollow it out, fill it with Oxygen, and live there... that might actually be very reasonable; it might even survive a nuclear blast. Spun up at the right rate, it will even provide artificial gravity for its inhabitants. Note to self: Build an evil villain lair in a hollowed-out asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and of course don\u0027t forget large-scale launch sites sucha s space elevators, launch loops etc., which are - like anything in space - extremely easy to destroy, and extremely expensive...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T15:44:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mic_e\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krona14","CreatedById":90751,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T21:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can try it yourself in KSP.
