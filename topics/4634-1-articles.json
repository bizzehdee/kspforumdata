The Foundation, in conjunction with Fabricated Avionics, began work on the Encyclopedia Kerbannica. The work in progress began with a mission to take the important and comical aspects of Kerbin and the universe it is in. Unfortunately, both the Kerbannica Foundation and the FAC have fallen on budget problems (the FAC saw the Minair budget explode. Minair has been shut down.). Now, Kerbannica asks your aid in the noble quest. The Foundation has authorized the release of the WIP Edition of Kerbannica, and asks all those able to help. In order to best help with locations, I have drawn up a map of the city 8 Kilometers north of the KSC, Kerbville, where most corporations that produce space parts are built. Thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I drew up the following maps so that you can use it for locating areas where things would go. When you make significant additions/modifications (5 entries or more. Preferably more.) Then you can attach it to a reply on this thread. The editing version is in ODT format, so it should be compatible. If not then please notify me.
