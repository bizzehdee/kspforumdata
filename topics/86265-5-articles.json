If you decouple that during reentry then it doesn\u0027t even need wheels to go close enough for mining/refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot about the rule that your lander have to go down as a stock ship too, but that doesn\u0027t really make it harder because attaching a minimalistic mining-rover to it and detaching during reentry is easy too. It rolls there and the Kerbal links it to the rocket with a KAS pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a quick sample rover and it weighs 2.3 tons. It has a mining head, kethane tanks on the sides and a converter as the body, and a KAS container for the pipe ends which can be used to connect the rover with the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t need too much logistics so I think doing this is much easier than a stock landing/leaving. Landing on Eve with the stock game is the hardest single mission what I can imagine and should be legendary. Launching an empty return rocket from Kerbin and bringing it to Eve and landing it there and then refueling is much easier than doing the same with a fully fueled one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think it is important to distinct them somehow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way I like both stock and Kethane mod and my mission will involve a Kethane surface explorer plane anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But I\u0027m going to wait on Laie\u0027s decision about this topic if I want to send an empty rocket or a fueled one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HKvbkbq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HKvbkbq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-10T20:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2014 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ziv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T09:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kulebron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kulebron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@all: I see some of you asked me for more proof and Laie mentioned not being naive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should read that again.

Inside the spaceplane, I have a small manned rover which is not top heavy so that I can safely drive around Eve without much hustle. I tested everything and it all works, I tested with HyperEdit. I hope having so many parts in this challenge is not illegal, because if so, I will be very sad because so much planning went into the space station and the spaceplane.
