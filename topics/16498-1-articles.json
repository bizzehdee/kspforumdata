Their new program involves research on the highest possible speed that you can make a kerbal hit Kerbin. They only use their own technology (no mods allowed, except MechJeb) and refuse to make their rocket parts better (no cfg edits). They want an image to prove the results (A map view image of the kerbal\u0027s speed at less than 200 meters above Kerbin) and an image of the starting rocket (or airplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults (Leaderboard):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T15:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly sure that this challenge has already been done to death many times.
