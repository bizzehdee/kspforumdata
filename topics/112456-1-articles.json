Assemble a station including a MPL and enough scientists/data to run it at a respectable rate. E.g. 7x 3-star scientists \u002B 500 Data yields a processing rate of about 6 Data per day = approximately 0.001 science per second.\n2. Start the MPL running, leaving the right-click menu open to monitor the numbers.\n3. At 1x realtime warp or 2x physics warp, the Science will tick up, but the Data will not tick down.\n4. At 3x or 4x physics warp, or 5x or higher rails warp, the Science will tick up and the Data will tick down."}]}
