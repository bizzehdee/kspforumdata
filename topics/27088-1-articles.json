I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a little while now, though! Since it became available on Steam, I think. A friend of mine posted on Facebook that it was available on Steam, and being a space nerd, I was naturally intrigued. I took a chance on it, and immediately lost the next 5 hours to playing the tutorials, watching youtube videos, building rockets and trying to get a feel for the game. Yeah, I got hooked quickly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, yeah, I\u0027m having an absolute blast with it.
