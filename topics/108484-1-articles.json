Here\u0027s what I\u0027ve made so far:\n\nKG-2 Requiem Shark:\n\n![f9csQ0T.png](http://i.imgur.com/f9csQ0T.png)\n\nEasily my prettiest SSTO design. Seats four Kerbals and a probe or rover in comfort and style. \n\n![dNSsz0k.png](http://i.imgur.com/dNSsz0k.png)\n\nIon-powered probe launching from cargo bay. Note that the cargo bay is actually half-full of orange donuts, so I don\u0027t consider this design as much of a success as some of my others.\n\nDownload link upon request.\n\nKG-5 White Whale: \n\nOne of the few SSTO spaceplanes able to put an entire station up in one go. Truly massive cargo capacity. Also, fourteen engines. \n\n![8kUAjzK.png](http://i.imgur.com/8kUAjzK.png)\n\nEarlier unmanned version of the White Whale undergoing testing near KSC.\n\n![RgOIoiz.png](http://i.imgur.com/RgOIoiz.png)\n\nWhite Whale in space, seen from the perspective of the station it hauled up.\n\n![F2MH4S1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F2MH4S1.jpg)\n\nWhite Whale\u0027s trademark non-explodey re-entry style. \n\nDownload link upon request.\n\nKG-6 \u0022Mini-Zip\u0022:\n\n![I6IGz2o.png](http://i.imgur.com/I6IGz2o.png)\n\nProbably the easiest and fastest way to transport one Kerbal from the Runway to near-Kerbin space.

Thanks!\n\nWhite Whale is in the mid 200\u0027s for parts. I\u0027m going to work on a turbos\u002B NERV heavy lifter soon that will hopefully have a lower part count. No guarantees about the payload space though. \n\nDownload links added!\n\nHOW TO FLY MY BIG RAPIER STUFF:\n\nAscend at ~25-30 degrees after takeoff, being careful to not put too much strain on the airframe with my larger stuff. RAPIERS should automatically switch over after running out of intakeAir. With something as big as the White Whale, you\u0027re going to be going rather slow, so no need to worry about overheating unless stuff starts exploding. In that case, simply back down to half throttle and hope it\u0027s the intakes. When it switches over to rockets, keep \u0027em going on full until your apoapsis hits 75km, then cut the rockets immediately. Add a maneuvering node to circularize the orbit and execute it. \n\nHOW TO FLY MY OTHER RAPIER STUFF:\n\nThese are a lot more free-form. Since there tends to be enough liquid fuel to last for days, you can go ahead and attempt to go up to the 800-900 m/s range at 10,000 feet to save yourself some dV on rockets. However, since burning up tends to be a slight problem for the smaller, faster builds, don\u0027t max out your throttle. Just stick it in a 30 degree climb and back down to 75 or even 50% throttle- as long as you\u0027ve got some acceleration, you\u0027ll be OK. \n\nNew build: the Vananna!\n\nThis is the easiest to fly cargo hauler I\u0027ve ever built, with a TARDIS-like amount of cargo space! Featuring one Mk. 3 CRG-50 main bay and two Mk. 2 CRG-04 auxillary probe bays, the capable Vananna is one of an elite few craft that can deliver a satellite (or two, in this case!) AND install (or at least leave in the general vicinity) a science module in the same trip! Bad news is, it\u0027s rather hideous. \n\nName derived from: Van (it\u0027s a space van, essentially) \u002B bananna (shape)\n\n![ne5K2pP.png](http://i.imgur.com/ne5K2pP.png)\n\nYes, that really is how it unpacks. No hitting the runway lights for this model, no sir!\n\n![VPATKED.png](http://i.imgur.com/VPATKED.png)\n\nIn orbit, after deploying the usual absurd amount of cargo. For this trip, I had it loaded out with 2 ion probes in the auxillary bays and a suprisingly heavy escape pod for example cargo. No parts were clipped for either payload.\n\n![qqcatw2.png](http://i.imgur.com/qqcatw2.png)\n\nVananna deploying an absurd amount of aerobraking power upon her re-entry. Total is two drogue chutes and eight airbrakes. Just keep the B key mashed down and deploy those drogues, and you will have an absolutely trouble-free re-entry, no matter how fast you came in. During my test-flight, not one of the \u0022re-entry\u0022 aero FX played. (OFC, this is under 1.0 re-entry mechanics. 1.02 users may experience spontaneous combustion, plagues of locusts, or other unforeseen effects, not covered by warranty.)\n\nDownload: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/dijc4w0fg1vit9d/Vannana.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dijc4w0fg1vit9d/Vannana.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Heckspress","CreatedById":8020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:14:43Z","Content":"Maybe make it so for each craft we can see if it works in nuFAR or nuStock"},{"CreatedByName":"Crikeycrapper","CreatedById":116365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:01:13Z","Content":"The KG-5 white whale is another truly impressive SSTO that I have encountered on my time in the forums.
