RAPIERS should automatically switch over after running out of intakeAir. With something as big as the White Whale, you\u0027re going to be going rather slow, so no need to worry about overheating unless stuff starts exploding. In that case, simply back down to half throttle and hope it\u0027s the intakes. When it switches over to rockets, keep \u0027em going on full until your apoapsis hits 75km, then cut the rockets immediately. Add a maneuvering node to circularize the orbit and execute it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOW TO FLY MY OTHER RAPIER STUFF:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are a lot more free-form. Since there tends to be enough liquid fuel to last for days, you can go ahead and attempt to go up to the 800-900 m/s range at 10,000 feet to save yourself some dV on rockets. However, since burning up tends to be a slight problem for the smaller, faster builds, don\u0027t max out your throttle. Just stick it in a 30 degree climb and back down to 75 or even 50% throttle- as long as you\u0027ve got some acceleration, you\u0027ll be OK. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew build: the Vananna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the easiest to fly cargo hauler I\u0027ve ever built, with a TARDIS-like amount of cargo space! Featuring one Mk. 3 CRG-50 main bay and two Mk. 2 CRG-04 auxillary probe bays, the capable Vananna is one of an elite few craft that can deliver a satellite (or two, in this case!) AND install (or at least leave in the general vicinity) a science module in the same trip! Bad news is, it\u0027s rather hideous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EName derived from: Van (it\u0027s a space van, essentially) \u002B bananna (shape)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ne5K2pP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ne5K2pP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that really is how it unpacks.

For this trip, I had it loaded out with 2 ion probes in the auxillary bays and a suprisingly heavy escape pod for example cargo. No parts were clipped for either payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qqcatw2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qqcatw2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVananna deploying an absurd amount of aerobraking power upon her re-entry.
