This is an AWESOME game! what about insert a mini-game and a new structure in the Space Center for training and recruiting astronauts? Right now its just a list but I beleive could be funny to test ourselves the astronauts in the \u0022training lab\u0022 . \u0022Only the toughests Kerbalians should pass the tests! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E \u0022 (maybe with more skills besides courage and stupidity). I was thinking much of something \u0022without\u0022 need of doing anything. I. e. you choose your recruits ( let\u0027s say 5 ) and put them into a centrifugal machine. The software should generate reactions (puke,fear ecc ) and give a feedback on astronauts assigning points \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You can have all training instruments as seen in the last video \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBye\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matts73","CreatedById":59867,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T20:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea.
