It kills the engine power of the craft in Vertical mode to keep it level. So if you looked at each engine you would find that it actually cutting the available power back a good bit keeping the available power below the 410kn to get the craft off the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know because I had the same problem last version with a VTOL I was working on with that TCA mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, TCA isn\u0027t messing with the IR rotatrons that turn the main fans, and those alone should theoretically be enough to lift it, since, combined, they\u0027re producing a total of 500-800 kN on their own. The jets are there for attitude control, but are each producing 500 kN themselves. We should have a total of 1500 kN of lift, but we\u0027re not moving.

This is what it says in the flight info thing in mapview?\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t fix it, kick it off the ground and then see if it works. Maybe it\u0027s the sticky pad bug. Maybe it\u0027s tweakscale messing with the mass of the parts that you think are low mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... it didn\u0027t even occur to me that the actual mass could be different from what the engineer says. I just assumed TweakScale adjusted the mass in the hangar. That\u0027s what I get for trying to throw together a helicarrier on what\u0027s basically the first time I\u0027ve started KSP in 2015. The map view says it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003E413.52\u003C/strong\u003E tons, and that would explain our lack of flight.

Supersonic wings are a little easier, but if the trailing edge is swept back enough the same trailing-edge effects need to be accounted for. For now, wing parts are different from ordinary rectangular parts \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E they are flat against something or used as a structural piece to enclose, say, a fairing.
