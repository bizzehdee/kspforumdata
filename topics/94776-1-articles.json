Funds gets traded with Science or Rep as if it was even remotely on the same order of magnitude when it so isn\u0027t, making any strategy to trade away Science or Rep for Funds utterly ridiculous and crippling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake this for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPatents licensing: If I slide it all the way up to the max level, it\u0027s taking 100% science and transforming those science points into 10 Funds per 1 science point it \u0022stole\u0022 away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I read that right, that would mean that losing out on, say, 2000 science would gain me a mere 20,000 Funds. Funds is a LOT more scaled up from Science than in a mere 10:1 ratio. It would need to be more like at least 100:1 or even 500:1 or 1000:1 to even be worth thinking about activating this strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seems waaaay out of whack. 2000 science is a waay bigger deal than a mere 20,000 Funds. 20,000 Funds is the return on investment from one single early contract in the beginning of the game (even in Hard mode that nerfs Funds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just one example, but it seems that the other funding strategies have the same problem. It\u0027s as if the devs forgot that Funds are on a totally different order of magnitude from Science and Reputation. They shouldn\u0027t be traded at a mere 1:1 ratio, or even 10:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the entire science return of an early Mun mission is traded in for the mere cost of one medium sized fuel tank, something is really off about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Recovery Transponder Fitting\u003C/strong\u003E results in nothing but a loss of money for no benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you set the Recovery Transponder Fitting strategy commitment slider to 30%. Then launching costs you \u002B8.8%, while recovery gains you \u002B8%. They\u0027re about the same. (At less commitment, it\u0027s a bit more launch than recover, and at more commitment it\u0027s a bit more for recover than launch, but in general it\u0027s never a lot of difference between the two). Unless you recover 100% of what you launch, and never use stages at all, and never burn fuel at all, and never leave items in orbit (i.e. satellites and probes), how can that possibly do anything other than just lose money? Your recovered vessels will always have less overall value than your launched ones, so when the launching surcharge is the same percentage as the recovery bonus, that\u0027s a net loss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T14:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD must know about things like this, but it\u0027s hard to balance a game and they need for all feature to be present to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting it early like they did is a way to spot \u003Cstrong\u003EExploit\u003C/strong\u003E even more than bug, so they know what to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the possibility to get free science using another of the Strategy, though I don\u0027t remember which.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is just too soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T16:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can, hopefully, expect the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-Tech-tree-and-parts-final-polish\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebalance changes\u003C/a\u003E to happen now that we\u0027re in beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
