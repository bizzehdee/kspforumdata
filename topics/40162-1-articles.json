I\u0027m trying to deliver an X200-64 tank into orbit and don\u0027t care if it\u0027s full when it arrives, so I ran 2 fuel lines down to the first stage asparagus boosters using 2X symmetry. When I run the first stage engines, 4 out of 5 of the first stage -64 tanks stay full as long as they\u0027re being fed by the upper tanks, but one of the tanks fed directly from the upper tanks has a small but significant drain as if there\u0027s more flow in one fuel line than the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39114148/Titanic%20Fuel%20Delivery.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.

When I finish the initial launch burn I pump fuel from the center -64 back into the upper before separation to let a skipper finish the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I can work around it by constantly pumping fuel from the top tank to the leaky tank until the top is empty. It works, but it\u0027s not ideal and if I can fix this it\u0027ll make future launches a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-31T13:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2013 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Subbota\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emarking it question answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T04:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that you created a fuel loop. Basically, you can have multiple fuel lines coming out of a stack, you can have multiple fuel lines coming into a stack, but you can\u0027t have one after the other. In other words (or with pictures (kinda)) you can have this: ---\u0026lt;=== you can have this ===\u0026gt;--- but you can\u0027t have this ---\u0026lt;===\u0026gt;---.
