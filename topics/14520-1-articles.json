But a part of the project is making Xenon fuel tanks for it to run on. I\\\u0027m fine with the c# coding, I just am not schooled at all in the resources available, like the unity engine...

However, in order to make sure the part only uses xenon I need to write modules for both xenon fuel and a part that uses only xenon fuel. Besides, knowing how to do these things makes way for greater possibilities; entire scientific spirit and all of that jazzimo. If I knew where the other modules were, that would make my opus dei, because that would be a simple copy, edit, paste job. I\\\u0027ll take anything at this point. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Houston we have a problem","CreatedById":7325,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T09:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei believe the mumech plugin allows you to create custom fuels and engines that run on that fuel : yep its here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8560.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8560.0\u003C/a\u003E the variable family sounds like the thing you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dani-Sang","CreatedById":4234,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T11:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei believe the mumech plugin allows you to create custom fuels and engines that run on that fuel : yep its here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8560.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8560.0\u003C/a\u003E the variable family sounds like the thing you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfirming I\\\u0027m using this for my own Satellite pack and its getting improved even more!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
