RPM does not use Hullcam\u0027s parameters for IVA - all it does is use the camera\u0027s position in the Hullcam part.  So, in essence, there are two cameras - the Hullcam camera you can view from outside, and the RPM camera you view from IVA.  \n\nThe cones in the editor are there only to show you which way the camera is pointed - it doesn\u0027t reflect the actual camera FOV, since the FOV in RPM is defined in the MFD\u0027s config, not in the camera.  That may seem weird, but that\u0027s the way it was done way back when Mihara wrote it.

It includes replacement cockpits for some stock interiors, but those replacements were done a couple of years ago, and the space plane models have changed, so some of them no longer have RPM-enabled IVAs.  The cockpits that come with RPM are very basic - there are several mods out there that provide much, much better IVA experiences.\n\nI don\u0027t know if the Airplane Plus mod uses RPM - you would be best looking at the mod\u0027s description on this forum.  The same applies to other mods - RPM does not automatically change cockpits.  Someone has to take the time to make an RPM-enabled IVA.\n\nThere is only one part in the RPM mod - the external camera.
