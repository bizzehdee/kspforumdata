Intended to hold active/reusable reachable parts (engines/chutes). This stage is initially empty but is always displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022suppressed\u0022 stage (displayed with gray header at the very top, eventually collapsable). Intended as convenient place to put any stageable parts you don\u0027t want to be in the staging at the moment (e.g. parts of the payload)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ stage to be fired next is always the last \u0022normal\u0022 (orange) stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ stages work like single-fire action groups, i.e. when fired, all parts in the stage activate/deploy/decouple and any reusable/remaining parts are moved to the \u0022active\u0022 stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4/ you can move any part between stages anytime, including from \u0022active\u0022 stage back to one of \u0022normal\u0022 stages. If you do so and fire the stage, that item will activate/deploy/decouple again. If you move an unfired part to the \u0022active\u0022 stage, it will just sit there until it disappears from the ship or you move it somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will both make it clear what is the next stage to be fired when you press space and make it possible to stage the same part (engine/chute) multiple times if needed (with manual intervention).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen the ship disassembles (e.g. structural failure), any unreachable parts should be removed from the staging list immediately or at least as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllowing to edit action groups in flight would be great, too.

I think I\u0027d also want to see the state of each part included with a color code, just like with chutes. I especially like being able to exclude parts from staging altogether if we choose. It\u0027d be like an automatic setting of the staging lock after we pass a certain point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T23:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStages are definately bugged currently when ships are broken apart and re-docked together.
