Build your ship \u002B lander \u002B mount points for the rovers (You might want 2 rovers, just to make sure your ship is balanced) \u002B everything else\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hit the Open dialogue, find your rover, but instead of \u0022Open\u0022, click \u0022Merge\u0022. That\u0027ll give you the rover ready to attach. It should be noted that the attachment points are based on the first and last part connected to the rover, regardless of any other points, such as docking ports and whatnot. If the attachment points are in the wrong place, keep on reading. If not, you\u0027re good to go as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The fiddling: Go to the SPH, or wherever you built your rover (I like using the SPH for this due to mirror symmetry as opposed to radial symmetry.), and open it up. Now, on the attachment point you want to use, stick some part. Any part. And on that part, place another part. Then use the reroot tool (if I remember correctly, it\u0027s the rightmost one, next to the offset and rotation button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Click the two junk parts. The second part will become the new root part (What this means isn\u0027t THAT important right now, but you\u0027ll learn eventually. I\u0027m sure that for now the goal is just to have this work). In this case it shouldn\u0027t matter which part becomes the root, as long as it\u0027s one of the junk parts you attached\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Open up the subassembly window by digging around the parts window. If you can\u0027t find it, I\u0027m sure there are plenty of threads explaining this already. Also, I can\u0027t remember the exact sequence of clicks to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Pick up your rover by clicking on the part that you want to be the attachment point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Drop in the subassembly dropoff area, and save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this should allow you to load your rover as a subassembly when back in the VAB, with the green connection point in the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with your launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T16:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth noting that your rover (like pretty much all rovers, this is a common issue) is not very aerodynamic.
