KSP is pretty much the game I\\\u0027ve wanted for years but didn\\\u0027t know it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t yet landed on the Mun, but I\\\u0027ve at least hit it a few times in spectacular fashion. Lately I\\\u0027ve been trying to launch satellites as best I can. I\\\u0027ve actually studied orbital dynamics, so you\\\u0027d think I\\\u0027d have some intuition for orbits, but I really don\\\u0027t. That\\\u0027s why I launch satellites, since I feel it\\\u0027s more about creating the most complicated deployment possible! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope to do some mod development, and I would really like to help start up a new Kerbal Space Repository since I heard the original one has been down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to getting to know all of you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Overlord","CreatedById":13025,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-10T06:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour username is bloody brilliant! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManOnMunAction","CreatedById":13024,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-10T06:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHah, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-10T12:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-10T18:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to our forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy crashing and exploding!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-11T06:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums.
