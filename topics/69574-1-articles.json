With no drive force once in vacume you prety much cant enter a stable orbit as you would have no way to raise your Pe. The only way you could do it without some form of space drive is to eject with enough velocity to do a Mun flyby and get a gravity assist to kick your orbit up (or enough to escape kerbin\u0027s SOI altogeather).

I have actually built one although you don\u0027t need to flap much. Once you get above 30 m/s and engage SAS the craft accelerates up to 1300 m/s automatically and achieves an apoapsis of 70 km. This is carrying an RCS engine and Kerbal. There\u0027s enough RCS to push the apoapsis up to 100 km and then circularise for LKO leaving 20% RCS left. Total flight time about 5 minutes. I just wondered if anyone else has done this or done it better. I\u0027ll see if I can post a video tonight.
