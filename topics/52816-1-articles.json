Been at the game for a week or so and have been concentrating on the Career mode. I\u0027ve ran science experiments while in orbit of both Kerbin moons. Interesting choice of components you\u0027re initially given. As they finalize career mode, I certainly hope they re-arrange the components to reflect a more logical progression of science (manned rockets before satellites, probes, \u003Cstrong\u003EOR PLANES\u003C/strong\u003E? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also just noticed today that once you jettison the fuel/engine in preparation for re-entry, the jettisoned components lose all ability to be acted-on by the atmosphere. I had an orbit that would give me a periopsis of only 15,000m, and just before entering the atmosphere I pointed my engine down and to the rear before jettison. I then watched the engine descend underneath and to the rear of me; shoot ahead as I started aerobraking; then head on back up and out into space. No aerobraking was performed at all on the debris. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T05:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to point out that at this time, Kerbal Space Program is still in development, a great many things about the game will probably be tweaked between now and the final release.

I have seen much discussion on the progression of the tech tree, and many people (myself included) think that, while in our universe we did start by sending unmanned probes, in the Kerbal universe it makes more sense for them to send organic matter first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E it also has to do with the electrical requirements of probes and the placement of the necessary equipment to maintain that within the tree as well. As for the discarded stages, once a piece of debris gets farther than 2.25 km from your active ship, physics ceases to act on it (unless it is below a certain altitude, and this number escapes me). The game is not perfect by any means. For example, if you are able to accelerate to 100k time warp while on a lithobraking trajectory with a celestial body, you will warp straight through it and back up to apoapsis \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T10:12:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 10:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by scootersoup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eshhhhhhhhhh\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T09:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eonce a piece of debris gets farther than 200 m from your active ship \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPssst!
