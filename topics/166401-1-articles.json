He essentially took the most\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einconceivable\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0concepts and brought them to reality, one by one: a working steam engine, a working piston engine, components powered by these engines (which is even more crazy since it goes to show that his engine tricks are all practical), etc. For god\u0027s sake, he\u0027s literally just \u003Ci\u003Emade an actual plane\u003C/i\u003E, like, not by placing down pre-made components, but by actually designing the cockpit, the control surfaces, the muscle-mechanism that moves the joystick and pedals, the truss mechanism that conveys control input from the cockpit into plane movement, all by himself. He\u0027s now making a dashboard that actually seems to be working, and apparently the only mod he\u0027s using is a paint mod.
