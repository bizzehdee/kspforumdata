A few times while doing a simple retrograde burn, the craft suddenly spun wildly out of control. It acted as if there was a ton of weight in the nose, which wanted to point down no matter what. SAS did nothing. I repeatedly regained control, lost it... It was a crazy unstable equilibrium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur landing was perfect... 0.0 m/s at about 2m above the surface, engines off--and then the thing flipped and started cartwheeling end over end. I landed it after a few bounces, but when the Kerbal got out for an EVA, the simple act of letting go made the lander tip over--and it ended nose in the ground, with the legs bobbing gently up and down at a 60 degree angle. Walking nearby makes the craft tip over flat, and then it magically tips back up, legs in the air, balanced on its nose. It\u0027s like antigravity or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve landed on Minimus a hundred times by now, but I\u0027ve never seen anything like this, or understand the physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any idea what\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T23:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does your craft look like, and how is it built?

From the physics standpoint, being top heavy would not influence the passive rotation of the craft in any way while in space - at least not in KSP (as gravity gradient is not modelled) - but it\u0027s a useful analogy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you tell the ship to hold retrograde while landing (which is useful), whenever you overburn and start rising again (even by a miniscule ammount, which would be shown as 0.0 m/s), the retrograde marker flips towards the ground - and SAS will vigorously try to follow it (which is not useful - but it would explain the landing problem).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you describe about the EVA sounds like phantom forces - basically (as far as I understand it), sometimes parts (including kerbals) get... Entangled, so to speak. Controlling one exerts the same forces on the other. Was the ship following the same movements you were performing by the kerbal?
