I think RealChutes has it\u0027s own modules, which my StockPlus doesn\u0027t interface with. There used to be some incompatibility, which I think is fixed.

I tried to rendezvous with this ship after losing the bottom right battery pack with a lander and the entire left side of the ship disappeared as I came into physics loading distance. I\u0027m not entirely sure what happened, as the ship I was piloting registered a single 4k battery pack exploding in the F3 menu, even though the piloted ship had none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is a somewhat heavily modded install (FAR, OPM, SpaceY, KER, Docking Alignment Indicator), so it could easily be the fault of any of them. But there\u0027s no cargo bays on this ship, so it\u0027s not the issue you haven\u0027t resolved yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was previously having cubic octagonals explode on both ships but that \u003Cem\u003Eseems\u003C/em\u003E to have been resolved.

I also had a small inline reaction wheel explode. I\u0027ve heard that FAR exacerbates the problem; perhaps a fix designed for stock isn\u0027t compensating enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very strange bug indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-30T00:20:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2015 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jodo42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
