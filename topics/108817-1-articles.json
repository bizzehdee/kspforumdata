As the title says I\u0027m getting consistant crashes at launch. This is actually true for all my steam games.\n\nI\u0027m sure this is not stricly a KSP issue or maybe even a steam issue, but rather a wider issue on my PC.\n\nWhen 1.0.2 came out it rune beautifully. No issues then.\n\nI blame avast. All started when avast, after an update, suddenly decided that steam was a trojan and locked a few steam executables in the virus chest. After much trouble trying to convince avast that steam is infact a friend I ended up uninstalling avast and switched to MSE. Unfortunately that didn\u0027t help. But at least MSE understands that steam is nice for me. (Yes, I verified the gamefiles)\n\nThe next step was to backup my appdata folder and reinstall steam. Moved my appdata back over, but alas, no joy. Still crashing.(Yes, I verified the gamefiles, again.)\n\nFine. I did a hard reinstall of steam. Lost all my games. Oh the re-dowloading at ~650kb/s, I fear thee! Just downloaded KSP for now. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) Still no joy. Still a crash at game launch. Nothing wrong with the actual steam application. Nothing wrong with other programs. (Yes, I verified the gamefiles, again.) \n\nI\u0027m hoping that the more tech oriented of you might be able to give me clues where the issue lies by taking a look at the output log.\n\nI much appreaciate your help!\n\n**KSP Version:**\n\n1.0.2\n\n**Screenshot:**\n\nN/A\n\n**Craft \u0026 Save Files:**\n\nFresh install\n\n**Crash/Output Logs:**\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/5buy9k9yqfp0yug/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5buy9k9yqfp0yug/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n**System Specs:**\n\nWin 7 x64\n\nAMD Phenom 4x\n\nNvidia Gt 630\n\n6gigs RAM\n\nOld PC but still working.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T21:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KingOfFinland**\n  \nReplaced file host"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:47:45Z","Content":"Hi KingOfFinland, we\u0027ll try to help anyway, even if it\u0027s not KSP causing it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nfilehosting.org won\u0027t accept a disposable email though, and I don\u0027t fancy giving them my email address, can I trouble you to use [pastebin.com](pastebin.com)?"},{"CreatedByName":"KingOfFinland","CreatedById":85723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:01:08Z","Content":"I\u0027d love to.
