I currently have a mission in an inclined munar orbit, swinging back and forth between around \u00C2\u00B130\u00C2\u00B0 of latitude. I\\\u0027m aiming for an altitude of around 3km \u00C2\u00B1200m. There is not much margin for error - some ridges rise close to 3km...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t been able to keep the orbit stable for more than a few hours at best - several times now I have realigned apoapsis and periapsis to within some twenty meters. After a few orbits, they drift apart, I haven\\\u0027t been able to identify a pattern though. Sometimes AP appears to rise or fall; sometimes PE, other times both apsides change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there are a few unknowns for me - I haven\\\u0027t been in such low an orbit for such a long time before (at least without going on rails), and most of my orbits so far were either equatorial or polar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was under the impression that as long as there is no atmospheric friction (and disregarding mass anomalies, solar wind, etc.), orbits would be stable no matter the inclination, but my understanding of orbit mechanics isn\\\u0027t firm enough to insist on it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T10:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIll state the obvios before an expert comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you leave rcs or mechjeb on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corax","CreatedById":11311,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T10:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022togfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022togfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll state the obvios before an expert comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you leave rcs or mechjeb on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo SAS or ASAS, no autopilot, and no RCS except for the reboosts.
