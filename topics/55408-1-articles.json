Unless, a Nvidia graphics card with a PhysX PPU (physics processing unit) is installed on a computer, in which case, the PhysX calculations done by the CPU are reduced and given to the PPU... this causes a significant increase in performance because it takes a load of the CPU, especially when there are multiple objects loaded in space (like if you have a multi-million-part space station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a hardcore AMD user and and even hardcore-er KSP player (this game is incredibly, everyone here knows that).... so I went looking for ways to optimize my game even further and possibly use hardware-based PhysX in an AMD system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came across this thing called hybrid PhysX. which allows a computer with AMD main card(s) to use an Nvidia card just as a sole physics processor (so basically, its putting in another graphics card to use solely for physics calculations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emore information found here:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://physxinfo.com/wiki/Hybrid_PhysX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://physxinfo.com/wiki/Hybrid_PhysX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow the Hardcore-est KSP\u002BAMD users to buy a chap ~50$ Nvidia card (even a plain PCI one can work, not even PCIe) to use PhysX and enhance the game to even further reduce the stress on the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emy question is... would this work?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-is the unity engine benefited by PhysX hardware components?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--if yes, does KSP allow the same use of hardware-based PhysX to lighten CPU load?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---if yes, is there any easy solution for AMD users to use PhysX on a different core or somewhere that doesn\u0027t interfere with the game performance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----if no, would hybrid PhysX work with KSP/Unity to achieve the desired result?(and i understand this part of the question is better asked on the PhysX forums)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-and yes, I am overthinking it slightly... but until Unity goes 64-bit i\u0027m optimizing everything I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-if there is any documentation on KSP\u0027s use of graphics features (like PhysX) i would love to find and see that... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOmniverse\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T23:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Suggestions and Development Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Unity engine does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E currently utilise nVidia\u0027s hardware for PhysX calculations, no.
