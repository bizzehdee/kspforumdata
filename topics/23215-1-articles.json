Alas that my account was created just last month; I get to start completely over...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve been playing through the awesome historical tutorials on the wiki and have completed the Gemini 6A/7 tutorial (the one that teaches docking). I\u0027ve been playing the game for a while now and I\u0027ve been looking for a good way to get to any target I choose, and I realized that docking might be the way to go. So, I came up with a design for each of the modules of the craft I\u0027d need, designed a booster that would get them into orbit, and began launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d show you guys a picture of my problem, but as this is my \u0022first\u0022 post, the forum won\u0027t let me. So here it is: the design calls for five engines in a cross-shaped pattern. I can\u0027t get the damn things to line up properly. Any suggestions? I realize that\u0027s nothing to go off of; can\u0027t post the damn craft file either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing real quick - if I have two modules docked together, one of them has a fuel tank and the other one has a fuel tank and an engine, will the engine draw fuel from the first tank without me having to pump it around manually?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks y\u0027all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vencaslac","CreatedById":57518,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T23:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein order to be able to answer your first question: \u0022how to get the damn things to lign up correctly\u0022 we would need some sort of picture showing what you\u0027ve got...

I have a booster that uses KW rocketry engines, 4x 120kn engines and 1x 230kn engine on a short and medium sized 2.5m fuel tank. I get more dV due to them being lighter and better Isp. This is good if you need something slightly more powerful than your current options, but not overly powerful where the weight and lower Isp are a problem. If we go by stock options, say we have a rocket and you need about 750kn of thrust for a good T:W. Your current options are either not enough power, or way too much power. The weight of the mainsail, coupled with lower Isp make it a very unappealing option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T01:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-v for a given amount of fuel being moved by a particular number and set of engines is going to be a constant. If you were to install 4 LV-N\u0027s in the pattern that sal_vager showed, and provided them with the same amount of fuel as 4 LV-N\u0027s installed on 4 separate (smaller) tanks, it would go just as much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you meant that 4 LV-N\u0027s vs 1 LV-N would get less delta-v from a given amount of fuel. In that case you would be correct, but not for the reason that you list. The only reason that it would get less delta-v is that it would have more non-fuel mass. Burning the fuel faster (or through four engines, however you want to think about it) would have no effect. The same amount of fuel mass will be expended at the same relative velocity in either case, so the same change in momentum (and thereby change in velocity) will occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only three things that determine delta-v - fuel mass, non-fuel mass, and Isp of the engine(s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have a much easier time steering your ships with two sets of RCS blocks, one set fore and one aft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T13:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps you meant that 4 LV-N\u0027s vs 1 LV-N would get less delta-v from a given amount of fuel...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what I meant; sorry if that wasn\u0027t clear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid the math on one LV-N drawing off of one X200-32 tank versus five LV-Ns drawing off of it.
