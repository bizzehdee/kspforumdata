When this happens create a new save and load it, possibly more than once until the space center loads normally. It is likely you will continue to experience this bug and have to keep fixing it. There are UI icons to access all the buildings, you only really need to see the space center to upgrade buildings for Career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
