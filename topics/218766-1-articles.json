My main goal has\u00A0 been to keep it as similar to vanilla as possible, with as few deviations from the stock progression path as possible. So far, I\u0027ve got it fairly well roughed out, and it\u0027s available for download on my github at\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Russell-Nesbitt/probeStartTree\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Russell-Nesbitt/probeStartTree\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore I begin to finalize it, however, I wanted to submit it for community critique and see if I can get a few questions regarding modding practice I had answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, I\u0027d appreciate it if I could get it reviewed by more experienced players in regards to its balance. I\u0027ve playtested the mod (50% science/funding, no quicksaves/loads/reverts) only up until Mun orbit missions, and my overall KSP experience extends only to Eve orbit and back. I wanted to ensure that the basic progression path I had set up (especially regarding the post OKTO2 probes) was appropriately balanced for later game play.\u00A0 There\u0027s a screencap of the tree in the Readme, but to see all the changes it will need to be downloaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, I had a few questions regarding modding best-practices and how best to avoid mod incompatibility issues. Currently, my mod works by directly editing TechTree.cfg, dictionary.cfg, and all the relevant part config files. This will obviously result in a great many undesired incompatibilities with other mods. I\u0027m aware of the great utility offered by Module Manager in this case, and -as I mention in the Readme file - I intend to port the mod over to Module Manager as soon as I\u0027ve finalized everything.\u00A0 Once that\u0027s done, I\u0027ll get it hosted it on Spacedock as well as on my personal Github.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my understanding of how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E works, that future port should address pretty much every incompatibility issue regarding TechTree.cfg and the part config files. However, I\u0027m unsure regarding how to solve the problem with dictionary.cfg. Ideally, I\u0027d like even a overwrite-style install (as seen in the Readme) to be fully compatible with other mods that require unique text, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. One of the mods I dissected when I was looking at how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E functioned edited the en-us.cfg file instead of the dictionary.cfg to get custom text into the game. Is this better practice than adding new lines into dictionary.cfg? Furthermore, is there a standard for how to set up unique identifiers for new #autoLOC_ values? I simply appended the ones I needed for custom node text onto the list with different numbers, but I can see how overlaps with other mods could occur in this case. Would something like #autoLOC_probeStartTree_numbergoeshere be in better keeping with modding standards?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had a question regarding the nodeName field present in each tech tree node object in TechTree.cfg. I\u0027m honestly not sure what it\u0027s for. As it seemed to contain information regarding the tier at which the node appears in the tech tree, I made sure to update it for any vanilla nodes I moved up or down in the tech tree progression, and I created new values for the new nodes I added in. For example, I moved the \u0022Landing\u0022 node up a tier in the tree, so I updated its nodeName value to node5_landing. This hasn\u0027t seemed to affect anything in the base game, but as one of my goals is to have this mod work with any other mods that add parts to the vanilla tech tree, I wanted to ensure that nodeName isn\u0027t used in some way that I didn\u0027t notice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also wondering if there was a good place to source custom thumbnail art for tech tree nodes. I have several new nodes in my \u0022Manned Pods\u0022 line that simply borrow art from the \u0022Command Modules\u0022 node,\u00A0 and I would like to replace those with custom art before I do the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E port. I don\u0027t mind having to do it myself in MS paint, but I doubt the results would be pretty! I don\u0027t want to steal art from any other mods without express permission from the author first, for obvious reasons. Is there an accepted etiquette for art reuse?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n#POSSIBLE SPOILERS?#\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made visible the \u0022hidden nodes\u0022 for Experimental Motors and Nanolathing, and incorporated them into my tech tree in case any other mods used them for parts. Is this considered good practice?\u003Cbr\u003E\n#END POSSIBLE SPOILERS#\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLastly, if there\u0027s any modding best practices that I\u0027ve failed to follow and haven\u0027t thought about asking, please tell me!
