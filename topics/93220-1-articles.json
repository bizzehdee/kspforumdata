And the way the VAB actually works, this would seem to suggest that. So why the heck is the VAB so large in Tier 1 and Tier 2? It\u0027s almost as big as the final tier VAB, but on tier 1 you can only ever build rockets that are REALLY SMALL. So why isn\u0027t the VAB small as that to match? It really is too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I build in the Tier 1 VAB, and I find that my ship is too tall for the VAB or it has too many parts, it really feels just like a bullcrap arbitrary limit, not one that\u0027s related to my engineers or the building itself. If the VAB was actually small, then it would really feel like it\u0027s a true limit of the VAB itself, not just a gameplay limit. I even did a little \u0022prototype\u0022 using the structural parts to build a box about the size of a proper tiny VAB, and feeling cramped really did feel like it would make the limit real. Also there\u0027s too much blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: I wanna feel cramped in the Tier 1 and 2 VAB/SPH because it makes the building limits seem real and not arbitrary.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DundraL","CreatedById":118705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECopypasta from another nearby thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022From what I heard the barn is still there.
