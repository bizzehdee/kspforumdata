However, I am looking for a citable source that gives the propellent mass fraction (mass of propellent to total initial mass) of real world SSTOs, or comparable spacecraft. And they don\u0027t have to be SSTOs from Earth. For example, the Apollo landers were all SSTO capable on the Moon, since they landed in a single stage (landing is launching in reverse when there is no atmosphere), and then the ascent stage went back up to orbit on its own, so those would be good places to start. I\u0027ve looked but I just could not find the mass of propellent stored on either the Apollo ascent or descent stages. If anybody could find something similar I\u0027d greatly appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T16:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/specs/lm.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELooks like I spoke too soon!\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
