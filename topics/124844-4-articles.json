They have between 14 and 17 TWR. When the tech tree then proceeds to unlock better engines, they are suddenly not 1.25m anymore - they\u0027re all 2.5m. Their TWR suddenly goes up to between 25 and 32, with comparable Isp and gimbaling across the board. When the 3.75m engines come, they pretty much conform to that same format.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, there is something \u0022missing\u0022 - an 1.25m engine that conforms to the same standards as other \u0022high tech\u0022 engines. It\u0027s not that the other engines are overpowered, but that the 1.25m ones are underpowered due to their earlygame status. And they never get updated to the state of the art that all other engines conform to. You\u0027d expect there to be a version of the Swivel that has perhaps 350 kN thrust. But it never comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there was one other 1.25m rocket engine, the aerospike. But it comes extremely late, and it isn\u0027t even in the rocket branch! Additionally it has no gimbal, and a TWR of 18, not 25\u002B. Its Isp is impressive, but its price is high and it lacks both the power and the versatility of the baseline that the 2.5m and 3.75m engines conform to. It\u0027s not a higher-tech replacement, it\u0027s a gimmick spaceplane engine unsuitable for things that get staged away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, after all this time, and at the very end of the tech tree, you suddenly get an 1.25m engine that conforms to the same power level as the 2.5m/3.75m engine sets. Yes, at first glance it\u0027s another expensive gimmick spaceplane engine, introduced solely to make STS replicas work; but assuming you have the money, or play sandbox, this time you actually \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E use it for a rocket. It has everything a rocket engine needs and is straight up better than a Swivel in every way, just like a Skipper is straight up better than a Swivel in every way. It even has the added advantage of working well on Eve, which will no doubt make it the default Eve ascent engine from now on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\u0027s two things that make the Vector feel completely off the curve: progression and scaling. Firstly, it takes that complete lack of better 1.25m engines that everyone ignored and shoves it into the spotlight. Previously the player thought \u0022well, maybe the huge TWR jump between 1.25m and 2.5m is justified, because it\u0027s a big jump in size, and the smaller ones simply cannot give that sort of performance.\u0022 But now the Vector shows that small ones are very well capable of matching performance, and that the sudden jump isn\u0027t in any way justified. It shows just how far behind the curve the other 1.25m engines really are, and just how large of a gap there is in both tech node progression and performance where other engines should be but aren\u0027t. You look at the Vector and cannot help but feel that it is out of place, simply because there is nothing that gradually leads up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, while the performance conforms to the same baseline as the other large engines, a baseline alone is a very variable thing. You can have 25 TWR with 1000 kN, but you can have the same with 10 kN. It\u0027s all a matter of \u003Cem\u003Escaling\u003C/em\u003E - you can assign it any arbitrary thrust and any arbitrary weight, so long as the math spits out a TWR of 25. And the problem is, with the second most powerful 1.25m engine topping out at 215 kN, placing the Vector at 1,000 kN cannot ever possibly hope to feel like it belongs. I mean, how many tanks do you usually put on top of your typical booster before you add another stage on top? Two FL-T800 for a Swivel, two-three orange jumbos for a Mainsail, two-three S3-14400\u0027s for a Mammoth... And now what? Ten FL-T800\u0027s on a Vector? That\u0027ll just look absurd!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: The Vector is not overpowered compared to most other engines, but it sticks out like a sore thumb for several different reasons. I don\u0027t feel like it is a particularly good addition to the game. It just doesn\u0027t fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with everything EXCEPT that it is a poor addition to the game. I love the heck out of it, while at the same time wanting higher-power 1.25m engines to bridge the gap. Maybe the last part Jeb\u0027s Junkyard makes for rockets in the tech tree ought to be one final high-TWR 1.25m engine: 500 kN thrust. That would help bridge the gap between the Vector and the Reliant while also giving us a rather useful size-1 rocket motor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T13:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to maybe end these types of discussions whenever any new engine is released, is to rejig engines entirely so that players select bells, chambers, pumps capacities, gimbal ranges, other enginey stuff etc. and then configure their own.
