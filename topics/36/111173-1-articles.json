The Apollo stuff is... meh, but were also some of my first attempts at texturing, and I tried to keep them \u0027real\u0027 looking...but unfortunately super-shiny/silver is a really hard look to do without reflective shader support.\n\nAs to dimensions (will update the OP with this info shortly)\n\nApollo stuff is 2.5m core, with 0.625m docking port (which is actually really close to the proper scaled size it should be).\n\nLM is 2.5m-3.7m; it -barely- fits inside a 3.75m fairing. Included is a 3.75m -\u003E 2.5m petal adapter to house the LM (shown in screenshot).\n\nOrion CM is 3.75m core (some fairing/adapter parts are a bit wider...but thats how they really are...). The CM alone -will- fit on top of a 3.75m stack; it even includes a fairing for its heat-shield. The ICPS has lower fairings to support both 5m and 3.75m lower stages.\n\nSome of the misc-parts... I\u0027ll have to get some good screenshots for scale on those..."},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:03:38Z","Content":"I really want the series C ship (it looks very, very smooth), and I would like to play with it.
