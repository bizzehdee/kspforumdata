For the most part things work pretty well considering! But let me report some weirdness for posterity:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA. With each player launching and rendezvousing two separate ships piloted by 1 kerbal, everything went more or less smoothly. But then we tried to do an EVA to swap ships. It couldn\u0027t be done. When you EVA any kerbals from your ship, a representation of the EVA kerbal does appear for the other player, but no kerbals are removed from the ship on the other players computer.\u00A0This means other plays are not able to board your empty ship. If you manage to return to your ship things work normally. But if for some reason you don\u0027t, this half empty / half full ship can\u0027t be boarded. If you attempt to switch to the half empty ship you will see a half missing kerbal portait! Also during the EVA the kerbal roster in astronaut complex begins to show the kerbal as available as well as assigned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLadders are quite fickle, moving or not. A kerbal doing fine on a ladder on one machine may be clipping through and applying excessive forces to the craft on the other machine. Grabbing a ladder at all with atmosphere was not accepted, F bounces you away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParachute graphics don\u0027t show for other players, but fortunately the parachute forces do apply to the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe safety bubble. Other players can\u0027t spectate your ship from the tracking station when your craft begins on the launch pad or on the runway, but if you move slightly then they can, even before leaving the safety bubble.

For some reason, on the server I started up, vessels just... Teleport 650,000km into space whenever they make contact with\u00A0a planetary body or enter an atmosphere. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s something with the mods I\u0027ve been using, or something else entirely, but whenever it happens there are three red rings on the X, Y, and Z axis, and the launched vessel is always on one of the rings, and the ring it\u0027s on is offset from the others.
