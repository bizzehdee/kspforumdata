We assume we want to take a 5 year trip with 2 Kerbals using Kerbin timeframe, the different mods give us the following numbers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIFLS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Kerbal consumes 1 u/K-d, we would need 4260u of LS (426*2*5) -plus EC, but thats not considered now-, the included larger container holds 1000u, the smaller one 125u, meaning you would need 4 large and 2 small ones, weighing in at 23.425 tons. With added safety margin it would be 27.5t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESnacks! with added Containers by Whyren:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the randomized nature of consumption, it\u0027s rather difficult to assess the needed quantity. I tend to play it safe and will assume a wider safety margin. Kerbals consume ~1/2 snack /K-day, so one would need ~3000 snacks, equaling 3 of the largest container by Whyren, these amount to 12.375 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIoncross (Starwaster\u0027s branch):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIoncross focuses on O2/CO2-conversion.

From your numbers it\u0027s pretty clear that the weight of the glykerol consumed needs to be minimal. So I\u0027ll be switching to 5 liters per freeze (which fits with the model that this mostly for replacing fluid inside the kerbals). For your 5 kerbal crew you\u0027d need 10 freeze events (provided everyone went under) or about .6t of glykerol and another 3.5t of dry weight for the part for a total payload weight of 4.1t. This would make the cryonic choice clearly cheaper for a couple of mod, and give us a slight edge on TAC.
