Suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So this is apparently more of a general KSP thing. If you install a mod that adds parts, the parts will not automatically be unlocked just because you already have that science node. You have to go back to that node in the tech tree, look at the parts window on the right, and then manually \u0022research\u0022 each new part (it\u0027s free).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-02T16:07:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2013 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by simmy2109\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarthJazno","CreatedById":57464,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T16:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022simmy2109\u0022 data-cite=\u0022simmy2109\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGetting a very strange problem... trying to use these in my KSP career save, but the parts claim I don\u0027t have the science researched.

Suggestions?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to your tech tree and find the parts. They are in the middle somewhere.

Just tested it and must say that i am very happy to have a ISA Mapsat replacement that works better as the original. Multiple scanners simulatneos is incredibly useful, and the markers/orbital info pieces are a nice addon. Thanks a lot for making this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one little suggestion for the magnified zoom window on the big map: The \u0022click again to zoom in even more\u0022 feature works, but is somewhat painful to use if you want to go from 10x zoom (initial) to a much higher zoom like 50x or 100x, as i have to step through all of the small intermediate steps (12, 15, 19 and whatnot) . I don\u0027t know how the \u0022next zoom step size\u0022 is calculated (guessing its something like \u0022increase zoom by a factor of 1.25\u0022), but i think such fine stepping is not really required. My suggestion would be to simplify this to a fixed stepping like 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x or to increase this factor to 2 or something like that. Also, it would be nice to let the user resize the zoom window or make its size somehow configurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, these are very minor issues, probably something to add to the bottom of the issue list.

(DMagic, OrtwinS)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The polar orthographic projection doesn\u0027t choke on the antimeridian \u003Cbr\u003E  anymore. (DMagic)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Greyscale mode changes more colors to barrier free colors.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The big map is now resizable and its size and position are saved in the \u003Cbr\u003E  persistance file.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Map markers now use the stock KSP icons, if applicable. (Sochin)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- More text has black outlines now to make it more readable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Map markers and the ground track are now visible in the zoom box. (Ortwins)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Polar projection now displays handy S and N markers. (Thourion, OrtwinS)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- All parts now consume electrical charge. The amounts are not finalized yet\u003Cbr\u003E  but can be configured in the part.cfg files.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Slope detection has been folded into altimetry. (OrtwinS)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Existing slope sensors have become broken, and a small explosive charge has\u003Cbr\u003E  been activated remotely for your convenience. You can trigger it via the\u003Cbr\u003E  right-click menu to get rid of the part on existing vessels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If there are maneuver nodes on the active orbit during the time span for \u003Cbr\u003E  which the ground track is rendered, the first maneuver node\u0027s position will\u003Cbr\u003E  be indicated on the ground track along with the ground track for one period\u003Cbr\u003E  of the resulting orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The GUI style should not flip between Unity and KSP style. (BananaDealer)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Rendered maps are not exported automatically anymore. Instead, there\u0027s a\u003Cbr\u003E  button in the big map window that exports the current map without any of\u003Cbr\u003E  the overlays. Exported images are still saved in the same location. (MOARdV)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Flags are now visible on the map.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Double clicking a ship name in the small window now switches to that ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The vessel list in the small window can now be toggled, and the window can\u003Cbr\u003E  be minimized to an icon only.
