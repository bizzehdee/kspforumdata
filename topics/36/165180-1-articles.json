I\u0027ve been trying to add IVAs, which I\u0027ve done for another mod, but since unity and/or PartTools updated, I\u0027m unable to get the exported .mu files to work properly. KSP won\u0027t recognise them, and even though Unity reads the internal configs, I always get an error message saying \u0022cannot create space\u0022 whenever I try to spawn the IVA model to add props. I\u0027ve tried everything I can possibly think of with no luck whatsoever, so I have decided to look for help. If anyone would be willing to work with me on this, please message me or reply to this topic, you\u0027d obviously be credited as a co-author. I already have the basic IVA models in blender which might be helpful, but you can change them if you want. I only have very few specific things I\u0027d like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
