As long as the costs don\u0027t rise absurdly.  Bear in mind, in every other game that comes to mind, hiring cost and than unit upkeep don\u0027t increase as your level grows.  Perhaps what would make more sense would be upkeep on the buildings themselves.  ...but, if that\u0027s not possible, I suppose a bump in hiring costs is an okay extrapolation of that idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T21:04:11Z","Content":"Yeah, something is definitely unbalanced if the most affordable way to grow your organization is to rescue strangers from orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T22:10:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Nightside said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, something is definitely unbalanced if the most affordable way to grow your organization is to rescue strangers from orbit.\n\u003E \n\n...and some people still defend that game mechanic."}]}
