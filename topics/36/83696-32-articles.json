Bi-modal engines are a more recent idea than the old NERVA type engines. The thing of it is, is that since the rocket engine is also acting on a heat engine cycle (such as the brayton or rankine cycles) just like a conventional powerplant you need lots of additional equipment: compressors, heat exchangers, turbines and big radiator panels. This stuff is bulkier than the engine itself and isn\u0027t represented at all in the model. \u003Cp\u003EHere is an example image from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#ntrsolidcore\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enyrath\u0027s excellent website\u003C/a\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/enginelist/tritonScan.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/enginelist/tritonScan.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big ridged cone is the radiator for the power system.
