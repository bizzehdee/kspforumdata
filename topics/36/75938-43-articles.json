My best guess is that it would load the second of the two after the first one, and thus override the variable with that new value. However, I do not know how KSP loads that data into its internal database. The best practice is to not have duplicate parameters but, from my experience, nothing bad has ever happened from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also just noticed, while trying to figure out a few stock errors, that those configs are pointing to non-existent models. It\u0027s rather odd that a config would still load a model without a reference to it, but it\u0027s not the first time I\u0027ve seen this happen. When I was installing Karbonite, back in the \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E early days of that mod, I noticed that several of the configs which had only one model in the directory (named \u0022model.mu\u0022) were also missing a mesh or model reference, and yet still managed to load the part with no issue. I\u0027m wondering if there might be a default behavior in the engine that will load that single model found in the same directory which is named identically to the name of the part and make the connection with that config if the currently defined model is not correct, or not even defined. Similarly, you\u0027ll notice that when using \u0022mesh\u0022 you have to supply a file extension, but under the \u0022MODEL\u0022 node, you have to omit the extension. I\u0027m not too sure what it all means, but I have a feeling that just as a \u0022MODULE\u0022 node has default values that, if not defined otherwise in the config, is used to define a certain behavior, configs for parts may also have some default values that are applied when the circumstances and/or environment are set up in a specifically perfect position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock error I was tracking down when I discovered the connections was an error that stated, in not-exact words, that the model (defined under the \u0022mesh\u0022 parameter) could not be found in the directory (which is not defined, and defies the logic that I just explained above) which was specified as \u0022Squad/Parts/some-other-folders/nameofpart/nameofpartconfig/nameofpart/\u0022 which is a directory that does not exist, but that internally would be a good way to define the connection between a part and a model which you can have multiple models and/or parts in a single configuration and/or directory. The problem with the error, however, is that the config and the directory structure for the part was constructed exactly the same way as every other perfectly working part is constructed. My only way to fix this was to remove the stock \u0022mesh\u0022 parameter and replace it with a \u0022MODEL\u0022 node. I don\u0027t think even Squad is fully aware of what\u0027s going on here because they just shipped version .25 to us with these errors being thrown about causing stock parts to not load correctly. Even crazier is the lack of any hot-fix patches to fix the problem, which suggests that they have not figured out the problem themselves and thus do not want to start hot-fixing until they \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E understand it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese little buggers are not unexpected with such a complicated addon-system however.

I would suggest shipping the way you have been, however, since you\u0027d have to place a dependency on the DDS loader mod.
