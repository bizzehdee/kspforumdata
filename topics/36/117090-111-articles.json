Single ratio is the only way to go.  If you want the full spectrum of ratios and fuels... well... that is exactly what Real-Fuels is for (and why the MFT\u0027s and engines support it; which is also why I won\u0027t be adding auto-fuel-setting to the MFTs... feel free to use RF if that is important to you... ). \n\nI\u0027ll be sticking with the realism-lite concept for now; same ratio across engines, semi-simplified fuels setup (though obviously slightly more complex than stock).  Mostly this will come into play if/when I add boil-off to LH2 (and possibly oxidizer, to lesser degree?); fuel-selection will be much more important for long-term missions, where hypergolics can often win out over LH2 just for there long-duration storage capabilities.  Your transfer stage might be LH2, but you\u0027ll likely use hypergolics for the insertion stage.  Of course, if I do implement boil-off, I\u0027ll likely have some options for zero-boil-off tanks that consume EC for refrigeration purposes.  Would also be cool to turn the boil-off into hydrogen gas to be used by fuel cells/etc...  but that is perhaps getting more complex than I want to get into ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E IIRC Experimental Rocketry is there, hidden and unused by stock but it is there, I don\u0027t remember exactly which mods use that node though...

I\u0027ve got good news and bad news for today:\n\n**Good news**:  Most everything appears to work great during testing.  The gimbal bug was fixed, so engine clusters work again.  Split-thrust setups for the vernier-enabled engines are in and working.\n\n**Bad news**:  The \u0027procedural drag-cubes for root part breaking map mode\u0027 bug did not get fixed.  Rather they made it so that fairings cannot be the root part (how does that fix it?)....  Ticket is still open, though no further information/updates have been posted in several days. \n\nI thought I had a hack/work-around in place by delaying the rendering of the drag cube; sadly this merely delays the manifestation of the problem; the moment the drag-cube is rendered, map mode is broken, even if the craft has been in flight for several minutes.  You can actually watch the map mode break if you switch to map-view when the drag-cube is updated;  the vessel map-pin and orbit lines disappear and\n\nThere is one more potential workaround that I can implement, however the work required to do so would be substantial and I will be waiting to see if the bug is fixed in future pre-release/1.1 final before I attempt to implement it (caching drag cubes from rendering in the editor and manually re-creating from stored data in flight-scene; requires a lot of per-module code changes, across many different modules; not so much fun, nor a very clean solution).  \n\n**What this all means**:  Sorry, still no release available.  The procedural drag cube bug breaks nearly every SSTU part when used as root (including command-pods), and I do not feel good about publishing a release with such game-breaking problems.  I had intended on publishing the first of the 1.1 compatible versions today, but cannot with such a large problem with so many parts.\n\nI\u0027m going to continue working on the upgrade process; still a fairly large list of things to finish up, clean up, and a full balance pass to be done on nearly all parts.
