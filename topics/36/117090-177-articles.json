When I was creating my custom shielded tank I ran many test with standard, lightweight, my custom shielded tank along side stock tank. SSTU might be slightly are more sensitive as they are lighter that stock therefore can\u0027t sink as much heat has heavier stock tank. Overall, the difference is neglectable.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In other news it has been all but officially confirmed that there will **not** be the \u0027rocket-parts-revamp\u0027 in 1.2, and with that, no support for PBR shader.  So... yeah...  apparently I get the fun task of writing up some custom shaders.  Not surprising, as they\u0027de been extremely tight-lipped about it.  Still are... haven\u0027t even heard any confirmation that it is still being worked on for a future update... only vague statements that don\u0027t exclude the possibility of it being worked on in the future.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On the note of updates and updating -- I will be jumping on the 1.2 pre-releases as soon as they become available for testing.  I fully expect SSTU to be massively broken by this update, both in raw code and in actual function of the code.  Likely will be a few weeks to get it working and compatible.\n\u003E \n\nOh well... If you ask me, PBR would be nice but if you would decide to not do it it would not make me cry. 1.2 update is more important for me as I won\u0027t play it without SSTU.

They are not using the part how it was intended and so they are responsible for taking care of anything needed for their alternate use.  The other option is to remove the lower nodes and auto fairings from the parts, preventing such alternate uses entirely.\n\n(The **solution** would be for the stock decoupler module to allow specifying multiple nodes that should be decoupled, so that a single decoupler module could manage both nodes.
