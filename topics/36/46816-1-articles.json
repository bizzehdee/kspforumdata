I tried to get into making parts a few months back but around the time of the forum having to roll back I ended up being unable to afford the rent on my flat and have spent the past few months looking for somewhere to live (bad times), I will be moving into my new and much more affordable flat on Monday and have decided it is time to come back and continue creating parts for KSP (good times). I may not have internet for the first couple of weeks but I will be able to do much of the work on models/textures and probably have the tools downloaded before moving in on Monday to have everything needed to work on the parts I have planned. I was speaking with several people on these forums a while back but their accounts no longer seem to exist after the forum roll back and I have no idea what their usernames are now (message me if you were talking to me please! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), hopefully I can get back in contact with everyone easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EToo Long, Didn\u0027t Read - I was here, then I was gone, now I\u0027m back and ready to make parts.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ECurrent Plans:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have decided to try and mostly work on my own, when I work with others it won\u0027t be posted in this thread and I\u0027d like to keep it to a minimum till I get back into the swing of things. The thing I have noticed about many part packs on the forums is that while they usually have amazing parts and clearly a lot of work put into them they rarely, if ever, seem to add everything needed to build an entire rocket/ship/whatever in their particular design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe few that do this well are generally designed for the space planes/atmospheric craft, and to be honest that\u0027s where I spend the least time as I see the game as a space exploration game, not a plane flight simulator (although it is fun doing that and I know plenty of people like that side of it, it\u0027s not what I enjoy). So my plans are to create several different designed packs, in particular based around the colonization and scientific exploration themes, I already have a few things I modelled prepared to import, but I am still getting used to it again so it will be slow to begin with. I\u0027d post some renders of the landing craft I\u0027ve been working on but I\u0027m still in the middle of animating it and I\u0027d prefer to simply post the video render of it doing a landing (in the modelling program first, then another when it is in-game). Here is a list of what I have in the works right now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EColony Vessel:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Colony Vessel is designed to have everything needed to take a one-way trip to any planet in the system with an atmosphere, it has enough room for 16 Kerbals and when set up properly, can become a self sustaining colony. The Vessel itself becomes a permanent orbital platform once the colony has been established, the habitation modules have enough room to transport 2 Kerbals to the surface and deploy to provide a living space for up to 3 Kerbals once on the surface. The station is best manned by 2-4 Kerbals at any one time so once the colony is ready you can have up to 21 Kerbals living in the colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u002B\u003C/strong\u003EColony Vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kethane Satellite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2x Lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mining Lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Science Equipment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Airborne Probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-5x Habitation Module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETerraformer:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Terraformer Vessel is built for the purpose of providing a Kerbin-like atmosphere on other worlds, even ones with no atmosphere currently! The ship itself lands as a whole, it then deploys to reveal several nuclear reactors powering the central device, while no Kerbals will see any change on the selected world for many generations, it is still an important goal among Kerbkind to complete this task. Setting up a colony around these terraformers is recommended, as any Kerbals living there will be the ones performing maintenance on the devices if required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BTerraformer Vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Terraformer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EFuture Plans:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to eventually provide full support for several other mods I use regularly, in particular the Kethane mod (as shown in the Colony Vessel parts) is a priority. My goals are to provide as complete a part pack as is possible, to the extent that you don\u0027t need to tape on another mods parts to ships from my pack, for example, my plans already include a Kethane scanner and mining drill following my packs designs, I\u0027m already preparing for the research equipment for the next KSP update too. If you use a mod which you would like to see supported by my parts then feel free to let me know, I\u0027ll do my best to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EScreenshots:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EComing Soon!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EVideos:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EComing Soon!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWays to Support the Pack:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EComing Soon!
