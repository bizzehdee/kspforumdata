The easiest approach would be to make all command pods consume electricity. Then, upon losing all electrical charge, make the plugin kill the kerbals after a set amount of time. The plugin could also be written to kill a kerbal on EVA once they ran out of fuel, since there is no built-in electricity in the EVA suits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be the easiest approach, though the solution itself will vary in coding length depending on how you go about it. Most importantly, this does not require changes to the parts themselves other than a code block for electricity consumption, something that you can copy and paste from something like the lights or anything that consumes power. No additional transforms need be added to the pods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T16:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you talking about Kerbals in command pods as PringleMan is, or Kerbals on EVA?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ako_Vendetta","CreatedById":82811,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T16:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s essentially what I want to do, is a very simplified life support system without having to micromanage oxygen levels and stuff.

The only thing you will need from the API is the code to kill the kerbals, but you could ask any of the LS modders for how they implemented it, I am sure they would love to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
