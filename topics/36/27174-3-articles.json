I know that that level of detail is pointless, but I was wondering if you were going to add a detachable \u0022cap\u0022 with the parachutes hidden underneath? I figured if you want to replicate t he Saturn V, you should get as close as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I was going to try and retexture the service module to the gunmetal blue that the actual one has, but I noticed that the unwrap is very, odd. If you want me to texture it, could you possibly send me a copy of the mesh? I would need to rearrange the unwrap so it that it would be easier to texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I think the SPS engine should be directly attached to the craft. One reason is because it is built attached when the rocket is put together at the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The Lunar Module Adapter turned out pretty well. I still think you need a way to jettison the fairings, but since this is just beta and it\u0027s not really that important of a feature, it can be held off. I know that BobCat has a few \u0022Jettison\u0022 functions on some of the things in his soviet pack, perhaps you could do something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I\u0027m a bit OCD, so the values on the saturn rocket itself really bugged me. They were nowhere near as powerful as the other rocket. The first stage has 33,851 megagrams of thrust, and weighs 2267.9616 tons(with the engines attached I believe). This is very, very low priority but it would be cool to see accurate weights and thrusts later down the line. Again, I\u0027m being really OCD here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the suggestions. I studied the Saturn V and Apollo Program for 20\u002B years, it\u0027s a bit of a hobby of mine.

Yea, that picture shows the barebone command module without protective plating over it. I wasn\u0027t expecting detail like that. I was trying to draw your attention to the crew tunnel connected to the docking port and how the parachutes set in there. I think that given enough time the models could be detailed enough to include something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027m actually working on the service module right now. I\u0027m trying a completely new design for it because for some reason, when I exported it from blender to maya, there were a lot of stray vertices. It was probably caused by the export. So there\u0027s no need to convert them for me. I designed a few elder scrolls mods a couple years back and I had to do similar things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. That\u0027s fair enough. Perhaps I can detail it a bit more? The wiki says that polycounts should be low, but to be honest, in this game, the biggest frame killer is the physics. I think the models themselves could handle 10/15% more polygons. I have an old dual core processor(crappy computer) that I use to test mods on, to make sure that they run on low end computers fairly well, so I\u0027ll try and test that before I get the updates to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You did it in one morning? That\u0027s even more impressive. It took me an hour just to make my mockup!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Well obviously so. But what I mean is, people throw down .64 a lot for sizes, and I figure that works for rockets as well. The truth is, for a rocket to have that much thrust, it would need enormous amounts of fuel to be used for more than a few seconds, and I think the combination of the weight and thrust would even things out. The thing is, and these values are completely off compared to KSP standards, the first stage got the craft to about 64km, the second stage got the apigee to 184k, and the third stage put it in a parking orbit, and was used for TLI. Now, obviously those are dead wrong in KSP, because Kerbin\u0027s field of gravity is barely 1/5th of the Earths, but I think with the right tweaking we could get it fairly accurate. Again, over the beta, I\u0027m sure this stuff will be tweaked. I\u0027ll probably do my own tests to see if it\u0027s possible to launch a shuttle like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T03:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I\u0027ll just share my progress here.
