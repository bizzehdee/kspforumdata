Most of the country believes that space travel is impossible, and is a waste of effort. A small group of Kerbals including Wernher von Kerman, Bob Kerman, Bill Kerman, Jebediah Kerman, and a few other staff purchase some land on the coast of their continent. The build a simple rocket base there with few resources. Wernher von Kerman used to work for the other side of the war, developing missiles. He later defected, as his goal was to go to space, not fight wars. Perhaps when the Keriama Space Program proves itself to be capable of spaceflight, the nation will support them. (Player\u0027s Space Program)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Socialist Republic of Ussari\u0027s Space Program started with the dream of one Kerbal to get people to the Mun.

Pictures taken from aircrafts have already been put together by cartographers to map out Kerbin, and astronomy has been able to make a few predictions of the planets. The only visible side of the Mun has been mapped out, but Minmus meanwhile is visible merely as a point of minty-fresh light. Duna and Ike have had some slight mapping efforts, and basic detail such as brown bits on the equator of Duna, white bits on the poles, and Ike has several known black spots. Jool has been observed to have several cloud bands, and at least three moons, each one of different color. Moho has some known craters, and Eve is just a light-pink sphere. No geological detail is known of the planets, so they can only truthfully be illustrated in the map as flat spheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData on planets such as gravity and atmosphere readings are given by the respective instruments, and are NOT available in the map view until the data is recovered or transmitted back. Default gravity and atmosphere data for Kerbin at start is available. However, to fill in the map, a camera must be used. They are taken in first person, and actually take into account what\u0027s in frame to fill in the map. Data gained by spacecraft is visible to the map of that spacecraft ONLY, unless/until it is transmitted back home or recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECamera pictures are valuable scientific instruments not just because they can yield both reputation and science, but because they can aid in mapping of the bodies. The detail of the map is based on how much of the planet is in-frame of a picture, how far away the spacecraft is, how zoomed in the camera is, and how high-quality the camera is. Manned Command Pods can automatically generate a heightmap for planets within a certain distance (A RADAR altimeter in the command pod, remember?), but this data is only saved if the mission is recovered. Camera photos can be live-fed by SSTV-signals back home or they can be recovered. Live photos will boost reputation, but Recovered photos have higher quality and are more scientifically valuable. Cameras can only store a certain amount of photos at a time, so be careful what you image! Photographs can NOT be deleted, but a Kerbal can take the film cartridge and replace it (or simply take the film back home to be recovered).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the R\u0026amp;D facility is upgraded, Eeloo and Dres are discovered when the telescope-observatory is built. Gilly, Bop, and Pol are only discovered when a ship enters the S.O.I. of Eve/Jool respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA Kerbals can also unlock a camera strictly for science and rep, and MUST be recovered. They are planted into the ground like flags are. There are also several other surface experiments that are planted like flags, such as a kerbolar wind experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on, digital cameras allow higher-quality data transmission than recovery, and can store AND delete photos, and store many more of them. Standalone RADAR Altimeters can be used for both landing info and heightmapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Space-Telescopes can be used for high quality height AND photo mapping of planets. They can also be used to map the Skybox. Telescopes will shut down if they look at the sun, (but do not EXPLODE like CactEye telescopes do.) so a special telescope mount must be used to observe the sun. They use the film system, and the cartridges must be retrieved via E.V.A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGame Balance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree will have embedded into it the option to follow a similar tech development as the U.S. Space \u0026amp; Rocket Programs and NASA, but there will be other routes that can be taken, depending on the types of missions and what they are. There must also be some alternate realities that mirror what COULD have been for NASA, and some other ones that are just more Kerbal-y or total fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike BTSM, BTTS will include a slow early-game tech progression, but the aerodynamics of NEAR must be kept in mind. Unmanned robot-probes come first, then comes stolen unpressurized cockpits from the museum, then comes barely-pressurized cockpits, then the Space Capsules, then waaaay later on proper spaceplane cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll tank dry masses are decreased to somewhat more realistic values to help with the upscale. The goal is to have rockets sized to their own universe. 64% real scale scale world, 64% scale real rocket (albeit with some exaggerated proportions). This means that 3.75 meter parts are replaced with 4.224 meter parts and what would be 5 meter parts are 6.4 meter parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Liquid Fueled Engines have higher thrust. Especially the rescaled ones. And, Jet Engines are also rebalanced so that they\u0027re not as effective as they are in stock. Perhaps Advanced Jet Engine could be used, but that might get too complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the size-3 parts have been remade into size-5 parts. Size-3 still exists, but using different models. The KR-2L is still the same size, roughly, but because we are using Ven\u0027s stock part revamp as a basis, the engines have no giant mounting tankbutt. This means that the KR-2L can be used in a first stage in a cluster of 5 as F-1 rocket engines! This also means that the KR-2L is rebalanced to have a much lower Isp in Vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will also likely be a small set of 3.2 meter parts to act as Orion parts. Probably no lifter parts though. There will be an adapter to 2.5 meter parts (service module) and the capsule will seat 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will also be 1.875 meter parts including a two-man capsule. The Lifter parts for the Uoskosmos (Ussarian Space Program) will also include 1.875 meter parts.
