I landed the two on Pol, as one ship, and was drilling and converting into the large LFO tank on the orbiter. Once I separated the two, and then docked again using the winch (which, fully retracted, was how they were connected when I was getting successful fuel conversion and transfer, as well as at launch) the converter now reports \u0022no space\u0022, even though there is a large Kerbodine tank sitting at least partially empty. The ships are together and I can transfer Mono between the two vessels via the winch cable, so that\u0027s confirmed attachment. I\u0027ve also tried connecting with the pipe connector, and same result. The rover has two Karry Kans, one with LF and the other Ox, but when I drill with the rover alone, I still get \u0022no space\u0022 even though there are empty Karry Kans attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027m doing anything wrong, since manual fuel transfer is successful when they\u0027re docked. Is this something with the way Karbonite recognizes tanks as part of a ship, or maybe with the way that KAS describes attachment? Either way this is frustrating since I spent millions setting up this operation at the edge of the solar system.
