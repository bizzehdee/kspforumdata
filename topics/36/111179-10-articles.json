I haven\u0027t got more than an hour in weaks... This exam will hopefully get me into a math-computerscience hightschool. After that I plan on folowing a career in aerospace. If not... I\u0027ll just go to the art school and become an architect. Cheers and I hope you all make this pack as unique as possible.

And junging after how long it took for a youtuber (kottabos) to review Kerbol Plus, we will certainly nead a lot of popularity. Make things cool and unique and don\u0027t bother with textures since I will start on redoing them after I finish my exam and we will finaly have a releasable mod!
