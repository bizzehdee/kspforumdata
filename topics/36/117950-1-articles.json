The SetTexture call works, I see the button change.\n\nMy problem is that it never returns from the SetTexture call, so that the flag which gets set after it isn\u0027t set and the rest of the mod doesn\u0027t work.\n\nI added a logging statement at the beginning of the update function to display the flag, and I see that it is never set.\n\nWhen the game is exited, then it returns and I get the messages in the log file.\n\nWhat would prevent Unity from returning from the SetTexture call?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nLGG\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T13:43:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T13:57:44Z","Content":"KSP.log is buffered.

But when I put a debug statement at the beginning of Update(), it shows that the flag which is set immediately following the SetTexture is not set, and that shows up in the log very quickly.\n\nWhen I exit the game, then I see the SetTexture message in the log.\n\nHow do I write to the output\\_log.txt? If it shows the same thing as the KSP.log, then why are there two log files?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T18:04:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T18:27:23Z","Content":"KSP has two logs because it\u0027s weird that way.
