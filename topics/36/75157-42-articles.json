Now I was able to fix it on the moon by editing a fade distance, but msy have ruined your EVE work in the process. And another issue without the fog is the ground seems very gritty looking and vibrates quite significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera clipping is the big issue however. It\u0027s impossible to enjoy your work on any planet other then Earth because the camera clips it all away after a certain distance. If I wanted to enjoy the beauty of mars ( and I\u0027m guessing any other body I travel too ) I have to enter the atmosphere then exit back to scaled space for the clipping issue to go away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T19:28:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zombiphylax","CreatedById":5471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T20:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deltervees\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deltervees\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis picture has been circulating the subreddit, and The People want to know what mod it is from, so I told them it looked like this mod.
