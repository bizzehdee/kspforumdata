There are many reasons why that\u0027s actually kinda strange and if you want to get into that there is about 50,000 pages of discussion on this subject on the internet, some of which has substance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is that the physical construction of SLS is firstly real rather than just a cartoon image and secondly new engineering from the ground up... it\u0027s not just the same machines that made ET it\u0027s all new, partly from new ideas about efficiency but also for logistic reasons down at Michoud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main confusion about the Block I system you see in the graphics is that, really, anywhere you could send an Orion capsule with that much power, you would also want some kind of hab or other eqipment module to go with you (Orion doesnt even have a toilet) .... and in the end wouldn\u0027t it be smarter to send orion up on a smaller booster and have it dock with something that the heavy launcher put in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from that perspective the Ares system seems smarter, except fot the fact that the Ares I idea was a total failure and many of the systems that will go into the big SLS launcher are already well understood and easy to man-rate, so it\u0027s really more like the Jupiter system and Ares merged, with a big helping of compromise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not perfect but at least it\u0027s funded!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Chaka system we are taking one giant leap over all that crap and going directly to the Block II SLS config with a large upper stage, advanced boosters and 130-160 MT LEO capacity, as would be invisioned for the mid 2030\u0027s. Once you get to that point, putting orion on the large booster is redundant and I\u0027m using a bespoke 5 meter LV for putting Orion into orbit, kinda like the Ares platform, without the foolish Ares I SRB ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real world equivelant would be sending orion up un crewed inside the cargo payload fairing with other heavy stuff like a hab and then using commercial crew launchers to send the crew up to that whole system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T23:54:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T00:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIsn\u0027t the SLS is basically just an Ares V with lower payload capacity?

Everything you said is true but lets take a moment and dig a little deeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The vibration of the SRB on shuttle was balanced out to an extent because there were two of them and some structural flex between them and the crew cabin. When you only have one and you are bolted directly on top of it, you are riding a jack hammer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The purpose of Ares I was increased safety because, in principle, the most dangerous parts of the shuttle system are eliminated. But wait a second, by using one SRB you are making it incredibly difficult to control, and relying 100% on a single motor which can\u0027t be turned off. Compare that with the falcon system using 9 merlins. Engine out? Gimble failure? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The upper stage motor would have to air start! You arent gonna get an upper stage out of the atmosphere with even a 5 segment SRB. So we\u0027re gonna put our lives on an air start of a J2X or RL-10 at mach ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Guess how they man rated the 5 segment SRB as a core structural stage? By taking the structural rigidity requirements for man rating and putting them in the paper shredder. Remember your first kerbal rocket with like 5 tank segments as the core structure and you got half way out of the atmosphere and a resonance flex built up and you went spinning out of control? 5 Segment SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The SSRB system was NEVER intended to be used as a core structural piece. Those things have a hard enough time staying together when they are strapped on, imagine a big heavy tank on top? It\u0027s like balancing a beer on 5 toilet paper rolls taped together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Cost. Because of 1 thru 5 the development cost of the system from test to human flight would be so high relative to the flight rate that each launch would be more expensive than shuttle. So for the same price you might as well fly SLS, which by the way since SLS doesnt suffer from 1 thru 5 is safer anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS = comparable price, more safety, more payload, you start to see why they felt like it was almost free. To heck with the fact that it\u0027s no better than shuttle from an equipment cost perspective, compared to how bad Ares I could have been it\u0027s a bargain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Human rated EELV would be cheaper and better performing by huge margins (although the Senator from Utah might get pissed that people at ATK would have to get laid off). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the rant but you know\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T02:42:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T09:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YANFRET\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YANFRET\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you glad to hear Orion is getting some flight time.

Most people don\u0027t understand that the SLS is functionally identical to what would have been called the Ares V (and the proposed, so-called Ares IV heavy crewed launcher) because most of the specs (engine selection, type of boosters, etc.) hadn\u0027t really been nailed down. Almost all of the development that had taken place was in the hardware to adapt the Shuttle SRB forward skirt for mounting the J-2 (or J-2X) interstage, and their (failed, dismal) attempts to dampen the POGO effect from the solid booster. Putting a manned capsule on top of a solid booster was patently ridiculous, and it\u0027s a shame it took them so long for rational thinking to come into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a case for using commercial EELV craft for launching the manned missions, but as the Orion test flight is going to show, even the largest EELV currently used (the Delta IV Heavy) doesn\u0027t have enough energy to launch the Orion stack to meet the mission profiles currently envisioned. Of course people are going to say, \u0022well what about the SpaceX Falcon Heavy?\u0022, which is fine, but even that hasn\u0027t flown a single mission yet, and the base Falcon 9 hasn\u0027t (yet) been man-rated. Lockheed hasn\u0027t made any progress on man-rating the Atlas V because they\u0027re not going to spend private-industry dollars on a complicated process that might go to waste, even with the Atlas being selected to launch Dream Chaser. AFAIK there hasn\u0027t been progress on man-rating the Atlas V since late 2011, and they cancelled what would have been a multi-core, heavy lift version of Atlas anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T17:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoint of note.
