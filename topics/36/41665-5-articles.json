Much of that is due to drag. Because drag is proportional to the square of the velocity, this means that going 1000 m/s at 4 km isn\u0027t ten times the drag of going 100 m/s, but rather 100 times. Due to this you see very little improvement if you go that fast that low. This is also why you can come racing towards Kerbin at 10,000 m/s and still slow down to 200 m/s before your parachutes deploy. And I don\u0027t want to require FAR, because I want to depend on as few other mods as possible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, though- the atmosphere is only 40% as thick at 4200 meters. For that reason, terminal velocity is 63.7% greater at 5000 meters than at sea-level...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, if you remember the Rocket Equation, you know that you pay the highest cost in mass for those initial few hundred Delta-V. Even if a mass drive that starts at the base of a 4200 meter mountain and ends at 5000 meters only saves the rocket 300 or 400 m/s of Delta-V off its total cost, that\u0027s a lot more fuel mass (as well as engine mass and control mass) saved than you think- especially for large rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, the Oberth Effect is also a bit of a contributing factor here- if you leave the mass drive at 2000 m/s, and start burning your rocket engines immediately (even though most of that energy will go to drag), you still get a lot further with the same amount of fuel than if you start burning your engines at 0 m/s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, that kick-start velocity translates to serious benefits in terms of reduced design constraints. If you start out at 2,000 m/s at 5000 meters, your SRB\u0027s will last you until a much greater altitude- which means you may be able to make use of much weaker (but higher-ISP) LFO engines, like NERVA\u0027s, for your first LFO engines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skykooler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skykooler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs mentioned, the craft are put on rails while they are accelerated.

It\u0027s just fun. I only tried one launch so far since that\u0027s all I had time for after getting everything set up. Does the direction you\u0027re travelling prior to mass driver launch affect what sort of orbit it throws you at? I spawned a rover on the runway and went straight for the mass driver (north), and ended up getting thrown to the north. Haven\u0027t had a chance to test it further yet. Also wanted to ask if there\u0027s any way I can change the distance at which it launches, since I\u0027d rather it wait until I got to the entrance (within 5 meters or so), instead of within 500 meters. It doesn\u0027t appear to be possible in this version.
