You could try editing the config files in GameData instead, since the in-game menu is basically a display of those (depending on what mods you have installed, either the default scatterer configs or the ones that came with your planet mod or visual mods)."},{"CreatedByName":"TRAPPIST-1E","CreatedById":212230,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-14T00:25:41Z","Content":"Well, I realize that, but I was wondering if there was a way to resize the menu.
