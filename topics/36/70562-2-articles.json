I do know that you can simply rotate them on the center axis in the SPH and get the gimbaling going any which way you want. The only thing they don\u0027t do well is mount in anything more than pairs, such as 45 degree angles (quad mounting in X shape or star mounts from the rear - trying to lift a rocket with 6 of them is fail). You can mount them, using the short steel bars, as far out as you feel like. I had 6 going in a parallel wing that way. Maybe I could add a few more thrust transforms and see if that would do the trick. They were templated off of Snoj\u0027s rotors in Unity and so far as I can tell they do what they\u0027re supposed to, and my test craft fly beautifully. Maybe you could explain it differently and I\u0027ll see what I can tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll command pods are undergoing re-beautification at the moment, but unfortunately now it conflicts with finals week at uni. I\u0027ll push the wings and other Squad replacement odds and ends out tomorrow, as I finally solved all the issues with those (6 hours of my life I\u0027ll never get back).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Porkworks stuff, I\u0027ll say this originally started out as a texturing project (see other project if you can find it), but basically that just adds a lot of RAM usage so I went this route instead. Included in the next release are B9 replacements for the two Mk2 fuselage parts from Squad. It would basically be easier to make my own versions of things like passenger cabins for Mk2 rather than try to re-texture his stuff. One thing I wish I could do is duplicate the \u0022feel\u0022 of his wings, as they look thin but still feel very solid. The scope of this project is limited though to direct use of B9 textures unless there is absolutely no other way to do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the guy that asked for S2-Wide loading ramp, I\u0027ve got some mock ups done but the issue is that for it to be useful I\u0027d need to make also a floor inset for the cargo bay (or replace the bays with alternate versions) so we\u0027d have a perfectly flat surface to run on. In testing, any rover I took up the ramp basically blew tires or flipped out, even if they looked like they should be straddling the \u0022maintenance pit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T06:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, is there something wrong with my install or do the rotors lack sound?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphorim","CreatedById":57249,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T07:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I had in mind for the buzz rotor was something like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/riYuJ7W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022riYuJ7W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial mount sized to fit 0.625m, and c-frame for buzz rotor with attach node hanging in middle of ring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T13:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice parts so far and I\u0027m looking forward to the rest but should the Buzz Turbine have it\u0027s center of thrust so far above it?

It was frustrating because I remember doing it a long time ago for consolidating the Squad internals into a single folder (and chopping out about 2/3 the memory hit...may do that again). The trick is the ordering. I went back through and realized everywhere it worked was because I put the textures that I wanted to use somehow in alphabetical order first, either by folder or naming convention, so when it processed the config the texture it wanted was already in memory. To make sure, I made an \u0022Xpansion\u0022 folder inside the B9_Aerospace folder to place everything (loads after all else in B9), and all is smooth. You don\u0027t even need the dummy files. The system also doesn\u0027t deal well with texture names with \u0022_\u0022 in them, but B9 only has 2 or 3 of those and I can use FS to get around that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I kept running into the part hanging on load up without the dummy textures, although I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve tested that in the more recent version of KSP.
