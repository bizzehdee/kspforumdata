I\u0027m always up to hear peoples thoughts on this pack. The direction has definitely deviated from what I originally intended way back last year, and I am pretty happy with how things are going with people\u0027s suggestions.\n\n[@curtquarquesso](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/42872-curtquarquesso/) you did an amazing job on your Cygnus and it came to mind when VenomousRequiem brought it up. I tried hunting for the post with that picture but had to jump out of the house before I could whip up a response. Regarding the side count, the US and CxA modules are 32-sides, the JAXA ones are 36. Similar to your Cygnus, the JAXA modules were increased to accommodate the 12 panel divisions and save me the headache with UV unwrapping and texturing. I\u0027d be down for collaborating with you, and including some of your models in my parts pack, and then I can add IVAs to them as well.\n\nWith the size of your Cygnus, I don\u0027t see an issue with the main body having and O.D. of 1.875m. When making these various station modules, I tried to keep the proportions pretty close to the full-scale ones while maintaining an outside diameter of 2.5m. Most of the modules have a diameter close to 15ft. Looking at Cygnus, it has an O.D. of 10.1ft, so scaling it based of my method would put it at 1.683m O.D. So I think your 1.875m diameter will work well. If you enlarged it to 2.5m it might look a bit funky.\n\nCBMs: I\u0027m thinking the overall geometry is set in stone (no future changes will cause a craft to break) and I\u0027ll be keeping it the way it is. I\u0027ll be reworking the models to give them more greebles at a later date but that will probably be a while. Though, sometimes I feel like they might look a bit better at a slightly smaller outer radius, but I think having the base 1.25m just makes it easier for people adding them to other crafts outside my mod pack (that\u0027s my thought at least) and doesn\u0027t really hurt the look of them.

It might not be too much trouble making modular pieces in addition to the specific Integrated Truss Structure components, as they will mostly reuse meshes and textures. But then that will make the mod pack a bit bloated with parts.\n\nI\u0027m considering making the ISS-specific truss segments as part of this pack, but then have a separate mod release for the modular version of the trusses, with some other truss configurations (crew tunnel, T- Intersection, 4- way, etc).\n\nRegarding the solar panels, maybe a compromise would be to build it into the P5 truss section, and then have a second variant that is just the panels without P5 , so that you can make P6 look correct."},{"CreatedByName":"_Krieger_","CreatedById":160353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T23:04:06Z","Content":"I\u0027m having some trouble with the CBMs, they get close to each other, touch, but they don\u0027t connect, the issue happened when I tried to dock an active CBM on a Node to a passive port attached to a Sleep Hab, I tried to dock with a relative roll of 0 and 90 degrees using MechJeb and they didn\u0027t dock both times, am I doing something wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T23:41:39Z","Content":"Does the magnetism kick in?
