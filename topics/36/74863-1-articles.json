I recently modeled a new liquid engine and I\u0027ve had considerable difficulty getting it to work properly. Initially it looked good, but produced no thrust. I poked around in the forum and found out about adding a thrust transform and boy does it work now. the only problem I have now is that when I add other parts to the bottom (decoupler etc,) it doesn\u0027t spawn a fairing. I found some info on how to kill the fairings on the stock parts, but nothing on what is necessary to get the fairing to spawn. I hope someone can help me with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T00:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engine fairings are part of the engine\u0027s model and should be tagged Icon_Hidden in Unity. I can\u0027t tell you much more than that, having never modeled an engine myself. My assumption is that they\u0027ll be disabled by default unless explicitly enabled by a PartModule like ModuleDecouple.
