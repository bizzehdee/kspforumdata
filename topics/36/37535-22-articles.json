So far things have been good and ZRM got it in game more or less. There are still a few bugs to flesh out but all that should soon be out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-We\u0027re not posting any in-game pics until the KSO is properly in game and all bugs are sorted out. Currently not all textures are on as well as there is still quite a bit to get functional (such as the IVA, landing gear, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unfortunately do to the design, its use as a parts pack is severely limited, more so than we originally anticipated. This being temporary or permanent is up in the air. A lot of it has to do with buggy attachment node code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The good news is that the cargo bay is working superbly. ZRM even did an EVA walk around with little to no collision errors or problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As a heads up, the shuttle works magnificently with the KCA mod. As I said earlier for the first versions of it, I\u0027m not providing support for a non-KCA version of it. That doesn\u0027t mean you have to have ZRM\u0027s KCA mod, it just means that there is a possibility that the KSO will be very unstable without it. For the average user it will be a required download. We are currently not spending time on engineering a version without KCA. Later on once we have more of the project fleshed out and folks are flying it, we can go back and release a non KCA dependent version for advanced users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it seemed that ZRM didn\u0027t need anymore direct art support for this first phase, I decided to move along with other parts of the project, in particular the lift vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The EFT will not be segmented, heads up because I know we\u0027ll get a bunch of folks asking. There are plenty of segmented fuel tanks both in game and on the space port. I\u0027m not making one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The EFT will be designed to go with the KSO (see WIP pics below). That means you\u0027re free to try to use it on other assemblies but its attachment points and configuration will assume the KSO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The Liquid fuel boosters will be liquid fuel. They will be solid as well minus the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Like the boosters, the EFT has an engine mounting location on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parachutes, sepatrons, and accessories may be integrated into the EFT and Boosters. I don\u0027t know at this point. This means you won\u0027t be attaching the stock parachutes and sepatrons by default since those components will already have them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you that wanted some texturing and modeling tips I\u0027ll do my best to post pics of the process, starting with Step 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Using 3D Studio Max, I create the Master model of the External Fuel Tank. This model has more polygons than the low resolution model used in game, but less polygons than its high resolution version I\u0027ll use for map generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I make a clone of the KSO that I weld as a single model. This will guide me in figuring out the scale and size of both the EFT and the external boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I use the real space shuttle EFT as a guide for my own stylized KSO EFT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I primarily work in Editable Poly. This allows me to extrude edges, chamfer, sub-divide, collapse as needed. Although I started with a basic cylinder which I collapsed down to Editable Poly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleted master model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P1JwIlN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P1JwIlN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T16:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DisarmingBaton5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DisarmingBaton5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHelldiver, are the engines going to be compatible with stock?

Basically any spot that can\u0027t easily be relaxed with the relaxing tools. I don\u0027t mess with it, max will do everything for me automatically. All I do is select the faces I want to have their own island, hit Unwrap UVW and then collapse. I do this over and over until I have all the pieces in their own island. For more complex meshes sometimes I\u0027ll hit it with a different material just to make sure I covered everything and didn\u0027t miss a spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-After I am done I end up with a mess that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zWuwXcE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zWuwXcE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-That\u0027s ok, as long as all the areas I wanted to have their own islands are together, this mess is ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I then hit the relax tool along edges or faces until all those islands come together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LrLg6uo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LrLg6uo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I then stitch as many of the pelts as I can to reduce the amount of seamlines visible on the final model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I move my pelts to the best optimal location to save UV space.

And if it could somehow launch with a LF/O EFT using overpowered engines the shuttle would then be able to easily reach Duna, which I don\u0027t think is the desired result. Personally I think we should require Modular Fuel System, as that would force the player to make proper use of the main engines and the OMS engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-23T07:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2013 07:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T10:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually slightly shorter now since it was a bit too tall.
