I was also on planning to add stuff like food, water, oxygen in command pods to be used up (and replenished to keep the crew alive) and stuff like Co2 and general waste that can be removed from the capsule or stuck into an unmanned rocket to be burned up in the atmosphere with the junk on board (like the Progress with the Mir and ISS), and if those are not removed then you\u0027re crew most probably will drop dead in the capsule. Food and water will only last so long then the crew will die (unless it is replenished). Also I wanted something along the lines of Uranium to go with modified Nuclear engines that only use a very small amount of the stuff, just to keep the weight of interplanetary rockets down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E .

I would love to see inflatable storage tanks. Something along the lines of a module that unpacks in a Bobcat-like manner while you mine out a deposit. Once the deposit is done, pack up and drive/fly/carry your platform to another location. Perhaps these could also be radially mounted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point was we don\u0027t know what resource system will be added. So once it does come out you will see more people doing resource mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T10:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd why not? Just look at Ioncross Life Support mod. It needs oxygen - which can be scooped from atmosphere on Kerbin, Laythe and i presume Eve. But what if we could mine oxygen from ice on Minmus and Eeloo (if it\u0027s ice at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E)? Or in fact mine it everywhere, albeit slower. Then we could pump oxygen into Ioncross tanks using Fuel Balancer for example (or tie two mods directly). We could support long-range missions indefinitely this way.
