I don\u0027t want to be the guy who says \u0022hey! make me this, by tomorrow -- kthxby\u0022 but then again, keeping silent is no way of getting ideas out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite often, I don\u0027t need the fuel capacity of an adapter piece and really wish I could put that length of fuselage to a better use. While this applies to basically all sizeX-sizeY adapters, the size2-Mk3 is the one where I feel it the most, and the worst. It takes up a lot of space, after all. If someone could find the time to make a service module / cargo bay in that form factor, this would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr... a crew module. Which is kind of a special need, but it\u0027s what eventually made me write this plea for help. Protect your eyes, and look at this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022crew_needed.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022557\u0022 src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/crew_needed.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis vessel is already too long for what it\u0027s supposed to be. I may add another segment of cargo bay because I have to, but slipping in a crew compartment would make it altogether too spindly. At the same time, I don\u0027t need much fuel. I can edit part stats easily enough, and did just that. I don\u0027t need IVA, and there\u0027s mods for slap-on hatches, so I\u0027m all set, right? Wrong. I found that, with all willingness to roleplay, I really need a crew module to have windows. Slipping on a few \u0022window\u0022 decals (the best i could do) only made matters worse. Would someone please have mercy and help me out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
