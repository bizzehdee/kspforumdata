So far it is seeming like a minor update though and hopefully there won\u0027t be too much needing fixed or updated to maintain compatibility.\n\nRegarding splitting the mod up, I have been considering it, but I\u0027ve got a few \u0027situations\u0027 to clean up before it could be done. I use a lot of texture sharing, even between seemingly unrelated parts; for example both the LC and SC-C series use geometry and textures from the SC-A RCS blocks. I suppose I could always split them as needed, with duplicating assets where they are needed. Would result in a slightly larger .zip sizes; but if I setup the layout properly they should all merge into the same folder and result in the same setup in the end.\n\nAdvertising -- aye, I will need to come up with a good plan when I\u0027m ready for a bit more exposure. Still a ways off though. I\u0027m really hoping/aiming to get things more cleaned up and releasable before/around the time of 1.1. I suppose I need to start outlining precisely what the precise direction of the mod will be, what parts are in the works, what parts are finished, etc, and perhaps start getting promotional material setup for those portions that are done/nearly complete."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T18:29:29Z","Content":"And.... the current full set of adapters/end-caps (not all will be available on every part, or even used initially):\n\n![8l8xPUg.png](http://i.imgur.com/8l8xPUg.png)\n\nNow to do some texturing for all these end-caps and noses... \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nKind of want to add some stringers to the sides of most of the adapters, and the bottom edge of some of the nose-cones.

Will play around with the stripe thickness a bit. Really those nose-cones in the render were me just playing around seeing what was (easily) doable given the UV mapping of the pieces. Vertical or horizontal stripes should work well on any of the standard adapters. The multi-couple adapters though... ugh.. the UV maps on those is... ugly. There was just no way to map them to allow for both ease of texturing -and- distortion free textures.

Plugin code seems to be working well so far. Models have all been exported and are available in-game. Have a few updates/changes to make/re-export a couple of them (only 4...), and -tons- of texturing work to do. So... textures might be a bit rough for the nose-cone/adapter bits initially, as I don\u0027t think I have time to fully clean them up for this release; they will all have textures, but there might well be visible seams and most will be lacking detail, and none will be finished.\n\nOn the config end of things I managed to get the tank config file definition down from \u003E2000 lines to ~500 lines last night through some refactoring of data storage, parsing, and layout, while still allowing for the same level of control and customization, and greatly increasing the human read/write-ability of the file. Still have a bit of optimization to do on the texture set definitions (they are currently like 300-500 lines each), but as those are stored/parsed separately from the part.cfg file, that is something I can work on a bit more leisurely.\n\nCurrently for the GUI/controls I\u0027m using the stock right-click gui with standard \u0027next \\_\\_\\_ \u0027 buttons. This is a temporary interface and \\_will\\_ be rewritten when KSP 1.1 is available; holding off on doing any custom GUI work until the new GUI system is available.

For the sake of diversity, it might make sense to not replicate all of those ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAhh, well, that explains why I was having such a time with the geometry of the RL-10 between the ICPS and HUS. I was aware there were different versions, but I thought the extending nozzle was standard/universal across them (or at least that the HUS and ICPS were using the same version; with extending nozzle). Makes a ton more sense now, and will likely help me get the geometry straight when I rework those parts.\n\nHere is the -very- preliminary list of engines that I\u0027m -thinking- about modeling for lifters and upper-stages:\n\nLifter / first stage engines:\n\nRS-27 - Delta-III -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-27A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-27A)\n\nRS-68 - Delta-IV-CBC -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-68)\n\nRD-180 - Atlas-V-CCB -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-180](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-180)\n\nMerlin M2/M3 - Falcon 1/9/Heavy -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_%28rocket_engine_family%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_%28rocket_engine_family%29)\n\nRD-107 - Soyuz 1st Stage -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-107)\n\nRD-253 - Proton 1st Stage, UMDH (monoprop) -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-253](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-253)\n\n Second Stage/Upper Stage engines:\n\nRL-10 - DCSS/Centaur/Saturn-IV -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL10) (likely make 2 variants)\n\nRD-0124 - Soyuz 2nd Stage -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-0124](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-0124)\n\nJ2/J2-X -- Saturn S-II and S-IVB 2nd Stages -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2)\n\n--Seems like there are not that many different upper-stage engines currently in use?\n\nOther suggestions appreciated; links to specs and images required if you want them to be considered.\n\nHaving a bit of a problem locating engines that would be acceptable for 2.5m lifters (and 2.5m in general). Seems most of the newer stuff is all geared towards really large rockets. Will likely go retro and look into some engine designs from the early days of rocketry (and a bit lower-tech; which makes sense for the KSP tree progression), Mercury-era or so.\n\nWould love to be able to rely on Nertea\u0027s work (he does excellent work!), unfortunately, that would leave the mod/part pack missing large portions of capability (and Cryo-engines are geared specifically towards Nertea\u0027s LH2 balancing), and does nothing to further the \u0027low part-count\u0027 goal (Nertea seems to like forcing lots of extra parts to be used...for example, requiring external radiators just for a reactor..... the radiators need to be included in the reactor model, or at least have that as an option)."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T18:58:55Z","Content":"yah screw flags, it\u0027s not priority and too many things at once can wear one down ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T18:59:35Z","Content":"Nice job on the parts they look great."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T19:08:11Z","Content":"A vacuum variant of the Merlin engines might be nice.

In the end it will depend on which engines (bells) I model and what kind of performance is needed from the upper stages.\n\u003E For the lower stage; unfortunately off-center engines like that won\u0027t work properly in KSP due to lack of proper per-engine thrust vectoring and throttle control. I might be able to do a 3 or 4 engine in-line config, but would have to be fully symmetrical. Again, will depend upon what engine(s) I model and the needs of the lifters.\n\u003E \n\u003E Any engine suggestions (with lots of pics and diagrams!)? Already going to look into the RS-68, and re-doing a proper version of the RL-10 (used on the ICPS/HUS), and possibly a JX-2. Not sure what is used on the Atlas / Delta upper stages (or lower stages even), but can probably find that out easy enough.
