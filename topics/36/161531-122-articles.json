The designs proposed in the 1960\u0027s (off which this is based) also included very powerful centrifugal chambers as well to help concentrate the gasses in some versions... The cooling of those gasses from literally hotter than lava (hence why they call it the Thermosphere- the sparse gasses there are VERY hot) to cryogenically-cold temperatures isn\u0027t cheap in terms of power either, although most of the power requirements there are due to the inefficiency of available cooling unit designs in the 1960\u0027s (the actual mass flow rate of the collected gasses is so low they don\u0027t significantly heat up the cooler as they are cooled...) which may have improved somewhat since then...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these processes could probably be redesigned for greater efficiency- keep in mind current performance is an eyeballed approximation to try and mimic the performance of 1960\u0027s designs for propulsive fluid accumulators, and we don\u0027t even have hard numbers on a lot of the power requirements...

They might not be accurate, but they might be game balancing reasons to maintain them. The atmospheric accumulator currenly have a liniear relationship between power and perfornace. The more power you put into it, the more it will produce. Most likely this doesn\u0027t scale so well. I can imagine that at a certain point not matter how much power you going to put into it, you aint going to collect more resource and only produce WasteHeat. The high power cost might simply a way to preventing you from reaching this point in the first place. Of cource this goes well untill you start getting very powerfull power systems. Note that the atmospheric concentration I asume to be above the atmosphere are probably way too high. A week ago I spoke with someone from NASA and he told me it requires years to accumulate any signifiant amount of resource this way. And that it\u0027s simply cheaper to use conventional methods than to try to collect any resource in space. Of cource he assumed having only acces to power generated from solar power, but still it\u0027s something to think about. Noticethat a few release back, I made the accumulator function with any High Isp engine, this allows you to collect resource with antimatter reactor.
