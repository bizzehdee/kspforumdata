As of today, I\u0027ve done them all except Bop, Pol, and Eeloo, which should get done by the end of the week. In the process, I\u0027ve been taking notes on the \u0022best\u0022 orbits and altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say \u0022best\u0022, not best, for 2 reasons. First, I wasn\u0027t just using SCANsat, I was also scanning for Kethane, and the Kethane scanner (at least in 0.8) imposes limits that SCANsat doesn\u0027t have. Second, because I usually have all kinds of things going on in the same game at once, I care a lot about how much gametime it takes to scan a planet. With both SCANsat and Kethane, the least gametime comes from lower orbits, but this means you can\u0027t warp very much, so the amount of REALtime required increases. But I also care about realtime, so arrived at a compromise in finding the lowest orbit altitude where I could warp 100x, which for most planets is as much as a single Kethane scanner can do and still hit most hexes it flies over. On very small planets like Gilly, the orbital velocity is so slow that the Kethane scanner works well at 1000x, however. Despite all this, however, the SCANsat beam is only like 2-3 times as wide as the Kethane beam, so the same orbit works well for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, keep the above self-imposed conditions in mind when reading the rest of this. If you don\u0027t care about Kethane (or want to keep it separate from SCANsat, which is actually a pretty good idea), or care only about realtime, not gametime, then the orbits I list below are probably not \u0022best\u0022 for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for terrain mapping with SCANsat, you want total coverage, which means an asynchronous polar orbit. The starting point therefore is the post linked above where cxg2827 calculated a number of such orbits for all the planets where this makes a difference. These orbits are asynchronous regardless of what instrument you\u0027re using so with SCANsat, you want something off these lists. Just ignore the columns showing time to scan (that\u0027s GAMEtime, not realtime) because they are based on ISA\u0027s beam width, which varied greatly with altitude while SCANsat\u0027s doesn\u0027t, so with SCANsat, faster gametimes occur at lower altitudes. Which again gets you into trying to balance gametime vs. realtime, whether you use Kethane or not. Anyway, here\u0027s what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOribts for total coverage in least gametime while able to warp 100x (except where noted):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho: 150km @ 90^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: 135km @ 88.8^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly: 56km @ 90^ (and 1000x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna: 69.95km @ 87.56^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke: 42.84km @ 87.1^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres: 52km @ 84.14^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe: 70.583km @ 87.91^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall: 41.223km @ 88.51^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo: 160km @ 90^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese orbits get the job done with the least amount of wasted time covering old ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T16:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022drtedastro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022drtedastro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is from the older \u0027other\u0027 mapping program, but the orbital mechanics work for orbital resonance and can be used here to see best / worst orbits.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas worked great for me for many different purposes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echeers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a GREAT starting point for finding ideal orbits, but there are a few things to keep in mind when using this info applied to other scans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, this was made for an older version of ISAmapsat, a version that DID NOT allow mapping at warp speeds of anything above x50.
