The actual tank capacity hasn\u0027t been increased, nor has the mass. Same for the 9 engine mount or the other enlarged ThunderMax tank or the enlarged adapter. I considered deleting 5 of the bottom nodes so it would only mount four Kerbodyne engines but this is KSP so moar boosters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E It\u0027d look a little bare without the Mainsail in the middle and the four LV-30s in between. They fit much better than on the smaller version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ThunderMax 64 tank has a scale of 2, 4, 2 and 11520 liquid fuel, 14080 oxidizer. Mass = 17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 128 tank is twice as tall with mass and capacities double the 64. Both are based on the stock fuelTank2-2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe even bigger versions have a diameter scale of 3.25. How much should I increase the mass and capacity? In real tanks the increase in the bulkheads wouldn\u0027t be as much as in the walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep things somewhat sane, I\u0027ll use the same % increase on the 9 engine mount and on the adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no plans for enlarging other components like monoprop tanks, batteries, decouplers etc. to ThunderMax size or to this even larger size. Components this size should only be used for disposable boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould this super duper size be called ThunderMaximer or ThunderMaximus?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Of course I launched it anyway, and it flew great, no mods.
