Mostly because browsing throught the mods list i found most mods here tend to be geared toward more \u0022serious\u0022 space exploration. Also, the retro style of rockets don\u0027t work so well when multiple stages are involved.\n\nI might continue the mod if there\u0027s anyone interested in retro rockets. I also take suggestions.\n\nSo, Yay or Nay?\n\n![Full50.jpg~original](http://i814.photobucket.com/albums/zz68/nicolarre/Full50.jpg~original)"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:34:03Z","Content":"Aliens!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:35:03Z","Content":"Honestly, this isn\u0027t the best idea, especially considering that multiple stages don\u0027t work that well with this style of parts."},{"CreatedByName":"spacecookie","CreatedById":101953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:40:19Z","Content":"You really should continue ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Those models look really great, and here\u0027s the proof that retro rockets and staging can match [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mRSGfmWujA0/TKA17u3S9sI/AAAAAAAAF0w/c_N77WNmqhA/s1600/68774-050-0DD2C3D2.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mRSGfmWujA0/TKA17u3S9sI/AAAAAAAAF0w/c_N77WNmqhA/s1600/68774-050-0DD2C3D2.jpg) \n\nNice designs, some looks right out from toy story ahah. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:58:56Z","Content":"I don\u0027t personally like the design of the parts.
