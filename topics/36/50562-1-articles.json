To be honest, a lot of this would not be possible without him and his more extensive knowledge of rocketry and available plugin functionality. I came to him with my own tech tree concept, and we\u0027ve basically reviewed the whole thing and came up with this new version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will most likely require multiple mods in order to make sense and also enable some of the key features of the tech tree. Which are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 - Completely separated lines of progress. Engines, Solid Rocket Boosters, each \u0027category\u0027 of parts has their own progression line. With some additional branching in some cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - New series of Tech nodes: Engine Controls, Electronics, Light Weight Materials, Low Temp Materials, High Temp Materials and Life Support. Some of these will still unlock some parts, but will be linked to incremental bonuses to other part sub groups. (IE, researching high Light Weight Mats, will give a small mass reduction bonus to Ladders, Wheels, Chutes, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - Inclusion of the Modular Fuel Tanks Fuels within the tech tree. (They each have their own tech line of progression with incremental bonuses for each tech level)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4 - Nathan proposed an \u0022experience\u0022 tracking system of which fuels/engines were used in past missions and would give slight bonuses each time you use them. (IE, if you want your space program to specialize with a certain engine only, sending multiple launches with them will progressively make them better.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is still heavy WIP, there is some branching missing and I haven\u0027t made it entirely pretty.

Here is the scenario of how/when I would use it. (Once I make a MCE specific version of the tree)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would add a tech node, before let\u0027s say manned tech line. (Capsules) Then I would put a science point cost of that node to 101,000 RP. Then, that would be tied into an MCE mission, that once completed yields 101,000 Research points. This would \u0027simulate\u0027 that a certain MCE mission needs to be completed before advancing to this newer section of the tech tree. (As finding 100k science points won\u0027t be possible). Right now there is no way to make an MCE mission as a requirement for a tech node. This is the best way I thought about how to do it. But before I deal with that, I want to balance the tech tree first. (in terms of which parts go where)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of balance, it would be of tremendous help to know how much science is available on each planet. this would give a good indicator on how to gauge SP progression/tweaks. From what I heard/read about the stock tech tree is that it\u0027s extremely easy to fully unlock as you can make loads of science points. The stock tech tree is about 33,000 science points total to unlock. I\u0027ll definitely give that a nudge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther tweaks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 - Use of Remote Tech 2. By using RT2 this will greatly limit the range of unmanned missions. (Not sure if science transmission is now dependent on a working sat relay)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - Whether or not FAR/KIDS/DR is used and at what setting. Sadly it appears that trying to make an \u0027overall\u0027 balanced tree for with or without kids is extremely difficult, see impossible. Since with the same rocket designed with FAR and KIDS set to real adjusted will yield ~1100m/s of DV, whearas the stock version will yield 3000\u002BDV. The range in those value is so extreme that i\u0027ll have to pick for which of those combinations to balance the tree with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - Including new experiments: Have Dust Experiment(Mod), and I\u0027ve also added probe sensors to all probe control modules. Each probe head can do an experiment that is roughly worth 50% of a crew report. Will most likely add unmanned surface sample collection. (0% data transmit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4 - Do we keep science experiments, repeatable or not? I\u0027m specifically talking about how each science part can be repeatedly used until a region is drained of science. That really, really bothers me. Ideally I would like science instruments to have a number of charges (how many experiments it can carry out in 1 mission), but since that\u0027s not even close to implemented. I\u0027d rather lean towards single experiments per module. Meaning after you\u0027ve taken a sample or whatever, even if you delete/clear it you won\u0027t be able to take a new one with that specific module. You\u0027ll have to relaunch another ship and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5 - Massive overhaul of solar panels. Gone are the day that the lamest solar panel could generate 45KW per min. Current blancing is it takes 4 cheap solar panels to cover the running cost of a stock probe. Stock probe average consumption is ~ 1.7 EC/minute. So why in tarnation would 1 single panel be enough to power the whole thing. Crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#6 - Probes overhaul. Making them different not only in shape but charge/consumption/torque. Potentially could put specific science experiments in higher end probes. (AIES)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of these tweaks will require the .cfg file pack i\u0027m making for this tree. (all with module manager)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter literally 3 weeks of making excel sheets and tracking part id\u0027s and performance, I\u0027ve just started to try and balance this whole thing. I have no doubt that depending on which mods people use it will definitely change the experience. As a few I\u0027ve mentioned above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously with MCE being used, and having to pay for parts you use.

After i\u0027m done tweaking this, i\u0027ll be able to switch to focusing on mission creation and potentially re-tweak the tech tree for a mission controller extended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it\u0027s in an \u0027ok\u0027 state, IE, I can reach mun and not unlock he whole tree. Or perhaps the opposite I\u0027ve been running in, not enough DV to get anywhere. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E (Using KIDS \u0026amp; FAR)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost done with tweaking solar panels and the RTG. So I\u0027ll be able to put at least the static panel early on, without arbitrarily putting them further down the line since they basically give you infinite power. But doing that, beckons another tweak. Power required to transmit data. it\u0027s pretty high. 15kw per 1 data unit. I think the thermometer does 10 base data, if you do it on mun then it\u0027s 10 x 4, so 40 units of data x 15kw. Yeah, it\u0027s quite expensive power wise. I guess the devs \u0027balanced\u0027 it with the current power generation, rather than balance the panels themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo much tweaks, so scare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Patupi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Patupi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHuh, did not know this. I really should get into modding KSP but I always have something else I wanted to do and I still haven\u0027t learned c# yet. Did learn basic C back in university but been a while. Also haven\u0027t modded much in many many years. The last serious thing I was involved with was a couple of Homeworld mods way back when (small additions to Sacrifice of Angels and Movements of Fire and Shadow). I did do a little mod for UFO Afterlife, but never finished that one. Maybe I\u0027ll get back to that sometime and get it done.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you want to create a plugin, using something like module manager is extremely simple!

It\u0027s tricky to get a solar plane to work without spamming loads of the small flat panels which increases parts count, and RTGs can work as a battery charger, but usually are too heavy for most planes to power props on their own. Thus if things are changed like that it might throw out some other mods. If they had KSPI it wouldn\u0027t be an issue \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E One of the smallest nuclear reactors from KSPI would work quite well on a firespitter plane I think, though probably wouldn\u0027t be a small plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock doesn\u0027t use the power generated much at all except with the (relatively) new torque system. Even that you could at LEAST halve RTG and solar panel output and I don\u0027t think it would hurt torque much when designing ships, even with ships with spammed SAS units on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, KSP is a unrealistic. But we try to make it \u0027work\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor RTGs, one could modify his stock RTG and use the resource generation module from Kethane. Invent a resource, whatever they have in RTGs. (Not bothered to check right now , lol) And then put the consumption to something decent and boom. Like how the interstellar mod handles nuclear reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for compatibility with Firespitter, might not work it\u0027s not on my list of mods. :/ One could tweak the power consumption rates to fix it. Or just remove the SP tweaks i\u0027m doing.

And I\u0027m not liking science balancing at all. The whole concept of loss of science per transmission just introduces a grind factor to the whole science collection concept. And it actually surprised me since they had stated they did not want to make science grindy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who don\u0027t know, science has 2 values which contribute do what makes science a grind. Each experiment has a base and a cap value. Cap value is how much science you can generate with that experiment in a given area. (with a multiplier based on location) Base value is how much of the total cap value you will be taking per experiment. So when you have an experiment that has a low amount of base, with a low transmission value. It does indeed make it a grind. Which encourages the whole transmission spam people are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is compounded when an experiment has a low % of transmission. So not only are you only getting a fraction of the total, but you can only transmit a fraction of it! Which is why you end up with quasi trivial amounts left over in some circumstances. Not only that, but it literally makes bringing back science purely optional thing. (No extra science, other than vehicle recovery)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few ideas to help these issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 - Remote Tech 2 - Need viable sat network\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - MCE - Science instruments could have a significant costs associated to them, to discourage spamming multiple experiment modules on the craft in a single mission. (Obviously this would be balanced in with my mission pack)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - Make experiments have matching base/cap values. So when you do your experiment you potentially have all the science that circumstance can generate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4 - Make instrument single use per flight. So, you either keep the data and bring it back (getting 100%) or you transmit and only get a fraction. This still keeps s form of diminishing returns but at least it gives returning science more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5 - As I\u0027m also working on the power balancing, transmitting data might shorten the lifespan of your mission depending on whether you are able to generate enough power to support transmissions energy cost. (Currently testing with 150watts per packet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone pointed out to me, Harvester mentioned that they wanted to make repeat experiences have 0% transmittable data within the same mission. So you\u0027d have to bring back the rest or send another mission. Of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I can\u0027t wait for them to put biomes on the other bodies, since right now I\u0027m pretty sure that Mun is houses more science points than any other body. Even though it has a multiplier of 4. (most other planets are 7\u002B)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
