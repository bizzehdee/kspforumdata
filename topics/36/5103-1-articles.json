They also conduct many experiments with atmospheric aircraft. When they do so, they employ what is known as a chase plane. This plane follows along side the test subject to provide film footage and give real time feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the past several weeks I have been modeling several liquid engines and boring fuel tanks. I grew tired of this quickly and decided to model something with a few more curves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give you the preliminary model of NASA\\\u0027s premier chase plane and also the Air-force\\\u0027s supersonic training aircraft, The T-38 Talon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis still requires some modeling and then the texture process can begin. I can\\\u0027t wait for this game to have more than just a defuse texture and some real wheels and animations. I hope to have this ready by that time, if not long before. I have noticed Harvester\\\u0027s tendency to work at break neck speeds. I can only say that I will do my best to keep up. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spoot Knight","CreatedById":8302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-03T21:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Talon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeeessssss. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother mod to add to my to-play list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-16T05:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be awesome to have.
