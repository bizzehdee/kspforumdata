I kinda need RealFuels since I play on RealSolarSystem and without it I\u0027ll never get to orbit.\n\u003E \n\nNot by me.  I provide some -very basic- real-fuels integration patches for the fuel tanks; that is it as far as my support for it goes.  I don\u0027t use it, don\u0027t know how it is supposed to work or how the patches are supposed to be setup or created; I\u0027m really not the right person to be doing support/patches for it.\n\nAll RSS/RO support should be handled by the RO patches.  Which have -not- been updated yet.  So I would expect things to not work until they have been.  I -do not- use RO/RSS, and as such do not make those patches (though I may provide technical support for others to help them figure it out); you will have to wait until the community at large gets its sorted out, or figure out and fix the problem yourself.\n\nEdit: I should add that even the basic RealFuels compatibility for tanks is broken at the moment as there was no 1.1.x version of RealFuels available when I did my last update.  That should be fixed up with the next release (likely this weekend).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-04T22:25:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2016 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T22:35:25Z","Content":"As a note, not all of the Merlin Vacuum engines have the same nozzle extension expansion ratio. \n\nM1C vac: 117:1\n\nM1D vac: 117 \u003C x \u003C 165\n\nM1D\u002B vac: 165"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T23:46:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, saabstory88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As a note, not all of the Merlin Vacuum engines have the same nozzle extension expansion ratio. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E M1C vac: 117:1\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E M1D vac: 117 \u003C x \u003C 165\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E M1D\u002B vac: 165\n\u003E \n\nSure, but that\u0027s not necessarily indicative of bell diameter.

Likely the last changes I\u0027ll be making though as I\u0027m pretty happy with where they are at currently, and need to start working on the actual time consuming processes, such as unwrapping and the UV layout.\n\nIn other news; tracked down the source of the \u0027impossibly crash resistant parts\u0027 -- [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9695](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9695)\n\nAlso fixed up the burn time and thrust displays for the MSRB parts; they are now updated in real-time in the editors (well..event driven anyhow)... but the displayed values should be accurate for the current engine setup, including thrust limiter (though not including any thrust curve).  Thrust curves are fully implemented and working, along with a set of simple presets (most just linear falloff, but one that approximates a curved/exponential falloff).  If a preset is used it will be directly loaded rather than persisted in the part; so if a preset is changed any in-flight/existing craft using that preset will also be updated (to force it to custom/persistent, just edit one of the values after selecting the preset).\n\nDid quite a bit more work towards the initial career balancing; lots of price and tech-node updates coming with tomorrows release.  Likely very close to what I would consider a good point for the initial public/stable release branch.  Have decided that I\u0027ll be pulling the SC-E parts from the mod until I can get them reworked properly; no reason to have them hold back everything else when they can be easily separated from the rest. \n\nSo might start seeing the first public/stable/non-dev releases as early as next weekend.  There is actually a ton of non-balance/bugfixing stuff I would like to get done before then regarding promotional materials and the initial craft files/examples; so might be a busy week next week getting all that in order.

The stock stuff is... well... unusable, or at least unfit for its seemingly intended purpose.\n\nI tried taking a few of the stock airplane examples and landing them; yeah.. right.  Tried being the key there; was more like terribly crash and explode even with the most perfect of touchdowns.  And I\u0027m a pretty good pilot by most measures; I fly pretty large/heavy/beast-like RC airplanes and land those without problem.  But take a plane in KSP and touch the landing gear to the ground?  ....instant explosions.  Are they made of dynamite or something?  My RC planes\u0027 landing gear certainly don\u0027t explode when I land them; even when I pretty much just drop them out of the air, landing at 10m/s\u002B downwards velocity.. the most that happens is some bent struts... -if- even that.  Landing systems are specifically designed to be able to take some impact force and distribute it in a non-destructive manner; not just crumple, fold, or explode.\n\nStock landing legs are just as bad; low-speed landings (\u003C3 m/s) that would have been perfectly acceptable in 1.05 now result in the legs breaking (or exploding), which of course results in the lander tipping over, and LCAV.  Would be better off with some simple rigid and animated landing legs without any suspension at all; at least they wouldn\u0027t crumple and break if you looked at them strange.  I\u0027ve currently stopped using them altogether and am just landing on engine bells; even 6 m/s crash tolerance is better than what they call landing legs (well.. engines aren\u0027t all that stable... but... just don\u0027t bump it and it\u0027ll be fine)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T16:17:37Z","Content":"Updated M-1D/V turbo-exhaust geometry.

Added Mini-AVC for version checking (untested, but will be testing it shortly).  Add the Merlin engines with initial stats and models; note that the stats have not been tweaked yet, the TWR on the early ones will be coming down substantially (mass increased).  See the link for full change log and downloads.\n\n**WARNING:** Lots of changes to command pods and service module parts that may break existing craft; they have all been converted over to hypergolic fuels for both engines and RCS, and have had transmitters to most of them.  Backup your saves and/or finish the missions using those parts prior to installing this update.\n\nAn early-career 3x Merlin-1A powered Mun orbiter, 1.875m diameter first \u0026 second stages\n\n![NweZoCf.png](http://i.imgur.com/NweZoCf.png)\n\nThe second and third stages after reaching orbit (really I was just enjoying the new lens-flare effects ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022))\n\n![tVevIxx.png](http://i.imgur.com/tVevIxx.png)"}]}
