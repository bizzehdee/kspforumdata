\u003C/span\u003EAnyhow\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you read that right, a full size Gemini capsule retrofitted to be a \u201Csim-pit\u201D for KSP.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0

similar) and access to general woodworking tools.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe goal is not to create a perfect museum-quality replica of Gemini, but rather something which enables the Gemini experience for KSP without breaking the bank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided the best way to make the project happen was to crowdfund it with Kickstarter and in return all of the

The red and yellow needles are the 2 sets of FD needles (I went with two sets because then docking will be much easier being able to display both prograde and target vectors).\u00A0The green needles are the fixed heading vector needles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YNv3CFw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YNv3CFw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe needles themselves will be made from either steel or copper wire, about 1.5 mm diameter.\u00A0I also decided to go with linear needles as opposed to ones on long rotating arms. \u00A0The reason for this is that I found that the needles could wind up colliding if I didn\u0027t perfectly calibrate their positioning, shape, and size. \u00A0Especially with 4 full length needles (on the original navballs, they had shorter needles, thoughts on whether I should make the needles on mine shorter? \u00A0I kinda feel like the long needles make the view a bit cluttered). \u00A0The servos are positioned the way they are to maximize the servo throw\u00A0on the needles, thereby increasing the resolution. \u00A0The servos will push on the needles\u00A0against a return spring to remove any hysteresis from the needle\u0027s motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for motors, I went with NEMA 8 Stepper motors because then I could avoid needing to have a gear train inside of the ball. I may wind up using a NEMA 17 size motor for increased torque on the roll axis, but that will be very easy to change because it is just kinda stuck on the outside anyways. \u00A0I need to do some calculations on the torques before I finalize the motor choice, but with the gearing I think it will be OK (those gears are 3D printed as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the purposes of seeing the insides, the picture below has the navball rendered with clear plastic so that the insides are visible. The final version will be completely opaque and 3D printed. I also rotated the navball 90 degrees (from the customary configuration), this way\u00A0the stationary center ring forms the horizon line, therefore each half of the ball can be 3D printed in a single color.\u00A0The text and lines on the navball will be painted\u00A0in grooves CADed into the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KWktxEE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KWktxEE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, I still need some of the main structural frame elements\u00A0but I am very pleased with how it is turning out so far\u00A0and I think I am now far enough along to be confident that the design will work.

maneuvers by allowing the command pilot to enter in delta-v values\u00A0for forward/aft, up/down, and left/right. \u00A0The computer then monitors the acceleration of the vehicle when the thrusters are fired, thereby allowing the pilot to program in maneuvers, and subsequently monitor the progress of their execution. \u00A0This in and of itself is incredibly useful, but when combined with the event timer clock, it allows for KSP-esque maneuver node programming. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://geminiguide.com/eventtimer.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external

will be for planning maneuver nodes, and the second will be for controlling time warp in the game. \u00A0In the maneuver node programming configuration the event timer clock will work in conjunction with the incremental velocity indicator to place and program a maneuver node. \u00A0The controls will be adapted slightly, instead of forward/aft, etc. they will be prograde/retrograde values, with the total remaining delta-v displayed in an additional display. \u00A0The digits will all be shown on 14 segment displays as opposed to mechanical counters (because cost), and the input knobs will be lighted rotary dials that will glow red or green to indicated a positive or negative value. \u00A0When a maneuver node is active a light will also illuminate by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability

indicates a higher value than the range needle, the speed is too great, and vice versa. \u00A0The labeling of this gauge is logarithmic to allow for the best range of values while still giving decent resolution at lower values. \u00A0This gauge will be featured in nearly identical form in the sim-pit, as shown by the CAD model below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

early in the project, but I wanted to make sure that I did\u0027t miss anything, and I wanted to work out how each control would function before releasing it. \u00A0The whole project wouldn\u0027t really work if the controls in the capsule failed to provide all of the necessary functionality to play KSP, the whole point was to eliminate the need for a keyboard and mouse...\u00A0 The exact layout has yet to be determined, the physical locations of the switches and buttons will be modeled on the real Gemini capsule, but the functions of controls that do not directly translate from the real Gemini are going to be located to make them as logical and ergonomic as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for seeing the game, the central panel of the Gemini capsule is mainly dedicated to life support and communications controls, neither of which are nearly as complex in KSP (without the use of extensive mods, though I am planning on an updated version\u00A0with a smaller screen that has more room for life support mods), so I decided this would be the ideal place to put the screen so that both pilots could see it. \u00A0The red outline in the picture below shows the approximate location and size of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.venturesinmaking.com/2017/08/osgs-update-controls-list.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external
