Form a distance a texture will suffice, we pretty much all agree with that. Up close a texture just won\u0027t do and that\u0027s why I already suggested generating some kind of \u0027fog\u0027. And even this \u0027fog\u0027 is already in the game: exhaust smoke. Just generate enough at the correct moment to limit visibility and obscure the texture. Once through the clouds the smoke can clear and the texture will be visible again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T17:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile each hex of the hexgrid is 2D, the entire thing is a 3D model where the hexes are placed tangent to a sphere; the mesh is one fifth of the globe in five instances.

Or extend the load distance and have it load further. Generate base weather, then a random/changing element, so you may have a steady .1 m/s wind from the east, then a random gust that deviates slightly from the main direction. Then every hour or so game time see if the base weather changes etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the physical effects, you could use a set of GameObjects with the renderers off... and have particle generated FX clouds with the energy/intensity variables cased to the weather condition. You\u0027d make the cloud iskinematic and move it via code, and change it\u0027s altitude based on it\u0027s density. Moving over water it gains density and drops altitude.. moving over land it rains and drops density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think locally it would be really neat. You could also generate rain and have the rain game object follow the player location so long as they are in a rain zone. Distance fog can be used beyond to make the rain look deeper than it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wind force is simply force applied to parts/vessels matching the weather direction/speed. That can be universally applied to all rigidbodies in the area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
