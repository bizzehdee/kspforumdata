I have tried to make crafts that use angled panels before in order to give it a sleek polygon aesthetic (google F-117 for reference). My problem with this has been that the structural panels in KSP and only square and the only other way to get other shapes is with wings. When I try to angle these wing panels to get the shapes I want, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E gets totally screwed up. This mod will be starting simple and may or may not get more advanced as it goes. If anyone is able to offer expertise in the realm of modeling and texturing, I would very much appreciate the help. As of right now, I will only be duplicating the existing wing panels and either reducing or eliminating their lift and probably making other tweaks. Until I can get texture help, they will use the same stock skins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy modding experience is also quite limited. In the past, all that I have done in making my own mods is making copies of stock parts with new stats. I have made the \u0022Potential Missile\u0022 part and the \u0022Fighter Cockpit\u0022 part (buffed versions of the seperatron and Mk.1 Inline cockpit, respectively).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T19:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be similar for this. For all the related wing parts I suspect you have to remove the module \u00A0ModuleLiftingSurface section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
