Thank you for pointing it out! What about Communications? I\u0027d say they are last thing to remove definitely. Near future Propulsion pack has 2 great aspects, first one of the best models in KSP Modding and second it adds challenge with electricity management and is \u002B/- realistic (Which is the point of my mod idea), as well as idea with capacitors. Deadly reentry is another mod that adds challenge and is \u002B/- realistic. I completely agree that mods that try to fit everything is hard to make, but having 100 mods installed and having compatibility issues is a headache. Do you think it is possible to make solar flare radiation releases \u002B general cosmic radiation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tyrador\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tyrador\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about Communications?

And actually, having multiple mods isn\u0027t that much of a headache, especially if the creators are cooperating/are the same person (NathanKell is running most of those mods now, or cooperating with people who are). As for KSP interstellar, it\u0027s good, but it has a lot of unneeded overhead such as Alcubierre drives, part upgrades and science lab. If we could have a simpler \u0022lite\u0022 version featuring just heat/electricity management (and one integrated with stock ElectricCharge system better), it\u0027d be much better. This is what I\u0027d like this mod to be. Electricity, heat and radiation management. This is definitely doable with a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
