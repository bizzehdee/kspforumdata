One of the things that came up over and over again in the thread I created about using portrait mode is that some kind of multi-window support would be really great for KSP (think putting the map in one window, regular screen in another, IVA or instruments in another, etc...). It won\u0027t happen, this is a Unity limitation that\u0027s not likely to change anytime soon, but it would be really neat. So the possibility of having some kind of offline map, maybe one showing your present location above, or on, the surface, and some info like Kethane, slope, altimetry, etc..., is really interesting.

It might be an option to just reduce the field of view of the high res sensor drastically, so that you really need a proper mapping orbit - but if you get into one it would hopefully not be more annoying than it is now to complete the map.

And one that has more uses than ISA, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after playing around with it a bit, there are a few things that bug/confuse me. Some of them were mentioned earlier in the thread, but I think they\u0027re worth repeating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Too many parts. While I can understand the desire to have each function in a separate part, at the moment the need to place multiple sensors is a little annoying, especially as you can\u0027t use symmetry to ensure that they\u0027re evenly spaced. An all-in-one sensor would be very nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Altitude has no effect on the area scanned? This seems odd to me, perhaps because I\u0027m used to ISA, but it would still seem to make sense to have an area scanned/resolution trade off for altitude. Especially since a quick, low resolution map might be adequate for some purposes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An auto-update for the big map would be nice, since it shows more detail than the smaller map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The big map could probably use some performance optimization, since it noticeably slows down the game for me, but it seems you\u0027re already working on this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work, by the way!
