The idea is that rather than having inline and surface parts for each of the 20 or so MKS modules, separate the core functionality (the orange and white bit - it\u0027s mostly foam) with the cap that would house the workshop, etc. and caps would come in inline (shown) or domed/tapered versions that look prettier on the surface of planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the current coding parts is to enforce this dependency (a module must always be the child part of a cap), then extend this as I work on crew efficiency.

A couple of observations (I\u0027m working off of a version I downloaded a day or two ago, so apologies if these have already been addressed):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I built a craft using the colony hub as the main source of control with no other probe bodies on it and it defaults to debris and doesn\u0027t display on the map. Feels like this ought to be a pretty quick fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I noticed that the colony hub does not operate if it has no punch cards, but its purpose is to generate punch cards. In one of my first tests I launched with no punchcards and found myself with an inoperable base. This may be how you intended it to work, but it seems to me that the punchcard generator should be able to work without punchcards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I had a hard time selecting exactly 250 parts for the construction hub--I set up a very basic bootstrapping base with just a construction hub and a colony hub and wanted to have both operational with the construction parts on board. The slider snapped to increments of 100, though, so I could only either bring 200 (too few) or 300 (50 more than I wanted). I worked around it by taking 500 in the construction hub and 0 in the colony hub, but if you can set that tweakable to snap to counts of 50 or less then that would be ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. On my map of the Mun water is *extremely* scarce, which I think is fine--the search for water is a pretty big thing in space exploration (or, at least, it is what makes it into the media--NASA mush have found water on Mars a dozen times by now). The algae tank lets you work around a lack of water just fine, but it strikes me as being unrealistic--you can generate mass with this unit. It would be within the suspension of disbelief if this module required some mundane resource, like \u0022dirt,\u0022 that was found everywhere. This prevents an orbiting algae tank from violating conservation of mass. For now I\u0027ll be self-imposing the rule that algae tanks only work when hooked up to some sort of drill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, though, looks pretty fantastic. Can\u0027t wait to see a not-extremely-pre-alpha version of this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
