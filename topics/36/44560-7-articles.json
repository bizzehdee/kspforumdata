Crew egress also becomes complicated especially if the hatch is submerged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo spacecraft would have used floatation collars, which were manually attached by swimmers from the recovery team once the capsule was located by helicopter; since Kerbals in KSP may have to wait for quite some time before said recovery team arrives, it made sense to directly integrate the collars into the heat shield assembly itself - these collars would then automatically inflate themselves on splashdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally, I had a really nice mesh deformation animation from Blender\u0027s Shape Keys that realistically depicted the inflation of the collar, which was compatible with Unity\u0027s BlendShapes; however, KSP didn\u0027t like BlendShapes, and so I settled with a less accurate but good enough representation using simple scaling changes. I also added animated colliders, so that Kerbals that egress the capsule can actually stand and walk on them while awaiting rescue without getting wet, as demonstrated in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months back, stupid_chris wrote a small plugin that would cause the floatation collar to only trigger when the spacecraft splashed down (and not for terrestrial landings), and I helped test a number of iterations of said code. He\u0027s still trying to make it more robust and to add proper buoyancy handling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve done as much as I can for the V2.0 - I should probably get on with some other projects while I\u0027m waiting for Chris to finish off his bits and pieces...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T02:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout any \u0022floatation balls\u0022 on the nose, do you think there could be any issues with the capsule going nose down during the inflation of the floatation collar?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T02:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWithout any \u0022floatation balls\u0022 on the nose, do you think there could be any issues with the capsule going nose down during the inflation of the floatation collar?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d love to include floatation balls for the sake of completeness, and a simple MODEL{} node patch would be sufficient to add the balls to the docking ports without re-exporting the latter.
