It\u0027s supposed to be a Delta IV CBC. Data collection wasn\u0027t a priority for me when I started putting it together, I was just piddling around with whatever I thought looked rocket-y. I\u0027ve been paying more attention to detail now. If you need an extra modeller, I\u0027d be more than willing to help any way I can!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, RocketTurtle, your models are amazing I\u0027m realllyyyyyy looking forward to using the Atlas you\u0027ve been building!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chimer4","CreatedById":58864,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T17:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I am almost done with the Atlas V, just a texture touch up and SRBs to do, so I don\u0027t really need help with that, but if you ask Blazing Angel, who is doing the Deltas, he might be able offer you something \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have managed to get even more stuff on the Atlas Phase 2 and have a pretty good idea of how I want to do it. I\u0027ll do a 5m CCB with 2 RD-180s with the A.C.E.S. upper stage (also 5m) with 4 RL-10s. I\u0027ll use 5m and 7m fairings for this and you should be able to get some pretty hefty payloads up. I may have a go at the \u0022Phase 3\u0022, but I\u0027m not sure how the game will handle an 8.4m (~5.4m in game) stage\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CluelessModeler","CreatedById":58172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T18:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure KSP would like anything bigger than 5m.
