If I knew more about what needs doing, I\u0027d be willing to jump in and try my hand at fixing it. Finally took some time and figured out how to set up KSP mods. I\u0027ve got a good amount of C# experience, been working on a plugin for RaterProp Monitor to add Science Experiment controls, and one for ALCOR to make that fancy life support control panel functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t know what parts still need done here before it is considered \u0027feature complete\u0027. If no one comes back with anything, I guess I can look into some implementation of multiple stars; after PF-to-Kopernicus automated conversion, that\u0027s what I am most enthusiastic about. (By extension, if people say \u0027we aren\u0027t working on PF conversion any more; it\u0027s too hard/impossible/wont work/etc\u0027 then I will work on that.
