As you see in the screenies, I\u0027m on team B, and the Radar and SAM site are on team A. I have Radar and SAM in guard mode, and my trigger is on. The data link between the two is active.\u00A0No matter how close I fly, something between the Radar and the SAM doesn\u0027t click. When I switch to the Radar, I see myself on it, but it won\u0027t lock.\u00A0I have a Weapon Manager on each vehicle.
