I realise it had very limited use but I liked it.\n\u003E \n\nSadly, no.  Casualty of the increased number of parts (went from 4 inflatables to 10; had drop something somewhere, and that one was an easy choice to drop as it would have required all new textures, and textures are by far the most time consuming part of modeling for me).  Yes, I\u0027m taking the \u0027easy/fast\u0027 path on these parts... far to many other things need to be done, compared to spending another week on textures for a single part.\n\nInstead you\u0027ll be getting some 1.25m or 1.875m sized standard inflatables (not sure yet what size; the 1.25m is really close the the existing HAB-D, but seem a bit comical when viewed next to the large ones; 1.875m would allow for using the SC-A-SM as a ferry/delivery tug).\n\nWill be keeping the mesh/model around in my dev repository to revisit it in the future, probably for some more planetary-base oriented parts."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T20:39:10Z","Content":"All good, it was nice but not a must have.
