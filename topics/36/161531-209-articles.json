By manipulating gravity in a different way, it is possible to slow or stop the escape of hawking radiation from the black hole, therefore reducing the power output and the required matter input. The idea is to set up an artificial event horizon outside the naturally occurring event horizon, which redirects the particles that escape back towards the event horizon, therefore maintaining the mass of the black hole. This is, in effect, exactly how you \u0022switch off\u0022 a black hole\u0027s power output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy manipulating the gravity around the black hole in a third way, you can actually cancel out its inertia. The idea here is to set up a second artificial event horizon outside the first one, but the gravity vector is in opposition to the first, and its magnitude is such that it will cancel out the gravity field of the black hole as well as the first artificial event horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if that\u0027s impossible, it also nullifies the ability to make a warp drive.
