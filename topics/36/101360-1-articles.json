What I wanted to make were structural pieces that were much smaller than those I had, along the way some other ideas came to me as well. At the moment the plan is to make a full set of modular structural pieces as well as some specific sized non structural pieces that look similar and will fit together with the structural pieces. The base building blocks are in the following table.\n\n[TABLE=width: 500, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Name[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Nodes (T/S/B)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]~Height[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]~Diameter[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Karbon Fiber Hex Strut[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]1 / 0 / 1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]93.75 cm[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]31.25 cm[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]DuoTetraHedron[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4 / 0 / 4[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]58.75 cm[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]58.75 cm[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]TetraHedral[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]3 / 0 / 1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]37.25 cm[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]37.25 cm[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Bihedral[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]1 / \\* / 1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]39 cm[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]31.25 cm[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nAs I am trying to stay semi-realistic I needed a material that was very light but strong and that material is [Karbon (*Carbon*) Fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer). From what I understand carbon fiber depending on how it is made can do some amazing things ending up being stronger and lighter than other materials however the cost is much greater in most cases. however one of the weaknesses is that when used in a manner that it is not designed for carbon fiber often fails easily and spectacularly. That in mind, these pieces are smaller, lighter and much stronger than similar structural pieces. However the cost is much higher and the crash tolerance is very low.\n\n[TABLE=width: 500, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Cost[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Mass[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Max Temp[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Crash Tolerance[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]breaking Force[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]breaking Torque[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Modular Girder Segment XL[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]25[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]0.375[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]5000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]80.0 m/s[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]200[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]200[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Karbon Fiber Hex Strut[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]0.035[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]???[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]3.0 m/s[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]400[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]600[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nUnique Shape\n\nAt some point when I was messing around with model shapes I decided to try making a tetrahedron (why I do not remember) this snowballed into the DuoTetrahedron, taking me many hours to get the alignment right for the point directions that would become the nodes. After which, I remembered that this shape is actually very simple to get simply by propping a cube up on a corner and making an axis from each opposing corner ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif). \n\nBut all was not lost in this process as I got some very interesting regular geometric shapes that align perfectly with my hex struts in the tetrahedral axes. Hence the names don\u0027t refer to the shapes but the axes that their nodes face.\n\nOther Features\n\nBesides purely structural pieces I plan on making other parts within the confines of these four shapes.\n\n- [\\*=left]Fuel Tanks for the fuels used for low thrust engines  \n[\\*=left]Ion and monopropelant engines.  \n[\\*=left]Low thrust RCS  \n[\\*=left]Expanding sat dish  \n[\\*=left]Omni-direction antenna  \n[\\*=left]Expanding Tracking Solar Panel  \n[\\*=left]Probe Core  \n[\\*=left]\n\n[Flywheel batteries / SAS / Reaction wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage) Combination  \n\nAs well as the above I will be making adapters that go from the stock larger sizes to this size and possibly in the future and even further smaller parts.\n\nIn the future I want to have the Inertial batteries reaction wheel force to be based off of their current charge but this will require me learning a bit about coding in c#/unity.\n\nI welcome feedback and ideas on the project please post in this thread if you have any.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T06:10:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nycidian**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nycidian","CreatedById":138349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T07:44:52Z","Content":"Some pictures of the Directional Antenna I\u0027m Modeling\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
