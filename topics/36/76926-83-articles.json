Basically, what I want it to do is when you come it comes in contact with anything, like a building, it\u0027ll explode and hopefully bring it down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more suggestion and I\u0027ll leave you alone. Some sort of triggered explosive like C4, but mounted on the surface, again. It\u0027s more of a self destruct feature if anything, but again, it\u0027s for the same cruise missile xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advanced, BahamutoD, I\u0027ll check back in a day or so to see if anyone has replied \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominicinator","CreatedById":133691,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T05:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA question, and a suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question: Does this already work in 0.90 or are there Behind the Scenes changes that derped up this mod there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suggestion: Railguns, you know what these are, but as a suggestion: Make it so they shoot high velocity shots that have small explosions, also try too find some way too make them \u0022Piercing\u0022 (They dig holes in crafts), have 2 variants, one that is very large and heavy, also making it more \u0022Heavy-Duty\u0022 as well as a smaller, lighter, but less powerful variant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King_komodo93","CreatedById":117407,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T05:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd if you could solve the whole space-time continuum thing so we can get to work by way of wormholes without dealing with that whole time-relativity... err... thing... yeah, that would be swell.
