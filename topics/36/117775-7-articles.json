That is what powers the animated engines for that mod. It would require a dependency, but for something this complicated, I think it would be warranted. (Though I haven\u0027t seen very many other mods that put that plugin to good use. Dr. Jet tried, but I\u0027m having problems with the engines parts that have configs that use it.)\n\nThe other, more stock option, is to have 2 sets of toggles for each engine: Deploy/Retract and Activate/Deactivate. (This is the stock behavior of Dr. Jet\u0027s engine parts I\u0027m having problems with.) As mentioned, this requires the player to consciously deploy engines or else wind up destroying the vessel from the inside out."},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T12:56:33Z","Content":"here is a picture of the ladder im talking about its on the airlock part already\n\n![lSLY8sd.png](http://i.imgur.com/lSLY8sd.png)\n\nthe ladder looks short i know but its actually 2 parts overlapped so it looks like one.
