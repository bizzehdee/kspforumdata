Every ocean, every major island, every river, and every mountain will net their own results for science experiments and evas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod essentially provides a new biome map for the planet Kerbin, very meticulously done by hand in the Gimp in great detail. As a consequence, this mod also names the continents, oceans, and other geographic detail in order to provide a sense of immersion. This is easier said than done. One thing that I ask from the community is to look over the names that I have come with to see if they match with the Kerbal universe, and even to submit names they would like to see in the mod. Feedback is the way I tell if a name for a specific region is good or not. For example, when I first started this project, I spammed the crap out of names that started with the letter \u0027K.\u0027 Since people complained about there being too many Ks, I went back and renamed some of the regions so that there were less Ks. If a name is no good, tell me! I take no offense to someone coming and saying that the names are crap, because I want the names to not be crap. And always feel free to suggest names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne critical part of this mod will be a new sciencedefs.cfg file. Of course, this brings the possibility of the planet Kerbin having too much science yield early on in a career game. I do not foresee this being a problem for low altitude science experiments, as players would have to put in quite a significant amount of work in order to gain access to those science points. However, I am looking into a way of limiting some of the biomes for high altitude flight, that way an orbiting ship doesn\u0027t gain access to a large amount of science early in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the scope of this mod is extremely wide. It is very likely that I will find out if there\u0027s a limit on the number of biomes (maybe a dev can comment on this?). If this limit is hit, or if the large number of biomes begin to cause issues, then the mod will have to be scaled back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: A release is pretty close. The first release will consist of 146 biomes that are implemented. 20 of those biomes will have the string in place for customized science reports. The 126 biomes will receive science reports through periodic updates as I can write them. In addition, I will be taking a look at the contracts system to see what is possible, and if they would be a good feature for KSI. The idea is to implement contracts, such as setting up seismometers across different, specific mountain ranges and even setting up arctic bases. Provided that the contract system will allow for those kind of contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027palatino linotype\u0027;\u0022\u003EProgress Updates:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/8/2014: Tested a working, custom biome with working experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/9/2014: Began implementing the ocean biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/12/2014: Requested permission from Saik0 to utilize his map data in creating the biome maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/12/2014: Renamed some biomes; some people complained about there being too many Ks.

The master biome map has every single mountain range, large lake, river, bay, and slope marked off (by hand) as an individual biome, which is why the map took so much time developing (it is also 16k x 8k in resolution). Which means that this mod is now in a completely new phase of development. 120 biomes is a lot of biomes to implement, and steps will need to be taken to minimize Custom Biomes\u0027s biome detection bug that occurs at the boundary of biomes.
