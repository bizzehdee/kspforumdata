The model\u0027s really just a placeholder to play with how to make things, and the .cfg is just the stock ion engine\u0027s one with the requirement for xenon removed and the thrust upped really, really far. However, when I load up the ship (which consists of a cockpit and an arseload of batteries), the engine activates just fine but tells me it\u0027s deprived of electric charge. Nothing happens. I\u0027m almost certain I\u0027ve done something wrong somewhere down the line (my last attempt at making a mod ended with it crashing KSP every time I tried to load it up - at least I passed that point this time), but I have no idea what. I will, of course, provide any information needed, but I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027d need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe .cfg is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Ename = IonEngine2\u003Cbr\u003Emodule = Part\u003Cbr\u003Eauthor = CSquared\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Emesh = IonEngine2.mu\u003Cbr\u003Escale = 1\u003Cbr\u003ErescaleFactor = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 0.2135562, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.1872844, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ecost = 5700\u003Cbr\u003Ecategory = Propulsion\u003Cbr\u003Esubcategory = 0\u003Cbr\u003Etitle = Dual State Electrical Propulsion System\u003Cbr\u003Emanufacturer = K.
