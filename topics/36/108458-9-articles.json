There is a mini guide in the addon release subforum I believe, which is pretty exhaustive.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always ask in the discussions forum and someone will probably help you out. As always on the internet, the quickest way to get information, is to often start off from an incorrect position![:lol:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png \u0022:lol:\u0022)\n\nI never really paid attention to such things before KSP, but here everyone seems to be a rocket scientist during the day and a lawyer at night. Spacedock seems a bit lax with checking such things, but had you posted the reuploaded mod to the forums, it would have been removed by a moderator for, at the very least, not showing the source code. It can seem like a lot of red tape and hurdles, but considering how much work developers put in their mods, it\u0027s probably for the best.\n\nAnyway, no harm no foul.

My intention was to do away with JoolGas, as it is not in the Community Resource Pack or the stock resources. And in real life Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere is rich in Xenon you only need to filter it out.

While trying to modify it, i probably overlooked a JoolGas entry somewhere, producing the no object error.\n\u003E \n\nI see your point.\n\nYeah, I\u0027m turning JoolGas into the Jool equivalent of Karborundum and the scoop into a particle collector. I added JoolGas as an atmospheric and interplanetary resource to Jool. Initial tests with a revamped scoop (as just an intake) proved unsuccessful while skimming through Jool\u0027s upper \u0022atmosphere\u0022. Also turns out also 1700 maxTemp is rather low for such activities. Going to try with scoop revamped mk2, as a particle collector. If that fails, then I probably added the resource wrong.

After all, they are providing extra content all the time at it costs them(Squad) nothing. Personally i don\u0027t think i would still be playing KSP if it weren\u0027t for the abundance of interesting mods. To that end, they should be more communicative about planned changes and how this may affect mods. Also, they really should update their documentation for modders. Some entries date back to 0.23 and are hopelessly outdated. That makes it difficult as a budding modder to get the info needed to make good mods.\n\nAs for the comments,... haven\u0027t checked yet but i\u0027m assuming our absolutly right. In my defence... i grew up with Turbo Pascal, then Cobol, C/C\u002B\u002B and finall Java and Bash |-), so please be leanient if i get confused. I\u0027ll correct them and upload a patch version.\n\nI certainly would welcome any help offered. If you feel comfortable using a Git client, i\u0027d suggest you issue a pull request on my Github repository for the IXS: [https://github.com/bartblommaerts/warpship](https://github.com/bartblommaerts/warpship)\n\nAnd for the extra \u0027cheaty\u0027 parts: i agree. i didn\u0027t put those in though, i merely inherited them.
