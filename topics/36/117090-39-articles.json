No, it won\u0027t have a big station butt attached to it, but it will have a special purpose built (1.875m) service module.  Will investigate station uses when I get there (though, will consider it a bit during pod design, as it might influence a few things).  It likely won\u0027t have a big reto-motor thing stuck on the front either; that is one of the bits of Gemini/etc that I dislike; so whatever  pod I do, it will -not- have that sort of setup -- it will terminate at a standard docking port, and will likely include a LAS/BPC shaped specifically for it.\n\u003E \n\nthat RCS/retro/antenna mast could be left to when you investigate the station parts if you add a TKS body to it ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\nbtw, I **\u003Cu\u003Ethink\u003C/u\u003E** the VA can have a 1.25m docking port where the parachute/RCS pod base is supposed to be, not sure though as I\u0027m not having luck on finding the dimensions of it at work...  \n\nEDIT: it wouldn\u0027t be the first time the VA pod was flown without the mast though ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1686](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1686)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-08T15:57:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2015 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T16:11:42Z","Content":"General Development Update:\n\n- Parachute module is -working-; it animates all deploy states, transitions states, and transitions between different drag states properly.  The rest of the drag setup is config based.\n    - Needs some \u0027tweaks\u0027, such as disabling body lift of the part when the chute is deployed, but leaving it enabled when stowed, so you can fine-tune your ballistic trajectory with the pod before deploying chutes.\n    - Needs to rotate the part/part-COM properly in relation to the chute/wind/drag direction.  Currently the pod orientation does not matter once chutes are deployed, and you can freely pivot it around its COM.\n        - This all might actually be fixed by adding the proper CoP and CoL offsets in the part.cfg; the config I am working with was from 0.90, so those did not exist yet.  Will know more tonight.\n- RCS block models have been started.  If you have any specific block layouts you would like to see done, speak up about it today/tomorrow.\n- SC-A-Command-pod model is...complete I think.  Needs a bit more \u0027thought\u0027 on it, and then unwrap/texture.\n- SC-A-SM model is in pretty rough shape.  I\u0027m keeping most of the old cylinder geometry (and texture if I can manage it), but will be redoing the engine mount, fill ports, and engine bell.\n    - At this point I need to decide if the service module should have an integrated engine, or?  I\u0027m thinking for these \u0027purpose built\u0027 service modules that integrating an engine is probably acceptable\n    - Either way, integrated or not, I need to create geometry and texture for the SM engine; as it is one of the engines I have planned (AJ-10-137), I will be taking the time to do up the model fully/properly, and it will be available as a stand-alone engine (and clusters).\n- SC-A-BPC - not even started, need to finish CM model\n- Parachute - Generic - Model re-used from SC-B-DPM parachute cap model.  Texture re-used as well.  This model, at least, can be called \u0027done\u0027.\n- Docking Port model - started; well, reworked from the existing docking port to lower poly count (\u003E4k down to \u003C800).  Needs unwrap and texturing.  Seems likely that I\u0027ll be re-using the same (rescaled) geometry at least for 0.625 and 1.25m docking ports(including for station-core parts), so this model is on the \u0027needs to be finished\u0027 list.\n\nQuestions regarding Parachute Module:\n\nWhat feature set should the parachute module have?  Should I merely mimic the stock options/features? (e.g. speed limits, heat limits, etc).  \n\nIntended feature Set:  \n\n\\* Min Atm pressure for semi/full deploy for both drogue and main  \n\n\\* Max Dynamic pressure / speed? for each chute/state -- if stat is exceeded, parachute fails  \n\n\\* Max temp for each, drogue/main.  Drogue can have higher max temps to allow for some higher-speed/altitude deployment.  A bit unsure how to separate the chute heat from the pod heat....  \n\n\\* Auto-deploy sequence - deploy drogues and the rest will be taken care of for you.\n\nI am personally going for the following sequence/feature set:\n\nStart re-entry,  continue on ballistic trajectory until re-entry heating has mostly subsided, generally around 25k.   \n\nHit \u0027Deploy Chutes\u0027 button to deploy drogue chute.  Can be deployed higher depending upon heating/dynamic pressure.  Drogue semi should merely add a bit of drag, keep speed from increasing too much, slows to ~800ms by 17k  \n\nDrogue switches from semi-full deployed at ~17k/?atm, slows to ~100ms @6k  \n\nDrogue auto-cuts and semi-deploys main chute at ~6k, slows to ~30ms @1k  \n\nMain chute full-deploys at ~1k, slows to \u003C6ms @ Sea-level  \n\nLand...(hopefully intact)\n\n(Speeds are... guessed... will require a bit of tweaking to get the re-entry profile down properly)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, lynwoodm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The pod you are referring to is for the a series cm/sm part catalog?

Right now, if you make it useful higher up it is like flying through soup lower down.  If you tune it for lower-altitude performance, it is useless at higher attitudes.  I might end up trying to find out how to do variable drag based on atm density or something (or rather, inverse density); so the drogues actually become -less- effective in thicker atmosphere. - Edit: Or, as you hint, making it speed/density based -- more drag at higher speeds?\n\nThankfully most of that stuff is all fine-tuning balancing and does not effect the core functioning of the module (deploying chutes, swapping drag cubes).\n\nThe only bad side about this parachute module?  The setup is so different from stock/real-chute that there is -no way- you would be able to convert between the two (they are both animation based, mine is...transform and config based).  Honestly, that was the whole point of the module; to break away from the stock animation-based setup, and to allow the parachute setup to be defined completely through config -- so I can change the animation/settings/etc without having to touch the model, or the mess that is Unity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-08T19:21:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T19:43:18Z","Content":"Wow, that sound awesome!

Shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add some mach-speed curve-based manipulation of the drag cubes into place.\n\nMight have to get together with you on IRC/Steam-chat/etc to go over some details regarding what you would like to see out of the system, as I am certainly no expert on supersonic flow or drag caclulations, but I think it could benefit from a better high-speed parachute handling setup.\n\nAnd, on the related subject of re-entry / heating -- Working on laying out the groundwork for a custom ablator/heat-shield module to be used by the upcoming capsules.  As apparently the stock module has some issues with integrated parts, this will be a full-custom setup - and probably much more feature filled than the stock one.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- heatShieldVector - Heat-shield \u0027shielded\u0027 direction vector to determine if heatshield is facing the airstream and should ablate/protect.  The more it is facing the air-stream, the more effective it is.  (will have a slight \u0027grace\u0027 area where you can be slightly off-vector without too much bad effect).  This means the heat shield will only protect a part if oriented properly  -- no more heat shields losing their ablator during launch.\n- minEffectiveDot - minimum dot product between wind and heat-shield direction where heat shield will still be effective (dot product is basically the angle between two vectors, expressed as a range of 1 to -1)\n- maxEffectiveDot - the dot product at which the heat shield is most effective (at higher dot products than this, it will be 100% effective; it is this that provides some small off-perfect \u0027grace\u0027 area).\n- ablationStartTemp - temperature at which ablation will start; below this temp and the heatshield is just dead weight\n- ablationMaxTemp - temperature at which ablation peaks -- beyond this temperature effective ablation rate will peak at 100% of maximal.\n- Node/occlusion checking - even if facing the airstream, if the specified attach node has a part attached the shield will be considered \u0027occluded\u0027 and not function.  Can be used to \u0027stack\u0027 heat-shields for sequential use.  Undecided if this will use drag-cube occlusion checks such as the stock heatshield, or if it will be purely node based.\n- ablation heat reduction is based on the material used for ablation -- using specific heat capacity/density of the material.\n\nWould-be-nice:\n\n- Allow for other types of heat-shield -- passive thermal soak, ejectable, active thermal soak, others?\n- Allow for variance in the ablator material? (e.g. in-editor switching)  More dense = higher start temp, but more effective (use for super-high-speed re-entries, such as direct-return-from other planets)\n- For non-ablating types of heat-shield, allow variance in shield materials; higher density = more soak potential, ??\n\nAny ideas/input on that list of requirements?  Will be needing to get this module finished up for the command pods as well; the stock heat-shield module just doesn\u0027t cut it for integrated parts (and the config values make zero sense / difficult to tweak properly)."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T17:19:16Z","Content":"I\u0027ll hate the CM texture?

Plugin-wise I guess shield shouldn\u0027t work and should be vulnerable to intense heat when it\u0027s open and function as normal heat shield when it\u0027s closed. Visual example:\n\n![kmjipRN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kmjipRN.jpg)\n\nIn other words animated heat shield / ballute module would allow to have simpler construction with engine at the back that can be shielded from airstream when entering atmosphere backwards.Otherwise you would need to drop / hide main engines so they wouldn\u0027t burn up when entering from high interplanetary speeds. Some concepts even have secondary ? engines for altitude control during reentry / multiple aerobraking passes:\n\n![VpBVuK8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VpBVuK8.jpg)![B3ZuLSc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/B3ZuLSc.jpg)\n\nAlso - from more real life designs - inflatable ballutes/heatshields designs like those could work nicely:\n\n![ballute.jpg](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090811/images/ballute.jpg)![xindex.php,qaction=dlattach,3Btopic=2937](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/xindex.php,qaction=dlattach,3Btopic=29372.0,3Battach=919535,3Bimage.pagespeed.ic.mHsaCqun5V.jpg)\n\nI often write ballute/heatshield in one sentence since both concepts are very often mentioned together:) In KSP this is also the case as soon as someone moves into Kerbol resize mods like kscale2 / 64k where orbital/transfer speeds are much greater than in stock.\n\n*edit: example stats for ballute/heatshield operation:*\n\n[http://slideplayer.com/slide/2869340/](http://slideplayer.com/slide/2869340/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T18:34:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T19:35:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, lynwoodm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There will be a show dedicated to your \u0022silver\u0022 looking parts.

The increase in the options granted by the new \u0027standard\u0027 shader is.... insane.  Probably should put on a \u0027Pimp my Part\u0027 type weekly series as I\u0027m reworking the parts (only half kidding :))\n\nOn that note, I -think- I just found how to \u0027fix\u0027 the messed up normals/shading for basic cylinders and conical parts, though it currently requires splitting the \u0027fixed\u0027 parts into a separate mesh object (less than ideal from a performance standpoint; might be able to fix/work around it, if I can find a way to persist the adjusted normals during mesh joins and export/etc).  Hmm.. it seems like it accepts re-joining, as long as I don\u0027t try and alter the mesh after the fact.\n\nThis is actually quite excellent news for me, as I\u0027ve been trying to find a way to \u0027fix\u0027 the shading on low-poly meshes for quite some time, and it has nearly caused me to quit modeling more than once (why model if even when done \u0027properly\u0027 it still comes out looking like mud?).  So... yah... good stuff.  Will see about applying this to the CMs as I rework them, in prep of the upcoming Unity shader improvements (one less thing I\u0027ll have to rework when 1.1 comes out).\n\nEdit:\n\nBad normals (note the shading on the airlock hatch, has some strange vertical banding to it)\n\n![KkuOhJv.png](http://i.imgur.com/KkuOhJv.png)\n\nFixed normals (not perfectly smooth shading on the hatch.... finally!!  (ignore the missing panel below the hatch, I was verifying that the normals work even with pieces cut out, which normally messes with them terribly.)\n\n![td4xSRM.png](http://i.imgur.com/td4xSRM.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T19:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T20:13:19Z","Content":"quick question, to go along with the new Apollo CM, would it be possible to when you re-work the landers have an third model LEM-alike? you know, for 0.625m docking ports ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T20:22:11Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t these be killer things to do to a CM?
