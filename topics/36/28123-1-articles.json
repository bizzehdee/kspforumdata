KSPX engines do not seem to wobble any more than stock, yet KW and Nova pack engines act like they are attached with rubber bands. Even though I have limited mod experience I thought a good place to start would be too compare the part config files. Below are all the differences I found between two similar engines the stock LV-T30 and the KW Rocketry WildCat-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E// --- node definitions ---\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 7.21461, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -7.27403, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWildcat-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- node definitions ---\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -9.56, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is this is the location of nodes relative to model center, I don\u0027t think this is the issue but it might be. If there is a clipping issue with the collider mesh this might be involved but that is a bit of a side issue.

The Wildcat has gimbal action but we already knew the LV-T30 did not so it is the lack of everything else that is odd. Or not really since all of that pertains to the inbuilt engine fairing which KW has yet to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also worth noting that the stock engine has several additional files in more meshes, models, and a DAE file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started to look at this because it annoys me that these engines wobble. I would imagine this annoys others as well and it also affects other mods. I have limited experience but I will begin testing to see if changing these values will stop the wobble.
