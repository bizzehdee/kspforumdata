If something does break, it is likely an error in the configs/setups that should be corrected -- so please let me know if you encounter any broken vessels, and let me know what part/layout/mount it was that was broken.  I\u0027ll be loading up some of my old craft for testing, but that certainly will not handle every possible combination.\n\nHoping to get it finished and available for testing later today/this evening.  So far I\u0027ve got the global setting stuff working, customization working, and mostly just need to setup the auto-sizing code (auto calc starting, min, and max size per mount per layout per engine).\n\nThis all came about because I was going to add a few new generic mount types (re-used textures, altered geometry), but was going to take many hours to add the mounts to all the engines for each layout.  The problem would only get worse as more engines, mounts, and layouts are added."}]}
