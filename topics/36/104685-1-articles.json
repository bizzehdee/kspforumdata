I\u0027d like to create a stock-alike control surface that, for pitch and roll commands, functions normally, but when is told to yaw while still in a horizontal placement, splits into two pieces, as in the following pictures:\n\n![3161617018_4bd283c08c.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3122/3161617018_4bd283c08c.jpg)![B2Taxying9oClock2.jpg](http://www.richard-seaman.com/Aircraft/AirShows/Edwards2005/B2/B2Taxying9oClock2.jpg)\n\nI can do modelling and texturing starting in a few weeks, once school is over, but I\u0027d like some input/advice/assistance as to how one might implement such a part in Kerbal."}]}
