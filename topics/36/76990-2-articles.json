It\u0027s goal is to combine many current mods into a cohesive launch system and only creating additional parts as needed. Either way, it doesn\u0027t approach the scale of the SLS. The rational is this: Other \u0022SLS\u0022 projects include sumgai\u0027s SDHI, blackheart612\u0027s Aerospace Kerbodyne Taurus SDHI, and ChakaMonkey\u0027s. SDHI is a 2.5m stockalike system. Taurus is a larger SDHI. ChakaMonkey actually has an Orion, but the rest of the launch system is still in the 5m range. The NASA SLS is a 8m system. The idea is this: With a realistic launch system (not overbuilt or asparagus, etc.) the SDHI is really an orbital vessel. The Taurus is fit for use within the Kerbin system (mun/mimnus). The SLS is a deep space and planetary exploration system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as far as joining Yanfret and ChakaMonkey? Let\u0027s look at the names of people working on ChakaMonkey. Yanfret, Bobcat, Sumgai, etc and containing mods from KW, Nova, Fuztek, KOSMOS, ALCOR, etc. In other words, ChakaMonkey reads like the \u0022Who\u0027s Who\u0022 and \u0022Must have mods\u0022 for KSP. I\u0027ve barely learned how to use blender and my textures need a great deal of work. I\u0027m not of the caliber of modeler or modder that these guys are. First and fore most, doing this is a learning experience for me. I\u0027m the kind of guy who needs a project to motivate me to learn something. I can\u0027t learn something just for the sake of learning. So that\u0027s my primary goal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in essence: Do we already have SLS-like systems? Yup, but I need the experience and I think it\u0027d be cool to have a GIANT rocket in the game. Why don\u0027t I join Yanfret on ChakaMonkey? I\u0027m not good enough. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4nxs","CreatedById":80680,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T16:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/11/new-sls-options-new-large-upper-stage/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/11/new-sls-options-new-large-upper-stage/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this with some extra info about the payloads.

Then there\u0027s issues with scaling bugs. Clearly it\u0027s best to model 1:1 with KSP. The scaling thing in part configs is the result of bad foresight on SQUAD\u0027s part anyway, isn\u0027t it. They simply scaled things as a hack, instead of remodelling everything to the correct scale.
