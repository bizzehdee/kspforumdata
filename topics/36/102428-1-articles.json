So I thought about making an area not to far from the Kerbal Space Center that would function as a rocket test facility. Not a full concept yet but gonna come up with some ideas to make the test facility be a fun place to test rockets. Gonna have a lot of modding questions soon so be ready."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T06:28:56Z","Content":"Sounds like a neat idea. I for one have always wondered why someone hasn\u0027t atleast made an engine test stand by now. Maybe something that can copy the engine you have attached to it exhaust effects and spit them out a thrust bucket."}]}
