Sometimes a mod installation has just plain borked things, somehow and required me to reinstall KSP to sort it (orphaned cfg\u0027s or whatnot).\n\nNow I wanted to ask if you would be interested in using a tool like this:\n\n- Made in a scripting language like perl to remove the uncertainty of running foreign .exe files\n\n- Manage your KSP installs:\n\n - 1-button clone installation to try out new mods\n\n - Safe updates, automatic updates won\u0027t mess up your saves\n\n - Choose when to upgrade to a new version ( once you know mods you use are available for the new version )\n\n - Revert possibility if something goes horribly wrong\n\nBasically all it will be will be a managed way to handle the install directories. You can do it all manually, but many are uncomfortable with manual directory management and it\u0027s so easy to forget to take backups of your saves before installing mods.\n\nAnother option would be for CKAN to handle this kind of functionality, CKAN is an \\_excellent\\_ mod manager and this function could be a nice addition.\n\nPlease drop me a line below if you have any suggestions."},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T14:22:48Z","Content":"If you an get it to work for mac, I\u0027ll download it."}]}
