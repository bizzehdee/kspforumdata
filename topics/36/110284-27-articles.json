I got it. I do not know why, but the Pathfinder does not work with SciensAlert mod. If you remove SciensAlert, then start working even running scanners.\n\u003E \n\nThe terrain scanner does not work properly because you can only use it for one scan attempt. If that attempt is done at the wrong time it gets permanently broken. This is very easy to test by having an install that only has Wildblue mods. Using the scanner on a *sub-orbital* flight or *non-polar* flight will break it. It reports that conditions are not right and the button to scan disappears. So it can never be used again.\n\nThis means any mod that automatically runs science experiments like Science Alert will break it buy trying to trigger a scan at the wrong time.  \n\nI also suspect that the Remote Tech can also break it early if that is installed as the data transmitter is replaced with one that has zero range.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T15:10:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis2**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T14:46:57Z","Content":"Ah, that\u0027s good to know!
