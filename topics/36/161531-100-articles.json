Imagine a spaceship with a thermal rocket pointing in all directions from the center of mass. You could have an inertia-less control system, where the engines work together to make a turn be a turn like on the ground, instead of just pointing a different direction while retaining your velocity vector. Imagine how maneuverable that would be? I mean you can build that now but you\u0027d need a control system to do differential thrust on the different engine groupings to make it really work. And it\u0027d use a lot of fuel, but.. would be fun to see if you could get it to fly.

It would only produce power when requested (megajoule being used). Since the mega joules will also feed Electric Charge, it can effectively be used to run all (KiloWatt) electric processes like life support and communication. Preferably it would be fully automated, automaticly kicking in when all main power sources (reactors) get offline. like a true auxilery emergency power system.
