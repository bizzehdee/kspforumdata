They wont deploy during my re-entry, saying it is unsafe (even at around 200m/s?). Doing simple tests (launching a ship straight up and activating parachutes) they work fine, so it must be the speed/unsafety that is causing them to not deploy.

You can even activate them while in space and they will properly not deploy until it is safe for them to do so.\n\nThe mass that they are attached to also should not matter; the only things that determine if they should open or not are 1.) The user specified altitude settings, 2.) The current dynamic pressure (speed\u002Baltitude), and 3.) The calculated shockwave temperature (speed\u002Baltitude; only while \u003E350m/s).  They -should- open around 220ms for mains, and... 325m/s or so for the drogues (depending on altitude slightly).\n\nI\u0027m not seeing anything in your log that would point towards mod-conflicts; there is a null-reference caused by PersistentRotation (so you might try removing that mod...), but it looks like that is happening after the parts have started lithobraking/exploding.

See how well you can make them and move onwards from there. Think of the Mars D.I.R.E.C.T project. The hab was, in fact, a landable can with a heatshield on it. Granted, it was supposed to be 2 stories tall, to accommodate 4 humans (I\u0027d say you can put 6 Kerbals in one of those with room for piddly things, like air, food, water, pet goldfish). But, with one of those attached to your cargo truss system, I\u0027d say you\u0027d had the beginnings of a fairly strait forward IPV. I know the Copernicus IPV concept did have an inflatable hab, but all the same and as always, I leave that up to you.\n\u003E \n\nWell... yes.. it appears I just might be doing at least a few inflatables.  Especially if I can get the BlendShapes to work; would allow for some truly unique deployment animations, of a quality and capability not seen in any other mods (well, dependent on my modeling and animation quality of course). \n\nThere is also the fact that no other appropriately modeled inflatables exist for my purposes;  PJ\u0027s Hab pack is modeled well, but is done with stock-alike textures, and has those silly 1.25m hatch/node/things stuck on them (and the v2 pack is nowhere to be seen/no recent updates on it).  RoverDude\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff is much the same; stock-looking textures, and improper sizes for most of the models, as well as having specific functions that are useless outside of UKS.\n\nSo its not that I really -want- to make them; its that I have no suitable alternatives available and my only recourse is to make them myself (or go without)."},{"CreatedByName":"Qwarkk","CreatedById":154770,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T17:06:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HI Qwarkk;\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It should not matter when you activate the parachutes (though they don\u0027t by default workthrough staging/space bar; you must assign an action group or use the right click menu).

You also have them working for your suborbital test cases.  The fact that the parachute cap deployed in your last test also tells me that the plugin is working, but something is causing it to cut the parachutes early.\n\nThat mostly leaves mod conflicts as the likely suspect.  About the only thing I can suggest there is to recreate the craft on a mostly clean (Stock\u002BSSTU\u002Bdependencies) install and see if you can duplicate the problem there.  IF you can, please not the steps neccessary to recreate the problem and reply with those details / a craft file that always experiences the problem.  If the problem doesn\u0027t manifest on a clean setup, then you have a mod that is acting badly or interfering, and will need to identify which mod it is (by installing your mods one at a time and re-testing after each one).  I will gladly fix problems that I can duplicate in a stock install, but do not have time to find, download, and install a bunch of mods to test for a -possible- mod conflict (that most than often is a problem with the other mods that I can\u0027t fix anyway).  BUT if you can narrow it down to a specific mod / very small set of mods it makes it much more likely that I will investigate the interaction problems.\n\nStaging: I noticed from your screenshot that you enabled the parachute staging in the right-click menu, in which case, yes it will respond to space-bar staging (but it is not setup like that in the default config; if that is your default setup then something is messing with the config for those parts, and is probably the first thing you should find out (what is messing with the parts configs)).\n\nI\u0027m not seeing anything too worrying in that log (though it appears that log got cut off early, as it ends partway during the initial loading sequence.. before the parts are even loaded), but thanks for including it anyway; never know when it\u0027ll have all the answers."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T19:00:22Z","Content":"Quick-and-dirty modular part setup for the \u0027Station Core\u0027 main modular part (which will probably be aptly called \u0027Station Core\u0027).  This potential layout makes full use of ModuleSwitch, ModelSwitch, dynamic crew-capacity, and IVA-swapping; some of which are \u0027tentative\u0027 or unknown if they will even be workable.  The crew-containing module would be the red colored sections due to limitations on only a single IVA being allowed per-part; all other modules are parts would be structural/functional parts only and would not expand the crew capacity.  The top and bottom module selections don\u0027t necessarily have to be the same, I was just running out of ideas.  \n\nWith the current setup of the \u0027ModelSwitch\u0027 module, you could even omit the Top Module and Top Cap modules (same with bottom) if you only wanted the core piece, or any combination thereof (so can have top module \u002B top cap, bottom module, but no bottom cap; or core module, no top module, but a top cap adapter).  The only non-optional bit would be the core segment.\n\n![pBoJ0QZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/pBoJ0QZ.png)\n\nNot shown are potential \u0027Core Module\u0027 accessories, which could range from solar panels, lighting rigs, transmitters, or ??, really anything small that would go on the outside of the  module is a potential \u0027accessory\u0027 option.  Other modules could potentially have \u0027accessories\u0027 as well, such as the reactor having optional radiators, or the logistics module having multiple transmitter options.  In theory the hubs could even have optional integrated docking ports as an \u0027accessory\u0027, or even just available as another discrete \u0027cap\u0027 option.\n\nThe same, or similar, setup could be used for some of the \u0027structural\u0027 parts;  the ModelSwitch module supports a pre-configured tree-type model hierarchy without any limit to length/depth of the branching.  So you may have a \u0027structural\u0027 part with multiple main body segments, various top and bottom adapters, and various cap options / hubs / docking port setups.\n\nThe only real limitations to this type of modular-part setup would be the complexity of the finished part (how many things do you really want on the right-click menu?), and the time needed to add all of the various options / tree branches for the ModelSwitch setup.  BUT -- I don\u0027t want to go overboard with the model-switching / modular parts setup.  Would still rather keep each \u0027modular part\u0027 to have a specific function and be usable in the \u0027lego-rocket/station\u0027 fashion.  As such would likely limit each modular part to 3-5 modules in length, with 2-6 options for each module.  That way a complete station would be constructed by docking together 2-4 of these \u0027modular parts\u0027, with perhaps a few random structural or custom bits on it (custom positioned lights or whatever... stuff that can\u0027t be done through the modular part setup).\n\nWill try and whip up some prototype models to use for testing and better examples (I know, my graphical examples are kind of poor).  Have a -ton- of thinking to do on this stuff before I commit too much time on the implementation of it.  Far to often I come up with a concept that sounds great at first but soon starts sounding silly/over-the-top/too complex once I start working on implementing it.  Will almost certainly be creating some dummy/placeholder models to use for some test parts for feedback before I start actually modeling anything for them.\n\nAlso, if the new ModuleSwitch functionality works out this may mean that the \u0027Modular Service Module\u0027 may actually become reality at some point.  Would use many of the concepts discussed above for the station core part, but on a bit smaller scale (body option \u002B engine option \u002B EC generation option \u002B CM adapter option \u002B payload/science option?; okay so not really much simpler, just different ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) )"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T20:16:28Z","Content":"I\u0027m probably arriving at the party too late, and sorry if this was discussed previously, but what will be the style for the parts?

Have not yet managed to get the model to display or animate in-game, but that shouldn\u0027t be too difficult of a thing to accomplish now that I can get the models to load.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So... I\u0027ve got a few things to think over/investigate regarding how best to handle the model-loading for asset-bundle based models.  I -might- be able to start them loading at the point where ModuleManager finishes its database loading; hopefully this would give them time to load so that I could inject them into the GameDatabase loaded models list so that they can be used as any other model.  But as my head is pounding from digging through obscure KSP API stuff, that investigation will have to wait for another time / tomorrow.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like that\u0027s two major features needed for the station parts that I\u0027ve got sorted out now.

I honestly haven\u0027t tried building anything... large.. since 0.90, where anything in the ~80 part range would start causing lag.  But, for example, compare a stock-built Apollo-ish rocket to an SSTU SC-B setup; is there any noticeable difference in FPS performance between them? (Might be too few parts to even notice a difference in those cases).\n\nMostly I\u0027m asking this because the recent plan for the modular-station parts boils down to little more than a limited form of part-welding; the parts would actually be -more- usable for lego rockets/stations if they were made distinct parts.  Would also save me a few days/week worth of updating/fixing/writing new code to handle them.  Even if I made them distinct parts, quite of bit of the part-count savings would still be in place, as each module (part) would have its own integrated accessory bits (solar panels, transmitters), and could still make them modular in so far as including choices of adapters/docking ports (optional).\n\nBasically the system I had envisioned would work, but the -only- gain out of it would have been part count reduction (2-4 parts saved per complete modular part, compared to the stand-alone versions), while actually reducing the potential combinations of use for the part(s) they were constructed of, and would require substantial amounts of work to get it setup (both as far as coding and the actual part config creation), and could be very prone to breaking for very minor updates to the parts/configs.  I suppose this boils down to I would rather save parts through integrating the \u0027accessory\u0027 bits into the modules (solar panels/etc) rather than pre-welded modules.\n\nOn that note, the Russian DOS station modules/parts would still make good candidates for single-part setups, and would still make a good single-part starter station / station-core.  Would need to decide if I wanted to make multiple discrete variants or to use modularity in the part itself for the different options; will have to do a bit more investigation on their various configurations and options.\n\nI suppose I\u0027ll have to do some testing this weekend and see where the performance limits are at in 1.1 as far as part-count is concerned.  While I do want to reduce part-count as much as possible, I would rather not do it at the expense of design options, vessel configurability, and general stability.  The goal in the end is to have \u0027usable\u0027 stations/etc, not merely the lowest part count possible; as long as the station can be used with a few vessels docked to it, then that goal has been achieved (and with the super-low-part count ShipCore vessels in SSTU, that leaves quite a few parts available to be used for the station itself).\n\nOn a slightly different note:\n\nLooking over the images of real-world station modules (mostly the ISS), it appears that there are two basic variants -- the US \u0027silver cylinder\u0027 style, and the Russian DOS variants (Salyut program, Zvezda, Zarya, etc)  (which is mostly what Jose had pointed out the other day).\n\nSo for those wondering on what the styling of the station parts will be, ^^^ there is your answer.
