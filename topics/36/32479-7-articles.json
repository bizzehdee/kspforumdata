I just don\u0027t think that it should be limited to mining because of a resource need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers will want to play together, for almost anything, others will want to work alone, but still share some element of the MP experieince. Most of these reasons do not hinge around mining integers. What happens after mining? We end up accumulating all these \u0027resources\u0027 that we can turn into rockets? It is just very limited in my opinion and might get tedious. Now, build ingame currency is a potential angle, but makes little sense in a small scale multiplayer short of 30 slots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a big universe, and you could very well have players start on other planets and work (as teams) to locate and destroy other factions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I feel the best \u0027gamemode\u0027 for this would be straight sandbox, in which you have minigames and group challenges. Mostly, giving the player the choice of experiences and tools will yield the most rewarding gameplay. Allow a server and sub-mod community to take on a life of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is one mod you should support, it should be the lasor mod by Rom. That will be maximum fun for those who dislike grinding. The combat takes on a great life with MP and that mod. It would also spur development of counter measures, and early detection radar. It takes the game forward. Most of this could be done only on the client side, and just have the server account for missiles exist, position, vecs and states. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as tech, yea - a free mode would be fun and part of sandbox. Why restrict? At the very least, give server admins the ability to choose a difficulty setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hear you on the difficulty aspect of working together to build space programs, and I\u0027m 100% on board with it. Thank for you for the effort you put in on it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my .02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-M\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T22:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Meatsauce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
