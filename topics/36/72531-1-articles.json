It all still works in 0.23.5 but lacks tech tree integration and support for the new Kerbodyne parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve edited the Bigger Badder bi/tri/quad couplers into Bigger Beastlier ones to plump them up to Kerbodyne size, and upsized the nodes on those and the ThunderMax parts from 2 to the new 3 size, except for where they attach to Rockomax parts, left those nodes at size 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing the node size on those large parts helps a lot, and should (possibly) keep the 9 engine mount from sliding around or falling off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s just one more new part to add, a ThunderMax to Kerbodyne adapter. Upscaling the ThunderMax to Rockomax one results in the ThunderMax end becoming grossly enlarged - and to thoughts of a ThunderMaximer size and enbiggening the 9 engine mount to hold four Kerbodyne and five Rockomax engines... No! Must resist the temptation of power... and because I\u0027ve no idea how to adjust that big mount if a simple scale up wouldn\u0027t make it fit the larger engines. But... sooo big rocket...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA scale factor of 1.45, 1, 1.45 on the new Kerbodyne to Rockomax adapter has its top end exactly Kerbodyne diameter. (Kerbodynamter?) But the bottom still hangs over the edge of a ThunderMax tank. Later I\u0027ll try scaling up the other stock adapters and see how/if they\u0027ll come closer. A little bit small on the bottom will be better than sticking out over the edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone want to participate in the updating for Tech Tree integration? I figure all the Badder/Beastlier/ThunderMax parts and the lengthened Rockomax tanks and the huge Rockomax diameter SRB should go into the same node as the Kerbodyne tanks and engines. I\u0027m not doing anything to the plane parts since there\u0027s nothing new they need to adapt to or to have adapted to them. They just need tech treed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakables? Nothing much that needs tweakabled, at least not on the simple tanks and adapters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other part that may need attention is the 5-way RCS block. For larger than Rockomax parts it\u0027s a bit anemic on thrust unless a lot of them are used, though two rings of 8 can swing a ThunderMax 64 around rather smartly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost 6:00 AM here. Going to bed. Will twiddle with those adapters later and if I get a good fit will release my mods to this pack to someone to add the other things. PolecatEZ said he\u0027d upload it to Spaceport.
