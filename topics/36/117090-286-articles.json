The two mods also appeal to potentially different audiences, have different artistic styles that don\u0027t exactly match up, and even go about things in a bit of a different manner.  KF is not really concerned with \u0027low-part-count\u0027 at all, instead being focused on a specific feature set and purpose -- making things move (or not move in the case of landing legs... or at least not crash-land as it were).\n\nAs for the tech-tree arrangement -- the parts could certainly be spread around the tree a bit more.  They are no longer as over powered compared to the stock parts as they once were, and so I think the main reason for them being so far down the tree has lost much of its purpose.  Certainly a few of them should still be in the more advanced node -- the largest tracks and wheels -- but the rest could be bumped down a tier or 2 to slot in next to the stock legs and wheels.  A PR would be much appreciated if you wanted to put one together, just base it off of the KF2 repository ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/KerbalFoundries2](https://github.com/shadowmage45/KerbalFoundries2) ).\n\nSSTU will at some point in the future have its own sets of landing legs (at the very least) that are purpose built to be used with the LC pods and tanks and also include some form of part-count reduction (pre-built / scale-able sets of 2/4 legs?).  Wanted to get the LC fuel tanks redone and touch up the LC-PODs a bit first, but I did not intend to leave the LC parts with nothing to support them permanently (pun intended)."},{"CreatedByName":"T-10a","CreatedById":176203,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-28T01:06:01Z","Content":"I use the optional patches, but I\u0027ve looked through them and deleted the obviously WIP patches (namely the deFirespitterisation patch and other similar module removing patches) as those broke other mods and were obviously in need of work."},{"CreatedByName":"The-Doctor","CreatedById":163802,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-28T15:55:00Z","Content":"I\u0027ve gotten it to work but I think I found the cause of the problem, it was a mod that added patches to sstu, I think its name was j patch laboratories?

It is not as hardcore as doing it like in Stephen Baxter\u0027s Voyage either, because instead of doing over 20 launches to send then refuel a propulsion stack in parking orbit plus the crew, lander and habitation module and a flyby to Venus for gravity assist to Mars, I prefer to follow the much more straightforward KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid.\n\n![2096f89d19730025fb236ab0d39a9251.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/2096f89d19730025fb236ab0d39a9251.jpg)\n\nTwo small nuclear reactors(from Near Future Electrical) per ZBO tank.

Upon reaching parking orbit with the propulsion stack, the last stage is finally jettisoned, the fairing of the Skylab Habitation module is jettisoned as well, and finally the Apollo CSM is transposed and docked with an adapter module previously stored in a smaller interstage petal adapter, then with the Skylab, giving to the astronauts immediate access to the MEM.\n\n![32ef2f1c41f051492ac8294020052ee3.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/32ef2f1c41f051492ac8294020052ee3.jpg)\n\nWhile the Propulsion Stack has a pretty good thrust, it still needs two separate burns to send the Ares towards Mars. Once the injection burn is complete, the reusable NTR boosters undock and burn retrograde with their remaining fuel to elliptical orbits around Earth, and their nuclear reactors are set to minimum power, for with their fuel almost empty, preventing boil-off is easier. In the future they may be refueled to circularize their orbits then be used again for interplanetary missions, because even a single NERVA II is too expensive to be merely discarded after a single mission.\n\n**Interstage Petal Adapters are useful for more than merely storing landers or other modules inside them**\n\nSpoiler\n\n![068bc7c2b99c8f4be294661d6ce64a01.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/068bc7c2b99c8f4be294661d6ce64a01.jpg)There were two choices to save delta-V: a complicated Venus gravity assist or an aerobraking-assisted orbital insertion. The engines are ignited near periapsis even with the aerobraking because Mars atmosphere is so thin relying on it and nothing more for circularizing an orbit is almost impractical, specially in such an impromptu and risky way.\n\n![014d0736e731633396531a39ace75c0d.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/014d0736e731633396531a39ace75c0d.jpg)A nice view of Olympus Mons, after a burn \u002B aerobraking and a second aerobraking, a circularized low orbit around Mars is finally achieved and the petal adapter served its purpose. The pilot moves in to the MEM because they don\u0027t trust kOS automated scripts done by a lousy coder and would also have to deal with the light speed lag of downloading such scripts from Earth to the MEM computer core. The Skylab is docked directly to the NTR propulsion system. After that, the pilot jettisons the no longer useful docking adapter connected to the MEM and docks it to the Skylab, so the rest of the crew can move in to the MEM for the Mars landing.\n\n![33d0bcbdada38a795d4a06ae0f4d2c50.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/33d0bcbdada38a795d4a06ae0f4d2c50.jpg)Because the MEM has more than enough room for the entire crew of this mission, nobody will stay behind. All crew goes to the MEM, which undocks and uses its Beryllium solid rocket motor to deorbit for landing. Unfortunately mission planning didn\u0027t think about attaching a small nuclear reactor to the MEM, which will limit their time spent on surface.\n\n![f42ef8dce98f7aef81d43935fc1ca2b2.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/f42ef8dce98f7aef81d43935fc1ca2b2.jpg)A ballute and a drogue are used to assist with descent, everything goes well. If it didn\u0027t, they would square their shoulders to the task ahead and persevere.\n\n![351192eb2899ff96725f80422a212c10.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/351192eb2899ff96725f80422a212c10.jpg)For when they raise a flag almost as cool as the flag of a certain brotherhood made of steel and isolationism that survived in a post-apocalyptic Earth, they must be expected to always succeed, even if they don\u0027t have power armor. Research is done for as long as possible.\n\n**What aerobraking with petal adapters saved fuel for and the return:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n![61050a1fba5fd5be102b87054ad42e6c.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/61050a1fba5fd5be102b87054ad42e6c.jpg)\n\nThe ascent stage is about as easy to maneuver as a truck skidding on ice due to its uneven center of mass(adjusting gimbal limits helped a bit), but rendezvous with the Ares goes well, the crew is transferred back and the MEM jettisoned, but there will be a long time yet before a transfer window to Earth happens, so the engines burn towards another destination instead.\n\n![40516d41d2e8992b722bd5707df065f3.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/40516d41d2e8992b722bd5707df065f3.jpg)And a very noteworthy landing happens, noteworthy because it was done using only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, possible thanks to the puny gravity of Phobos, and the entire Ares landed on it, where the entire crew made their first \u0022steps\u0022, barely noticeable. The science officer traveled far with EVA thrusters to collect soil samples from several different biomes, and after some days, the Ares ascended from Phobos using at first only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and burned towards Deimos as well, where the same happened.\n\n![8bbbb94dad2d6ea498743088f9a66c81.jpg](https://anonimag.es/i/8bbbb94dad2d6ea498743088f9a66c81.jpg)14 days on the surface of Mars, a few more on Phobos and Deimos and almost 3 years of space travel. Was it worth it? The fact the lab facilities of the Skylab module were forgotten about in another mistake of mission planning made such question even stronger, but where some things could have been done better, in the end, it was their first interplanetary manned mission, and in one of the intended design goals it succeeded fully. There was enough fuel to almost fully circularize the propulsion system in LEO. Spare fuel from the Apollo CSM also was used to help a little, and in the end the entire Ares established an orbit around Earth with an apoapsis around 990 km before the Apollo CSM undocked and deorbited. The first three who stepped on Mars, Phobos and Deimos finally returned home.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-29T20:37:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2017 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NotTheRealRMS**\n  \nfixed more typos"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T20:38:01Z","Content":"Jup, I didn\u0027t have issues with boiloff either."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T00:08:16Z","Content":"[@NotTheRealRMS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172906-nottherealrms/)   \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E hasn\u0027t been supported since 1.2.2, but there is patch that makes it work 1.3.0/1.3.1 as it\u0027s just the Earth/kerbin naming that was causing issues.\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll try boiloff again sometime."}]}
