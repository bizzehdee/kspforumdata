If you wait until release that shouldn\u0027t be an issue and you can drop it into an existing save without any problems.

Per the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://trello.com/b/SDnjLzmI/scrapyard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScrapYard Trello \u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I am a bit behind schedule. Some IRL stuff came up this week so I didn\u0027t get to spend as much time on things as I wanted, but it\u0027s not a serious set back. I also spent a bunch of time working out some bugs and integrating KCT and SY together. The good news is that KCT and SY are at the point now where they work together, but not every case has been covered (scrapping works\u00A0and even doesn\u0027t count as a \u0022recovery\u0022 so it can be used for ordering parts to put in the inventory, but I haven\u0027t looked at what happens with recovering a vessel to storage). I\u0027m very happy it\u0027s gotten to this point where it\u0027s actually almost a functional thing with only final tweaks and improvements needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne fairly major change is that instead of parts automatically being pulled from the inventory and applied to the vessel on rollout, the inventory is applied within the editor and then the parts are removed upon build (either KCT build or rollout). It may not sound all that different, but it\u0027s a decent sized shift from how the inventory worked previously. It also opens up the option to have a UI that lets you grab specific parts out of the inventory and place them on vessels. For now there\u0027s just a button that will automatically apply the inventory to the vessel in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few known issues that I\u0027m going to try to fix regarding that change. Symmetry is a problem, since if you pick up a part that\u0027s had the inventory applied then all symmetry partners become \u0022fresh\u0022 parts and you have to reapply the inventory if you want them to be inventory parts, which makes it harder to manually define which parts should be new and which should be from the inventory. That will still be an issue (potentially worse even) when it moves to the UI that lets you select individual parts. There\u0027s also an issue where when you build a vessel in KCT the parts in the editor will still appear as if they\u0027re pulled from the inventory, but those parts are already removed from the inventory from the previous build (it makes sense when you see it, basically it\u0027s \u0022cache invalidation\u0022). I\u0027ve got a solution in my head for that, basically to just replace them all with fresh parts whenever the parts are removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main other feature I wanted to have at least partially done by now is a way to define which modules are tracked. That\u0027s not done yet. At this point I wanted to just have the ability for the user to make a list of modules in a config file. That\u0027s ultimately a really crappy way to do it but it\u0027s the way it works internally right now. That causes problems with parts before and after installing/removing a mod being treated differently than before (for instance, if you track tweakscale (true by default)\u00A0and then install it later, suddenly your entire inventory is no longer valid since they don\u0027t have the tweakscale module on them). For the tweakscale problem I\u0027d like to just not track the module if the scale is the same as the default scale, but there\u0027s not a good general way to do that. Also, it might not be a good idea to track every part of a module, but instead just the relevant ones (the current scale for tweakscale, for instance, but if \u0022staging\u0022 is different then that doesn\u0027t make it a different part). Also, the PartUpgrades system is defined by a node within every module that is empty by default. ScrapYard needs to track that inner node for every module but is currently not designed to do so. I don\u0027t want to hard code any exceptions, instead making the system general enough to handle everything in a user-defined way. As such, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to even do the basic \u0022here\u0027s a list of modules you can change\u0022 since that\u0027s just going to be rewritten anyway. The proper way of implementing this system is gonna take a while and I have to figure out exactly how to make it work. For instance, how does a user in a config file say to track the TweakScale module only if the default scale on the node is different from the current scale, but in a general way that also works for other modules? I\u0027ve got ideas for it, but I need to play around with it for a while until I find something that I like that isn\u0027t also a pain to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s my weekly wall-o-text about progress. TL;DR: Slightly behind on the configuration front because I want to do something better from the start regarding module tracking. KCT and ScrapYard are working together now but it\u0027s not finished.

If you need to change launch locations, going into edit of the vessel and selecting the new launch location then saving the edit seems to work fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T22:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223034526\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002262900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493158358\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273338\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, magico13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know, it\u0027s still an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273338\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@magico13\u003C/a\u003E, and wow I even posted underneath that particular one!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit, and ninja\u0027d by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/93167-jeffreycor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002293167\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/93167-jeffreycor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@JeffreyCor\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst I know that your time is precious, would allowing rollouts to other KK launchpads be possibly implemented by KCT, or is it a KK issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-25T22:17:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2017 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by theJesuit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENinja\u0026#039;d\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T22:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223034530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002262900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493158585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022122369\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theJesuit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, theJesuit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273338\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@magico13\u003C/a\u003E, and wow I even posted underneath that particular one!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst I know that your time is precious, would allowing rollouts to other KK launchpads be possibly implemented by KCT, or is it a KK issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an interesting problem. I think it\u0027d have to be fixed in both, though I could maybe fix it KCT side by manually calling functions within KK. So, it used to work great and you could rollout to wherever you wanted and it would launch without issues. Then something changed in a KSP/KK update so that only the current KK launchsite would work correctly and all other ones would catastrophically fail. I did find in my personal testing after the issue first started that as long as you load the KK launchsite once per game session before trying to launch with KCT from the site then it would work for the rest of the game session. So I\u0027d just fire up a simulation at the desired site before actually launching later. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s still the case, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s as difficult as that other post makes it out to be, but again I haven\u0027t tested it in a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to fix it so it isn\u0027t as ridiculous, but I\u0027ve obviously been working on other, arguably more important, stuff lately \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T22:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223034373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002262900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493151460\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002293167\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JeffreyCor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, JeffreyCor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never get anything that makes sense \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Haven\u0027t had a chance to test these independently but at least getting some time to do some things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog from last flight: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/tm0vrjfzfoehhl2/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/tm0vrjfzfoehhl2/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general I\u0027m seeing some unexpected things regarding half of the max building upgrades being set to -1 and half set to 2 (Personally I was seeing them all set to -1 in the editor and 2 in the space center) which I\u0027ll have to add in some code to work around, but I didn\u0027t see anything crazy going on around decoupling.
