Since all the reactors I\u0027m using will be based on Stirling heat engines, they\u0027ll still function with radiators closed, just at a far lower capacity. The 50kW reactor produces up to 250Ec of power (25 kW by my conversion) when opened, and only 15Ec when closed. You can therefore run it closed if you like for fun. They also have slow response times, so it takes a little while for the reactor to ramp up to full capacity or to shut down. I\u0027m not 100% happy with the texture right now, so I\u0027ll be tweaking it somewhat. I also want to have the heatpipes glow a reddish tone when it\u0027s on, so that\u0027ll be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a shot of some stuff in the VAB.

It also seems a bit out-of-whack with the rest of KSP regarding what Ec/s means. The PB-NUK represents something like this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG\u003C/a\u003E which is a 300W RTG, and it produces 0.75 Ec/s. This suggests 1 Ec/s is around half a kilowatt, maybe more when you consider the PB-NUK is 80kg whereas the GPHS-RTG is only 57kg, although that would put it in line with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ALSEP_Apollo_14_RTG.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESNAP-27\u003C/a\u003E which generated 75W and weighed 20kg. Worse, looking at the lights, the huge spotlight that can illuminate the entire KSC at night quite brightly if you point it at it has a power draw of 0.04 Ec/s. That would suggest that 1 Ec/s is well over a kilowatt (there\u0027s no way a 40W bulb is generating that much light), more like 10kW, but maybe the lights are massively OP. In any case, your numbers suggest 1 Ec/s is only about tenth of a kilowatt, which if true, would make the PB-NUK awfully weak for its mass, and the lights in the game utterly ridiculously powerful for 4W bulbs. I\u0027m thinking your balancing is off by an order of magnitude here, give or take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, there really seems no way to reconcile the numbers in the game as currently used -- realistic figures for the lights make the PB-NUK massively OP on its power generation, whereas realistic figures for the PB-NUK make the lights massively OP on their power draw. But going for something somewhere in the middle, say 1 E/s = 1 kW, makes the PB-NUK only a bit OP (it was original 1 E/s and they dropped it to 0.75, they probably should have dropped it to 0.5 if they\u0027re thinking 1E/s=1kW), and the lights, well, still rather ridiculously powerful for 40W bulbs but a lot better than assuming they\u0027re 4W bulbs lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-07T18:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2013 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
