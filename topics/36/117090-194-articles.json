I can de-link the model-name from the GUI name and allow them to be specified separately.  So you would specify name = \u0027whatToDisplayInGUI\u0027 and modelName = \u0027nameOfSSTU\\_MODEL\u0027.\n\nIndeed, have just updated the code to allow for separate \u0027modelName\u0027.  Defaults to whatever the \u0027name\u0027 is if modelName is not specified (so existing configs will not break).  Will be available with the next release (probably this evening)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T15:15:54Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), I\u0027ll drop the log in the github issue for you.\n\nLog uploaded to github."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T15:26:14Z","Content":"I threw an issue in there with a list of the category names (copied from the cfgs) for you."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T15:56:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 38 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), I\u0027ll drop the log in the github issue for you.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Log uploaded to github.\n\u003E \n\nFixed in dev ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 28 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I threw an issue in there with a list of the category names (copied from the cfgs) for you.\n\u003E \n\nAlso fixed in dev code.\n\n^^  That is what including proper information/logs can do -- makes fixing things much faster and less of a guessing game.

You rounded real engines down to about ~41.1% thrust. Seems fine for lifter engines, but it can be a problem for orbital engines. IRL those engines are of course super weak, but in KSP you got a lot shorter orbits and less time for burns. Causes a slight problem in pre-configured lifters, similar to the upper stages.\n\n-------------------\n\nSmall feedback:  I think the orion service module is a bit weak. Only manages 11kn, which is 0.09 t/w (with orion capsule), too weak for anything but long, high orbit interplanetary burns. It\u0027s actually noticeable weaker than the SM\u0027s own forward \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust.\n\nOne way would be to go with more realistic thrust, which is probably about 26.7, since this service module will use leftover Space Shuttles OMS. Would be the realism option.
