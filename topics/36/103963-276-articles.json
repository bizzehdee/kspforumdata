If you have a ton of mods, particularly part mods and you install scatterer, unless you have a good CPU, you can expect awful FPS, even with a 1080ti. While the 1050ti is an ok GPU, it will definitely struggle with a game like KSP, which is not well optimized, and visual mods, on top of the demanding physics of KSP.\n\nif you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, it\u2019s particle system is also pretty taxing. Not much you can do there except disable the volumetric clouds.\n\nyou need to provide us with more information:\n\ncomputer specs (besides the GPU), output log, screenshot of your gamedata folder. You can find a link in my signature that says \u201Chow to get support\u201D click that and come back with the necessary files. \n\nIf you want to try other things, turn off the ocean shaders and the water refraction in the main menu window. Other than that, there isn\u2019t much you can do in reference to scatterer and it\u2019s probably a hardware issue if that doesn\u2019t help out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-13T01:20:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2018 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Voodoo8648","CreatedById":142471,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-13T17:06:11Z","Content":"The ALT \u002B F10/F11 doesn\u0027t seem to work anymore.
