I use HE a lot, but it has seriously screwed things up in multiple versions more than once for me. \n\nI think my new HE methodology will be to install it for a specific purpose (I\u0027ve replaced craft that have automagically vanished before, for example), use it, then remove the mod just in case. \n\nNote also that I considered the idea that the perfect circular obit of HE might have been a problem, so the first thing I did up my HE to orbit was to push the orbit slightly eccentric to avoid any issues that might cause, then I undocked the test craft  to test different docking ports. Kraken happened afterwards with HE, no kraken with it removed.\n\nPS---note the LOL, please.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T22:58:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T22:47:49Z","Content":"Indeed, hyper-edit has some problems with clearing/setting the \u0027landed\u0027 state of craft when they are HE\u0027d into orbit.

That\u0027s not usually possible on the surface without ISRU refueling/large scale mining and processing, but is certainly possible in orbit with a tiny lander and large mothership. Something like the above (a little larger) would be great for taking all of Minmus\u0027 science and processing in a lab in Minmus orbit, over an extended period.
