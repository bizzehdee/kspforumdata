At the most basic, you can make just a fuel tank with a clever spot to attach a stock engine, but in the reference part I\u0027m building the engine into the fuel tank, so it becomes a one-piece solution. It\u0027s up to you how crazy you want to go - you could make a pair of parts that include a descent stage and an ascent stage, or you could integrate landing legs... or rcs jets, or... whatever else you\u0027 want in the piece. It can be as basic or as complicated as your experience allows. It\u0027s also your choice whether you size it to work with the 1.25 or 2.5m lander cans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pics of the reference part I made last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bSFRd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

So, if you\u0027ve ever considered getting into modding, this is a great time to try it out. We WILL vote to choose who has to, err, gets to, host next week, but the contest isn\u0027t the point here - building parts and sharing our process with each other is.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETo help get people started, these first few days I\u0027m going to post my process building the reference part!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESO....

If you do, you\u0027ll understand how to build a part, how to set it up in Unity, how to make an engine work, how to add resources to your part, and how to add an engine fairing that jettisons when the engine decouples.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the first video that shows how I built the model in Blender and did the UV Unwrapping. It\u0027s not a comprehensive Blender tutorial - it assumes that you\u0027ve watched a couple of videos that cover the UI and the basic tools, but it DOES show every step and pretty much mention every click and keypress, so it should be very easy to follow along. I\u0027m NOT AN EXPERT at texturing or UV unwrapping, so don\u0027t take this as a tutorial on how to do that the best possible way, take it for what it is - a tutorial on how to get a basic part built and unwrapped in 25 minutes!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe basic skills you need to do all of this are :\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EDelete the objects that come in the default scene.

Getting some reference source files scrounged together is something I\u0027m going to work on for my other project, the (thus far, useless) modders wiki after the first of the year, because that would have helped me to no end when I first got started. (I STILL can\u0027t make the stock landing gear module work on my models, and I know it\u0027s a Unity Hierarchy problem, and yes I\u0027ve seen the reference image, and yes I\u0027ve read some of Cpt. Kipard\u0027s thread about the skylon gear, but I can get FS to work, so I just use that and stopped fiddling with the stock stuff.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all that said I\u0027ve been giving the format of this challenge some thought. What if, instead of a \u0027part week\u0027 we just made them open challenges. We could get a sticky(either here, or in the modelling and texturing subforum?) that acts as a table of contents to link out to the other threads, and we just make it permanently open - so if a new modder wanders in at anytime, they can pick one, build it, and post it back to the thread? Instead of a weekly challenge it becomes an opensource repository of parts? We can still vote after a week or two to determine who gets to set up the next one, but that wouldn\u0027t mean the challenge was \u0027over\u0027 and the new \u0027winner\u0027 wouldn\u0027t be under the time crunch to do it right away, just within a couple of weeks? That way there\u0027s still incentive to do it when it comes out, but there\u0027s no end to it? Sort of like the challenges in the player sections of the forum - do them whenever you see them, but you may be too late to make the \u0027leaderboard.\u0027 I, of course, recognize that we\u0027re not closing the threads, anyone could come along and do these challenges two months later, but if we set it up that way and get a sticky to encourage people to use the threads that way, it might set the right tone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know this has been a rough week for me to try to host too, because I\u0027m trying to finish a kitchen renovation before family comes at Christmas, and I was trying to get an docking module for RPM pushed out before the .90 release so it could go out with the update (though squad got done a week before I thought they would, so blew that plan out of the water!!! Not that I\u0027m complaining about having .90 out!) What do you guys think?
