Mostly this is due to the fact that I\u0027ve never really thought of a change that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould bring much to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve had that idea now -- and I\u0027m progressing on with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I dive into any specifics, I need to point out that I have never developed any kind of mod before, ever. I\u0027ve not done any 3d modelling, very little programming etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll be a learning experience for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe weakness of the game I\u0027ve identified is this\u003C/span\u003E: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface sampling per biome is a bit of a chore and is boring.

Building on on the fantastic work already done by KospY, Winn75 and zzz in their Kerbal Attatchment System mod, I\u0027d enable the Kerbals to collect these rocks, store them in some sort of Rickshaw or Wheelbarrow, and transfer them to a part on the lander that could store them. On recovery of the spacecraft, the rocks, dependent on size, type and other factors would be converted into science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWhat I have done so far: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have created parts for the dozen most common types of Igneous and Metamorphic rocks and have made them work with the Kerbal Attatchment system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery type can be picked up, rolled, etc. I\u0027ve completed the model for my rickshaw and wheelbarrow (I\u0027m not sure which type would work best yet. It\u0027s a good way to learn blender anyway!) and I\u0027ve completed a Container item to store the rocks. Everything transfers in and out pretty seamlessly.

I\u0027m sure this would be absolutely horrendous on performance though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Secondly, is there any plugin released or in development which can convert recovered parts into science points?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Thirdly, would there be any interest from the community in me releasing this if I can get it to work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Finally, Does anyone have any suggestions that would perhaps make this simpler than I am making it?
