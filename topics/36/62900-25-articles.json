Specifically, if you take a part and scale it up or down, the build time stays the same though the price (displayed by native KSP) changes. I need to do more testing to see if the funds deducted from the account are accurate or not (I was playing in Sandbox). It would be nice if this worked, and Extraplanetary Launchpads seems to be able to account for it, but it doesn\u0027t break anything so perhaps its low priority. One problem I can foresee is integrating it with the parts recovery system. If I build a tiny rocket with scaled down Mainsails to .625m, I shouldn\u0027t get full sized Mainsails in my parts inventory, but adding to the code for the parts inventory to store all the different tweakscale configurations wouldn\u0027t be worth it. So maybe KCT is best left as is. You can build a tiny Mainsail, but it still takes a long time because it is more complex than an LVT45.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, great mod. This is just an annoyance and not a big problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T19:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe costs should be ok (as in you\u0027ll be charged correctly) since that uses the built in KSP system for calculation (and thus will account for fuel and all that, meaning you pay exactly what is displayed). The time calculation is also based on cost, but on the cost of the fully fueled parts (aka, what\u0027s listed as the cost in the editor, or more specifically in the part config file). Tweakscale does pose an interesting problem that I haven\u0027t considered, though. Although tweakscale also basically eliminates the tech tree since everything can be any size (aka, 3.75 meter rockets in the first tech node.) I think it may be best to leave it how it is for now, because otherwise you could build a bunch of tiny parts really fast, then recover them and make them really big and have it build quickly because they\u0027re in the inventory. I may look into Tweakscale to see if there\u0027s anything simple I can do to split parts based on size in the inventory, which would be the best solution, but probably a bit of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Looking into the Module that\u0027s saved to the parts, I could probable get the current scale and save it with the part name in the inventory. I could see an issue with if you didn\u0027t always have tweakscale installed though (aka, added it later or removed it later) since the normal stock parts would be considered different parts. I could work around that by not saving the scale if the current scale == default scale. Definitely doable, and might not be super hard. The only issue is that I would have to change how the total time (well, Build Points) is calculated to not use the costs in the config and instead use the current costs (and all the implications associated with that, such as fuel costs). Honestly, not too hard to do and it shouldn\u0027t make too much of a difference 90% of the time. I\u0027ll do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Except that method of calculating the cost may only work when I have access to a ShipConstruct, which is not true anywhere except in the editor. If I try to make one from a ship ConfigNode then the ghost ships come back, and they are bad. This may be harder than I thought. At the very least I can save them differently, but perhaps not have proper changes to the time. At least not yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit3: Should be able to do it with the confignode of the vessel.

I believe the Getting Started guide covers the upgrade system decently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can spend upgrades in three categories: VAB upgrades, SPH upgrades, and R\u0026amp;D upgrades. VAB and SPH upgrades work the same way: by speeding up build rates or by unlocking additional build rates (meaning you can build multiple things at once). R\u0026amp;D upgrades have two options: Research, which gives you science based on how long a ship takes to build; and Development, which decreases the time that tech nodes take to unlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes a lot more sense when you play with it, but the Getting Started Guide also describes it pretty thoroughly (if I recall correctly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConceivably there shouldn\u0027t be any mod incompatibilities, since this acts very independently of any other mods. There are two cases of mod integration though. If DebRefund is detected then KCT doesn\u0027t perform any of it\u0027s own refunding of funds for dropped stages, but still recovers parts independently (for use in the inventory). If StageRecovery is detected, KCT transfers ALL recovery over to it and receives the percent refunded. From that, it determines whether parts are \u0022too damaged to be used\u0022 and won\u0027t add them to the inventory if they are (basically, if you get refunded 75% (due to landing speed) then there\u0027s a 25% chance that a part will be unusable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe supposed mechjeb issue is questionable, since I really don\u0027t know what was causing the bug that made me think that, I just know that people who have experienced the bug also use mechjeb (but there may be some who don\u0027t). I think that was the camera lockup on simulation bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before I post this I\u0027m gonna guess I got ninja\u0027d \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But that\u0027s ok because I generally do a terrible job at explaining things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Surprisingly I wasn\u0027t this time! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@WololoW It\u0027s too out of scope for KCT, but it doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027d be too hard to write. I don\u0027t have a whole lot of time right now, so I don\u0027t think I could, but someone could put it in the addon suggestions forum. KCT is too close to release and has had so much change of scope that I kind of just want it to stop growing for a little bit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E When I took over I thought this was going to be a small mod and it\u0027s grown to something far more complex then I ever could imagine.

I hadn\u0027t noticed the Getting Started Guide, but I found and read it after I saw your post. It\u0027s very helpful. The upgrade mechanic sounds cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this mod could increase my love for spaceplanes. First, the \u0022simulation\u0022 mode means I can test the heck out of my planes even in a hardcore, no-reload game. Normally I\u0027m very reluctant to like Kerbal lives in such a game, but a simulation mode would let me perfect the design with no risk of loss of life. Second, I assume reusable craft like spaceplanes will have quick build times, yes? If I land a spaceplane back at KSC, all its parts go into inventory, I imagine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u0027m wondering whether your mod anticipates the \u0022Administration\u0022 facility that Squad is constructing.
