You shouldn\u0027t need to do anything with the geometry other than split the screen components into separate models.

If everything was in the same texture I would have to emulate this programmatically in the shaders, which would complicate things and could potentially hurt performance. It will definitely boost the instruction count by quite a bit, though it would require testing to see if the effect is noticeable.

In fact many textures would be used in one pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also the number of draw calls is not that important on modern hardware, due to improvements in graphics APIs and drivers making each call inexpensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T21:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
