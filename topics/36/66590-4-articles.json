I wanted to improve on that and use real world physics and chemistry without adding too much complexity. After looking at a number of options I decided to go with a 2 step solution, which does add a little complexity but also adds a lot of functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step is a Sabatier reactor that turns CO2 \u002B H2 \u002B Electricity into CH4 \u002B H2O. For the mod that means Carbon Dioxide, Hydrogen and Electricity into Liquid fuel and Water. Running just this system gives you drinking water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second step is a Water electrolyzer that turns H2O and Electricity into H2 and O2, so that\u0027s Water and Electric charge into Hydrogen and Oxygen. Running just this reverses the process of the fuel cell, recycles water into Oxygen to breath and along with the Sabatier reactor gives you a closed loop life support system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth systems are used on the ISS and there is a fair amount of documentation for them, making it easy to balance. Having both systems also gives you some additional game play opportunities. For example you can use the fuel cell, resource tanks and electrolyzer to act like a large battery.
