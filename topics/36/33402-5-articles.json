Is it good that you can make new planets? Does Squad care if users make new planets? How easy should it be?\u003Cp\u003EI think its good, assuming Squad doesn\u0027t mind. I have yet to hear anything. But if they said \u0022hold off\u0022 I would without hesitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how easy it should be... Well, who cares what you do inside your own game. And nobody can make you install a crap plugin. But from my poking around I have realized that it is much harder to make a good planet than you would think. And to make something that isnt a complete mess you need need to get the orbit right and the mass and the SOI all the other little things that seem minor until thing go boom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming I get it working I would probably release a simple proof of concept planet and the code.
