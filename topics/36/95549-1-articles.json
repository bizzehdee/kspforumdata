Before you answer the primary question, maybe you could help me out with some tips as far as how to use the Forum search Engine? That would be helpful and I hate asking questions like these when I have to assume I am not the only one trying to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAYS. I\u0027d like to integrate my own resources into the game. I\u0027ve done it before but that was almost a year ago, so I don\u0027t remember much about it and I\u0027m worried that what little I do remember is out of date/ won\u0027t work with 0.90.

I\u0027m not going to use a resource generator plugin to randomly produce resources on bodies, I just want to choose an already existing part and edit it with a generator module to produce a resource. I remember most of what it takes to do this, and I have a good enough head to read and compare already existing parts to create what I want, but there are still some things that I could use help with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it possible to create a generator module that requires the presences of two resources within the vessel to create one new resource? That\u0027s to say that, if one of the resources are not available, the generator will not work. The Closest thing I can think of is a Jet Engine, however, I don\u0027t need it too produce thrust.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s actually the only question I can think of regarding Part Editing right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could help me find a thread, find a guide, or just flat out answer my questions, I would really appreciate it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a sticky in this very section that people somehow miss.
