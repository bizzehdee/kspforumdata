It\u0027s about genius-level things like procedural quad surface that generates planetary surfaces getting mixed with outright insanity like the load-all-assets-into-memory-and-keep-them-there, which gets players craving for a 64 bit version that simply shouldn\u0027t be needed. Before 0.23, it would be a problem easy to fix. Do not load textures up until they are actually required by parts that are present in the scene. Unload them if they aren\u0027t. Unity does this natively to assets packaged in asset files, without even asking anyone. KSP maintains it\u0027s own assets for parts and does no such thing. It also has to keep all textures in memory and load them all at, once so that every part can be shown in the editor. Ok, that can be optimized later, right? Render the part into an icon cache of some kind, load it only once the player actually puts it onto the ship, easy. But in 0.23, they just had to introduce the cool spinning model into the tooltip, and now it just can\u0027t be done quite so easily, a change that could be dealt with in a day will now chew up weeks of someone\u0027s time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is such a thing as starting to optimize too late, there is such a thing as not paying attention to where you\u0027re coding to.

I have seen companies fall to hubris before, only to end up in obscurity, and I do not want to see another one do so -- and in my observations, it starts happening when they make something genuinely cool, and then believe they got it good enough, when fans, who got rabid and uncritical for some reason, start trampling down people who find actual, real flaws in it.
