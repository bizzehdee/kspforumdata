Does it have anything to do with a Light map?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the seam lines between the Cockpit, SAS, and Cargo Bay segments. Although these pieces are separate, I\u0027m hoping that seam won\u0027t be visible in-game.

I was able to assign textures and look at the components, but aside from that, I\u0027ve no clue what to do. Also it seems I can no longer find the Max script that lets me read the position of a Vertex so I can jot them down for attachment node purposes in the .cfg file. I think I might go as far as the FBX portion, and then turning it in to someone in the modding community with lots of experience getting models like this into KSP.
