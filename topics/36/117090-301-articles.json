(sadly, issue tickets are the only way I\u0027ll keep track of all the stuff going on in my mods... no ticket = no fix, as there is no way to keep track it of it all).\n\nOhh.. one other neat feature on that MUS -- there should be a button for \u0027toggle upper interstage node\u0027 or similar -- it will enable a node positioned inside the tank where the cylinder wall gives way to the dome -- with that, you can sit the SM directly onto the MUS (or rather, put the decoupler on the MUS upper-interstage-node, and then the SM on top of that).
