Then turn on the reactor (using a tiny molten salt or scraps of microwave power if it\u0027s fusion) in the new planet soi, use it to power your capture and circularization burn. Now turn it back off until the next ship enters soi, then fire it up as transmitter. Later antimatter reactors can be parked in van allen belt and left on. Also I find 100GW is often more than you need in a system, even 30 or so is plenty to power most regular stuff if you don\u0027t mind a longish burn for big payloads. More than that you have to carry a ton of radiators or turn receivers on for short burns only. Turning down receivers is also helpful, especially the new omni receiver.

I see today\u0027s update reduced the wasteheat generation, but that seems to be the key to it. Unfortunately I started using the VASIMR engines and I\u0027m having an even more odd problem with them - I have my craft perfectly balanced with CoT through CoM. In vacuum where I don\u0027t have aerodynamic stability, my spaceplane will want to pitch up when I apply more than about 50% throttle - so much so that even my advanced hydrazine-powered RCS thrusters (pushing thrusterpower 15 each) can\u0027t keep it from pitching up and over. It does not happen with other engines placed in the same way. It does not matter if I have the engine gimbals locked or freed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current test craft has VASIMR engines pointed both forward and back. If I have the main rear-firing engines burning, it wants to pitch up. If I have the retro forward-firing engines burning, it wants to pitch down - I suppose it\u0027s consistent but it seems like the engines aren\u0027t firing \u0022straight\u0022 - like there\u0027s some kind of offset angle to the way they produce thrust. At least, that\u0027s the best way I can describe it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems that these engines don\u0027t draw fuel evenly. If I don\u0027t use TAC fuel balancer to balance my hydrazine tanks, the 2 engines will pull fuel at different rates from the tanks on either side of the plane, causing the CoM to shift to one side or another and induce yaw under thrust - this can be solved with the fuel balancer, but the aforementioned pitch issue cannot, as all the tanks are in the same plane as the spaceplane\u0027s wings (pardon the pun) and fuel never shifts vertically within the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing - \u0022toggle propellant\u0022 seems to do nothing in flight. I thought I heard/saw somewhere that VASIMR engines would work on quantum vacuum, but when I click the \u0027toggle propellant\u0027 button, it\u0027ll only let me use hydrazine or liquidfuel - possibly others were I carrying them, but quantum vacuum doesn\u0027t seem to show up. Except one time when I forgot to put any antimatter fuel in the craft - that seems like it wouldn\u0027t be related, but it did show the ability to toggle quantumvacuum then... so I\u0027m a tad confused by these engines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T05:55:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ss8913\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded bit about the \u0026#039;toggle propellant\u0026#039;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T06:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the dry mass might be a bit light, as actually has a better mass ratio than a plain water tank \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
