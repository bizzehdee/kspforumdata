I\u0027ve decided to knock this out as both an open API, and also just for fun, to do an offshoot of Hollow Asteroids that lets you mine massive storage spaces in the crust of a planet or moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works by attaching resource \u0027ports\u0027 to a \u0027tank\u0027 that has a definition of both available and mazimum capacity (i.e. as you mine it out). These can then be tweaked, expanding and contracting the space allocated to each port relative to the tank\u0027s overall capacity (visualize a barrel filled with a handful of large balloons - as you contract a balloon, it changes the available space for other baloons to expand into).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso looking at how to use the same concept to let the user create dynamic IVS-enabled caverns or wet workspaces based on used capacity (Just don\u0027t fill it back up with LFO with Jeb inside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObligatory screenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bV0iFmG.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022bV0iFmG.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a central tank with a dozen compartments, and three \u0027ports\u0027 attached.

Attach a port, allocate storage space, and begin filling it. Now, here\u0027s the fun part. Because I also have the Proximity Logistics module from MKS, you could have ships land nearby, dip a part into the ground, and transfer in the resources without having to be connected (i.e. by using KAS, docking ports, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T12:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking great, I look forward to seeing this in MKS.
