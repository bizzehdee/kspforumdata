However I agree that it needs an upgrade. Clicking next weapon to scroll through a list isn\u0027t very helpful In my opinion. I\u0027m not sure what the coding required would be but if there was toolbar integration with a GUI listing each weapon and its status that could be dragged anywhere on the screen like the menus in mods like Mech Jeb or FAR that would be Ideal IMO. That way it\u0027d be easier to select exactly which weapon you want and better to find in the first place\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, that makes a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I play only with joysticks I didn\u0027t notice that you cannot manually select the guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s a good idea to add that, either using stock or modded toolbar, given that with those you can close the window when not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be interesting if on such toolbar the selected gun was highlighted, so it also has a use for joystick users, if they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T17:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027ve noticed many scattered posts of people who have created extra content for this mod what about giving them a section on the main thread to link to their parts.
