Another forum member is (was?) working on a couple probe core bus systems.\n\nHowever there are several other things planned ahead of the satellites/probes (station parts mostly), and I wouldn\u0027t expect to see them for at least a few months (unless said forum member surprises me with some models).\n\nOn the note of ModelSwitching -- wow.  Complex... but capable.  \n\nIt is graph/tree based.  Parent -\u003E child -\u003E more children -\u003E etc.  Each parent may have multiple children; each child may have its own children.  Each model defines \u0027model nodes\u0027 where the children are positioned.  Unused \u0027model nodes\u0027 may optionally be exposed as attach nodes on the part.  It all integrates with VolumeContainer to dynamically update the resources/volumes available as models are changed; with support for multiple containers, fuel presets... all those other goodies.  \n\nIf you wanted to take the time to setup the config for it you could nearly build entire rockets with it... with swappable components ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) (single-stage rockets at least).  Essentially I\u0027ve replicated a bit of how vessels are constructed in the editor; though the parts available are limited by config, and positions/orientations are pre-defined.\n\nCombine all that with the upcoming ModuleSwitch stuff (not even started yet) and the VolumeContainer resource system, and you\u0027ve got one very powerful system for setting up modular parts.  It is generic enough that I could almost move the MFT parts over to use it (it lacks/will not have fairing integration though).\n\nAs I do not yet have a real use-case for some of the more advanced functionality I\u0027ll likely be including a \u0027test part\u0027 that is setup with random models to verify the setup and those functions.\n\nShould have an updated testing release here in a few hours; mostly just bug-fixes.. but a lot of them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  No clue if the models-switch test part(s) will be available... still working on the module a bit; we\u0027ll see how it goes."},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T16:10:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/21/2016 at 10:58 AM, GoldForest said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Saturn V was actually supposed to receive moar boosters.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![Saturn_V_upgrades.jpg](http://www.daviddarling.info/images2/Saturn_V_upgrades.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Check these out.

Going to do a bit more testing to try and narrow it down more... but for now I would have to recommend against using HE (BETA-3 version for 1.1)."}]}
