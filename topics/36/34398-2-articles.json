So far I\u0027ve re-textured pretty much everything, redid some of the models, added more seats, and learned a whole bunch of stuff that will be useful for future additions. All I have left to do is do a quick bug-checking session(like half an hour), reposition the IVA so you can look out the window properly, and maybe add some hanging tubes. Then I will release it, hopefully tonight, but maybe tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot of a semi-new version, it doesn\u0027t have all the Kerbals in it though. The Time roter will be more blue once I\u0027m finished. After this is done I think I\u0027d like to do another project instead of another IVA, because they get kind of boring after awhile. I\u0027m thinking of doing either a retro style UFO, or some custom Starship. I\u0027ve just kind of had enough restrictions for awhile and I want to do something that doesn\u0027t have to look like somethingelse , which all of my work has had to have been so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D1d2WGW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022D1d2WGW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
