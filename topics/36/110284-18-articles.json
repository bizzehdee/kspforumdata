The difficulty here revolves around the resources that you keep track of, which is reflected by the mod you have installed.\n\nPathfinder will adjust to all three situations; the greenhouse will consume different resources to produce Food than it does for Snacks, but it\u0027s purely decorative when you have no life support installed. With both Snacks and TAC-LS, the greenhouse will produce Food/Snacks after 90 days, with time reduced if you have a skilled scientist in the module. With Snacks, you can produce Snacks from Ore in the Doc Commercial Science Lab, which is exactly how Snacks itself works, but it\u0027s (hopefully) cheaper to use the greenhouse. With TAC-LS, the Watney Chemistry Lab can split water to produce Oxygen. The Pigpen can clean your WasteWater and turn Waste into Organics for the greenhouse, while the greenhouse consumes CarbonDioxide as it grows Food. The system is not 100% closed loop with either Snacks or TAC-LS; you\u0027ll need to drill for resources to get the inputs you need, but you\u0027ll have no dependencies on Kerbin other than the kerbals that provide efficiency bonuses and who set everything up.\n\nGiven the three difficulty levels mentioned above for life support, I have no plans to add in USI-LS at this time."},{"CreatedByName":"Der Kosmos","CreatedById":7632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T22:37:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Releasing a Ponderosa from the muncrete slab is not something I considered and not recommended if you have other parts attached to the habitat.

It is based upon NASA\u0027s real-world Multi-mission Modular Space Exploration vehicle (MMSEV). Just like the NASA vehicle, the Buffalo can be configured as a rover, but it doesn\u0027t stop there. (Coming Soon!) The Buffalo can become an asteroid exploration craft, a munar lander, a cargo hauler, and more. This initial offering provides the components needed to build the \u0022space truck\u0022 version of the Buffalo; future versions will offer in-space functionality. The best thing is that the Buffalo can be assembled by an engineer via KIS, and the vehicle is sized to fit into a standard 3.75m cargo bay!\n\nThe Buffalo components include:\n\n**Buffalo Command Cab:** A command pod that seats two kerbals, with Stock IVA and ASET Props/Avionics-based IVA (highly recommended). It also has integrated ladders.\n\n**Buffalo Crew Cab:** A crew cabin that seats two kerbals, also with IVA. It also has a rooftop solar panel.\n\n**Buffalo Wagon:** A.K.A. the Wagon, this Buffalo Storage Container holds lots of resources when deployed. It is a semi-rigid container that is shaped like the Crew Cab, and it too has solar panels on its roof.\n\n**Chassis (1u):** The chassis serves as the foundation for the Buffalo. It is sized to the same length and width of a KIS standard SM-62 storage container/Buckboard/Ponderosa. While it is initialy configured as a battery, the Chassis can store a variety of different resources once converted to storage.\n\n**Chassis (2u):** Same as above, but it\u0027s twice as long.\n\n**Standard Flatbed (1u):** Sized to be as wide as the Buffalo cabin, the flatbed is sized to hold 2 SM-62 containers/Buckboards/Ponderosas. While it takes an engineer to mount the flatbed onto a chassis, anybody can put cargo on the flatbed.\n\n**Standard Flatbed (2u):** Same as above, but twice as long.\n\n**Wide Flatbed (1u):** A wider version than the standard flatbed, the wide flatbed can hold 3 SM-62 containers/Buckboards/Ponderosas. It is sized to fit in a standard 3.75m cargo bay.\n\n**Wide Flatbed (2u):** Same as above, but twice as long.\n\n**Trailer Hitch:** This specialized \u0022docking port\u0022 is used to connect trucks and trailers together. It also has an integrated ladder.\n\n**Chassis Decoupler:** For those times when you need to mount a Buffalo to a rocket, the chassis decoupler fits the bill.\n\n**Interim Wheel:** Based on the RoveMate M1, the Interim Wheel provides ground transportation while we wait for KSP 1.1 and its better wheel system.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue with the stack node on the Mineshaft. Now you can use it to close the gap between Buffalo modules separated by trailer hitches!\n\nPersonal Note:\n\nThis release marks a major milestone for Pathfinder; it\u0027s reached beta! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) There\u0027s more work to do but I\u0027ve finally completed my initial vision for the mod.
