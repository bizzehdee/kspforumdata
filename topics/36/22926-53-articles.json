Regarding cargo bays: How about versions of all of the bays you already have, except the doors open in a more low-profile fashion, i.e. popping open slightly, and then the doors slide down INSIDE the bay, along the side walls. This would allow more freedom to attach parts to the outside surfaces, at the expense of a slight reduction in interior space. :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a. Also, perhaps a selection of bays designed to open on the side (yes, I know, they can be rotated). I mean that instead of 2 doors that open wide, make it one single door that opens out to become a ramp (the inside face of the door being designed to be flat and smooth so as to function as a ramp), with the floor of the bay being on the \u0027side\u0027 where the hinge is. This would allow a ship to land, and then the bay door opens out to touch the ground so that a rover can drive directly in and out. I see this as being most useful in 2x2, 4x2, and 4x4 sized bays, with the door on the 4x2 being on the short \u00272\u0027 side. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Ooh, for that matter, maybe some bays with a door/ramp on one END! Or, even better, just make a hinged door with extending ramp that can attach to the end of a current cargo bay or even the \u0027engine fairing\u0027 parts. Although, it would be better to have a dedicated part with a flat floor, IMO. Basically just a hull section without ends, a tube. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Once again, I\u0027m seeing this as being most useful in 2x2 and 4x2 sizes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Also, I\u0027m always looking for more and better cockpits and command pods. How about a new series of more sci-fi-ish parts, designed to look like SPACESHIP cockpits? Much like your first and second series of pods, but with some new and varied designs. Perhaps something for the 2x2 hull shape? Or maybe a new 4x2 horizontal design. Yes, there\u0027s the 4x2 Hog cockpit, but it\u0027s kind of... well, plain, and to me it really only looks good as a rover cockpit. And I don\u0027t mean just rescaling the smaller 2x1 and 1x1 parts, I could do that myself if I wanted to. Anyway, sorry if I seem demanding, I\u0027m just trying to make my point. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finally, we (I) can always use more adapter parts, especially now that you\u0027ve introduced new hull sizes. 1x3, 1x4, 2x2, and apparently a 2x6 fuel tank that says in the description that it \u0027fits the 2x6 hull part\u0027, of which there is no such thing as far as I can tell. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So, like I said, all sorts of adapters to blend all of these various new pieces/parts together would always be welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, anyway, all of the above are requests, and/or food for thought, whichever you prefer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E As always, I look forward to whatever you come up with next, my friend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, Lack. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T01:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I ask a question on cargo bays/rover bay?
