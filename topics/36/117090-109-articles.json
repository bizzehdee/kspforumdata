Have already reported the problem, and verified that it exists on stock parts (try setting the LV-N as root part, launch, and try using the map...).\n\nThis kills pretty much all of my parts as most of them use dynamic drag cubes;  anything with fairings, any modular part, any resizable part... pretty much all of them.  You can\u0027t have a command-pod as the root part (as they have fairings)... yah... good times....\n\nAnother issue keeping me from updating is that root parts that use IMassModifier are having the GetModuleMass method called on them before they are initialized;  this renders it impossible to use any dynamic part as the root part, as the mass will always be incorrect in flight scene and/or it will crash with a null-ref.  Will be submitting a bug report on this one soon... need a bit more testing and verification.  \n\nSo.. will be waiting until these issue is fixed in stock before releasing a 1.1 version; the mod cannot function with those bugs.  If they are not fixed, there will be no 1.1 version ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T16:58:18Z","Content":"I knew it was going to be botched up by squad judging by all the problems they had when they did the devnotes. So half a step forward, 15 back. \n\nSorry to hear this Mage, seems like they went out of their way to making modding harder.\n\nIf there is no SSTU, then I will stop playing KSP all together as the stock game is unbearable. This is a testament to your mod Mage, not an ultimatum. I just don\u0027t find KSP worth playing without it. Not even mentioning all the brainwashed groupies that think rubber ... is the norm for flight behavior.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T17:06:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T17:07:28Z","Content":"I\u0027d give it some time, they have made it clear that modding is something they support, and this update sort of breaks everything."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T17:10:08Z","Content":"Not necessarily that they\u0027ve made anything harder, in fact they fixed quite a few problems that I had to previously hack around ungracefully (highlighting, gimbals, thrust curves, multi-engine-module setups); its just that they introduced a few new bugs that absolutely break my parts.  A few other mods are going to run into issues with them as well eventually (P-fairings, P-parts, P-wings, perhaps tweakscale?).\n\nThe drag-cubes issue I believe will be fixed; it effects quite a few stock parts if they are used as root.  Will also effect other mods as listed above.  Already have a bug-report open regarding it (or rather, found an already open one on the issue and added more relevant data and details)... so hopefully they\u0027ll get this fixed up in the next day or two.\n\nThe IMassModifier issues I might be able to work around in one manner or another; am investigating things now and they -might- not completely break the flight-scene as long as i can cache the most recently calculated mass value (doable; should probably cache it anyway)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T17:11:19Z","Content":"Have you seen this tool sarbian made:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135726-11-debugstuff-see-the-hidden-secrets-of-your-parts/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T17:14:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Have you seen this tool sarbian made:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135726-11-debugstuff-see-the-hidden-secrets-of-your-parts/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\nI had seen the screenshots of his version from experimentals, but was unaware he had cleaned up and posted a public version.
