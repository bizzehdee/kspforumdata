I\u0027m not entirely sure what it is but I also want to make sure that it doesn\u0027t happen with the revamp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, well, it\u0027s not really a PROBLEM, per se. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But I\u0027m guessing that when you were modeling the engine pods and putting them in position on the capsule, you did so \u0027by eye\u0027, and not necessarily with any kind of mirror symmetry or geometric positioning, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the Rodan head on, like it\u0027s coming straight at you, you\u0027ll see that each of the four engine fairings intersect the main capsule in slightly different places, and all of them are at a slight angle to the axis of the capsule. This is most easily noticed by the fact that, on one side, one of the fairings comes right up to the edge of the window, almost intruding into the window itself a little bit. But on the other side, there\u0027s a bit of a flat area of hull between the edge of the window and where the edge of the engine fairing is. Another visual cue is seen when you look at the \u0027tips\u0027 of the fairings, where they intersect the pod up by the nosecone. If they were symmetrical, the front edge of each fairing would be a straight line where it meets the hull, and they would all be the exact same length. But currently the intersections are all at an angle, and they all end at slightly different points in \u0027Z\u0027, if in fact the lengthwise axis of the pod is defined as \u0027Z\u0027, that is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Finally, these visual misalignments carry over to the thrust transforms, because if you place the box-stock Rodan in the editor with NO other parts added, RCSBuildAid will show that the combined thrust vectors of all four engines, the center of thrust, is not aligned with the capsule\u0027s center of mass. There is a net torque of 1.xxx kn/m (I don\u0027t recall exactly the number, I\u0027m not at my computer, but I know it\u0027s greater than 1 kilo newton-meter. I think it\u0027s 1.2 something). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s not that the center of mass is out of alignment, because if you place four RCS thrusters in radial symmetry on the capsule and check your \u0027forward\u0027 or \u0027back\u0027 translation vectors, there\u0027s no torque at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, again, the reaction wheels can compensate for the thrust torque, at least they do fine when I \u0027TweakableEverything\u0027 them to double the default torque, 30 as opposed to 15. And this is when using MechJeb as autopilot, I haven\u0027t tried just using the stock SAS and flying manually (why would I want to do that?). But the torque isn\u0027t huge in any event, so the pod is still totally serviceable as-is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyway, I hope this helps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.

Not really sure why it is wobbly, I would recommend KJR though. I\u0027ll take a look at what might be causing the slowdown, I didn\u0027t seem to see any slowdown but it might be some extra faces. Did not notice that one, easy fix.
