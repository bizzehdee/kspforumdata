It means you need MORE lh2 for every unit of oxygen, which means even bigger tanks, which results in even worse tank mass fraction.  And as engines rely on the \u0027mass\u0027 of the propellants, you are using even more volume per-mass-unit -- more flow rates / volume of fuel per second for the same mass of propellant moving through the engine.  (That is all a very gross simplification, but enough to outline the effects of the balance change)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T19:11:17Z","Content":"LH is a lot lighter, so despite having huge tanks (current setup), the craft is still lighter in total (less oxidizer needed), giving more TWR and more dV.

Even if you use the same -mass- of the vessel, it will be worse, as more of that mass will be tankage/dry mass with the now even-larger lh2 tanks.  Once again, dV is based on useful propellant mass, and with less useful propellant mass, your dV decreases.\n\na 5m x 5m tank at 10:1 results in a total fuel mass of:  31.7t  with a dry mass of: 5t (arbitrarily chosen), results in a tank mass fraction of: 0.1577287066246057\n\na 5m x 5m tank at 15:1 results in a total fuel mass of:  23.8t  with a dry mass of: 5t (arbitrarily chosen), results in a tank mass fraction of: 0.2100840336134454\n\nAt a set ISP (will use 445 for example), this results in dV for the theoretical single stage of:\n\n10:1 -- 8710.834688\n\n15:1 -- 7647.763763\n\nEdit:  I\u0027m not trying to say which is better for balance -- merely pointing out that there is no logical way that the change in ratio will increase performance.\n\nFurther Edit:  Will run some tests with a set tankage mass fraction (e.g. tankage mass based on propellant mass rather than volume), but I\u0027m betting the results will be very similar.\n\nEdit:\n\nApparently if the tankage mass-fraction is constant (which... it is not in real life as far as I know; tankage fraction is higher for LH2 than it is for RP1, due to the necessity for the tank to support its own weight, larger tanks = more structural weight), there is zero net change in dV for a given vessel.\n\nNumbers for constant mass-fraction setup for a 5x5m tank (0.15 mass fraction):\n\n10:1 - 5.595 dry, 37.3 fuel, 42.889t total - 8900.970334 dV @ 455 ISP\n\n15:1 - 4.195 dry, 28.0 fuel, 32.167t total -- 8900.970334 dV @ 455 ISP\n\nSo.. depending upon how the tankage mass is balanced, there may be no change to vessel dV, but generally (and realistically), the dV will decrease as the F:O ratio increases (ignoring actual consumption ratios and how those effect efficiency, as those are not simulated at all in KSP).  From my research yesterday, the changing of the propellant ratios can actually have a very noticeable impact on ISP, and there are different \u0027ideal\u0027 ratios for sea-level and vacuum (ideal for a given engine design, can change for a different engine).\n\nFurther edit:\n\nThis really would need a study of the vessel as a whole; because as Jimbodiah points out, the higher LH2 ratio tank ends up being lighter for the same DV (at a fixed mass ratio), but that is all without accounting for any payload (and a theoretical 0-mass engine), nor accounting for the increased performance / freed up payload capacity of the lower stages from the lighter upper stage.  So my examples are likely not directly applicable as to how it would play out in game / in use.\n\nAhh... rocket science... such fun ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  (yes, I even enjoy the math/science end of it a bit too).\n\nEither way, I\u0027ve already swapped the LH2 patch over to a 15:1 ratio, however I do not believe it will change the resources on already in-flight fuel tanks (old engines will have the new ratio, just not old tanks).  This would apply to any saved craft as well;  for the MFTs / upper stages, it should be as easy as switching fuel types in the editor to fix it.  This change will be available with the next update, likely Saturday.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T01:06:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T22:36:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The main reason I\u0027ve done NASA engines so far -- those are the only engines I can find detailed schematics for, such as: [http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/F-1_DWG.gif](http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/F-1_DWG.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Those detailed diagrams are the only thing that has allowed me to make reasonable engine models.

Checkers will not work due to the mismatched horizontal/vertical scaling, neither will normal maps (at least not generically, esp. for resizable fairings with different top/bottom diameters).  Note that I mentioned that \u0027very specific laid out textures, for specific fairing configurations\u0027;  Not everything will work for every fairing.\n\nEven if you wanted specific textures for a single specific fairing, there is still no way for checkers or normal maps to work without distortion due to how the fairings can change their radius/height/etc.  The only time you could use a specially designed fairing texture with normals or horizontal stripes would be if you disabled the ability to change the size of the fairing completely.  Static mesh = easy to make proper textures for.  Dynamic mesh = good luck, not happening...\n\nBasically, the ONLY kind of texture that would be cleanly supported for generic fairing use would be wide vertical stripes (in even divisors of the # of cylinder sides; so 2, 4, 8, or 12 stripes only), and even then edges of the stripes HAVE to run exactly down the UV seams or they will result in ugly distortion when radius are scaled differently.  For this reason normal-mapped stringers will -not- work, as they cannot all run down the UV seams, and any not on the seams will get some really ugly distortion (unacceptable for me anyway)..... this is all why I didn\u0027t want to get into custom fairing textures in the first place... very very few people understand the difficulty of UV mapping a dynamic mesh, and what that means regarding what textures can be used due to the limitations brought about by the UV mapping.\n\nOnce again, I have to go back to -- you are free to try out this stuff yourself (and see how badly it turns out), but I\u0027m not going to spend my time on it, as I already know how bad it will look (and I consider how it would look to be unacceptable; texture distortion makes me (mentally) ill when I look at it)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T16:18:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I might have seen it wrong, but I remember seeing it having 6 maneuverability dashes in the shipyard, more maneuverable than my Viper Mk IV (bought for the Millenium Falcon style ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)), that\u0027s for sure...  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m using eddb to get me some profitable routes, like netting 3500 credit for each ton hauled in a loop route, so if I make a round trip hauling 200ton of each indicated goods I will net 700k after doing just a 10 to 15 minute A-\u003EB-\u003EA route, if I really work towards it I might have it this weekend ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) but since last weekend I raged because I got killed by a diamondback on my T6 and lost a few millions (insurance and goods) and raged it on my cat I\u0027m taking it a lot slower and less ragefully ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E another reason for me to seek a python is that I\u0027m really tired of being interdicted by any NPC (got interdicted in my T7 by a sidewinder threatening to kill me, like.. wth...), I\u0027m looking forward to having a ship able to haul like the T-7 but kill ***\u003Cu\u003Ealmost\u003C/u\u003E*** everyone who dreams of interdicting me ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E plus, it looks like a micro-star destroyer, it\u0027s win-win... if only I could get a Vader costume when they launch the customizable characters... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nHeh, it used to -actually- turn like a cobra, not just say it on its stat-sheet, and could nearly keep up with it speed wise... none of this 240m/s stuff.  And the shields used to be about 2x what an anaconda had, IIRC.  It was a beautiful and deadly craft.  However, I only played in solo mode (I refuse to play games/on servers with non-consensual PVP; I don\u0027t play to try and compete with no-lifers, I play to have fun, not aggravation), and as such, even in trading ships (t6/t7), interdictions were merely an inconvenience and loss of time; there was never any real danger of being destroyed (even if a conda interdicted my t6, it was just boost-boost-boost-wait-jump, rarely would I even get hit).\n\nBut... anyhow.. yah, the python is quite a nice trading ship even in its current form.  Def sturdy enough to take a few hits while you spool up the FSD, and if you don\u0027t mind the extra mass, you can even put a few guns on it and have some teeth of your own.  Thing will chew through Cobras and anything smaller in about 2 energy bars worth of lazering; poor little sidewinders pretty much just go \u0027pop\u0027 when you turn the guns on them (of course, I liked lots of beam lasers, with MC\u0027s for backup/sniping... beams melt things really well).\n\nOne other decent alternative for a T6 is running rare-goods.  Not sure if it is still as hot as it was, but I was able to pull in ~5 mil for about a 1 hour rares loop (in a T6!).  Was a -ton- of traveling, and I could only do it once or twice before I got burned out on the traveling... but it was a good swap from the normal station-\u003Estation trading.\n\nAhh...

The game is quite beautiful, though it takes quite a bit of horsepower to make it playable while looking good.  Game play is fairly immersive, and the things they have implemented have been done fairly well (aside from the \u0027airplanes in space\u0027 flight model... bleh).

If you want to upgrade to a new ship you have to spend time... a lot of time... either doing combat/missions or doing trading runs.  Combat is fun for a bit, and even trading can have its moments.
