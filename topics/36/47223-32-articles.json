Stock KSP doesn\u0027t seem to care about heating up cryogenic and/or manned spacecraft to furnace temperatures without any sort of consequence, and as such, making the entire vessel a giant radiator is pretty much the default behavior. You\u0027ll recall me voicing my great disappointment about this before, Nertea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile in prior versions of KSP and Near Future electrical, we had something that could pretend to be active cooling. Heat was directly funneled into the dedicated radiators, the rest of the spacecraft was undisturbed. I would much prefer this option. I spent some time mulling this over in my head, and I came up with the following example idea for an active/dedicated cooling system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A radiator which surface attaches to a part will reduce that part\u0027s positive internal flux by up to x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The radiator instead gains x internal flux itself, and it possesses the thermal properties necessary to radiate it away safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bonus improvement: the value of x, and therefore the upperceiling on radiator performance, can once again be set directly and displayed comfortably in the VAB, which greatly eases balancing and improves usability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The radiator could still be used passively on parts which do not have positive internal flux; useful if the part in question is next to something that produces heat but doesn\u0027t allow surface attachment (hello LV-N!). It would follow all the normal rules of stock thermodynamics in that case; there\u0027s no extra code required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with that in mind, imagine making the nuclear reactor itself a thermal insulator with near zero heat conductivity. Flavor it something like \u0022the heavy radiation shielding prevents most heat exchange with neighboring parts\u0022. Suddenly, you need the active radiators attached to the reactor to keep it from meltdown - and at the same time, you prevent people from using giant cryogenic tanks as radiators.

Now in KSP such a system can pass because there\u0027s underlying potential for modders to expand on it, the debug menu is pretty much a regular gameplay feature and the community is slightly masochistic (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E), but in any other game this absolutely wouldn\u0027t fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, adding additional complexity to an already obscure system is a bad idea.

Something being realistic has absolutely no connection to how well it plays. Much rather, something being \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E has a direct connection to how well it plays. Sometimes the two overlap, because realistic things tend to be believable by default because we are so familiar with them from real life. And sometimes the two don\u0027t overlap, for one of two reasons. One, the feature in question doesn\u0027t transition well from concept to ingame representation due to limitations in control scheme, the ability to display information, or due to being disruptive to other gameplay elements. It ends up frustrating the player and feeling wrong, in the way, unusable, not believable. The other reason is that we might simply expect something else - either from simply knowing nothing about the topic, or from being used to seeing it handled a certain different way. Great example came from Notch (of Minecraft fame) when he was tinkering with 0x10c, a first person space survival sandbox which he later dropped due to dissatisfaction. He was dead set on simulating physics as realistically as possible. He started with the character\u0027s movements. As soon as he had modeled jumping according to all the laws of physics, he discovered that he hated it. Not only that, but his testers also hated it. It didn\u0027t feel right. It wasn\u0027t what they expected jumping to feel like in a game. It wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E. It made for poor gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not to say you can\u0027t make unexpected realism feel believable. A great example of this is orbital mechanics in KSP. It goes against everything we are trained to believe by popular media and games about how spacecraft are supposed to move - and it\u0027s complex to boot. It should kill believability dead. But it doesn\u0027t, because it\u0027s implemented in a way that is completely seamless with all other mechanics, is extremely controllable, gets by with very little information display and promotes visual learning to an impressive degree. The player is easily able to shed all their preconceived notions about spacecraft movement and accept this new method as believable because it is immediately obvious that this is how it should be, and controlling it feels \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E. The novelty factor also helps it a great deal, and it exposes a lot of depth for its complexity investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the heating system has none of that. No matter how realistic it might be (and it still derps in some areas, if you look into it), it fails to take the player along for the ride. In fact it\u0027s largely hidden from the player, who gets to see only the explosive results, but never the reasons. There is depth somewhere in there, something the player can do - but where? And what? This is not a conceptual issue, but one of implementation: it\u0027s extremely hard to expose this to the player in a seamless, entertaining fashion, without it getting in the way of the rest of the game. Near impossible, I\u0027d wager. The concept of realistic thermodynamic simulation and consequences just doesn\u0027t \u0022gamify\u0022 all that well. The little floating heat bars added in 1.01 are a band-aid feature aimed to expose and involve the player a little bit more, to make them realize that there\u0027s actually a logical game mechanic hidden somewhere among the random explosions, but it also resulted in a number of players being upset about them getting in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main saving grace for stock KSP here is that, as mentioned, the heat system appears only transiently in a select few special cases - during atmospheric reentry, and during LV-N burns. The heat simulation part of drills and ISRU refineries got axed by Squad within a few business days of releasing 1.0, and for good reason: it just doesn\u0027t play well in any non-transient scenario. This is a pretty big concern for Near Future, because heat load from reactors is not transient. Nertea\u0027s job here is pretty difficult, because he needs to make a poor gameplay feature feel like fun when players use his parts. That\u0027s why he implements things like the thermal insulation parts - those give the player more control over how their vessels handle non-transient heat loads. And when the player is in control, things feel more believable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T09:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022billkerbinsky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022billkerbinsky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActual number for real reactors is more like 7% of operating power a few seconds after a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram#Etymology\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESCRAM\u003C/a\u003E (follow link for Kerbal-ish lore), ~2% after 10 minutes, but it\u0027s still 10kW/ton after a year and 1kW/ton after 10 years.\u003Cp\u003ESee also \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_heat\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_heat\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell yah, if the ratio is 7% for operating power for large reactors (MW thermal before conversion to MW electric) it would be more like 10% for NFT reactors. NFT reactor total MW thermal = MW thermal \u002B MW electric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7% from (MW th \u002B MW el) = about 10% from (MW th). So realistically after shutdown you would have 10% of total thermal heat generation and that would drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Nertea, I was testing new version which included reactor core damage and I feel it\u0027s not serious enough. Currently I just don\u0027t care whether reactor is damaged as soon as I drop it to 75% core integrity. Since I can always (having appropriate engineer) repair it to this point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Thus my suggestion for core damage below 75% (or lets say 50%) to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) rapidly (and exponentially) consume remaining enriched uranium and convert it to depleted one - this would simulate reactor meltdown @ very low core integrity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E produce additional heat (to account for freshly produced spent fuel radiation) with rapid conversion to depleted uranium; have a look at below graph to see how much heat is generated by one ton of spent fuel.

So for example you abuse your reactor and it overheats heavily, take core damage to 20% (almost complete meltdown), you shut it down and in a second a) it doesn\u0027t take any further damage \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E it doesn\u0027t produce any heat c) after cooling you can take remaining fuel back to other \u0027healthier\u0027 reactor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that reactor takes core damage no matter whether it works or not after achieving critical temp. I know that potential side effect will be core damage when shut-down reactor is overheated for other reasons (lithobreaking or engines or other reactors).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) reactor is always repairable; I imagine after reaching 0% core integrity (meltdown) it would be in FUBAR state (damaged beyond repair). So it should be at least dead mass. In more advanced version dead mass that generates a lot of heat (core is full of spent fuel that cannot be removed at 0% integrity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GzlBGhg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GzlBGhg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T10:50:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sage","CreatedById":103634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T09:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree with the theory of your post, I disagree that heat mechanics cannot be presented to a player without making them understandable. Stock gameplay is famous to hide information from the player -and I\u0027m still amazed on how they managed to get the orbit thing down right (and still I think that no neophyte ever got docking right without a tutorial) . If we use your reasoning the new aero should be axed in favor of the old one, since they aren\u0027t explained \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E and one was at least simple, while the new one is often unpredictable also in regard to RL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat mechanics are actually much more straightforward to people - thermal mass, conductivity aren\u0027t really known by this name but a lot of people have an idea of what they are. What Squad hasn\u0027t done right is telling the player that this system exists at all, and it is a shame since it can give a new, fun challenge in building spacecraft, even in non-transient scenarios. That don\u0027t work because squad hasn\u0027t tweaked values at all initially to allow equilibrium points inside the max temperature range, and it hasn\u0027t given us critical parts needed, like radiators and insulators. Now that Nertea is adding those, along with tooltips in the VAB to signal what parts produce heat and dissipate it well (every part should have it, like the mass reading), he is having the problem that large ships ends up being the radiators of a reactor, and bumping up the heat production to fix this put in danger small ships. In the end, instead of pushing the player towards the \u0022correct\u0022 assembly - a ship with a hot part with radiators and heat sources insulated from the cold part, the mod is juggling to accommodate every possible design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I never minded Nertea not adding boiloff - it was an unnecessary complexity where there was no need, since heat was modelled poorly and it had no integration with NF reactors. However, now that we have a \u0022realistic\u0022 simulation environment the mod ends up not conforming to reality and our expectations of \u0022need radiators for reactors\u0022 because large ships act as one - and people were indeed surprised that the tanks could tolerate high temperatures loads, not that the heat was flowing all over the spaceship. So, borrowing from real-life a mechanic that force the engineers to insulate the hot parts from the cold (and Nert has given us an insulators that works wonder!) could prove useful. I don\u0027t say it will solve all the problem out of the box, or that it will actually be fun in game, but now there is a \u003Cem\u003Ereason\u003C/em\u003E to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and again, delivery of the info to the player, and a more simple modelling to avoid unnecessary complexity can be done easily. Initially, give to LF and OX the same boiloff rate, so they keep the ratios intact, make boiloff start at a critical temp (not realistic, but this give the players an hard limit and we can have the temp bar popping out when we reach this) and add RCS effects and sounds to the surface of the tank, that start appearing when the temp reach the critical point to give visual feedback that something is wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can tell me on how liquid boiling, a common sight in everyday life (people even know that during summer some of your gasoline disappears if you don\u0027t use your car), presented in this way is less intuitive that plane matching I\u0027ll call myself wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving consequences is a good idea, yes - you just need to be careful about the what and how.
