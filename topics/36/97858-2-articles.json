I noticed the same, but only if you rescale the size of the pod first. Will require some investigation into how this other mod works because there is nothing obvious in the log.

I can re-produce the crazy torque numbers error without AmpYear installed... but I found the only way I could do it was with TweakableEverything and Tweakscale together.. When I changed the command pod size with Tweakscale then the TweakableEverything torque numbers went crazy. In the pictures you posted it didn\u0027t see like you had Tweakscale installed.. but maybe you have something else conflicting with this mod? Because as I said, I reproduced this without AmpYear installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Version posted.

The Reserve Power is exactly that. The ship will draw electric charge from the main batteries first... when these run out you can transfer power from any Reserve Power you have.

In the meantime been working on a new release which has fixed a number of bugs including fixing vessel switching when you go EVA (nasty bug I didn\u0027t even know about until I tried it myself). Re-balacing of the KabinCraziness calcs, I\u0027ve removed Hibernation if you time warp, so everything keeps running in timewarp, but will drop you out of time warp if you hit a configurable Low Electrical Charge Percentage. Still got a few bugs and testing to do before I release it.. probably next week now as I will have little spare time this week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T10:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T13:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI say split it off...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run heavily part modded games, so I pretty much dont use any mods that are just for aesthetics, realism, or more resources than a stock game...I like to keep the mods stripped down to what \u0022I\u0022 consider bare minimum for my style of gameplay...If I had a more powerful computer, i would partake of the extra resources mods, but any extra resources are out at this time for me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI REALLY like and want to use the power management part of this mod, as I really loved the original...But i would most likely NOT use any of the other features you have, except the Reserve Power (which I think is essential to the mod as a \u0022power manager\u0022, anyway), and I like the TurnBooster...But I not be using the others...So i would prefer a stripped down version of the mod...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT being said, I like the idea of all the other features, even the \u0022Kabin Kraziness\u0022...I would NOT scrap that...Just split it off and offer it as a separate mod, that nicely interfaces with AmpYear....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou already put all the work into it, and I am SURE there WILL be people interested in it...It IS a pretty unique idea so far...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T14:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about just creating a light version with only the power management stuff, and a full version with kabin kraziness and the electric RCS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured out why the reserve power felt backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term got subconsciously associated with back-up generators.
