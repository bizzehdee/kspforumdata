From the stack trace it has likely cached a mesh or renderer component, and is attempting to access its game-object for some further processing, and failing at that point.  I would have to look into what the FAR source does in that method to know more. Thankfully, I can actually look at that source; but its a bit late in the evening for me to start digging into it right at the moment.\n\nIf you want to open up an issue ticket to make sure this does not get forgotten about, I\u0027ll look into it a bit more when I\u0027m a bit more awake ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochton","CreatedById":70134,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T08:33:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Indeed; Duna and back with half of my designs.
