I\u0027m not sure how to do the life span part, if it\u0027s even possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example you could select\u00A0Americium-241 that lasts like 400 years but has very little output, or\u00A0Strontium-90 that has higher output and lasts 25 years... Is there a way to do this?
