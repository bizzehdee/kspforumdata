Mods like kethane and Kerbal Interstellar let you mine resources in-situ to extend your explorations. These are great additions to the game, and one result of their inclusion is the need for a transportation network to ship resources around the solar system. If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re like me and you grow tired of trucking resources around your various stations and bases, then KOTS is the answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased upon the real-world Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program employed by NASA to resupply the International Space Station, KOTS takes the concept one step further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign Goals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think all of these are possible. Ideally, KOTS lets you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EList what resources are available on any vessel equipped with a KOTS module, even if that vessel is currently unloaded. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESchedule regular supply runs between Kerbin and a vessel within Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI (including the Mun and Minmus); just list what you need (Liquid Fuel, Oxidizer, Water, etc.), specify how much you want per shipment, and how often to deliver. KOTS will buy the resources and ship them for you- for a fee. If the receiving vessel hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been focused upon in a while, KOTS will catch up on its shipments. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETransport any resource in a vessel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inventory to any other vessel anywhere in the Kerbol system so long as both vessels are equipped with a KOTS module. This is known as a supply route. You set up supply routes by focusing upon the vessel that will receive supplies, then checking the list of KOTS-equipped vessels for resources that they can ship. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESetup supply routes from multiple vessels. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESchedule regular shipments between vessels.

If shipping between vessels, then KOTS charges a small percentage of the resource\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s unit cost, plus a shipping fee equal to the total units being shipped multiplied by a distance factor. If being shipped up from Kerbin, then KOTS charges a fee based upon the cost per unit of resource, plus the shipping percentage, plus the distance factor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe configuration node also lists density, which is the mass per unit of resource. Resources with a density of 0 (EVA propellant, electric charge) cannot be shipped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KOTS module has a limited amount of mass that it can transport, about 16mt- the part itself should be around the size of a Rockomax-16 fuel tank very roughly representing the size of a Space X Dragon or an Orbital Science\u0027s Cygnus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shipping manifest could specify how many metric tons of resource you want, and it will automatically calculate the number of units you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re shipping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough units of capacity aboard your vessel, then the units indicator turns red. If you have sufficient capacity, but the current amount of resource you have plus the shipment amount would exceed capacity, then the indicator turns yellow. Green indicates that your current amount of resource plus the shipment\u0027s amount will be less than your vessel\u0027s capacity. Ideally, these indicators work across all shipments you\u0027re going to receive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe nice to the player; if the player hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t focused upon a vessel receiving shipments in a while, then support partial shipments so that excess capacity isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t thrown overboard (and the cost of shipping said excess isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t paid).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T16:43:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T16:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to add functionality with this for my Cygnus mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T17:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like this has already been done with MKS/OKS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ogamaga","CreatedById":66292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T00:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Angel-125\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Angel-125\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks like this has already been done with MKS/OKS.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one lacks the inter SOI capability, which I would greatly appreciate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T01:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei remember having a idea about this, there would be landing pads between each resource pickup/dropoff point. you would have a craft on landing pad, and when ready to make a route between 2 points, you launch/drive/takeoff the craft and it would record all the resource values on the craft. during the journey piloted by the player, between each landing pad, it would record how much fuel used, time spent, resources taken into the crafte and taken out, and then it make a route that automaticly simulate the resources being spent, drop off, picked up , and so on. you could have a landing pad on the surface, and one in orbit, and launch a vessel from the surface launchpad, to the orbit launchpad, and it record the LF/O used during the trip, the resources picked up on surface and dropped off on the orbit launchpad and vice versa, and it make a route between eachother and it would automaticly simulate the route forever without user intervention. hope you understand my idea and like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riles","CreatedById":114143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T22:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool but I seemed to be confused, do you have to pilot and nav the ship yourself or is this all done behind curtains?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T01:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022riles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022riles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery cool but I seemed to be confused, do you have to pilot and nav the ship yourself or is this all done behind curtains?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor the first time yes, then after that it takes the data from the first time and it just uses the numbers from that- how long it took, resources used, vessel used, resources transfered/picked up, but i dont think it would actualy be moving the ship. you could do that if you had very advanced coding, but i dont think its that important. maybe make it so when it stops at a landing pad the ship used for transporting is teleported over to said launchpad,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T02:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a neat idea.
