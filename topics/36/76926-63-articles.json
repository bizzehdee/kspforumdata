Missiles DO WORK, but are extremely buggy and more or less require stationary targets as they NEED a direct hit on the CLIENT that takes damage. Whether i see the hit or not is not important, the way DPM currently works is that a client can only be damaged if he seen the object hit on his side and his client actually calculates damage. Sucks for combat in general, as then lag becomes a massive issue, and anyone who isnt 100% in sync with you is more or less impossible to hit short of a massivs shrapnel shotgun (my new stock weapon or choice, 200 sepratrons, one HAS TO HIT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, while i have TEMPORARILY shelved my MP mod, since BDA as is, isnt going to work much if at all, the work i did do is quite promising. Ive switched from a random % kill to a heat damage model. Bullets will heat up the target, and if enough hits connect in a certain timespan, the part will be overheated. While its not truly how bullets work (lets just say ist some sci-fi energy weapon heat damage), i feel its alot more fun and allows multiple playstyles to work. Do you want to have a quick hard to hit flier thats a easy kill once hit, or do you want a massive heavy tank that requires focused fire to take down, but is so heavy that it is more or less unable to move? My model also makes part types much more important, for example structural panels are way better then fuel tanks of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, once i fix a few small bugs, im gonna upload a heat damage model version of this mod (no removal of cheat options for MP, ect), and id really liek to see what the community thinks of it, as it is in my opinion much better and offers more depth (the only way to defend against current model is sheer redundancy, all tanks will be gunbeds with 10\u002B cannons to keep it viable after half is shot up if combat even becomes semi competitive). So once up, ill need some brave testers to see how the new model works, and whether its balanced in terms of how much the specific guns do (still gotta buff those 50s and not buff the 30 at the same time, if i make 50s useful the 30 becomes insanely OP).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yski","CreatedById":119366,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T23:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETalking about different versions, I made one with lasers that scale down based on distance instead of flat out stopping at around 2km.
