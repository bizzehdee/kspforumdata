I can\u0027t see 4kW being all that useful, I think solar pannels fill that space quite well, it could make a useful night time generator I suppose, especially as you can leave it running in the daytime too and not waste karbonite. Also karbonite powered rovers, that could be cool. Actually I\u0027ve talked myself round I like that idea now.
