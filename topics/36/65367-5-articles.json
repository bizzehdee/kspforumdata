AMD compatibility mode got switched on. Might have hit it sometime earlier in week. Turned it off and everything is good. Also took care of some funky textures on shadows I was getting. Well thanks for the attention and thanks for your work, KER appears to be working wonderfully. The is something still there but it only pulses for like 1/10th of a second every 25 - 30 seconds and that was after I splattered my uber rocket across KSP like 5 times in a row and all settings maxed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the AMD compatibility options refers to video cards rather than CPUs so it could explain why you were seeing odd video effects and the lag if it was trying to do something a bit Radeon specific on an NVidia card...
