I have watched a wealth of tutorials online for both software to be able to get where I currently am, but am having trouble finding good tutorials on animations in Blender and Unity and getting them to function in KSP. I can do basic animations in Blender and get them into Unity but am kinda lost at that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can model, texture, set basic cfg parameters for static parts and make use of them in game no problem. It\u0027s setting up the animations to function properly and setting up the controls for it. (Ex: One animation to open and close the hatch or two separate animations?....ect..) getting the animations into KSP, and in what conditions would I have to have a .dll file \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimplemented for what functions to work? I\u0027m sure there will be more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just a few questions to start this off with but will be adding more as I go along. Also I will post screen shots and models to view with any related questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000CD;\u0022\u003E1.

Could I use (and possibly) tweak the current engine emissions animation from the Squad engines to use in some of my own models via the cfg file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What is the best way (if there is) to make my animations? Should I make them in Blender and export them to Unity or should I Export my model only and setup animations In Unity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003ETo anyone who may read this thread, If you have experience in these matters I would appreciate you possibly subscribing to it or at least saving a link so that you may come back and check it regularly for updated questions and such.

Finally figured out how to properly add tags and triggers in Unity for the hatch and ladder colliders. That took allot of searching for one good tutorial on Hatches and ladders. Now that that is done i am on to the engines, landing gear and other animated parts....and here ....I am stuck once again. I can make the animations Work in Blender to some extent...Not sure if my hierarchy and Objects such as Empties and such are setup correctly, also i am having trouble importing my animations into Unity ...I know how to edit the import so that the default take doesn\u0027t load with my model. But my saved animation isn\u0027t showing up. In any case I was hoping someone (or a couple of modders) might step up and make a good tutorial this. Primarily animating an engine start to end and then properly importing it into unity and setting it up for game. I\u0027m sure this would have to be done over 2 maybe 3 videos but it would be awesome if someone took the time to do this. I know there are a couple of tutorials out there for engine emissives and such but that doesn\u0027t help if i cannot get the animation right in the first place.
