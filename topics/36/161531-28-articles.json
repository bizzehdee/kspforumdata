It is very costly to deal with it, you should store them for long periods of time or use some high cost procedure to eliminate them in suitable reactors. Nuclear waste problem gets bigger with the age of reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can we use it ourselves here. If we have some waste we can just jettison it to outer space right? Or can we use it to limit lifetime/efficiency of our generators. Nuclear waste buildup can be used as an extra load on power generation rather than being a separate resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch our rocket with usual power generation efficiency, by the time it reaches Jool after 5 years we will have some nuclear waste buildup that will reduce power generation efficiency. Nuclear waste is only going up, our engines need power to operate, at some point power will not be enough to enable a return trip so we should plan when we should go back home. However, if we work so hard then we can build a nuclear waste disposal station in orbit around Jool, just like a resource mining/refining outpost, antimatter collector arrays. We all know this kind of project require so much time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be said that fusion and antimatter do not produce waste. Neutron emission in fusion reactors are the main source of heat generation, they generate heat for us to use but they also produce radioactive material when they hit inner shell of tokamak reactor. This is short half-life material but more radioactive than fission nuclear waste. We can also invent some kind of reason for antimatter too. For example long term antimatter storage cause deterioration on storage facility so energy requirements increase exponentially in time. This will mean antimatter collection array stations will require another heavy module for continuous maintenance of antimatter storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of power generation will limit our ability to use overpowered power generation with very high dV vessels. There is still a workaround, build a microwave network but that system require so much work with any decent power generation through the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T06:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yafeshan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022yafeshan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022yafeshan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI write this since you ask for contribution.

The Vista Engines combines High ISP and High Thrust, something that requires tremendous amount of power. Fusion creates a lot of power, but most of is useless radiation and neutrons (especially D-T fusion). That\u0027s why I updated the Vista Engine to generate 2\u002B 10 GW of additional Waste Heat, meaning, waste heat will be a major issue to deal with.
