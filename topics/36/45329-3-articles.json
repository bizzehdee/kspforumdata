Maybe make the mounting plate thicker so it\u0027s not disappearing inside the part it\u0027s attached to? I changed the offset to -0.035 (from -0.025, I think) to work around it here. I also had trouble getting the radar to deploy in an action group without having to press it twice. I removed the \u0022animSwitch = False\u0022 line from the config file to fix that one. I think the weights are a bit high, too (0.25 seems way too high for a surface-attached antenna to me - I ramped it down to 0.05).\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I really like it, and I immediately placed it on my TKS mapping craft (more like shoehorned it - not much surface space left on that ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI encountered the difficulty selecting the piece - I tested it mounted on quite a few different pieces and didn\u0027t come up with a good way of stopping it \u0027floating\u0027 a few cm off the surface on parts with a collision mesh that closely follows the visible mesh without making it recess slightly on parts with coarser collision meshes.

I wanted to take the generic animation out because that button is no longer needed with the new code.
