Thought I was going to wait on this, but as I needed the code to disable a node/check if a nosecone could be enabled anyway, it was only a few dozen more lines of code to implement the multi-node stuff.\n- Split texture-sets off into optional download pack.  If you were previously using a non-SLS texture set on any of your parts, you -must- install these texture sets with the next update (at least the ones you were using), or bad things might happen.\n- Add 4 (four!) new texture sets -- Gray-Plain, Gray-w/Stringers, White-Plain, White-w/Stringers.  All have inter-tank details, but the \u0027plain\u0027 variants lack any other normal map/details; just a plain color \u002B  bit of noise.  These will be available in the optional texture-set download.  These will -not- be available for the old deprecated tanks, only the new single-part Modular Fuel Tank.\n- Add ability to change top/main tank/bottom textures independently for new Modular Fuel Tank (old fuel tanks had top\u002Bbottom caps linked).  No, this does not apply to the old tanks, as they will be removed in a release or two.\n- Added flag transforms to the -new- modular fuel tanks that will be coming out with the next release.  Uses a custom plugin, but should be functionally equivalent to the stock module (aside from proper support for multiple same-named transforms in the same part).\n- Added manufacturer/Agent info.  Some of the implementation/details/stats are temporary, but it should be fully functional for manufacturer-part-sorting.\n- Removed the visually-delayed fairing updates.  They still use an optimized deferred update scheme, but now do it in a place where there is no -visual- delay.\n- Fixed up engine cluster \u0027None\u0027 mount still having a fairing...\n- Added a \u0027Prev Mount\u0027 option to engine clusters.  Anywhere else that needs \u0027Prev\u0027 buttons that I\u0027m missing?\n- Added a \u0027Clear Mount\u0027 option to engine clusters to set them directly to the \u0027None\u0027 mount option (for easier setup/use on fuel tanks or upper stages).\n\nBy far the biggest feature for this update will be the new single-editor-part modular fuel tank, but there are quite a few other usability/quality-of-life improvements coming as well.  It is looking like this release will mark the transition into the 0.3.x release group, as the primary goals for 0.3 have been met (implementation of engine clusters, configurable upper stages, and configurable fuel tanks).  One step closer to public release.  Have updated the milestones list with a new 0.3.5 release to denote the actual public release stage (when all things needed for initial public release have been completed);  squashed it in the middle so as to not disrupt the rest of the set up goals.\n\nRegarding texture set download(s) -- should I offer just a single pack with -all- of the optional texture sets in it, or should I offer one-download-per-set?  Currently I have it split into one-download-per-set, but would be easy enough to merge it all into a single download.\n\nDoesn\u0027t look like I\u0027ll get to the RCS blocks this week; has been a busy week at work, and I\u0027ve not had any modeling/texturing time like I normally would.  Oh-well, lots of plugin updates this week.  Should likely still have time for a bit more touch-up on the upper stage and skeletal mount textures, perhaps even able to make some alternate texture sets for them (no guarantees...).\n\nNext week -- SC-A-CM rework.  Yep, that is all I\u0027m scheduling, as it will require redoing/finishing the model and textures (and a new 0.625m docking port model/part...), and writing up a full-custom parachute module.  I have no idea how long the parachute stuff could take;  could be a day, could take all week.  If there is extra time, it will go towards either RCS blocks or updating the SC-A-SM geometry/textures (possibly RCS blocks first, as I\u0027de like to use that geometry and textures on the SM)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T20:42:23Z","Content":"Can\u0027t wait.

Was a blast, and almost lost all my kerbals on the earth return when I zoomed past earth as I forgot to do the last burn to get into the atmosphere. Took a whole aerobraking orbit and one half more to lower the speed down (no fuel left) before the capsule fell to Kerbin.

Their efficiency is pretty low and you usually don\u0027t need that much thrust.\n\nAlso, I think it\u0027s possible to do the same mission with much, much less rocket.  In my preliminary tests, I think the second largest booster and a single J2 upper is enough to get the CSM and a modest lander into a trans-munar injection, from which point the CSM has enough fuel to do the rest.  This was using FAR, so the delta-v requirements might be a little different in stock, but they should be pretty similar post-1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T03:47:11Z","Content":"it wasn\u0027t as much about efficiency as making them look right ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022). I can do the whole mission on a single Ares I in the kerbin system probably. The first SLS I made did a round trip to duna; It\u0027s about the size of the Ares 5. On these Ares rockets the second stages on both were half full when I dumped them, so yeah, way too much for the kerbin system ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nFor career or just Kerbin sandbox I use asperagus staging and smaller stages. not as realistic looking though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T03:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T03:54:21Z","Content":"I really don\u0027t know what the actual engines were and if sstu has them (or similar). might be a next step to refine these builds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T03:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T04:07:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I really don\u0027t know what the actual engines were and if sstu has them (or similar). might be a next step to refine these builds.\n\u003E \n\nIf I\u0027m not mistaken, both would have used J2X uppers (possibly x2 on the Ares V).  The J2X is planned for SSTU, but the J2 exists currently and it\u0027s a reasonable substitute.  The Ares V would have used RS-25 or RS-68 lowers I believe, of which the RS-25 exists in SSTU (RS-68 planned)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T04:16:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ll check it out tomorrow, would be cool if the right engines are used instead of the \u0022yeah this one looks right\u0022 method."}]}
