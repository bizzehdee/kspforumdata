If they license it in such a way that forbids it then we should honor those wishes. For that matter, sometimes a modder goes quiet for a long time and then returns to their project (a good recent example would be AIES). How would it be fair to have their projects taken from them when they explicitly said they didn\u0027t want that done?\n\nBasically, it is neither fair nor right for us to appropriate the works of others just because they have stopped maintaining them. They don\u0027t belong to us, we must honor the terms under which they chose to share their work. To do otherwise would discourage modders from sharing their work in the first place, so we use licensing rules to foster an environment that makes modders happy to share.\n\nThis is ignoring the whole issue of legal liability in enabling copyright infringement by dishonoring license terms, which can get Squad and its community in a whole heap of trouble."},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T21:49:00Z","Content":"@Avera9eJoe:\n\nSince it was (largely?) a compilation, any chance for a deliberate recipe that we could follow to achieve the same results?
