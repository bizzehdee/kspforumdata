Anyways, this state of the art uses filtered air, heats it up to \u0027like a gazillion degrees\u0027 using a nuclear heating system, then exhausts it out the back. It needs to be moving pretty darn fast before it produces much thrust. Also, it LOVES to overheat. Also, it can only throttle down to 75% of full thrust.

This gave him the idea to \u0022Blow really hard on the engine\u0022 to cool it down. No one could take him seriously due to how he had phrased his proposal, so, instead he just made a really fast fan, hooked it up to a fridge, then stuck it in an aerodynamic case. Also, it seems that it cools more efficiently when it moves faster.
