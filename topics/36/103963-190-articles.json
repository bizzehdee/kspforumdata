Thanks!\n\u003E \n\nI assume you are using Kopernicus. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing it but when kopernicus is installed, the custom sun flares are present with the center being the stock sun spikes. Perhaps ask the kopernicus guys how to use just the stock sun. Seems kopernicus makes the sun larger.  I dunno it\u0027s not a big deal to me. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T21:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Berlin**"},{"CreatedByName":"nerf_hurrdurr","CreatedById":132797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T02:36:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No need for a log, just send me your OpenGL version and GPU.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Btw did this not happen with previous version?

I\u0027ve replaced the factory graphics card so all of the \u0022What Model Mac is Yours/OpenGL Version\u0022 charts won\u0027t apply. For the record my graphics card is an ATI Radeon 5770. Embarrassingly enough, I don\u0027t really know how to check my openGL version: I can\u0027t find the terminal command to display the current version, and system profiler lists my version as \u002212.1\u0022 (wut?). Wish I could be more help, especially if this is an issue others run into! Probably time to face the music and jump ship to PC next computer upgrade.... ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-20T02:36:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2016 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nerf\\_hurrdurr**\n  \nformatting"},{"CreatedByName":"RangeMachine","CreatedById":149069,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T23:44:41Z","Content":"Any plans to add scatterer to tracking station? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeenobit","CreatedById":125578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T03:34:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been crashing with the latest version of Scatterer when I try to load a saved game.
