I\u0027m sure it was more technical than that, but the effect was that it was a rather violent procedure. The visual aspect of this was that all the parts of my craft were temporarily turned to their natural orientation and, upon reaching the destination, the parts were re-orienting themselves based on their strength with the nodes they were attached to. It was like it was reassembling itself on the spot. Even worse, when my craft came to a halt it was not on the water, but actually a few meters above it and... get this... it was facing nose \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E into the water.

It has the lot! Stock-ish look to suit the MK2 cockpit, so 1.25m initially and 2.5m will follow. The aim is a rigid, robust chassis to mount different parts in depending what you want to do with it, rather than making a body out of rocket parts with little tolerance for the crashy-crashy-boom-boom, rough and tumble nature of rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horus","CreatedById":99705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T18:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, this nice mod conflicts with heldiver\u0027s recent KSOS package #4 (rovers).
