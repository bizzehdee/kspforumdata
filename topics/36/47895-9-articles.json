The reason the city lights would fade into view when on layer 10, is because the camera that renders the actual terrain and Space Center is rendered ON TOP of this layer, and as you get farther away, it lowers the alpha to eventually make it visible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to render the clouds and lights on-top of this camera render, but I\u0027m running into the issue of the clouds and lights rendering on top of the spacecraft (as that is the camera being used). A possibility would be to render the craft above the clouds and lights again, but then the issue would be that they would always render above KSP, even if it were supposed to be out of view behind it.
