I\u0027m in the mood to add some new ores to my game, just something simple to start with, diamonds which I imagine could be found in rare deposits on asteroids. Any tutorials or documentations that I could read up on about adding ore? Also, do I have to start a new game for the effects to take place? I have a career mode I\u0027m rather invested in.\n\nMany thanks in advance for both your help and patience."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:26:17Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t done this before myself so take what I say with a grain of salt ...\n\nAdding a resource just takes a simple config file - see Community Resource Pack for a config file that adds a lot of resources ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998))\n\nThen you need something to harvest the resource - look at the existing drill config files and under a section named something like \u0022ModuleHarvestResource\u0022 and either add your resource or add a new drill - ModuleManager (MM) is a really good way to do this [(](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29)[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-2-1-5-%28May-22%29))\n\nThen you need tanks to store the stuff in - same as above MM is the way to go for this - add a tank(or tanks). I haven\u0027t seen any manuals on doing this - just study the existing config files.\n\nDepending on what you want to do with the resource may require a plug-in or just another config file. If your just selling your diamonds (I think) it\u0027s just a config edit.\n\nAnd of course you want to do this in a test setup (or back-up your save file).\n\nHappy modding!"},{"CreatedByName":"JonDahm","CreatedById":145757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T07:01:57Z","Content":"If you want further help, I believe the [Plugin Development Help and Support subforum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30) is the place to go.
