My latest one the WT-51, I put the EVA inside the cargo bay,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich was causing kerbals to explode inside sometimes, all turned out to be a badly placed hatch collider. Even if you are not using the hatch, it\u0027s still a detectable collider, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso if it has a problerm and even if you are not using it, simply passing by it or touching it can cause your issue.

Also a slightly scaled down version of the command hq with a standard hole in the bottom would make an awesome bridge for bigger ships. otherwise nice im enjoying trying to make a colony outta these. waiting for devo\u0027s biodomes. you can also watch me doing the bobcat colony challenge with all of this on my twitch channel col_neville. doing the basics on the mun first then out to the other bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-24T19:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2013 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by COL.Neville\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alskari","CreatedById":57638,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T20:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat to hear.
