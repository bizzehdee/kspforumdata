There don\u0027t appear to be any other variables in ModuleReactionWheel I could query, so my question would be does anyone know where (if anywhere) that information would be stored?

So it\u0027s a bit like the bug was fixed giving constant charge but the outputResources list is not being updated (the alternator doesn\u0027t have an on/off state either). I can work round that by querying the state of the engine module on the same part I hope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
