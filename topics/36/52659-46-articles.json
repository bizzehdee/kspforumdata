Your Models and Textures are beautiful, and I love how you try to keep to to a stock-alike aesthetic. I\u0027ve been wanting to do a space plane parts pack for a while but my modeling is crap, and frankly I\u0027m totally overwhelmed by it all. Here is some crappy MS Paint sketches I just did to show you some of the ideas I had in mind. These are parts I would like to build with, and if they spark your imagination, i would love to see your attempt at them or something similar!\u003Cp\u003EWe really need a 2.5 meter cockpit section! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G26rDck.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/G26rDck.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 2 kerbal capacity would be reasonable. I know the Mk3 is supposed to fill this niche, but with the mk3 fuselage being so underdeveloped, and TonouTorpedo seemingly unlikely to re-upload his efforts, I think this would be very appreciated. This part would also marry nicely with some of the fuselage sections in the KAX pack. This one steps down to a 1.25 meter nose section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nice pointy nose cone with a hypersonic-look would be fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vjv15nN.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/vjv15nN.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe structural nosecone in the game doesn\u0027t really give an impression (accurate or not) of the hypersonic speeds that an air-breathing SSTO spaceplane would need to reach in order to achieve orbit.

I\u0027ve given this a ton of thought (as building space planes is almost the only thing i do) and when I heard about the 3.75 parts coming out, this is how I imagined a space plane pack could take advantage of that and look cool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xFFwFQv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xFFwFQv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese have circular cross sections. In this way, you can build one 1.25 meter nosecone for all applications, A 2.5 meter cockpit that can be used on 2.5 meter parts or married with a nice special adapter to 3.75 meter parts. The adapter can carry fuel, potentially, and can be reversed to taper down at the back of the craft. with that circular cross section any stock part can be swapped in for your special parts to give maximum flexibility when building all sorts of craft. If you notice from the pic, there is a slight downward taper to the parts I\u0027ve drawn. This is purely for aesthetics, and does induce a small problem with CoM as the attachment nodes are pushed down towards the front of the parts. In my experience this is just not a big problem on larger craft, however. The change in the crafts CoM will be negligable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also looks a lot like many of the beautiful concepts for the x-30 competition from the 90s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QMlx9OA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QMlx9OA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0bJCiQB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220bJCiQB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RbzOmPk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RbzOmPk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027ve been thinking about is some sort of analog of a Scramjet and Intake:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7WG3HP4.png\u0022 alt=\u00227WG3HP4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pjcdFWD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pjcdFWD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one might be too ambitious, but it would be highly satisfying to fly at extremely high speeds and altitudes with a system that is a little more beliveable than the Turbojet /ram-air intake system. See X-30, X-43, X-51 etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts would have a CoM and Attachment in the standard configuration for 1.25m parts, allowing them to be attached at the back of a spaceplane. Intakes would attach similarly, with a nesting and protruding leading edge allowing some minor level of stacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBallancing the performance of the parts would be the hard part. I think to keep things simple an exagerated version of the turbojet / ram-air intake profile would fit the bill well. The intakes gather more air at higer speed and the engine performs better at higher altitudes. While not really accurate, I know that speed-altitude based performance isn\u0027t really possible in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already tried to do a non-functional mock-up of how this would appear ingame with a few of my builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RZw6fLK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RZw6fLK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on and on with this stuff, but I think i\u0027ll stop there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Take from it what you will!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-04T07:25:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2014 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Exothermos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T19:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoa this guy, throws out one cool idea after another!

That makes a lot more sense than arranging three in a row. Why didnt I think of this? For a shuttle however, you also wanna have the engines tilted towards the common center of mass of the Spaceplane \u002B External Tank. A fixed angle adapter probably wouldnt be of much help there either. It\u0027s actually really difficult to make a Spaceshuttle in KSP. I tried to make one with SP\u002B without using tons of reaction wheels and kinda got it working but it was very difficult. I used Editor extensions to radial attach nosecones with engines to the back so I had control over the tilt and direction of thrust. But this also only allows tilting in 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 increments which was not precise enough to make it perfect, but better than nothing. So to to enable you to build shuttles with SP\u002B I would rather design some clever radial attach engine mounts than a stiff adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T14:24:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Porkjet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPorkjet, maybe that could be resolved if I ever get around to releasing this robotics part (-22.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to \u002B22.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.cubby.com/pl/IR%20VTOL5.png/_6d47240f69c8444695e531aa5f874107\u0022 alt=\u0022_6d47240f69c8444695e531aa5f874107\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the added advantage that once your main fuel tank is decoupled you can realign the angle to the centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApprently Stupid_chris is working on some kind of animation plugin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73283-0-23-x-AdvancedAnimator-ModuleAnimateGeneric-upgraded-v1-1-1-2-04-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73283-0-23-x-AdvancedAnimator-ModuleAnimateGeneric-upgraded-v1-1-1-2-04-14\u003C/a\u003E It might be interesting to check it out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Prime flux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Prime flux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApprently Stupid_chris is working on some kind of animation plugin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73283-0-23-x-AdvancedAnimator-ModuleAnimateGeneric-upgraded-v1-1-1-2-04-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73283-0-23-x-AdvancedAnimator-ModuleAnimateGeneric-upgraded-v1-1-1-2-04-14\u003C/a\u003E It might be interesting to check it out\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t handle looping animations so the centrifuge spins once then stops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, @Porkjet strange, I dont think I experienced that.
