Couple more part-category updates (fairings moving to \u0027payload\u0027 category, thanks [@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/)) (should ISDC and/or petal adapter be moved to payload as well?), and I\u0027ll be trying to add \u0027inverted\u0027 adapters to most modular parts\u0027 adapter selections (need to make up the adapter model definitions... a fair bit of work...).\n\nThis all puts me in a pretty good position to start working on the HAB / inflatable parts in earnest next week.  Will likely be starting with the cylindrical inflatable modules (A/B/C) as they are much less controversial in their geometry setup, and downright simple in some regards.  I will be trying to spruce them up a bit so they are not just plain cylinders, but they will still end up being fairly simple parts.\n\nAlso going to try and take a bit more time to work on the wheels stuff (so that the SC-E can return, fully functional) -- someone msg\u0027d me an idea that should allow the \u0027sticky friction\u0027 to work out acceptably (if I can get it implemented/working), and bump-stop I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m going to implement with colliders.  No clue if I\u0027ll get to these this weekend, but need to take some time for it before too long."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T18:13:21Z","Content":"ISDC seems like a coupling part, no question (not payload).
