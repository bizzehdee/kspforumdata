I took a little break from modding/playing KSP and when I started playing again last night, I found that I could really use a tiny (0.625m) booster. Specifically because I wanted to replicate the Delta II rocket line.\n\nWell, I made one up! I\u0027ve finished the model and the texture - sadly I must leave for work... But soon it should be imported into the game and coded to work properly. I\u0027m not sure how to balance the stats for it yet, but here it is!\n\n![XTXaZm0.png](http://i.imgur.com/XTXaZm0.png)\n\nAs I said, it\u0027s small - 0.625m diameter and I believe around 5m tall.\n\n[Release Thread!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136038-Phoenix-Industries-Boosters%21-%280-625m-SRBs%29?p=2231855#post2231855)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T17:30:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-**"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T23:14:13Z","Content":"You should include this in your Phoenix pack! This fits quite well with it aesthetically and would make it easier for launching a Phoenix to resupply stuff, especially when you need that extra \u0022umph!\u0022 when you load it up with heavy cargo! I like how the nozzle is angled, doesn\u0027t it make your rockets more stable if the boosters are angled like that?"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T23:48:37Z","Content":"Thanks! I may include it or keep it separate - not sure yet. \n\nI\u0027m going to make the exhaust nozzle a tiny bit bigger, it looks too small to my eyes even though it was to scale to the reference photos. \n\nAs for angled exhaust being more effective / stable - I\u0027m not quite sure. I can imagine the angled thrust might work more efficiently in angling the kinetic energy \u0022in and up\u0022, for lack of better term. To be honest I have no idea why they angled them.

I kind of forgot about this part until recently, I started fresh and have it working (for the most part.) \n\nI\u0027m running into two issues - the particleFX for the engines is running constantly, even when the boosters are not activated. The second issue is that I\u0027m getting the spinning rocket problem, just when the boosters are about empty, the entire rocket spins in the air. I\u0027m not sure if this is a mass/drag issue due to quick rocket-building or if something with the booster part is causing it.\n\nAny help with either problem would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI ended up stealing the config for an existing stock SRB and modifying it for my own use - which fixed the issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T02:58:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T08:14:29Z","Content":"You probably misspelled the running effect name, check your config. \n\nIf you have 24 sides, you should rotate your collider by 12.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA on Z, to make the face the qttach point, not a rim between two faces.

I tweaked the texture a tiny bit and played with the config. It now works as it should.
