It can do that because wheels only bother to keep the craft off the surface, and not on it. The kerbal engineer thus concludes: we need to mount wheels not only upside up but also upside down. And for good measure upside left and upside right won\u0027t hurt either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problems with height remain for the time being but it seems you can drive over such imperfections without issues.
