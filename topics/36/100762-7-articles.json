However, as this is still apha, those plans have not yet been realized.  Please continue to use Final Frontier.  This mod will add other features that you may find useful.

What we plan to provide is a single interface to many of the features that these mods provide.  So, you will have an \u0022integrated\u0022 dashboard so to speak that combine the features of several mods into one control panel.  Now that is not to say that if we decide to \u0022do it our way\u0022 that we might not create our own way of doing performing a given function.  In those cases, you can choose through the interface to either use our method, or use the integrated mod\u0027s method.\n\nI\u0027ve always been about choice, so I prefer to let the player decide what is best for them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-14T15:06:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2017 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T14:17:04Z","Content":"ah ok sounds like a good method. \n\nwill be checking back on this as time goes on as **all** your mods have always been on my mod list when they are available for my game version.  so I am always looking at new things you make.\n\nother than BDArmory I guess...  lol I make many \u0022fighter plane\u0022  or \u0022attack helicopter\u0022 looking things to fly around but I have never actually armed them..."},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T15:13:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 49 minutes ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ah ok sounds like a good method. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E will be checking back on this as time goes on as **all** your mods have always been on my mod list when they are available for my game version.  so I am always looking at new things you make.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E other than BDArmory I guess...  lol I make many \u0022fighter plane\u0022  or \u0022attack helicopter\u0022 looking things to fly around but I have never actually armed them...\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m wasn\u0027t really into blowing things up either (except accidentally).

KSP was a nice idea from the start but i am shure it wouldn\u00B4t have stayed this popular for such a long time without the many changes (and the many many mod ideas they transitioned to be included in the game in their own versions). It\u00B4s just great to see mods like this to be brought back online after years. Not everyone likes to make KSP into a space project manager, but i love the realism on the management side. I love mods like Tantares and BDB and i couldn\u00B4t play this game without any life support mods anymore but the same goes for such things like Kerbal Construction Time and other things that bring in some more need to plan out my career path. I just love the idea that Kerbals go out of the Astronaut Corps or that they need time and money to get trained for their missions and that you have crew rotations. This can do a lot of things i am just trying to include into my long term careers with the help of Excel.  \n\nI just hope this works out with my save files.

The Vanilla game was a bit too complex at first but through perseverance i fell in LOVE with the space management side. I have always been drawn to physics games and resource management. Those elements combined.. OMG. I quickly delved into the world of mods and am truly amazed at how large this \u0027niche\u0027 community is.  \n\nIt saddens me to know end to see the elements that i love abandoned in KSP2.  \n\nParticularly the procedurally generated missions and ability for mod packs / community contract aspects.. and resource management. I only hope that there will be enough malleability in the basic game core design to allow for the modding of these elements i love.  I will play KSP2 and likely enjoy much of what it has to offer while i lament the features it abandoned or failed to fully capture.. but i think i will continue to play KSP1 to get my fix.  \n\nRecently ran across this mod and am excited to try.  \n\nPS i cannot get final frontier to work with a manual install. Am i missing something in the required placement of various subfolders or do they all dump into gamedata as a finalfrontier subfolder? I havent really started to troubleshoot the issue, but seen mention of some on here using FF and didnt know if there were special config or modifications to certain txt files thats needed.  \n\nKuddos on the mmodding community of this game and people that continue to bring the beloved changes to the game that elevate into something else greater than the sum of its parts."}]}
