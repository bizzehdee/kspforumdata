I may consider switching from the stock module for this to the Kerbal Foundries mod as that would let the suspension be user-adjustable to cater to your payload and intended ride-height.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the breaking, I suspect my break thresholds are too low. Do you happen to know what mod those other parts are from and could you possibly send me a craft file? The moving despite being broken is because there\u0027s no damaged model of the wheel yet (I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027d model such a thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitching to the Kerbal Foundries mod method will probably be enough to fix it since wheels under massive amounts of weight don\u0027t break (well, the tracks don\u0027t), they just struggle to carry the load. Also, I should have mentioned that the test craft was fully loaded with ore and substrate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod the containers are from is RoverDudes FTT (Frieght Transport Technologies), the craft itself also has B9 struts and the big SAS from there.
