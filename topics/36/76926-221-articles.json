What it really is doing behind the scenes is designing most of their PartModule\u0027s KSPActions to respond to any change in state of the Boolean value, i.e. an \u0022edge detect\u0022 algorithm, such that it transforms what is really a Boolean toggle keypress into something that appears to be a one-shot on the surface to the user because it will fire off either when becoming true or when becoming false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the KSPAction \u003Cstrong\u003Einfrastructure\u003C/strong\u003E is a toggle on, toggle off system, but a lot of stock PartModules add a layer atop that infrastructure to turn it back into behaving like a simple one-off button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh no, not at all.
