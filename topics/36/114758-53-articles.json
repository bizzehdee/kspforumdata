I hope this information is useful in solving the above mentioned problem.\n\u003E \n\nThere is an option in the config that can set whether a part can only be attached on an anttachment point or also on the body of another part. A part can also define if another part can attach on it on the surface. I enables surface attachment on the legs so they are not restricted to the adapters. But i did not consider that the detach is specific for only one node. I have to consider what option is more sensible or find a compromise.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 20.1.2016 at 1:31 AM, BunnyOmatic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nils,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   Excellent mod I have been using it extensively in my latest career and look forward to any and all updates you provide.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I noticed one odd behavior though I don\u0027t think its a bug, it sure doesn\u0027t change game play.

I can\u0027t remember how many I was missing on the 6-pod, but the 4 was definitely missing two nodes; those closest to the reattachment point.

I think it most often appereas when therea are multiple stack nodes on a part. Sometimes the game does not register that they are decoupled.

I am afraid that i can\u0027t do much on that end.\n\nNB I haven\u0027t actually tried to resolve mine yet as I\u0027ve not played since, if you get anywhere replacing the part in editor let me know!"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T06:20:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, davidy12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E She\u0027s a DAMN Beauty.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is your internet back online?\n\u003E \n\nWell sort of...the connection works but my pc needs a new Wifi Adapter/Usb stick.
