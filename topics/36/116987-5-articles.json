I don\u0027t know if MKSL actually requires kerbals inside the workshops but I think the work is meant to be done by kerbals.  \n\nNone the less I see your point, atm it would need 20 Printers to match the MKSL workshop outcome of MaterialKits and 5 Printers to match the SpecializedParts outcome. MaterialKits should be produced faster than SpecializedParts. So I\u0027d boost the productivity of MaterialKits by the factor 10. This way 2 Printers would match 1 MKSL workshop and 1.5 Printers would match 1 OSE Converter. The rate of SpecializedParts will remain the same. What do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T14:16:15Z","Content":"Eleusis, the MKS Lite scout workshop does not require an engineer to be inside of it for it to function. I will have to check tonight to see if a Kerbal needs to be in the base or if it will run sans green guys. I suspect it needs a Kerbal, and probably an engineer for higher efficiency.\n\nNow, concerning your production rates on the 3d printer. I should probably explain my methodology. \n\nI like to build remote bases that can become self sufficent but my goal is to start the building process with a single drop pod/genesis pod and build the rest using extraplanetary launchpads. The initial drop pod will contain one or two kerbals, life support, and enough material kits to build the first base structure. The first building is usually focused on ore mining so that I can start feeding my workshop. The Scout workshop is light and inflatable and it makes for a great starter material kits producer. Since it is so light I can usually bring one with me and not build it on site.  Once the base is developed fully my goal would be to build a more permanent material kits manufacturer. This is where your models come in. They are beauties to behold!\n\nSo the transition if from the temporary buildings and then to the permanent structures.\n\nIt would be great to only have to build two 3d printers to match the material kit production of the scout workshop. But remember the way I am looking at it. The refinery and printer are permanent structures and as such you would assume they are **more** efficient, not less.\n\nThe MKS Lite scout workshop weighs in at .75 tons. The Keridan Dynamics furnace and 3d printer weigh a total of 17.65 tons and is a permanent structure instead of being inflatable. It takes a substantial amount of material kits and time to construct the furnace and the printer vs the workshop. This could lead a person to argue that the furnace and printer should be much more powerful and effective devices, not less.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-17T21:36:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2016 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr Farnsworth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T01:45:01Z","Content":"Thanks for the input!

Easyiest way is to use the Orbital Pad with a PPD Hitchhiker container(s) (stock; productivity factor: 0.4) and some storage-containers filled with RocketParts. Once in orbit, right click on the Orbital Pad and open the EL build menu. Select a craft and start building. The more Kerbals you have in PPD Hitchhiker container(s) and the higher their level, the faster the building-process will run.\n\nAnother way is to use the Orbital Hangar instead of the Orbital Pad. The Orbital Hangar is bigger, heavier and not to mention its aerodynamics but if you have it in orbit, it can hold up to 8 kerbals and assemble vessels faster with a productivity factor of 3.5.\n\nThe fastest assembly can be achived with the Mobile \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (productivity factor 5.0) but it can not launch vessels on its own like the Orbital Hangar. A Pad of any kind or Launchsite (surface only!) is required.\n\nI hope this helps but if it isn\u0027t what you meant please add a screenshot of your station."},{"CreatedByName":"pheenix99","CreatedById":159480,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T21:35:47Z","Content":"Can\u0027t wait to see the next incarnation of this  mod"},{"CreatedByName":"pheenix99","CreatedById":159480,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T04:02:26Z","Content":"\\*crickets"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T20:06:20Z","Content":"Sorry for the lack of updates lately (again) but I\u0027m very busy.

Like the old Station Tanks they come in 6 sizes plus one adapter and offer between 585 and 8340 units of resources. They provide a slightly different interior that requires JSI advanced transparant pods and are also equipped with illuminated signs to distinguish them in the dark. By default they can store RocketParts, Metal and Ore. If Community Resource Pack is installed additional setups for MaterialKits, RareMetals/ExoticMinerals, Dirt and MetalOre are available.\n\nConversion rates have been greatly increased to justify the high costs (financial and weight). If that is still not fast enough it is possible to convert MetalOre too. The concentration of Metal is 70 times higher in MetalOre than stock Ore. A patch for the stock drill is included to mine MetalOre.\n\nThe mod is compatible to Extraplanetary Launchpads OR SimpleConstruction.\n\nIncluded is also a little experimental modlet called \u0022OreScience\u0022. It adds Ore Samples as a new science experiment to the stock drill. It was very easy to set up but I hope for some feedback before I put more work into this.\n\nHave fun with the update!\n\n**Future plans:**  \n\nFor 0.9 I plan to focus on recycling. The ChemicalReactor needs more work. I\u0027m still struggeling with a deployable launchpad but no result I like so far.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n\\*\\*2016-11-26 - Balancing update one - v0.8.1\\*\\*\n\n\\* New part: KD-ChemicalReactor (Ore --\u003E Metal\u002B\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E)  \n\n\\* New parts: KD-T250XFS (X=variant) 2.5 m non-passable Storage Tanks in 3 sizes (1, 2, 3 m).  \n\n\\* New parts: KD-T375XFS (X=variant) 3.75 m non-passable Storage Tanks in 3 sizes (1, 3, 6 m).  \n\n\\* New part: KD-T3252FS 3.75 m to 2.5 m non-passable Storage Tank adapter (2 m).  \n\n\\* Removed parts: KD-T125FS and KD-T250FS.  \n\n\\* Increased Furnace conversion speed (~15 times faster, extr.-rate remains 1%-mass).  \n\n\\* Added MetalOre --\u003E Metal converter to Furnace by default (~70%-mass extr.-rate).  \n\n\\* Added MetalOre harvester to Stock drill (Big one only).  \n\n\\* Increased 3D-Printer conversion speed (~21 times faster, conv.-rate remains 100%-mass).  \n\n\\* Reduced 3D-Printer mass to 1.85 tons.  \n\n\\* Included compatibility patch for SimpleConstruction.  \n\n\\* Updated converter specialty to ExperienceEffect (3D Printer,Furnace = ConverterSkill; ChemicalReactor = ScienceSkill)  \n\n\\* Added Bulkheadprofiles.  \n\n\\* Added tags.  \n\n\\* Added ScienceExperiment: OreScience to Stock Drill (Big one only).\n\nBig thank you to [@Dr Farnsworth](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147177-dr-farnsworth/) for all the time and effort you\u0027ve taken for testing and supporting this mod!"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader_guy","CreatedById":137198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T22:03:23Z","Content":"![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) I had no idea this mod was still alive!\n\nI\u0027m glad I found it again, I really loved playing around with it like a year ago"},{"CreatedByName":"Odonian","CreatedById":170403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T22:08:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m interested in using this alongside MKS, but I\u0027m not seeing the option to convert metalore to metal in the furnace, just ore-\u003Emetal."},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T00:40:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Invader\\_guy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) I had no idea this mod was still alive!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m glad I found it again, I really loved playing around with it like a year ago\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I was going for a dramatic ... ...
