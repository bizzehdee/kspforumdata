This isn\u0027t a complete game-breaking hack, nor was it ever meant to be. As I\u0027ve played KSP, I\u0027ve found that setting up colonies is a tedious job. Not only do I have to launch the base (and if it\u0027s on another planet, do the whole transfer window dance and wait 6 months while my poor Kerbals twiddle their thumbs), I have to expand and maintain it, which means running a series of missions, every single one of which will have to do the aforementioned transfer window dance.
