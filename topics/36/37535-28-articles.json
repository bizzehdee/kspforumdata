The stock navball is a prop, and is instantiated in a cockpit via settings in the config file for the cockpit. So you could edit the config to remove the stock navball and add another one. Helldiver would have to provide a suitable model for the navball holder so that the navball appears with the same visibility as the original one. You could also use a similar technique to add standalone MFD units to stock cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could just use my yet-to-be-released material overriding plugin I have been developing for the shuttle to make the navball emissive and use Helldiver\u0027s textures.

It should not be used just to get the engines pointing roughly at the COM. That is the job of the engine pivot hinges. Luckily it will only be an action key or two to get the engines pointing in the right direction, since pivot presets can be written into the config file. Making use of the pivots like this ensures that the gimbals have the approximately the same freedom of movement in both negative and positive pitch directions for attitude changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Imca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Imca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow many parts is the shuttle itslef comprised of, and do they use a node connection system if I may ask?\u003Cp\u003EOr is it all one part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can bear to trawl back through this thread, you will find that the shuttle is split into several parts, all attached by the normal attachment node system (for the time being - I am working on an improved system). The shuttle itself comprises of a maximum of 20 parts, if you include the avionics in the nose cone and the docking adapter. The reason that it is split into so many parts is partially due to artificial limitations needlessly imposed by KSP, and also partly due to some inaccurate advice helldiver received early on in the modelling process. It also helps to have the shuttle split into several parts when you consider the variety of status information and buttons you will find in the context menus. If it was one part that context menu would be very long, and some of the menu items would be identical due to there being more than one of some modules on the part (such as the engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf necessary I can try welding parts together at a later date.
