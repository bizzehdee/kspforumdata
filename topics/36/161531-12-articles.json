No, rally, if you can power the Gigawatts electric plasma thrusters, even if the electrolysis is highly inefficent, Power is not realy an issue on a nuclear/fusion powered rocket. I guess it\u0027s just a matter of scaling up the processing, which in game term means mass. When electric thrusters/magnetic nozzles use hydrogen for propulsion, they are not going to use a lot of it, which is kind of the whole point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the reason I want to do this is because in 1 m3 you can store 702.1 kg of Liquid Ammonia, from which 17.647% mass is Hydrogen meaning 123.9 kg of Hydrogen / m3. Compare this with raw Liquid Hydrogen storage of only 70.85 kg of Hydrogen / m3, and it becomes obvious that storing Hydrogen, is 75% more compact when stored as Ammonia. Also Ammonia Boiloff temperature is much higher, meaning less heavy tanks. The Nitrogen itself is universal propellant which can be used directly by both thermal and electric propusion, making it ideal for high thrust application, like landing on a mun, where you want maximum trust just before landing, or at takeoff when getting back into orbit. Nitrogen is almost litteraly the Nitro of interstellar rocketry! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA potential bonus of Ammonia is that the stuff can be used in a fuel cell. This would be ideal as an alternative power source when cooling down the Nuclear Reactor and you need to keep your crew alive. Instead of using clumsy solar panels which don\u0027t work after mars/duna or in the shadow, you would have reliable power source from a Ammonia fuel cell.

MMH and UDMH, meanwhile, are just Hydrazine with either one or two methyl-groups tacked on, respectively. So if you have a source of Methane available (Sabatier Reaction anyone?), Hydrazine (see above), and an ISRU refinery- then you can just combine the Methane and Hydrazine to get MMH or UDMH and a volume of Hydrogen as by-product equal to half the volume of Methane you put in...

To get NTO all you have to do is combine one part Nitrogen gas and two parts Oxygen gas together (there are some catalysts and co-catalysts involved, but we don\u0027t really need to care about them, as they are not consumed by the reaction...) VOILA! You have an unlimited quantity of highly-dense fuels that will never boil-off and will spontaneously ignite when mixed with NTO- perfect for your offworld refueling bases!

Figuring out creative and efficient ways to utilize the environment to your best advantage is half the fun of ISRU! (It\u0027s a bit like legos- you have this reaction that does this, and that reaction that does that- but how do you select the right reactions and design your mission-plan to get the propellant you want as efficiently as possible? For instance, do you set up a surface-base on the ground, or use Propulsive Fluid Accumulators from orbit?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ABZB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ABZB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKeep in mind that per-mol of Urea you decompose, you have insufficient O2 to make all CO2 - you\u0027re going to end up with extra C that has to go with \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E - unless we let pure C dust be an intermediate resource (like alumina) and let it be used for various reactions noted above.
