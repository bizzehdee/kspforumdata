Some of you may remember from before the great server fire that I was working on a full Apollo/Saturn replica. I\u0027ve finally gotten back to work on it, and have been spending a little time each day converting everything to Unity 4, fixing collision meshes, finishing models that needed it, resizing the Saturn parts so they\u0027re more compatible with other modpacks, fighting with folding ladder animations, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForum user Razorcane is on the development team now and has been doing a fantastic job cleaning up models and creating some beautiful textures for the LM/CSM parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/apollo-lmcsm-replica\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EClick here to download the current Beta release!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sb1sXLZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sb1sXLZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I should note here that the Saturn parts I\u0027m using are not my own work, but are modified from the wonderful parts pack made by KingTramp back in the 0.13 era.

I\u0027ve got a collection of reference images, and hopefully myself or someone else will be able to do a better rendition than I\u0027ve got so far. As far as fairings go, I\u0027m not using fairing factory, and the ones you see are custom-made. Although, mine also have the problem that they don\u0027t attach to anything at the top. I\u0027ve tried to make the collider meshes as small as possible to reduce wobble on them, and we\u0027ll have to see how that holds up.

Then I had to go back and resize the fairings so they fit around the CM properly, then that didn\u0027t work, so I had to go back and start them over from scratch. It\u0027s been a long morning, but now I\u0027m pretty happy with the way they came out:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xvZ3wJZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xvZ3wJZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(NOTE: I know the actual Apollo fairings didn\u0027t have the black and white pattern on them. That was mostly so I could tell if they were clipping into each other at the seams or not. I\u0027ll make them the correct color for the release version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my next order of business, I think, is going to be to figure out what to do about the shaders. I thought it was just me going crazy, but I remembered stuff looking better before, but I found one of my old screenshots, and it does look worse now than it used to (the old version is on the left, the new one on the right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yroenpF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yroenpF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to figure out if it\u0027s something that changed between 0.18 and 0.19, or if something happened when I switched over to Unity 4, or if there\u0027s something else I missed. If anyone has any insight, please let me know. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: Wow, I\u0027m not very observant. I just noticed that the insignia and stuff on the tanks are different between those two images.

I just replaced them with the textures from KingTramp\u0027s original parts, but, alas, that did not make things look any better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it for today.
