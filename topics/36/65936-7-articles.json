One balance thing I am looking at is making sure that it\u0027s more effective to ship out Colony Supplies than it is to ship out food, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is (currently) not the case, simce, to support 10 Kerbals for 500 days, I either need 12.7 tons of Life Support supplies, or 20.8 tons of Colony Supplies. So building the colony is a long game - i.e. if your mission is a single trip and back, even at several years, just haul LS supplies. But if you want a permanent residence that can even generate spare food for return trips, etc. (say, a colonization of Laythe and exploration of Jool) then MKS makes sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(FYI, I\u0027ve chopped the Colony Supply requirement in my dev build by a factor of 10 to make it more inline with TAC for all MKS modules, otherwise it was just too much of a swing - over 10:1)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T03:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew version is up - ping me with any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a breaking change - specifically, the old storage hut is deprecated (new ones are available) and some of the caps have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T03:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover, what is the Interstellar planet-based science stuff you referenced?
