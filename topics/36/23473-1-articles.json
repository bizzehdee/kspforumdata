Yeah, what devogen said. I\u0027ll keep the below text for posterity.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always just add a blank animation to my object in Unity. Click on your object, then Component -\u0026gt; Miscellaneous -\u0026gt; Animations, hit ctrl-6 and create a new animation clip. You can input frames and adjust rotation in that window. Then click on the animation in the Inspector window and remove it, the original animation file will highlight in yellow in the Project window as you clicked previously. When selecting the clip in the Project window, select Wrap Mode: Loop in the Inspector window, then drag it onto the object you\u0027re animating in the Hierarchy tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this method I can do easy deploy/retract animations from Blender to export and more complex rotational type ones from Unity. This also helps me in not needing to piggy-back additional frames (ie frames 1-60, 61-100) on to the same animation file. Plus I can add multiple animation clips on to the same part this way - my project has three different clips on it. I should also add that I\u0027m using a development version of the RemoteTech.dll to test out JDP\u0027s new animation module. He\u0027s added a module that creates a master animation (MasterOf0 = True/False) that controls the mode state of all animations in a part, among other things. It can be handy like when closing a cargo bay door, but forgetting to retract the large antenna inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps send JDP a message, if anyone is interested in expanding on animations, he\u0027s (with some help from Alchemist) doing some awesome stuff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: JDP\u0027s plugin will also stop looped animations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-11T15:25:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2013 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spacegh\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6st\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHerp, derp!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
