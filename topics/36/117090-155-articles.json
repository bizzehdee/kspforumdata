I think this is fine, since these  are low-tech stations, more sophisticated hab modules would perform better. The other four seats come from the soyuz capsule itself.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In terms of supplies, 500 supplies is enough for one kerbal/month, therefore the station needs to hold 3000 supplies, with no need for recycling (low tech). The early Salyuts had no resupply, so this puts a fairly hard limit on the station lifespan. Salyut 6\u002B could dock a Progress vehicle for supply, and judging by the mission logs, it looks like one Progress could supply the full ninety day duration. This implies that the Progress can hold 3000 supplies, or three tons of cargo. Since that mostly matches the real world, that\u0027s pretty straightforward. I\u0027ll write a basic mm patch when I\u0027m in front of a pc, and see if that causes any other problems.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mir and ISS modules would require some more thought/research, as would inflatables or anything more sophisticated. Going the other direction, a MOL-like station would require minimal supplies and perhaps only one seat (for the lab) to match it\u0027s forty day mission duration.\n\u003E \n\nregarding max crew size on DOS cores, let\u0027s not forget that they had Intercosmos missions visiting the crew during a mission, which would leave Salyut 6, 7 and Mir with 5 people on board for a short time  \n\nI wonder how they managed the Mir when the Shuttle was docked and how many astronauts went to Mir for each Shuttle-Mir mission...."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T08:05:04Z","Content":"Spoiler\n\n// Progress unmanned pod \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E patch\n\n@PART[SSTU-SC-A-SMX]:HAS[@MODULE[SSTUVolumeContainer]]:NEEDS[USILifeSupport]  \n\n{      \n\n    @MODULE[SSTUVolumeContainer]  \n\n    {  \n\n        @CONTAINER,1[\\*]  \n\n        {  \n\n            resource = Supplies  \n\n            resource = Mulch  \n\n        }  \n\n    }  \n\n}\n\nSSTU\\_RESOURCEVOLUME  \n\n{  \n\n    name = Supplies  \n\n    volume = 1  \n\n}\n\nSSTU\\_RESOURCEVOLUME  \n\n{  \n\n    name = Mulch  \n\n    volume = 1  \n\n}\n\n//duplicate and adjust the electricCharge definition;  \n\n//done as a copy because NEEDS blocks apparently do not work on regular definitions?\n\n\u002BRESOURCE\\_DEFINITION[ElectricCharge]:NEEDS[\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E]  \n\n{  \n\n    @name = SSTUKISStorage  \n\n    %flowMode = ALL\\_VESSEL  \n\n    %transfer = PUMP  \n\n    %isTweakable = false  \n\n    %isVisible = false  \n\n    %volume = 1  \n\n    %density = 0  \n\n    %cost = 0  \n\n    %hsp = 0  \n\n}\n\n//add the dummy resource to the given containers and tanks  \n\n@PART[SSTU-SC-A-SMX]:NEEDS[\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E]  \n\n{      \n\n    @MODULE[SSTUVolumeContainer]  \n\n    {  \n\n        @CONTAINER,1[\\*]  \n\n        {  \n\n            resource = SSTUKISStorage  \n\n        }\n\n    }  \n\n    !MODULE[ModuleKISInventory]{}  \n\n    MODULE  \n\n    {  \n\n        name = ModuleKISInventory  \n\n        maxVolume = 0  \n\n        externalAccess = true  \n\n        internalAccess = true  \n\n        slotsX = 4  \n\n        slotsY = 4  \n\n        slotSize = 50  \n\n        itemIconResolution = 128  \n\n        selfIconResolution = 128  \n\n        openSndPath = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/Sounds/containerOpen  \n\n        closeSndPath = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/Sounds/containerClose  \n\n        defaultMoveSndPath = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/Sounds/itemMove  \n\n    }  \n\n}\n\nGoing to be a silly question.

As such I\u0027ve had to scale back the plans for those parts a bit (was a single part, now will be multiple distinct parts, with much reduced modularity and customization options ).\n\nThe lack of module-switching functionality has led to the following reduction in capabilities from what I had originally wanted/intended for the parts.\n\n- They cannot have integrated docking ports or else the end-cap selection will have to be limited to adapters for that chosen docking ports size, greatly limiting the possible integration opportunities for the part.\n- They cannot have multiple solar panel options due to no ability to add or remove the modules to manage them.  So only the \u0027core\u0027 of the model will have solar panels.\n- They will have a single \u0027core\u0027 model for each part.  No ability to add/remove the lab module means I cannot readily have multiple core variants.\n- Each \u0027core\u0027 will have to become its own distinct part with various module/config settings to differentiate them.  Some will have more storage, some more lab capacity (or none),\n- Only a single pre-set crew capacity and IVA for each part; no \u0027core\u0027 switching means that switching of IVAs and crew setup is unnecessary.\n\nSo.. with the removal of all of that, what is left that they will have for features?\n\n- Ability to select the top and bottom adapter caps; 1.25m and 0.625m caps will be included by default, as well as the 1.875m VA adapter and possible a short flat-topped 1.875m adapter.  Top will also include an optional \u0027hub\u0027 multi-adapter (1.25m x 5 nodes).  They will not include docking ports or solar panels unfortunately.\n- Integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (as part of the core model)\n- Integrated Solar Panels (as part of the core model)\n- Integrated OMS (orbital engines) -- small low thrust hypergolic thrusters for orbital adjustment and rendezvous.  Integrated into the \u0027bottom cap\u0027 adapter.  ALL of the DOS based modules will have this capability.\n- You still get the VA capsule (and its SM and LAS)... so that\u0027s something.  1.875m, 3-man re-entry pod.  This will actually become ShipCore: Series-D when it is completed.  It will be situated somewhat later in the tech tree, likely around the stock 2.5m capsule.\n\nThey will be able to function as \u0027low part count\u0027 stations with the addition of a couple of docking ports of your choice; everything else should be taken care of (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, engine, power generation, storage).  Most, or perhaps all of them, will come with some sort of lab capacity; the crew count and storage for the lab will vary with the \u0027core\u0027 model, though I haven\u0027t settled on any particular balance yet.\n\nNowhere near as grand of a concept as I had originally, but should still greatly reduce the part-count needed for creating these types of station modules (down from ~12 to 3.. so still substantial part savings), while still allowing for some variation and customization of the parts to better integrate them into various designs.\n\nMost of the other part concepts that I had planned should still be possible.  The large multi-axis solar truss parts are definitely still doable, as are the inflatable module parts.  Welding docking ports should still be a thing.  Multi-docking hubs would still work but they would likely be limited to a single set of models for the ports (e.g. could be no port-size switching; -might- be able to work around this a bit, but unsure if I want to).\n\nStill going to give this all a bit more thought before I commit to anything on these parts.  I\u0027m really not happy with the limitations to the (now not very) modular station core parts, but I cannot currently fathom any way around them.\n\nRegarding the USOS styled station parts -- I\u0027m really not sure there is anything that I can do to improve on those that other mods\u0027 already offer.  I can\u0027t integrate docking ports, and they already have a built in \u0027adapter\u0027 on them, so there is no need for top/bottom adapter switching (or is there?).  At this point I\u0027m not sure that I\u0027ll be doing any USOS styled station parts, it seems unnecessary given that other mods\u0027 already have those parts in the appropriate sizes."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-22T19:23:07Z","Content":"I\u0027ve said before, but one of the hurdles that I\u0027ve certainly found in careers (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS) is the lack of decent habitation parts.

Due to the other limitations in place each variant is its own stand-alone part, which has its good and bad points.  It is a bit of editor part-list bloat, but it gives an excellent chance to differentiate the setup of the parts a bit; perhaps one has more lab capacity, or no lab, or one comes with built-in science experiment packages, or (thinking ahead) one has better/integrated life-support systems or greenhouse.\n\nCurrently I have 6 core variants (including the TKS body), 6 top adapters (including the VA and hub adapters), and 4 bottom adapters (soon will be at least 5).  They can potentially use any of the other top/nose options from the MFTs or SRBs, however the bottom adapters have built-in engines so the selection is more limited (the alternative that I\u0027m considering is building the engines into the core, greatly simplifies the module interaction code and is actually where some of the modules had their engines).\n\nSpeaking of which... this mess of modules sits at 23 parts (28 if the blank hub was covered in docking ports).  That count is including an SC-A-SMX, a full SC-A OM/DM/SM, and a full VA/TKS spacecraft, so the station itself is only 14/19 parts (of which more than half is docking ports).  If I can make some workable multi-docking hubs, that count could be even further reduced.  The use of welding docking ports between the modules could also reduce the part count (though I\u0027m unsure on the clearance if the stock ports were removed; I may make additional longer adapter options for use with the welding ports).  (only prototype/testing parts, and only about half-way working so far.... still lots to do, and at this point I\u0027m still figuring out what will or will not work)\n\n![iAKM4Pc.png](http://i.imgur.com/iAKM4Pc.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-23T15:20:33Z","Content":"Would you be down to making a cylinder probe core (tweakable size) that has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and parachutes on the edges?

Between the removal of features (such as album layout selection), the constant site \u0027updates\u0027 (which really just remove more features; such as the ability to auto-upload into an album), and the recent breakage of albums on the forum... its time to move on to something new (or old in this case; but at least old and working rather than new and busted).\n\nImages will be moved to being hosted on the SSTULabs - Github-Wiki (or perhaps github pages... undecided; really don\u0027t feel like writing any HTML).  This means that albums will be gone entirely, and that many older links will simply be broken and not fixed (I\u0027ll fix recent links, but anything more than a few days/week old is going to remain broken)."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T05:17:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Freaking massive things compared to all others available (they even dwarf the largest Near-Future panels by quite a bit).\n\u003E \n\nNo such thing as massive or \u0022freakin\u0027 massive\u0022.

Shows how much chance I get to play around with other mods =\\\n\nLast night/today was more work on getting the prototype parts laid out and \u0027working\u0027. \n\nAll of the DOS modules are in-game with some slight variations between them (still working on it).  Apparently the stock science-lab doesn\u0027t support any sort of \u0027max crew\u0027, so any kind of lab-equipped part is an all-or-nothing affair (no way to set crew capacity to 3 and lab capacity to 1); not exactly what I wanted, but... oh-well, it\u0027ll still work.  Reduced the number of new adapters to be created by using the existing MFT adapters where appropriate; the new ones entail a 4-1 aspect ratio (flat/short/long), 3-1/3-2 extended (extra-long), and 1-1, 1-1-ext, 2-1, 3-1, 4-3 styled \u0027hubs\u0027.  Moved all of the engines to be part of the core model rather than the bottom-cap adapter; this means that they can now use the full range of bottom adapters that are available on the MFTs/other parts (potentially even the engine mounts).\n\nStarted work on the placeholder COS modules (these are the USOS equivalents); initial thoughts are for 6-9 module variants with S/M/L sizes for each Hab, Lab, Storage.  Currently using the stock hitchhiker and science lab modules for these, but may put together a couple prototype models before the weekend.\n\nCreated two more sizes of inflatable hab modules for a total of three, so now there are 2.5m, 3.75m, and 5m cores for them (they expand to double that size when inflated).  These have modular end-caps the same as the DOS/COS/MFT parts.\n\nCreated initial prototype geometry for three different sizes of DOS module solar panels; the TKS will get the shortest/smallest size, but unsure on which modules will get the other two.  This brings the total solar panels available with the StationCore parts up to 4 variants, with potentially a couple more to come.  These will all be available as stand-alone parts as well as being integrated into the various modules where applicable.\n\nCreated two new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pod variants, 6 and 8 port angled; these re-use the textures/geometry from the SC-GEN-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-4F-T upper-stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks.  Moved from having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E built into the DOS models to having them added through MODEL nodes; simplifies model creation and makes it easy for others to replace the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks if they wish (and for me to replace them later if I wish).  These \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pods will also be available as stand-alone parts.\n\nStill left to work on prototypes for are the toroidal parts (inflatable centrifuge based on Nautilus-X, rigid centrifuge, static docking ring/storage torus), proper COS module prototype models, and the multi-docking hubs.  Seems likely that they\u0027ll have the same limitations as the other station parts -- single non-resizable core model with modular end-cap/adapter selection.  This means that there will be one distinct part per-model created, without any user-selectable rescaling; the only \u0027options\u0027 will be for the end-caps.  I\u0027m imagining 5 multi-docking hub variants (0.625m, mixed 0.625/1.25, 1.25, mixed 1.25/2.5, and 2.5).  Likely will end up with 6 different torus parts, two each for the different types (inflatable, centrifuge, static).\n\nUpdated DOS modules with changed main-engine setup/location/geometry (solar panels not shown, and apparently I missed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the far left module in this render; adapter selection has also changed since this render, but it is mostly to show the engine changes anyhow):\n\n![ST-FGB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-FGB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true)\n\nUpdated selection of inflatable modules (top to bottom, 2.5m, 3.75m, 5m core diameters; double those sizes for inflated diameters).  Note that these will all likely have a short cylinder cap on them so that I can add a hatch to each part; the modular adapter will sit on top of that hatch section.\n\n![ST-HAB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-HAB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true)\n\nAnd, most of the current prototypes assembled in-orbit (sorry, forgot to get a part count... but it is pretty low); mostly was just testing to see if any modules were mis-behaving and making sure that all of the engines and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E worked as expected (VA capsule and engine are from another mod; Tantares I believe... they just happened to be the proper size / fully compatible)\n\n![ST-StationCore-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-StationCore-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true)"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T21:18:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Leave it to you guys to find something even more ridiculously massive.

This will mark the transition into the 0.5.xxx releases (sadly, still no \u0027stable\u0027 releases as I\u0027m still waiting on wheels).  Note that for a few releaes these parts will be prototypes only; simple models, no textures, but should be \u0027feature complete\u0027 and the overall shape and size of the models should be about right.  Ideally you should be able to transition from using the prototypes to using the finished parts with little to no side-effect (just prettier models); fair warning though, there might be a few parts that will have geometry changed, and might be a few module/config changes as well (mostly based on feedback on the prototypes).\n\nDoing the entire set as prototypes before I start any real/detail work on even a single part.  Have had a few cases where parts don\u0027t mesh well together previously and feel that putting the entire set out there while things can still be changed should give an opportunity to spot and fix these problems before they are too difficult/time consuming to fix.\n\nSo, if all goes well you should be able to start playing around with them soon.  Won\u0027t be very pretty initially, but all of the function should be there.\n\nOn a different note; does anyone have knowledge of how the ISS solar arrays deploy the central truss?  From watching some videos of them being deployed the truss just magically keeps streaming out from the base container (~35m long truss comes out of a ~2m long container).  I was expecting some scissor-like deployment of the truss... but it appears to come out of the container fully assembled.  Obviously there is some sort of folding going on for the truss inside of that container, but I\u0027ve not been able to locate anything on it.\n\nDoes anyone have any information on the mechanism they use for folding / compacting the truss for storage?  (I\u0027m probably just going to \u0027fake\u0027 something, but am curious for knowledge sake)"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T23:00:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone have any information on the mechanism they use for folding / compacting the truss for storage?\n\u003E \n\nThis is what I found. \n\n[P3/P4 Truss Unfolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISS_P3-P4_Truss_unfolding.ogg)\n\nSeems like the wiki states the solar arrays were stored in an unpressurized cargo container and attached to the rotating joint, then unfolding in the manner in which you see in the animation. Kinda makes you wonder just how fragile those solar arrays really are?\n\n\u0022Major P3 and S3 subsystems include the Segment-to-Segment Attach System (SSAS), [Solar Alpha Rotary Joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Truss_Structure#Solar_alpha_rotary_joint) (SARJ), and Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS). The primary functions of the P3 truss segment are to provide mechanical, power and data interfaces to payloads attached to the two UCCAS platforms; axial indexing for solar tracking, or rotating of the arrays to follow the sun, via the SARJ; movement and work site accommodations for the [Mobile Transporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2#Mobile_Base_System \u0022Canadarm2\u0022). The P3/S3 primary structure is made of a hexagonal shaped aluminum structure and includes four bulkheads and six longerons. The S3 truss also supports [EXPRESS Logistics Carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPRESS_Logistics_Carrier \u0022EXPRESS Logistics Carrier\u0022) locations, first to be launched and installed in the 2009 time frame.\u0022\n\nHonestly, I cannot find anything quickly on this subject as far as how it got on there to begin with. Unless you can read the entire engineering schematic (or understand it), looks like you\u0027re going to have to fake it. I am sure there\u0027s more people out there that know more than I do on the subject. \n\nEDIT:\n\nThinking on the texturing for the inflatables. I don\u0027t know how hard it would be to pull off a \u0022hab canvas white\u0022, but that\u0027ll do. Unless you want to subject them to the tank textures, which will be fine.

Seems likely that they\u0027ll have the same limitations as the other station parts -- single non-resizable core model with modular end-cap/adapter selection.  This means that there will be one distinct part per-model created, without any user-selectable rescaling; the only \u0027options\u0027 will be for the end-caps.  I\u0027m imagining 5 multi-docking hub variants (0.625m, mixed 0.625/1.25, 1.25, mixed 1.25/2.5, and 2.5).  Likely will end up with 6 different torus parts, two each for the different types (inflatable, centrifuge, static).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Updated DOS modules with changed main-engine setup/location/geometry (solar panels not shown, and apparently I missed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on the far left module in this render; adapter selection has also changed since this render, but it is mostly to show the engine changes anyhow):\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![ST-FGB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-FGB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-FGB-Preview-07-25-16.png?raw=true \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Updated selection of inflatable modules (top to bottom, 2.5m, 3.75m, 5m core diameters; double those sizes for inflated diameters).

Maybe using the same ones that are already on the Orion SM, but only 2 of them instead of 4. Or maybe multiple types that can be swapped out?\n\u003E \n\nI have no problem with the concept; I would in fact love to have parts setup like that.  Sadly, as was seen recently with the station parts debacle (that almost made me quit modding), stock code does not support PartModule switching which would be needed to make this work properly/generically.\n\nIts not impossible to implement without module-switching, but any implementation would be a bit hacky and prone to failure/breakage.  Basically it would require a very low-level integration between the fuel tank managing code and the solar panel managing code; and I really don\u0027t want all my fuel tanks to carry around solar panels / the code to manage them.  The other option is a custom fuel tank module just for the lander-parts that has the solar-panel integration; but that is a ton of work for only a few fuel tanks.\n\nI -might- at some point in the distant future (when I am reworking the lander-core parts as is scheduled) be willing to write a custom module to manage it, but certainly not in the near future / for the next few months."}]}
