The game is called Labyrinthian, and I\u0027ve had a heck of a time working on it. Its still in a proto stage, as its a pretty big game by rpg standards, but its coming along.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of a game pitch, its a game about shaping your character\u0027s legend. In other games you\u0027d find cool lore about these wild characters that did things way cooler than what you can do in the game; in Labyrinthian, you get to be those wild characters other games use as background lore. You see that dragon over there, by that mountain? You \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E suplex that dragon, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ebreak\u003C/strong\u003E the mountain with it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it goes farther than that, as the game seeks to deliver a truly reactive, living world where, even if you and your party decide to just be fantasy Bakers (and they can, its fully supported!), the world will change and develop around them as they play. And if they do decide to get involved, then they can start forging a legacy that will persist even past their own lifetimes. Your character\u0027s great grandchildren could very well still be dealing with the fallout of your original choices.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeature wise, we got:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTactical, fast-paced combat that scales cleanly, and effortlessly, from the grit of 1v1 Duels to the dire slaying of complex boss monsters, to epic slug fests between the tens of thousands amongst the forces of Good and Evil. You will witness the reality of warfare in a world of high magic. Featuring a core system revolving around the Combat Grid, inspired by the Tactical Grid of the upcoming game Hollows and featuring a hybrid of Position and Zone play, Combat is an intricate tactics game thats easy to learn and effortlessly fun.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn expansive and wide open character building system that hybridizes classic\u00A0Class systems with an Elder Scrolls style Skill\u002BPerk system. Make a character in minutes, and realize their potential in how you play.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n20 Base Classes and 80 Subclasses, all of which can be mix and matched and built up in any order you choose. You want to take all the subclasses at once?\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EGo for it, its balanced.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCrafting - Inspired by Tears of the Kingdom, the game will feature an elaborate, and relatively realistic, crafting and gathering system, allowing you an unprecedented amount of expression in what your character will make of the things they find in the world. A sword is no mere combination of a couple ingots and some leather strips, but of potentially many different metals, leathers, woods, and oils, all of which will provide unique and emergent properties as you combine them. The cost of your creations is that they won\u0027t last forever, but this is a good thing; as your equipment degrades, you\u0027ll be able to repair them and add new materials to gain temporary abilities, and if you let your weapons break (or, with the right Skill, do so deliberately), you can add these new abilities permanently. Sprinkle some Springhorn\u00A0into your sword as you sharpen it, and it\u0027ll gain the Boomerang property, and will fly back to your hand after being thrown at a target a few times. Reforge your broken sword with it, and you\u0027ll be able to do it forever. And all this before we even start talking about Magic!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA True Exploration System - Exploring the world is the bread and butter of an adventure in Labyrinthian, and as you learn more about the world, your characters will find Inspiration in their knowledge, and will be able to leverage what they\u0027ve learned not just to succeed in the challenges they find out there, but in the greater schemes of play. Seek out and discover new places to build, to gather, and to explore, or don\u0027t! Exploring is about more than just striking out into the wilderness; its about learning. Find out that big bad evil guy is weak to bananas? You\u0027re Exploring!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA Systemic Living World - Building out from very simple mechanics governing the passage of Time, the gameworld will come alive as play continues, and narratives begin to emerge. Entire Cultures could rise and fall and change, and heroes and villains will come forth to inevitably face each other. Your characters Reputations will invite challengers and pleas for help, and as you affect others they\u0027ll affect you back, whether they be Rivals or Allies.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFull Integration of Improv - Its an open secret that much of whats enjoyable about RPGs is just improv; we call it roleplaying, but there\u0027s a whole lot more we can do than just pretend to be elves. Improvisation is useful and supported in nearly every sector of the game, from Combat to Exploration to Questing.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEasy Set Up - The game only needs a World map and the Combat Grid, and new characters can be drawn up in minutes. World Keepers, the Game Masters, will need a bit more, but the game has your back, with innovative tools to get you in the game. The Quantum Statblocks and Quantum Quest Blocks will help you improvise enemies and entire questlines all on the fly, and the gameworld is designed to be easily managed with nothing more than a Calendar and a handful of Region\u00A0Sheets.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEasy Integration with all Playstyles - Don\u0027t want to just play with an abstract grid and some tokens? The game\u0027s got you; you can build as elaborate a set up as you want and the Combat Grid is easily applied to it. Don\u0027t want to engage with this elaborate living world? Thats fine too; the game will only break if you stop playing it. Want to play without a World Keeper? Co-op is easy. Want to just play by yourself? Go solo!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=====\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, yeah lol.

Im going to have a healthy amount of free time so I don\u0027t see any issues there).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the mod, my plan is to first get over the hurdle I originally ran into when I stalled out originally, which had to do with getting Kerbin to work as I wanted it to. Essentially as I wanted to go all out and support detailed underwater topography, the height maps and their related settings have to be set just right and that was a fickle thing to get right. (Otherwise the land topography gets wack)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut push comes to shove, I can table that particular feature and just get the actual surface working as a stopgap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there I\u0027ll be going through each world and just tuning them up essentially, cleaning up anything I no longer like and ensuring the basic visuals are all in place. As volumetrics are a thing I\u0027ll be looking at that too and seeing what all it can do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that stage, whenever that will be, I will be moving the mod into an ongoing, public testing phase. The goal there will be for you fine folks to help me tune each worlds topography to cull any wackiness; on-orbit visuals are pretty simple for me to deal with solo but I\u0027ll definitely want the help when it comes to the surface, particularly down the line when I want to start doing scatters, launch sites, and whatever else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes I don\u0027t see any reason why this can\u0027t be set up with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E at some point. Probably not during testing, but with releases yes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo ultimately just bear with me. Time is the enemy now and I just have to hurry up and kill a whole lot of it lol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spikemaster","CreatedById":232968,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-15T08:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224372644\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710442370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0027th\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, G\u0027th said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see any reason why this can\u0027t be set up with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat! this is seeming more and more like a no-brainer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the new moon of Duna \u0027Mic\u0027, the new moon of Sarnus \u0027Lypso\u0027 and the new locations of Gilly and Bop a part of the base mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224372644\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710442370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0027th\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, G\u0027th said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime is the enemy now and I just have to hurry up and kill a whole lot of it lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll right.
