Thank you for your work on the Mass Driver Mod. I have played around with the mass driver quite a bit and wanted to publish some findings. First, If you have trouble getting your mass driver\u0027s payload into the correct position, vector, and state of individuality/un-attachedness at the same time, there is another mod I found essential called \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHangar\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E, by allista. The hangar mod stores parts or complete rockets virtually until you want desire their release. The hangar objects are similar to the cargo bay on a C-17. Anyway I found that if you strap a hangar onto a mass driver, the hangar will create the payload un-attached and on demand. Even better, the payload is bound in all but one direction by the hangar walls. This came in handy when I was trying to fire a payload perpendicular to gravity or in an air resistance or otherwise accelerating environment-- when using decouplers for this my payload would fall away faster than I could arm and fire the mass driver.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe specific hangars useful for this were the spaceport and the spaceplane hangar.

Instead of storing premade vessels, EL allows you to build new vessels by drilling for ore. In similar fashion to the hangar mod, once your vessel is built, EL creates a new, unnattached and individual ship upon its launchpad. This was a great way to build and launch new vessels offworld, espescially in vacuum or low atmosphere environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I wanted to mention that I have been altering Squad\u0027s aerodynamic fairings that came with ksp1.0. I find that if I change the melting temperature to that of Silicon Carbide I can use the fairing to protect all of the parts inside it suitable for being mass driven in atmosphere. I also needed to offset the center of mass in order to keep the fairing-stored vessel from flipping-- at mass driver speeds flipping creates torques and angular momentum that destroy everything. I am still experimenting, trying to get closer and closer to something more realistic, but in the meantime I\u0027ll post the code I have changed.

Which would probably require Extraplanetary Launchpads and building the Mass Drivers on site- as it would take an insane rocket to lift a 50-meter long stack of Mass Drivers to the Mun in one piece...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dunebugmi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dunebugmi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFinally, I wanted to mention that I have been altering Squad\u0027s aerodynamic fairings that came with ksp1.0.

Install Procedural Parts and RealFuels mods, and place a small Procedural Parts fuel-tank *just behind* the nose of the fairing filled with LeadBallast (a resource from RealFuels specifically-intended for use to change the Center of Mass of vessels to improve their aerodynamic stability...)

Real life has really been getting in the way of Kerballing, as has a certain frustration on my part than 1.0x just isn\u0027t stable on my computer like 0.90 was. I\u0027m hoping 1.1 will be better- because the frequent CTD\u0027s in 1.0x (even completely unmodded) have driven me bonkers and to other games in my free time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been working on a video project to carry out a Constellation-style mission to Duna in Real Solar System 6.4x in what limited Kerbal time I have been spending, as well as trying to get back into the swing of KSP-Interstellar Extended (another mod I helped get off the ground and develop) modding...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, down to business a little. I will have to take a look at the actual files Aaron released, but immediately, I noticed this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AaronLS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AaronLS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy default mine isn\u0027t going to be as powerful, however I will have a field in the part config that you can multiply the power if you want to jack it way up. I just think it\u0027s a way overpowered to provide such as huge boost during launch for essentially zero cost, and I don\u0027t think even the world\u0027s most powerful magnets come close to being that powerful. Even conceptual designs of electromagnetic assisted launchers come in the form of very long tracks that slowly accelerate the payload (which would be a neat idea for a facility mod).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, Aaron, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eforce\u003C/strong\u003E the Mass Driver produces (which leads to varied acceleration based on the mass of the cargo launched) is based on real-world figures. The Mass Driver is a replica of the performance expected for the StarTram project (the generation-1 design, to be precise: which still had some room left for improvement in future generations of the design...) Which could produce, to be precise, 30 Earth-gravity\u0027s (g, or 9.81 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E) of acceleration on a 40-ton cargo. It was simply a matter of calculating and back-calculating the numbers from there to get the maximum force the part can produce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the part is not overpowered. At least not compared to the real world. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe problem is REALITY can seem a bit overpowered in a Kerbal-sized universe.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E For what it\u0027s worth, though, even at this level of performance tracks of mass-drivers many kilometers long were planned. I haven\u0027t been able to construct a stack more than 500 meters long that remained stable upon launch on Kerbin (although I suspect a larger stack might be usable in orbit, if I were to somehow get one there- which would probably require either HyperEdit or Extraplanetary Launchpads, as there is no way I\u0027ll be launching something that tall AND massive anytime soon...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind also that the reason every real-world design includes very long track lengths (often 10-12 km or longer) is both to reduce the acceleration rate to something humans can more easily handle (when designing the system to only accelerate a tiny capsule, rather than a giant 40-ton rocket carrying lots of cargo...) and to not only escape the atmosphere, but do so as horizontal speeds closely approaching orbital velocity- so only a tiny push is necessary to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been known as far back as Aristotle and Archimedes that the faster you travel through a think medium like air or water, the more drag you encounter- and that this requires an exponentially faster entry speed to exit that medium with a slightly faster exit speed, or travel through a slightly thicker medium. Real world mass driver designs are meant to launch on a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eshallow trajectory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (which GREATLY increases path-length through the atmosphere), after a long low-g acceleration (not to exceed 3 g\u0027s for a manned capsule, typically) and still be traveling horizontally at close to orbital velocity at apoapsis: which all mean that a MUCH longer mass driver track is necessary than what is needed, say, to simply launch straight up at high enough speeds to catapult a cargo at high G\u0027s onto a suborbital trajectory that narrowly escapes the atmosphere and is moving very slowly at apoapsis...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I appreciate your efforts to keep this mod alive Aaron. I hope you will carefully think about what I posted. If you\u0027d be willing, I\u0027d love to officially bring you on as a co-developer of this mod- however I really strongly do wish to keep the \u0022standard\u0022 version of this mod as closely based on real-world performance as possible. So, it will kind of be a requirement that you be willing to develop a version that is based on real-world designs for which hard numbers can be found for the expected performance (at least, how many g\u0027s you could accelerate such-and-such a mass rocket at), such as StarTram...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaron, I will send you a PM- but to be clear, I would very much like to bring you in on this project. I am thinking of starting a version 0.2.x thread for a re-designed version incorporating some of your changes. It would be nice to have somebody with more proficiency in code and code-writing working on this project (for the most part, I just ripped some existing code from the little-known Stanford Torus mod: with the author\u0027s permission, of course- and then then tweaked the config to match real-world data for the force produced, and for practicality increased things like the collision tolerances to reduce the chances of spontaneous explosions with long Mass Driver stacks...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind the CDDL-1 license does require us to attribute previous contributors to the project- thus, even if you go off and start a new thread without me, you would need to attribute both the creator of the Stanford Torus mod and myself (if you worked off my version) for the project. You could work off the original ST version to shorten the attribution list if you wanted, of course. Regardless, I would prefer to work WITH you rather than compete with you anyways. Your work would likely displace mine, as you are better at coding- but I could still do a lot to spread word about the mod, helping to bring in more users, as well as doing more real-world performance research (at which I am very good- being a real life scientist) and such, if we worked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T06:48:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 06:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T09:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAaronLS,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill haven\u0027t heard back from you one way or the other.
