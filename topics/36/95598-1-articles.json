This ranges from orbital tugs with prograde and retrograde engines, to VTOL\u0027s and Munbus type ships with hover engines as well as prograde and regrograde engines. Setting up engines to activate or deactivate with action groups is very simple and you can even use lights to mark which engines are active. The problem is you need to manually set up your lights to indicate active engines, you cant make them go directly to the correct state. Also pushing the U key will throw them out of sync. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I was originally thinking of lights since that\u0027s what I\u0027ve used in the past, they wouldn\u0027t actually need to cast light to be useful. A simple little surface mount box with a glowing indicator might serve just as well. Green when activated and red when deactivated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese could indicate the status of engines, karbonite or kethane converters, status of OKS/MKS modules or anything else you can switch on or off with action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone here aware of a mod like this or even just direct switchable lights?

One way to do this is to launch a vessel with two lights near the engine. A red and a green. You can then set their states to toggle on/off with the same action group key that toggles the engine. However, I am not aware of a light mod that automatically changes color with another part\u0027s activation.(Other than the MechJeb box, which changes color when MechJeb is turned on/off)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T06:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16925\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAviation Lights\u003C/a\u003E let yet you switch on, off or toggle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T14:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerba Fett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerba Fett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs anyone here aware of a mod like this or even just direct switchable lights?

You just have to click their name in the left hand column to remove them from that list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, you can bind engine A and its corresponding indicator lights to the 5 key, remove those indicator lights from the \u0027Light\u0027 category, and you should be good to go.

I just had a look at the stock lights and they have an option to turn them off or on. They must have added that recently since the last time I used lights with action groups I\u0027m sure the only option was toggle. While I could tweakscale the stock lights down for indicators I\u0027ll check out the aviation lights. If they have on/off switching like stock that\u0027s exactly what I was asking for. :^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoomerang, that\u0027s a great tip about removing lights from the switchable list.

For instance, when I was having trouble with action groups in my early days, I\u0027d discovered the on/off settings but not the toggles. For many parts, especially modded ones, the toggle was labeled as simply \u0022toggle\u0022 but not \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E it was toggling. So, in the action group setup you could have as many as six different items simply labeled as \u0022toggle\u0022 with no other identifier. It wasn\u0027t until I started searching teh forums for the answer when finally my brain caught up with me and I discovered that the toggle was related to the actions they were displayed under and it all became clear. Before that, I thought there was something wrong with the hot keys themselves and had attempted to fix the issue by editing the KSP configuration files manually to make them into \u0022toggle\u0022 keys. Needless to say, I failed because that wasn\u0027t even applicable to my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-04T22:12:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
