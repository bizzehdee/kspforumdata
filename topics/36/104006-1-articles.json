This the Large version that produces 2GW. I used a custom unit, \u0027MJ\u0027, properly defined in a Resource.cfg, and an MJ resource shows up in the resource bar. \n\nReactor:\n\n    MODULE{    name = ModuleGenerator    isAlwaysActive = true        requiresAllInputs = true        INPUT_RESOURCE            {         name = UF4         rate = 0.0000918        }        INPUT_RESOURCE        {         name = Cooling         rate = 2000        }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE        {         name = MJ         rate = 2000        }}RESOURCE{    name = ElectricCharge    amount = 0    maxAmount = 2000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = True}RESOURCE{    name = UF4    amount = 3172    maxAmount = 3172        isTweakable = true    hideflow = false}RESOURCE{    name = Cooling    amount = 0    maxAmount = 120000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = false}RESOURCE{    name = MJ    amount = 0    maxAmount = 2000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = false}\n\nNormally, it consumed \u0027Cooling\u0027 and \u0027UF4\u0027 to produce \u0027MJ\u0027. Problem: It just doesn\u0027t. The UF4 properly drains, but cooling does not and no MJ are produced.\n\nThe Reactor is supposed to be paired with a Radiator. The Radiator produces Cooling in exchange for a tiny amount of ElectricCharge. \n\nHere\u0027s the Radiator:\n\n    MODULE{    name = ModuleGenerator    isAlwaysActive = true        requiresAllInputs = true        INPUT_RESOURCE            {         name = ElectricCharge         rate = 3        }        INPUT_RESOURCE        {         name = TinCoolant         rate = 0.00005        }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE        {         name = Cooling         rate = 7000        }}RESOURCE{    name = ElectricCharge    amount = 100    maxAmount = 100        isTweakable = false    hideflow = True}RESOURCE{    name = Cooling    amount = 10000    maxAmount = 10000    maxAmount = 10000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = false}RESOURCE{    name = TinCoolant    amount = 1728    maxAmount = 1728        isTweakable = true    hideflow = false}\n\nAgain, nothing works. It drains ElectricCharge, but does not produce Cooling.\n\nProblem 2: Weird Firespitter stuff.\n\n![oeO4Jui.png](http://i.imgur.com/oeO4Jui.png)\n\nEngine animation in the VAB... it works fine on the launchpad though. This only affects parts with the firespitter module I added:\n\n    MODULE{name = FSmeshSwitchmoduleID = 0buttonName = NextpreviousButtonName = PrevobjectDisplayNames = Level A; Level B; Level C; Level DshowPreviousButton = trueuseFuelSwitchModule = falseobjects = WF0.5GW; WF1GW; WF2GW; WF5GWupdateSymmetry = trueaffectColliders = trueshowInfo = true}\n\nThe Next/Prev menu buttons appear, but clicking on them does nothing. Also, the objectDisplayNames do not appear.\n\nCan someone help me sort out this mess?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:15:51Z","Content":"Did you make Resources file ?\n\nEDIT- And from play with CFG\u0027s have seen if you \n\n    RESOURCE{    name = Cooling    [COLOR=\u0022#FF0000\u0022]amount = 0[/COLOR]   // \u003C-- If you leave this 0 it will not fill don\u0027t know why or if it\u0027s a bug but match your max and then try using the tweakable in vab to set it to 0    maxAmount = 120000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = false}\n\nEDIT- And from the Pic did you check the log looks like your throwing a error.\n\nEDIT- And you have a double max amount in lower one \n\n\u003E \n\u003E RESOURCE\n\u003E {\n\u003E \n\u003E  name = Cooling\n\u003E \n\u003E  amount = 10000\n\u003E \n\u003E  maxAmount = 10000 \u003C--- here\n\u003E \n\u003E  maxAmount = 10000 \u003C--- here\n\u003E \n\u003E  isTweakable = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  hideflow = false\n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T00:32:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T00:31:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did you make Resources file ?\n\u003E EDIT- And from play with CFG\u0027s have seen if you \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     RESOURCE{    name = Cooling    [COLOR=#FF0000]amount = 0[/COLOR]   // \u003C-- If you leave this 0 it will not fill don\u0027t know why or if it\u0027s a bug but match your max and then try using the tweakable in vab to set it to 0    maxAmount = 120000        isTweakable = false    hideflow = false}\n\nResource file:\n\n    RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = Cooling  density = 0.0  unitCost = 0  flowMode = ALL_VESSEL  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = false}RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = MJ  density = 0.0  unitCost = 0  flowMode = ALL_VESSEL  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = false}  RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = UF4  density = 0.0001  unitCost = 100  flowMode = ALL_VESSEL  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = true} RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = TinCoolant  density = 0.0001  unitCost = 5  flowMode = ALL_VESSEL  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = true} RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = LiquidHydrogen  density = 0.0004  unitCost = 0.5  flowMode = STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = true}\n\nI\u0027ll try setting the minimum values to 1.
