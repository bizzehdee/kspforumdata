It doesn\u0027t boost out NEARLY fast enough. You watch videos or GIFs of MLRSs and its a rush of noise and smoke as the rockets leave. The current M31 seems to sorta float out of the launcher before gathering speed.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. GPS works well, haven\u0027t conducted extensive testing to test maximum range, non-line of sight, etc...\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Definitely needs secondary spotting vehicle, will benefit from persistent GPS marking introduced in 9.5\n\u003E \n\u003E 4. Haven\u0027t tested explosive power against vehicles, but it seems adequate against space center\n\nExplosive power against vehicles is more than adequate, does great against my over-armored (so useless) tank\n\nQUICK EDIT: For some reason the M31 bounced off of the armor plating????\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T21:11:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MatsSanders**"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T21:48:28Z","Content":"Im sorry what?"},{"CreatedByName":"MatsSanders","CreatedById":143270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T22:49:49Z","Content":"Yup, the M31 bounced off of a tank.
