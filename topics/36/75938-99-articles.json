I think the issue with low gravity worlds is that while trying to stop, the reaction with the ground forces the craft to lift upward slightly. In high-gravity locations the craft will drop down immediately, and with an atmosphere you will also get drag from the air which forces the craft back down after this upward lift reaction occurs. On the Mun, however, there is no air-drag and the gravity is low enough that the craft lifts off the surface ever so slightly which decreases the effect that the grip of wheels would have on your forward momentum. This is not helped by the fact that brakes, in KSP, mean \u0022lets slam down on them and try to stop as quickly as possible with no regard for safety.\u0022 What you need is a braking system that slowly brings the craft to a stop so that the sudden jerking of the wheels doesn\u0027t cause miniscule airtime. I fear that with such low gravity, however, that might not help much. In this case, you may need some form of thrust to either help with braking, or simply increase the pressure on the wheels towards the ground. Alternatively, a dummy weight object might also help to keep things grounded, or a fuel tank which could be filled from a lander to add extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also testing an old mod right now that added a part which could be used to implement an ABS system to a rover. In this case, it simply pulses the brake when activated until the vehicle comes to a complete stop.

I\u0027m having a heck of a time trying to get SharpDevelop to detect and compile for .net 3.5 instead of the only error-less option that i seem to have (version 4.0) so that my attempts at plugin writing aren\u0027t thwarted by the fact that KSP is built on and reacts best to version 3.5. It\u0027s not going well. Still, if the ABS-sorta-kinda-brake-pulsing plugin works pretty well, I may look into making it easier to integrate into a rover than having to put an ugly huge part on it. It\u0027d be more \u0022kerbal\u0022 to just stick a few super short-burning solid boosters (like those landertron mod thingers) on the front and fire them off when you need to stop moving. I think the landertron mod also had the ability to be re-fueled using tiny hex-cans on EVA, like reloading an old cannon by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T01:39:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T09:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment they\u0027re just comand seats, but integrated into the cage, Darren. When I\u0027ve got the design a little more fleshed out I\u0027ll do a proper IVA with JSI transparent pod so it can be crewed at launch, driven IVA, have props and all that shenanigans. Slow paced as I\u0027m just dabbling and tinkering, but I think it\u0027ll turn into something quite cool.
