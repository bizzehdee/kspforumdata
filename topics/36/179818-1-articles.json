(Updating an existing parts mod is generally much easier, if anything needs changing at all; most simple parts made in the last 2-3 years still work as intended with little or no modification.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most basic mods rely solely on repurposing existing assets by using ModuleManager or PatchManager .cfg files. This is where your Notepad\u002B\u002B skills might be worth something, but again there\u0027s rarely a need to update these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA: On reflection, I have come across much harsher than I intended.
