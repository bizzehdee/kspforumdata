I\u0027ve been playing with it and minus a few refinements am very happy with the result. \n\nSince code is basically wrapped up, it\u0027s time to unveil what will be the next USI mod (which will be released immediately after KSP 1.0).\n\n![n7QWMRG.png](http://i.imgur.com/n7QWMRG.png)\n\n**Basic overview stuff.**\n\nMechanics wise, it\u0027s pretty simple.\n\nKerbals require supplies. Kerbals also require EC. these are both on the same timer, so I just check supplies for the status window. When Kerbals are done consuming supplies, leftovers, scraps, and \u0027anything else\u0027 is either tossed overboard, or (if storage is available) tossed into a \u0027mulcher\u0027. The resulting organic slurry is called \u0027mulch\u0027 and can be used to feed greenhouses, etc. at the player\u0027s discretion (or in the case of MKS, converted into Organics at varying levels of efficiency).\n\n15 days out, the visuals go yellow (sorry, no auto-warp-slowdown-thingie, use KAC). When supplies run out, things go into the red. If you leave them unsupplied for 15 days...\n\nwell, they just say \u0027screw it\u0027, get grouchy, and quit.\n\nThey are still in the pod. they still take up a seat. But they can\u0027t fly, can\u0027t EVA, and essentially do the Kerbal equivelant of spinning around in their office chairs, refusing to work, until resupplied. This is a design consideration in that all of us, at least once, has just flat out done goofed, and lost a whole colony of Kerbals via glich or other sadness. Yes, death/despawn will be an option. Not the default one tho.\n\nOnce resupplied, they are happy as clams and will return to work.\n\nAll of the above is code complete.\n\nFor the EVA, my plan is to put them on a similar timer (3 days vs 15 days). So stupendously long EVA times (Kerbals are durable). A kerbal left out longer than that will either go \u0027missing\u0027 and wander home as a new Kerbal (default) or death (optional). \n\nLastly. Toggleable option (default is on) for your orange suited Kerbals to be immune to the ill effects of life support. They will still consume supplies if given, but do not leave the job. This always gives a player (especially a new one) an \u0027out\u0027 to test out a manned mission before actually committing your other kerbals, etc. to a horrible death of snack deprivation.\n\nYes, it\u0027s a bit more \u0027Kerbal\u0027 than TAC-LS, but also a lot more predictable and with harder consequences than \u0027Snacks\u0027. It does, however, feel \u0027right\u0027 (at least to me) from a design standpoint.\n\nParts wise: Four. Three inline storage compartments and a radial tank. \n\nNo extra recyclers needed. No resourced added to pods (the 15 day window covers all of the Kerbin SOI so no point). No random contracts.\n\n**MKS/OKS Changes**\n\nMKS wise, closed loop just got a lot harder/more interesting (depending on your point of view).\n\nThe old C3 (now renamed to the Pioneer Module) will have a basic mulcher and greenhouse and can do recycling at 50% efficiency for up to four Kerbals.\n\nKerbitats operate at 75% efficiency.\n\nMk-IV modules (the giant biodome thingie you saw earler) operates at 90% efficiency off-world, 100% efficiency on the surface (pulling in of local material is inferred, no extra drills required).\n\nSupplies come from organics. Organics come either from mulched supply waste, or from a combo of water/substrate. So surface bases are easier to get to self sufficiency - if they are on water/substrate deposits. Orbital will always be a pain - so you will need to fly up fresh organics or keep large stores. And since organics creation is not tied to the life support loop, building large surface farms is also pretty easy now.\n\n**Dealing with hungry Kerbals**\n\nSo you can do some very interesting things. Run a command pod to dock reviving supplies/snacks to a starved out colony ship. Use one of your orange-suits to lead a mission and conserve supplies. Note that Kerbals are pretty damn aggressive about getting their snacks - the only way to lock them out of the biscuit tin is to click that little feed button by the resource on a part (same way we reserve some battery power for a probe). \n\nNote that a Kerbal about to starve (i.e. no supplies for 15 days) will in fact happily break open said biscuit tin. witty screen message included ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Design side note:**\n\nSo \u0027Mulch\u0027.\n\nWaste was used, and too generic. And I wanted something that showed that the stuff was kinda useful, not edible, and felt more \u0027kerbal\u0027 (and less like poo!) if that makes sense.\n\nThe idea of Kerbals tossing all of the spare bits and scraps into a contraption and getting out a semi-useful generic organic slurry had a certain appeal, hence the abstracted mulchers and mulch resource. \n\nThe resource itself is just \u0027supplies\u0027 and has the visual representation of a translucent, semi-rounded green cube. What are they? Well... leave that to the imagination. But the labeling will read \u0027N.O.M.S. - (Nutritional Organic Meal Substitute)\u0027 on the tins\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T16:01:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:42:45Z","Content":"Will the different stock habitable parts have different durations?

Food, Oxygen, Water.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now. Let\u0027s look at stuff we get when we start raising a bunch of plants...\n\u003E \n\u003E Plants can suck out nutrients from waste water, and some plants can be used in water purification.

Substrate and Water. Where do we get oxygen on the moon? Well, mostly from lunar regolith. Plus other interesting minerals and trace elements.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now. Let\u0027s look at the resource \u0027Supplies\u0027. Consider it an abstraction of food, oxygen, and water in one handy package. Semi-replenishable through the use of a greenhouse, fully replenishable on planetside.\n\u003E \n\u003E So less \u0027one resource\u0027 (a jar of peanut butter) and more \u0027a combined resource\u0027 (like a peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich!).\n\u003E \n\u003E Next... let\u0027s look at gameplay.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS: I add six resources to every pod, and a tank with three full and three empty (in case I care about recyclers). Lack of any one of these has precisely the same effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS. I add no resources to the pods, and a tank with one full and one empty. Lack of the one resource has the singular effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\n\u003E \n\u003E So what do three resources add?\n\u003E \n\u003E Certainly not variety. Loss of any single one still has the same penalty (death). Probably the one thing that can be said (and I agree) is that for bases, it forces you to consider multiple resources. Oh wait... I did precisely the same thing with USI-LS for base building.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS with MKS in 0.90: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make biomass to turn into food, with your greenhouses and purifiers handling the water and oxygen side of things.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make organics to turn into supplies that represent all of the stuff a Kerbal needs to live.\n\u003E \n\u003E Again... I am finding no benefit still.\n\u003E \n\u003E There are not different effects (like better food or super oxygen or something) like RealFuels... just... well, three things that at the end of the day do the same thing.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS: Penalty for losing food: Death. Water? Death. Oxygen? Death.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS: Penalty for losing supplies: Inanimation or death, your choice.\n\u003E \n\u003E Life Support should be first about gameplay and interesting mechanics, with just enough of a resource base to make that mechanic work. It should not be about making a set of resources, then figuring out gameplay mechanics to make them interesting.\n\u003E \n\u003E Someone earlier in the thread put it best.

IMO more distinct logistics channels are generally a good thing initially given this game is all logistics anyway, providing there\u0027s eventually some way to set up repeatable resupply if you find yourself running the same mission over and over. Space pipes, if you like.\n\nI\u0027m in two minds about death; I launched a ship out of my orbital dockyard and burned it away, and then realised it\u0027d taken the dockyard\u0027s entire supply of lifesupport. That brought on a panic design \u0026 launch to intercept ( not easy given it\u0027s in a huge elliptical orbit ) and I lost a kerbal on the station literally 3 mins before I managed to resupply - in the case of a go-on-strike mission I couldn\u0027t have cared less at that point, I didn\u0027t need them to do anything for a while.

Food, Oxygen, Water.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now. Let\u0027s look at stuff we get when we start raising a bunch of plants...\n\u003E \n\u003E Plants can suck out nutrients from waste water, and some plants can be used in water purification. We already know we can get oxygen from plants as a waste product, and of course we get to eat them.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now. Look at what stuff it takes to make supplies from scratch... Substrate and Water. Where do we get oxygen on the moon? Well, mostly from lunar regolith. Plus other interesting minerals and trace elements.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now. Let\u0027s look at the resource \u0027Supplies\u0027. Consider it an abstraction of food, oxygen, and water in one handy package. Semi-replenishable through the use of a greenhouse, fully replenishable on planetside.\n\u003E \n\u003E So less \u0027one resource\u0027 (a jar of peanut butter) and more \u0027a combined resource\u0027 (like a peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich!).\n\u003E \n\u003E Next... let\u0027s look at gameplay.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS: I add six resources to every pod, and a tank with three full and three empty (in case I care about recyclers). Lack of any one of these has precisely the same effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS. I add no resources to the pods, and a tank with one full and one empty. Lack of the one resource has the singular effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\n\u003E \n\u003E So what do three resources add?\n\u003E \n\u003E Certainly not variety. Loss of any single one still has the same penalty (death). Probably the one thing that can be said (and I agree) is that for bases, it forces you to consider multiple resources. Oh wait... I did precisely the same thing with USI-LS for base building.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS with MKS in 0.90: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make biomass to turn into food, with your greenhouses and purifiers handling the water and oxygen side of things.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make organics to turn into supplies that represent all of the stuff a Kerbal needs to live.\n\u003E \n\u003E Again... I am finding no benefit still.\n\u003E \n\u003E There are not different effects (like better food or super oxygen or something) like RealFuels... just... well, three things that at the end of the day do the same thing.\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC-LS: Penalty for losing food: Death. Water? Death. Oxygen? Death.\n\u003E \n\u003E USI-LS: Penalty for losing supplies: Inanimation or death, your choice.\n\u003E \n\u003E Life Support should be first about gameplay and interesting mechanics, with just enough of a resource base to make that mechanic work. It should not be about making a set of resources, then figuring out gameplay mechanics to make them interesting.\n\u003E \n\u003E Someone earlier in the thread put it best. Less tedium more funium.\n\nI see what u\u0027re doing there...\n\nBut when i think at life support for spaceship, i imagine to see lots and lots of machines interconnected into a complicate and efficient network created in order to recycle and reuse and don\u0027t waste potential resouces.\n\nAs we don\u0027t know anything about biology and physiology of kerbal\u0027s body, we can\u0027t do anything more than speculate about how a kerbal react about the lack of one of our basic needs, for example, the lack of food could put them in hybernation for years, or as kerbal are green they can be sentient plants beings, that need water, CO2 and nutrients like the plants of your greenhouse, instead of needing food and oxigen...\n\nBut as we\u0027re not Squad, the majority of the community (or what i think is the majority) assume kerbals react in the same way that humans do.\n\nSo if they don\u0027t eat they starve, if they don\u0027t breathe they soffucate, and if they don\u0027t drink they dehydrate.\n\nNow, is established that a humans can survive plenty of days without food, but they survive less then a week without water and couple minutes without oxigen!\n\nI don\u0027t think u can generalize all the needs into one \u0022supply\u0022. \u0022Life support\u0022 pratically, doesn\u0027t exist at all... it\u0027s a generic classification for all the systems that keep kerbals alive... it\u0027s a collection of needs that must be satisfied all the time. U win if u account for all of them, either if u bring with u 15 tons of supply or u build a super complex structure that weigth 5 and recycle 0.5 ton of resources continuously. If u generalize, and put all this resources in one jar of peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich, u remove the meaning of be of a life support system.\n\nI\u0027m perfectly aware that the lack of any of the resources means death but that\u0027s actually the point! It\u0027s not a metter of variety it\u0027s a matter of complexity... if i, player, want a Life support mod, i look at the ones that allow me to project, exploit and manage all the needs that my kerbal need on their missions. \n\nI look at MKS\u0027s TAC integration and i find it perfect, the more complex, the more efficient, the more valuable and satisfying the result. \n\nI want to ask u: what is for u the funium in a life support mod?\n\nAs u go for manned missions with life support mods, u submit a silent contract to find a way to provide all the things a kerbal needs in order to come back alive.\n\nFor me at least, the funium in a life support system is exactly this, find a way, efficient or not, to manage the multiple needs of my kerbals, and as life support is the biggest and the most complex system on a ship, the engeneering process to develop the most efficient life support system for a specified mission is the funium of this kind of mod. Add needs that must to be satisfied adding things. If u generalize, u minimize and this lead to something that i\u0027m not attracted anymore.\n\nIs the funium of the game iftself: engineer always better and more complex contraption that can go further. That\u0027s why i\u0027ll stick with TAC.\n\nBut, hey this is only my point of view... i don\u0027t want to argue your choices and as said before, i\u0027m still a great fun of yours! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T15:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Keymaster89**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:41:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now, is established that a humans can survive plenty of days without food, but they survive less then a week without water and couple minutes without oxigen!\n\u003E I don\u0027t think u can generalize all the needs into one \u0022supply\u0022.\n\nThe problem is that in TAC-LS, it\u0027s already generalized into one resource: they are drained at the same rate compared to tankage and lack of a resource has the same effects, no matter the resource. The only difference between them is the amount of time that a Kerbal can go without them, and that\u0027s still a pretty small difference.
