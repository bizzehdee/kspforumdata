Long time since I\u0027ve posted, but I want to bring up a topic that, from what I\u0027ve managed to find, hasn\u0027t seem to have been addressed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy kids and I have been KSP players since version 0.13, and to make things interesting/challenging again (as well as educational), I\u0027ve recently have been trying to assemble the right set of mods for (somewhat)realistic modelling of our solar system and real-world rocket technology. Sure, we could jump over to Orbiter, but there\u0027s nothing like KSP for creativity and having fun while learning.. Science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m in IT (a C# developer, btw) and no slouch in such things, I found this to be quite a challenge to set up, to put it mildly. So I can imagine that for most players who haven\u0027t spent many hours tweaking KSP and/or reading the forums, getting going with this would be just too difficult now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I see, one main issue is that there isn\u0027t a place online where you can go and get step-by-step instructions on what to do to get a good realism setup. Information is scattered, and the info that\u0027s there is full of lingo and acronyms that people (like me) who haven\u0027t been forum regulars have to muddle through to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other main issue is that the realism mods, particularly those with scaled rocket parts, are now woefully inconsistent in scale and performance with respect on one-another. (No offence to the mod developers -- you\u0027ve done marvelous work.) Most seem to be either still on \u0022kerbal scale\u0022 or at 100% scale, which is just too big to make anything practical within the confines of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve started to take it upon myself to go through each part (stock,KW,Nova,etc) and re-scale them based on real-world engines specs, etc., to about 60%-by-length, and 20%-by-mass/thrust. It\u0027s a lot of work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great if a group got together (especially if important mod developers got on-board) to come up with some standards for scaling/etc to agree on and start to work towards... and also to put-together a friendly easy-to-find instruction page for installing a standard set of realism mods known to work together correctly, for people who just want to play realism without spending hours on setup with inconsistent results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anything like this been done? If not, would anyone like to join me in starting to organize this, or at least helping with the part scaling work?
