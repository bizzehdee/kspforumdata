By realistic skew I mean that they will fit in aesthetically with stock KSP parts while simultaneously having realistic features. For example, a crew pod with a service module that has an umbilical connector. While it serves no actual purpose in the game it makes the whole thing look more functional and realistic. Another example would be radiator panels, which would serve no actual gameplay purpose in stock KSP but they would make an orbiting habitat module look more functional and realistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logo symbolises the idea behind the mod and the order in which I intend to iterate on it. The three coloured celestial bodies are Kerbin, the Mun and Duna, with a rocket launch going up into the stars which is meant to represent exploration of all the celestial bodies of the Kerbol system. The latin phrases translate to \u0022To the stars through adversity\u0022 and \u0022From the stars, knowledge\u0022, representing, well, what you\u0027ll be doing in the game using my parts. The idea is to progressively add mission elements in phases with increasing capability (sort of like NASA\u0027s journey to Mars plan) that ultimately combine to make an epic series of missions. You will be able to do a lot of things using only parts from this mod. They say a picture is worth a thousand words so here is an image to help illustrate what I\u0027m trying to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OXZ6vaZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OXZ6vaZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should give you a rough idea of the types of parts I\u0027m going to make and the order in which I will make them. I have a better idea in my head and some rough sketches that I don\u0027t want to share (I am awful at drawing). Instead I have been prototyping and iterating in 3ds max, the tool I am the most experienced with. For inspiration I have looked mostly at modern Russian, Chinese and American spacecraft and launch vehicles. I will use this thread to post work in progress renders as I refine the various designs as well as answer your questions and address any requests you may have. Any and all constructive feedback is much appreciated. With that said, this is not going to be an easy task to accomplish by myself so if there is anyone out there who wants to collaborate do send me a PM.

You already partially answered the first part of your post (base plates clipping through the rest of the model) but I also just don\u0027t want to make a mount for other engines. I want to create a whole part with engines already in place, like the stock engine part from the ARM update. I am not looking to make unique parts in the sense that I\u0027m plugging a hole in the spectrum of mods that are out there and what they\u0027re offering. This also applies to a 4, 5 or however many kerbal crew pod. I feel like 3 is a good number for a number of reasons. It\u0027s stock default and if I have a crew of 5 it would necessitate much larger landers and habs which in turn would require a larger diameter launch vehicle so it doesn\u0027t look stupid (also, imagine a 3.75m pod docking to a 2.5m space station). A 4-5 kerbal pod and lander and all that would probably work well with 5m diameter, but I am personally not a huge fan of anything larger than 3.75m in diameter. There\u0027s Chaka and KW Rocketry if you do though, and I believe Kyle and Winston were working on a 3.75m pod with a larger crew size at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFox62\u003C/strong\u003E: I already answered some of your post above, but I\u0027ll also add that I don\u0027t want to make a service module to go with the stock pod for a number of reasons, chief among them that SDHI (which is excellent) already exists and I don\u0027t like the shape and size of the stock pod and want to create my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E: It\u0027s a good suggestion, it\u0027s just not something I want to do. Also, I can think of one reason why engine mounts (or tankbutts as you\u0027ve called them) exist and that is that a lot of different fuel tanks have ends which look different. For example if you were to mount an engine, just the nozzle and pressure chamber, under a KW rocketry tank, it would appear to be floating unattached mid-air below the tank with no attachment or fuel pipes, which would in my opinion look a little stupid. For my mod I am going to design fuel tanks that look realistic on their own (domes visible on both ends) and the corresponding enging parts will have an end cap that when combined make it look functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDarthVader\u003C/strong\u003E: No, I am not going to be working on KerbX again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDragon01\u003C/strong\u003E: The Yenisei and Energia 5K designs are very much my main inspiration for a lot of the launch vehicle parts.
