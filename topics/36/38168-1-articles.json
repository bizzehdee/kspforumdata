I want to alter the fairings found in the KW rocketry pack, so that as well as being able to use the nosecone to top the fairing, I can also use a fairing base then continue with the rocket like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17909925/screenshot361.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot361.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve added a new part which uses all of the data for the original fairing wall with a modified part file which changes the attachment node for the wall part to be attached to the upper fairing base. Here is a screenshot of the original part file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17909925/KSP_Wall.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Wall.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is the new part file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17909925/KSP_Wall_Top.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_Wall_Top.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an in-game side by side comparison of the two parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17909925/Fairing%20comparison.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Fairing%20comparison.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attachment points are in the right place, after a little trial and error. I know it\u0027s a rather crude job and the parts will clip, but it\u0027s the best I can do without re-texturing. The problem I am having is that the decoupling node which I have added is not working properly as it only removes the bottom wall and not the top one. Does anyone know how to make this work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
