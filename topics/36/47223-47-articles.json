I had a double ended cargo ramp carryall type thing, and had to bolt a little probe nacelle to the outside since the old core had, well, a core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as adapters go, there are a lot of possibilities, but not all of them are worth doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne that might be kinda fun is mkIV-5x 1.25m in a row. Kinda like NFC\u0027s trilinear, but spaceplane and 5. You have the two lump ones on either end, and three more bridging the gap between them.
