So, I decided we needed more planet packs, of course, for more variety in planetary/star systems.\n\nThis planet pack is a WIP, so I will need all the help I can get from the forums. The planets are showing up and we are still working on some bugs.\n\nHowever, this pack is made to add newer explorable worlds, which are exotic for viewing, and others for science collection (when we implement biomes).\n\nThanks for support in the WIP stage!\n\nAlso, more Kopernicus planet making guides/codes would be nice.\n\nThings developed (kinda):\n\n-A \u0022Mun\u0022 around Dres - pretty much finished: named Kosarn\n\n-Small Gas planet - still WIP, but the main gas giant is at the very least is finished: named Mysterio. It has a radius of 1500km @ equator.\n\nThis we are planning on doing:\n\n-Muns around the mini gas planet\n\n-A Brown Dwarf planet-star.\n\n-Binary Planets (if Kopernicus and the game allow us)\n\n-Binary moons\n\n-quite a bit more.\n\nThing we aren\u0027t so sure about:\n\n-A Kraken look-a-like planet\n\n-cubical moons.\n\n-copy of Kerbin that has its old map.\n\nHere\u0027s some pics of the development:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
