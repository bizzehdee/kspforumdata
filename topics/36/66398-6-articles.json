I may have been a little too quick to report that 400mb savings in my earlier post because it didn\u0027t even occur to me that this was in a new save without any debris or ongoing flights, which is probably the source of much of that extra memory. There is still an improvement in the amount of memory used and in the way it handles it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to point out that even small savings can add up quite quickly. If a planet texture takes up 40mb, but then you\u0027re able to get rid of 10 of them until they are actually seen, you\u0027re saving 400mb. Also, wouldn\u0027t intercepting planet textures work in the same way as part textures?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T19:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Skull","CreatedById":103510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T23:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried this twice with no success.

There are 3 common causes for such crashes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Invalid images or image formats LOD cannot handle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Other mods messing around with textures LOD wants to \u0022manage\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP actually runs out of memory. LOD isn\u0027t really perfect yet in that regard, especially when preparing the individual textures for the first time.
