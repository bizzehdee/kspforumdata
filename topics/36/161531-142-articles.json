Although ICF can reach higher energy densities than magnetic confinement, it is not ideal for power generation. All designs I have seen only focused on generating thermal energy. It might also be able to redirect a part of the charged particles to a direct conversion using a magnetic mirror, but not as efficient as the magnetic confinement which has very strong magnetic fields to begin with. That\u0027s why KSPI-E, I have rated power generation to be 40% of normal electric power production. Another factor that influence power output is fusion power output. Although p-B11 fusion is cheap and easy to store, the amount of power produced from a reaction is only 50% of D-T fusion. Now, combine all factor and you will end up with a maximum overall fusion power to electric efficiency of only 83.5% * 40% * 50% = 16.7%\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-21T21:02:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T20:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 1.5.14 for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Released on 2015-10-21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduced loading time outside VAB \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded Real Plume Configs (by\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/138631-Nansuchao\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Nansuchao\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E ) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThermal Nozzle can now use Liquid Fuel with nuclear propulsion \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInertial Confinement Fusion reactor no longer suffers from thermal power efficiency but reduced overall power output \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduced core temperature of Inertial Confinement Fusion reactor, thereby improving thrust but lower maximum Isp \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMagnetic confinement Fusion no longer suffers from thermal propulsion inefficiency \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENormalized core temperature of Magnetic confinement Fusion reactor \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-21T21:01:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2015 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Profit-","CreatedById":144948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T21:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 1.5.14 for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Released on 2015-10-21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduced loading time outside VAB\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded Real Plume Configs (by\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/138631-Nansuchao\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Nansuchao\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThermal Nozzle can now use Liquid Fuel with nuclear propulsion\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInertial Confinement Fusion reactor no longer suffers from thermal power efficiency but reduced overall power output\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduced core temperature of Inertial Confinement Fusion reactor, thereby improving thrust but lower maximum Isp\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMagnetic confinement Fusion no longer suffers from thermal propulsion inefficiency\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENormalized core temperature of Magnetic confinement Fusion reactor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pleases me greatly and I will be checking it out tonight =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T21:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Profit-\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Profit-\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis pleases me greatly and I will be checking it out tonight =)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T22:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s been a slight miscommunication here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have every single node in the CTT tech tree unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all examples, assume that I have connected enough radiators to the setup to dissipate more than the maximum power that could possibly be generated by the reactors while using the highest power fuel mode (eg.
