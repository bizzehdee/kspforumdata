Generally they are all now based on the core FGB block, with different external bits and accessories.  The FEM is now based on the TKS module, but with a bit of a dome/bubble at the top (which will be covered in windows).  Swapped out the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for the 6-port model, added EVA hatches to all parts, finalized solar-panel positions.  \n\nI\u0027ve decided to not do the cloth covered look.

I would have enjoyed if another option would have been available. Like carrying a core part, then transfering X amount of rocket part resource and BAM, you have a huge centrifuge.  Again its all good, at worst it will be a verry challenging lunch! That will be fun.\n\u003E \n\nThat is an interesting mechanic, and perhaps simple enough that I could integrate it with the other modules.  A bit of a compromise and a decent gameplay abstraction.  Have been thinking that some sort of \u0027kit out\u0027 function would be appropriate for -all- of the inflatables, not just the larger torus parts, and this mechanic could work well for that (to simulate bringing in the equipment to bring the module fully on-line while/after it was inflated).\n\nI think it would go something like:  \n\n1.) Launch the empty \u0027core\u0027 for the inflatable/torus module in its deflated state.  \n\n2.) Dock/attach another vessel that contained a container full of RocketParts, or MaterialKits, or whatever resource is chosen to be used for the purpose.  \n\n3.) Press the \u0027construct\u0027 button on the inflatable, the needed resources will be consumed, the inflation animation will play, and from that point out the part would be **permanently** inflated.  The part would increase its mass proportional to the resources consumed in the kit-out/construction process.\n\nThis would allow for lower launch masses for deflated parts while still \u0027simulating\u0027 the kit-out/completion process for those parts.  They could be toggled to the \u0027constructed\u0027 state while in the editor and launched complete if the user desired (though they would have the full mass and cost).\n\nSo for the largest torus parts you might launch a 20t empty core and ship up 80t worth of resources for its construction -OR- you could launch it fully inflated at its 100t standard dry mass.  The non- torus inflatables would have a much smaller difference in their deflated and fully constructed masses as they would be merely simulating a kit-out rather than full-on construction of the part.\n\nI\u0027ll give this a bit more thought and see if it is something that I want to implement/investigate potential problems.  It seems like it would be a good compromise for the inflatable parts while not adding too much complexity or duplicating features from other mods."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T18:45:15Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), so your mechanism above would effectively use the \u0022core\u0022 part to assemble/inflate as an EPL \u0022launchpad\u0022 part, with itself as the thing to be constructed (with the \u0022pad\u0022 bit destroyed in the process)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T18:51:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), so your mechanism above would effectively use the \u0022core\u0022 part to assemble/inflate as an EPL \u0022launchpad\u0022 part, with itself as the thing to be constructed (with the \u0022pad\u0022 bit destroyed in the process)?\n\u003E \n\nEssentially yes; but without any destruction/replacement.

If you want more details, you could just remove the tanks under the panel and put something else, battery or else. A bit like your semi random box/sphere/tube on engine mount.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-26T13:07:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2016 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T21:59:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 39 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Something a bit more like (on the covered smaller tanks):  ?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Should be doable.

Setup the SSTU\\_MODEL config data for the model, and reference that model in the part.\n\nAnd yes, you could very likely do some low-part-count setups using other mods\u0027 parts.  Very few of my plugins/partmodules require any special model setup -- the \u0027modular\u0027 parts simply require that the SSTU\\_MODEL config be setup for them so it knows how big it is/how to position the models, and from there it should mostly \u0027just work\u0027.  I would already be doing this myself, except for a.) I really don\u0027t want any external mod dependencies, and b.) I\u0027m not a fan of \u0027stock-alike\u0027 textures (which seem quite prevalent with most mods).\n\nI\u0027ve even setup the SSTU\\_MODEL loading so that you can load specific -meshes- from models and combine single meshes from different model files.  This was done to support models built for B9/FS mesh-switch modules, but could be used in other ways as well.\n\nReally... many of these modules could be a part-welders wet dream, they just require a bit more manual work and setup than pressing the \u0027weld\u0027 button on Ubiozor.  Part-welding was what got me started on plugin modding... or more specifically the limitations imposed on part-welding by the stock modules (I found it silly that you couldn\u0027t weld more than a single solar panel, landing leg, multiple animated parts (in 0.90, layers didn\u0027t exist), or parachute... so I fixed those problems)."}]}
