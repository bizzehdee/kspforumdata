The reason I use Karbonite (and Kethane before it) is to expand what I can do with more or less conventional rocketry, and to make MKS colonies totally self-sufficient not only with supplies but also fuel for their own fleets. If I want dilithium crystals instead, I\u0027ll use KSPI \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite, as mentioned, already has extremely high energy density, at least when burned as fuel itself with its engine stats as they now are.

This wasn\u0027t a trivial project, especially when done about the mid-point of a career game, but it shows the power of Karbonite. Furthermore, I believe I\u0027m on the verge of creating a spaceplane-type SSTO that can reach Eve orbit from sealevel. I\u0027ve so far managed 60km and 2500m/s before having to switch to rockets, which isn\u0027t quite enough, but know I can do better. It\u0027s definitely not easy and is presenting many novel challenges, but I\u0027m not yet convinced it can\u0027t be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I really WANT to make an Eve SSTO to justify building an MKS colony there. Without an SSTO, Eve is pretty much doomed by economics to be a prison planet. But I want an Eve SSTO to be hard, even with Karbonite, like it (probably) is now. I mean, with KSPI, you own Eve, which takes all the fun out of it. With Karbonite as it is now, Eve is still a hard fight. It might even be unwinnable but I don\u0027t yet know that. Anyway, I\u0027m definitely NOT saying the Karbonite and/or its engines are OP, but pretty close to right as I like to play the game. What I am saying is that there\u0027s no highly visible need for anything more powerful, at least to the extent of my knowledge so far, and anything significantly more powerful than Karbonite would be in KSPI territory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: I think Karbonite by itself, as it stands now, is very close to being or is already all you need to do just about anything, provided you put in some significant design effort and fly it as well as possible. I like it as it stands. I wouldn\u0027t tweak its current part stats, and I\u0027d be very careful about adding something even more powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T14:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s actually not a bad general tweak for ORS anyway - some kind of configurable threshold value.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno.

I never used the big Kethane drills because the little ones would get the job done with warping, too. Warping is a feature of the game intended to maximize the amount of quality playing time a player has in a play session of limited duration. Instead of having to sit there watching paint dry, he can skip over such boring things and get on with the fun of flying rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, from a Kerbal\u0027s POV (ie, from a game-clock perspective), the time required to do anything in KSP, no matter what the task (stock or mod), is totally meaningless unless the time required is measured in years. At that scale, you have to pack a lot more life support supplies and might miss a transfer window, which might require even more life support. A few hours, days, or even a month or 2 difference in the time required to do something has no effect on what Kerbals do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the same goes for the player\u0027s POV (ie, real time). If the player doesn\u0027t have anything else going on in his game, he can just warp until this job is done, then proceed to the next stage of the mission. If he has other irons in the fire, he can jump around between them, warping as necessary until the next KAC alarm goes off. Increasing the time required for a task only impacts the player if it\u0027s lke scanning for Kethane. This either requires him to sit there in mind-numbing tedium for hours or go do something else instead of playing the game, while the game runs in the background. Neither of these options is at all desirable from a gameplay POV because one isn\u0027t any fun at all and the other isn\u0027t playing KSP like he wants to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, IMHO, stop worrying about \u0022(insert activity here) \u002B timewarp = OP\u0022. It\u0027s not OP, it\u0027s just how the mechanics of the game itself work. So just make a decision as to whether or not you want a task to be completed in the time available between arriving at a planet and the next transfer window to go home. If the task won\u0027t take that long, then the time required for it is utterly meaningless for practical gameplay purposes, no amount of tweaking will ever make it so, and the only thing you can do is impose a kethane-scanning type of un-fun burden on the player, which is bad for business. OTOH, if you want the task to take longer than that, then there\u0027s also no point in worrying about the relative rates of big vs small drills, because they\u0027ll both take forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T15:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Geschosskopf Read all of the posts, totally get the POV \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E To put it another way...

The accepted practice for an Eve ascent after doing no more than planting a flag is, with conventional rocketry, to rove the rocket to the highest convenient mountaintop, then use a Kerbal-made mountain of 1.25m rocket parts in several dozen stages all to get 1 Kerbal in a lawnchair into the lowest possible orbit. This can\u0027t in any way come close to being economically viable (forget mere contracts, I\u0027m talking about the long-term \u0022Eve India Company\u0022 colonial/imperial stuff), even with Extraplanetary Launchpads.
