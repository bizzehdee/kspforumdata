This makes it so only one of the Land Classes shows up, no matter what you do.\n\nI submitted a pull request to Thomas P., whose fork of Kopernicus most people use, but for now, I\u0027m using my own fork, which has this issue fixed.\n\nEDIT: so apparently, there\u0027s a Kopernicus beta release on the main Kopernicus repository that I didn\u0027t know about.
