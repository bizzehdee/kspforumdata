And later i used solar sail to slow down more along the path to the Pe. Finally i turned the sail to the right orientation to begin accelerating after i reached Pe of the orbit around the sun. Yes the acceleration is much bigger than i thought, i even wondered if it might break the joint connecting the sail to the vessel...
