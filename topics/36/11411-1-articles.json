If animations could be made in Unity, that would avoid this problem.\n\nMaraz"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T18:26:21Z","Content":"Well I am by no means an expert in the Unity editor, but I do not believe so.\n\nIts odd that your model was messed up on importing, were you importing the .max file directly?

Probably that has to do with the fact that MAX uses a different orientation (Z-up) than Unity. Also Unity likes importing my MAX files with scale 0.01 (but I understood how to correct that).\n\nBye\n\nMaraz"}]}
