That being said, it will be difficult for you to get consistent outputs if you start including curves/circles in your designs, since solidworks will arbitrarily decide how to convert them into polygons. For instance if you want to make a part match up with the standard 24 sided cylinder of a 1.25m part, you\u0027re best to actually draw that as 24 lines (I think there\u0027s an operation that can auto do this for you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood Luck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T23:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that\u0027s what I read.
