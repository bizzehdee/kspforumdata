Anyway I do not consider myself as reliable enough to do this. About updating prior to 1.3, you do not have to, the current release is more than ok for anyone that would wish to stick with 1.2.2. Unless you think a release prior to 1.3 does not represent extra work, I would advocate against it. I am sure you could use that time on something more useful (or just relax really).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I have been playing around and trying to make a ship that enter the atmosphere like a space shuttle but landing vertically, like the SpaceX ITS but much smaller. It got me thinking about your plan on doing the aeroshell thingy as it could probably do something similar. What I previously posted about it was way to ambitious to be made, there is definitively something to be done with much more simple mechanics while remaining customizable.\n\u003E \n\nNo worries on the testing; I fully understand having a busy schedule ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nReleasing for 1.2.2 would be zero extra work -- my dev setup is still using the KSP-1.2.2. libraries.  My main point of hesitation on doing it for 1.2.2. it is that it -will- be craft/save breaking.  Perhaps if it gets to a more stable point, and we are still waiting for KSP-1.3, I\u0027ll look into packing up official/public \u0027testing\u0027 releases of the new version for use with KSP 1.2.2. -- if nothing else it would help make sure there are no more breaking changes when things are updated for 1.3.\n\nAtmospheric horizontal landers -- yeah, I\u0027m still giving them a bit of thought.  Still not sure how to handle the aeroshell setup and/or if it will even work in KSP (might end up being a visual-only thing, KSP\u0027s drag system really can\u0027t accommodate partial shielding). \n\nIdeally I would like to make a new stand-alone \u0027aero-shell\u0027 part, that could be resized and customized for use with any payload/lander setup; alternatively it might be procedurally-generated fairing, using the existing procedural generation code.  The big problem either way still comes back to how to handle holes for engines/etc -- such a setup almost needs to be part-specific, with no support for scaling or customization.\n\nGeneral Development Updates:\n\nStill more recoloring system work.  The last few days saw the MSRBs converted to allow for recoloring (plugin/textures/configs).  Possibly a few config-level things to adjust on them, but they are working and finished from a functionality perspective.\n\nYesterday\u0027s work went into converting the NodeFairing system to allow for recoloring -- updating the plugin, texture set configs, and remaking the actual textures.  Seems likely that I\u0027ll be upping the texture resolution on them, at least doubling it in the X-axis, which should reduce the \u0027blur\u0027 between different colored sections, and bring the texture density-per-meter closer to what is used by the rest of the parts (it is currently about 1/4 to 1/2 density compared to tanks/etc).\n\nToday\u0027s work is going into code-side changes to allow for recoloring on the rest of the procedurally generated parts (ISDC, IPA, PDC, PPC).  Progressing well so far, hoping to get them finished up this afternoon/evening.\n\nOnce those parts are finished the last parts needing reworking will be the StationCore series of parts.  Will likely be doing a fairly simple initial set of textures for these, probably consisting of only a single mask / set of textures (except those where multiple sets already existed -- COS/DOS).  Can always add more masks/sets at a later time now that all the rest of the support is in place.\n\nIn regards to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E / RealFuels / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E compatibility (as I keep seeing this stuff pop up) -- is there anyone who regularly uses the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E suite and wouldn\u0027t mind getting their hands dirty with a bit of compatibility testing, and who is also familiar with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E patch setup?
