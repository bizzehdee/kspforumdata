It was frustrating because I remember doing it a long time ago for consolidating the Squad internals into a single folder (and chopping out about 2/3 the memory hit...may do that again). The trick is the ordering. I went back through and realized everywhere it worked was because I put the textures that I wanted to use somehow in alphabetical order first, either by folder or naming convention, so when it processed the config the texture it wanted was already in memory. To make sure, I made an \u0022Xpansion\u0022 folder inside the B9_Aerospace folder to place everything (loads after all else in B9), and all is smooth. You don\u0027t even need the dummy files. The system also doesn\u0027t deal well with texture names with \u0022_\u0022 in them, but B9 only has 2 or 3 of those and I can use FS to get around that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThough I do have one question.

The stock shielded one will get an extender of 2-3 meters and will be surface mounted...still probably squared though. The stock inline I\u0027ve already almost completed, there will be a 2m 1.25 cargo bay with the first release, and I\u0027m putting together the animation for a 1.5m long inline docking port based on that. I may also make a 3rd one with the nosecone idea, maybe flip the entire top of the cone down...or spread it like a giant claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll throw that other one on the list of adapters. Adapters are easy to make and look good, they\u0027re just very tedious work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***general update***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve finally muscled my way through all stock wings and ailerons, and I\u0027m fairly happy with the results. I\u0027ll definitely revisit them later and retexture, but for now they look decent. The whole system builds like a giant puzzle, and after much cursing at Unity, the ailerons and canards actually rotate correctly in all situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext steps are to re-export all the rotors/engines, odds and ends, and the cockpits that don\u0027t require custom internals (about half) and do an alpha release hopefully in the next 5-6 hours. 2 versions are planned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad Knockout - Replaces select stock parts, and adds additional non-stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupplemental - Adds different versions of stock parts to the catalog (doesn\u0027t replace anything) and adds additional non-stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only requirements will be the original B9 download, module manager, and you should probably update your FireSpitter plugin. Some engine sounds are borrowed from Firespitter for now, so if you have full Firespitter installed you\u0027ll get everything sounding good, if not some parts will be silent. I have basic sound files for what I want, I just need to find a good sound editor to trim down the files before I include them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no need to re-release B9 or include any actual files from B9 on my part.
