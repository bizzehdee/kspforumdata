I find the lack of sleek Mk3 cockpits disturbing so I decided to remedy just that. As of now, I\u0027m only working on a cockpit, and I wanna finish it with full IVAs before anything else, but depending on how it goes I might consider more parts in the future. This is still som way from being ready for a test release, but I thought it might be a good time to get some feedback at least in terms of the concept and the looks of it, so here it is. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The idea of this is a near-futuristick cockpit for heavy but sleek spaceplanes (with a huge panoramic window)\n\n**NOTE: I\u0027m having issues with the CFG file and with collision meshes. If anyone can help, please respond on this thread** [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129697-1-0-4-Help-with-configs-and-collision-meshes-please](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129697-1-0-4-Help-with-configs-and-collision-meshes-please) (or here if you want to, but the specifics of the issue are there)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The intakes is something I was actually considering as a separate part, but it\u0027s actually my top priority when I\u0027m done with this one.
