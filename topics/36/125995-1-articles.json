I\u0026#39;m in california dreaming of the things we used to be[/s] I am developing a nifty little command pod/station module that I call the Tyandi.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInfo on the Tyandi so far: So it will fit a 2.5m form factor and be designed for anything from planetary bases to orbiters. It will have a glass dome at the top and a bottom part that will be either a service compartment or maybe some kind of docking port mounting points (I really don\u0026#39;t know on this bit) and will carry four crew whilst being lighter than the Mk 1-2 command pod, the big kick-in-the-nuts downside is that it has no stack mounts on the top, and attatching things radially to the dome will be ugly as all heck. Don\u0026#39;t ask me where the name came from. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Tyandi will eventually be a part of a planned parts pack containing parts inspired by Chinese space technology (Tiangong, Shen Zhou) that will be aimed towards RSS/RO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPics coming soon...\n"}]}
