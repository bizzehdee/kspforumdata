Today I put the finishing touches on Keelon\u0027s moons and started to work again on the Sarvin System. Potatus now no longer uses height maps, is mostly proceduraly generated, a bit oblate, and has the cryovolcano centered better. Oh, and the cryovolcano now also uses Kopernicus, getting rid of the Kittopia Tech dependency. The cryovolcano is a separate object from the planet textures themselves, so I have moare control over it, like size and deformity. \n\nBTW the cryovolcano object works the same way as KSC\u0027s flat landmass, in fact using a PQS mod called PQSMod\\_MapDecal.\n\n I also made Sarvin appear as main menu planet instead of Kerbin. Unforcenately, due to some strange bug, Fonso\u0027s (now also proceduraly generated) surface became intense orange and the ground textures were loading with extreme dificulty so that means I\u0027ll have to remake it yet again till it works good!\n\nAfter I also finish remaking the Sarvin System part, I\u0027ll start making the Dwarf Planets.

I can explain how to make the two compatible though:\n\n1. K\u002B planets orbiting the black hole\n\nSolution: open the configs of the K\u002B planets, scroll to the orbital properties and set the parentbody to \u0027Kerbol\u0027, or whatever the stock sun is named in KG2. Remember: ONLY the K\u002B (dwarf)planets that are orbiting the black hole, don\u0027t touch the moons!\n\n2. Eeloo vanishing\n\nSolution: this is simply because KG2 has a config that places Eeloo around the new stock Sun, while K\u002B also has a config that moves Eeloo. In the K\u002B configs, delete Eeloo.cfg and it should show up. The problem is that Kopernicus gets the following information (not literally, this is merely a highly simplified version):\n\nKG2: Kopernicus, place Eeloo around a new stock sun called \u0027Kerbol\u0027\n\nK\u002B: Kopernicus, place Eeloo around a new planet named \u0027Sarvin\u0027\n\nSince Kopernicus can\u0027t move Eeloo to orbit both Kerbol and Sarvin, it errors when trying to place Eeloo and therefor Eeloo can\u0027t be loaded and disappears entirely.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nTWG"},{"CreatedByName":"Ateballgaming","CreatedById":152776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T16:13:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well...\n\u003E 1.
