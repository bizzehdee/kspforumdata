Skilled application of textures, emissives, bumpmaps, etc, all help to counter the inherent lack of fidelity, but a lot of that is artistic talent so it\u0027s more difficult to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your first step, you\u0027ll need two pieces of software, Blender, and Unity (google will show the way), Blender\u0027s fairly scary at first look but once you figure out the control scheme it\u0027s pretty easy to grasp, and a surprizing amount of things can be figured out by simple exploration and trial. Both are free btw. Blender also has literally months if not years worth of video tutorials, and books worth of written tutorials, literally books, that you can buy. But also online written tutorials for free. It\u0027s the most common modelling application used for KSP so far as I\u0027m aware, so if you\u0027re ever stuck you can ask here and somebody will point the way. Unity on the other hand is just a process, you use it to turn your models in whatever application you choose into a package that KSP can take, and everything you might want to do in it works a specific way. No skill, just a series of steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went from not knowing how to do anything to having a set of parts that I was using in my every day game in about a week, it took longer to get them to a stage where I wasn\u0027t embarrassed to show them to others, and I\u0027m still in the process of balancing them and tweaking things now a few months later, but KSP is amazingly easy to get into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only key is that you have to try, give it an honest effort, read things, watch things, listen to what they have to say, and for now don\u0027t worry about the result, just do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T09:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Greys, I know how to use blender, I just need help with how to work everything, and to figure out UV maps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T18:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUV\u0027s are a skill learned with practice, the basic concept is that you want to place seams on the model to allow the faces to be laid flat with as little distortion to their actual shape as possible, preferably in a way that makes drawing on that flat sheet as easy as possible. Once you get your head wrapped around the goal it becomes a matter of practice to lay down your seams in the best ways, but then you have to deal with the actual unwrapping. If you\u0027re using blender there is unfortunately a secret bullshat button in a secret context sensitive panel. Blender defaults to unwrapping models \u0022Angle Based\u0022, which attempts to preserve the angle of edges compared to other edges, which gives you... things that don\u0027t make much sense\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RzJ9GMc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RzJ9GMc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option for how to unwrap is \u0022Conformal\u0022, which tries to preserve the shape of each face independent of the rest. It\u0027s confusing to me why this isn\u0027t the default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe switch between the two exists in a contextual panel that only shows them immediately after you unwrap, once you click anything else it goes away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gWQBSTA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gWQBSTA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to provide another image, but when I switch to Conformal, that same set of faces unwraps into a very good approximation of the shape that they actually are, which makes everything easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have it unwrapping into islands you can work with (an island is a set of faces that are not separated by seams) it\u0027s just a matter of fitting everything together in the most ideal way you can figure out. Overlap islands that will use the same texture, weld islands that represent identical features, minimize the small elements and maximize the elements that need the most detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YxHneeR.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/YxHneeR.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the exception of the asterisk shaped island and the big hexagonal island all of those island are 6~ identical islands that will be textured identically, so they don\u0027t need to take up 6x the sheet. And for the big hexagon, each side is roughly the same as the width of the big square part of the island in the bottom left, but the hexagon will have significantly more valuable detail on it, so giving it more resolution allows me to put more detailed texture work on that set of faces (also that set of faces doesn\u0027t need to be as complex as it is, I\u0027m better now than I was when I made that part and I should revisit it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T11:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much, that is exactly what I needed to know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
