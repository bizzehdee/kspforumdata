It\u0027s two separate issues.)\u003C/em\u003E No one\u0027s telling anyone not to get it. The fact is that it\u0027s been tested with mods and without mods that KSP is simply not very stable in x64. It\u0027s not unstable in a consistent way, however, so one person might have perfect performance while the other crashes every time they do anything at all, and any variation between those two extremes.
