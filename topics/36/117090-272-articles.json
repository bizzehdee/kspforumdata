The remaining outer engines are attached to the decoupler and use the \u0022pyrios\u0022 mount. If I use a fuel line I can get all three engines to fire and I can stage the outer two engines but I just can\u0027t get it to look nice no matter what I try. If I use the offset tool to line everything up then all of the engines are destroyed upon staging and if I try a different mount on the tank then there is still a large gap in the structure as seen below.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Have any of you managed to build a working (and good looking) layout such as this and if so could you please share how you did it? I know BDB has working (and beautiful) parts that I could use but I wanted to try and build it using SSTU.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If this is not possible then could I request that it may be considered as a future part option? Perhaps it could be achieved by adding a hollow collider and interstage node to the \u0022pyrios\u0022 engine mount option? I don\u0027t know how to code at all though so obviously this is just a guess and I expect it\u0027s massively more complex than that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the support, is much appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nThe problem with 1.5-stage setups, as you\u0027ve likely found out, is due to colliders.  Basically for it to function properly, you need a hollow collider for the mount, with a big hole in it where the \u0027staying attached\u0027 engine slips through.\n\nHollow colliders are extremely bad for performance.  Not inherently so (as there is no built-in \u0027hollow\u0027 collider type), but simply due to the number of standard colliders needed to simulate a hollow shape.  While a standard \u0027solid\u0027 shape may only need one or two colliders, a hollow collision setup will require at least 4 (and probably 8, 12 or 24 if you want the object to seem even partially cylindrical/round).  This is why the decouplers use standard (non-hollow) colliders by default, and why the fairings by default have no colliders -- it would be detrimental to performance, and only benefit very specific craft setups.\n\nNot really sure if there is a solution available that would both give the use that you are looking for while keeping the collider setup simple.  Open to suggestions though if anyone has ideas.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-24T18:38:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2017 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T18:43:15Z","Content":"What are the shapes for colliders in KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T18:58:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What are the shapes for colliders in KSP?\n\u003E \n\nSphere, Capsule, Cube, and Mesh (convex only).  All of them are convex shapes, meaning no cutouts / hollow areas.  The only way to make a \u0027hollow\u0027 collider is to arrange multiple primitive / mesh colliders around the area that you want to be hollow, usually by using cubes (scaled to rectangles) or mesh colliders.\n\nFor example, the decoupler looks like this with hollow collider setup (24 mesh colliders):\n\n![I0IT8LJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/I0IT8LJ.png)\n\n(those are procedurally generated mesh colliders, but you would do pretty much the same manually using cube/mesh colliders for other parts)\n\nAlso, initial testing of the parachutes w/new models, textures, and recoloring support.
