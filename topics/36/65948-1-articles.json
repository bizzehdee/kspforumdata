The first version would add a third tab in the R\u0026amp;D building that would keep a log of your ship launches. Starting weight, starting crew, date and time of launch, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have experience in coding (specifically in C\u002B\u002B and Java), and I figured it wouldn\u0027t be too hard to find some tutorials to spring board into making this thing. Where the issue comes into play is that every tutorial or guide I can find involves making/editing parts. With my mod, there would be no need to create a single part, I just need to know how to make and modify tabs in the R\u0026amp;D building. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Graknils","CreatedById":77446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T18:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how \u0022connect\u0022 threads in the forum (or even if that can be done at the user lever) but, in the interest of networking mavens who are thinking along similar lines I\u0027ve included links to other threads having to do with a \u0022Mission Log\u0022 or a \u0022Mission Planner\u0022 mod suggestion/request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28096-Mission-Log-Mod?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28096-Mission-Log-Mod?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72723-A-Mission-Log-Mod-Completely-New-to-Modding?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72723-A-Mission-Log-Mod-Completely-New-to-Modding?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63104-How-do-I-view-a-successful-mission-log?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63104-How-do-I-view-a-successful-mission-log?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72358-Mission-Log?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72358-Mission-Log?highlight=mission\u002Blog\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T18:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to take a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67246-0-23-Final-Frontier-0-3-9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFinal Frontier\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Graknils","CreatedById":77446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T19:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gristle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gristle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou might want to take a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67246-0-23-Final-Frontier-0-3-9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFinal Frontier\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust read through that thread.
