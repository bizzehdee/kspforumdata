Personally, I\u0027ve had issues with that mod causing some conflicts, so I\u0027ve had to go in and manually remove it\u0027s module from the config (not a big deal), but if someone like Rover Dude uses it, it\u0027s probably on the level. The transparent pod feature can be toggled to taste; it also adds in IVA instruments from what I understand as well, allowing you to do full IVA piloting and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a slightly unrelated note, you mentioned Porkjet\u0027s Habitat Pack not working for you.
