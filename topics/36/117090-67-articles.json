I have limited time for in-game testing of things (which doing config changes requires), and all of my time over the past few days was spent fixing up FAR.  However, it is on the issues list, and scheduled for this weekends update, so will be done by then at the latest.  (I should probably be more precise when I say \u0027for the next release\u0027... the mid-week unscheduled releases are often a \u0027whatever is currently done\u0027 type deal, and may not include all of the scheduled stuff...).\n\nParachutes, in RO -- you should merely need to adjust the \u0027mainFullDeployArea\u0027 to compensate for any change in pod mass.  It uses standard real-world drag equations to calculate drag force, so the proper canopy size can easily be derived through the equations.  Let me know and I can point you towards the proper equations, or even make up a calculator spreadsheet for it.  (simulated parachute area is completely separate from visible canopy size; you can have a tiny visible parachute but tell it that it is 10,000m2 in area if you want...).\n\nOrion-SM Nodes -- Honestly, I have no idea; its really not setup to be used that way, and would have to spend some time playing with the config to figure it out.  From what I remember the things Jose was trying to do were \u0027not supported\u0027 and only working by chance/through side-effects. (BTW, the ICPS/HUS -already- have secondary top attach nodes for use by the SM, decouplers, whatever; they are hidden inside the tank top...).  That patch is also using some -very- old syntax for the NodeFairing config; so has not been kept up-to-date with the other changes; that is likely part of the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T15:34:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, stratochief66 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm, so for some reason I can\u0027t get RealPlume effects on the Orion SM, after much tweaking.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/stratochief66/RealismOverhaul/blob/898b6c5968dda86bb9f2b3e7b6222c66a856a360/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealPlume_Configs/SSTU/SSTU-SC-B-SM.cfg](https://github.com/stratochief66/RealismOverhaul/blob/898b6c5968dda86bb9f2b3e7b6222c66a856a360/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealPlume_Configs/SSTU/SSTU-SC-B-SM.cfg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any ideas appreciated.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was able to get it to apply just fine on the Apollo SM.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/stratochief66/RealismOverhaul/blob/898b6c5968dda86bb9f2b3e7b6222c66a856a360/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealPlume_Configs/SSTU/SSTU_ShipCore_A_SM.cfg](https://github.com/stratochief66/RealismOverhaul/blob/898b6c5968dda86bb9f2b3e7b6222c66a856a360/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RealPlume_Configs/SSTU/SSTU_ShipCore_A_SM.cfg)\n\u003E \n\nNo idea -- my patch works just fine for it, so it is not a problem with the part or modules:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/GameData/SSTU/Patches/RealPlumes.cfg#L240-L256](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/GameData/SSTU/Patches/RealPlumes.cfg#L240-L256)\n\nThe only difference between your two (SC-A/SC-B) is the !EFFECTS{} line in the SC-B-patch -- this looks like it is malformed anyway, and is likely causing it to skip the rest of the patch.

Mage announces parts that will be removed, so you have time to replace/remove your craft safely in your save. And always make a backup of your saves before installing mod updates, that way you can test if everything it OK without destroying your game.

I barely understand the trick that allows these fairing/support parts to be auto-generated, but I really like them.\n\u003E \n\nThinking a bit further on this -- the problem is probably related to the inclusion of the \u0027SelectableNode\u0027 module.  The NodeFairing relies on the attach node always being present on the craft if it is set to watch that node.  The selectable node module -deletes- the attach nodes from the part.\n\nCombine (node needs to always be present), with (node gets deleted), and you can probably see the conflict.\n\nTry it after removing the selectable node module and see if the problem persists.  (and after cleaning up the definition for the fairing module to the updated standards; many of those config values have changed).\n\nWhat is likely happening is that the nodeFairing is checking for the node when the part is initialized, but the node does not exist, so it does not create a fairing.  The selectableNode module has no inter-linking back to the fairing module, and as such the fairing module has no way to know that its \u0027missing\u0027 node has been added to the craft.  However, when you attach a part it triggers an \u0027EditorShipModified\u0027 event to be fired, which the NodeFairing module monitors to check for parts being attached/detached so it knows when to enable/hide/unhide the fairing parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T16:46:14Z","Content":"...\n\n![Wn7mFea.png](http://i.imgur.com/Wn7mFea.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T16:49:40Z","Content":"![GIIBqRA.png](http://i.imgur.com/GIIBqRA.png)\n\nDeployed and still at 120m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T16:53:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, davidy12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![GIIBqRA.png](http://i.imgur.com/GIIBqRA.png)](http://i.imgur.com/GIIBqRA.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Deployed and still at 120m/s.\n\u003E \n\nYou are missing the most important thing -- LOGS.

I will have to take a second look at that one. I just threw in the !EFFECTS{} at the end, since it wasn\u0027t working without it (and it isn\u0027t working for me with it. Perhap our patches are fighting, but I didn\u0027t see your effects, which is why I was trying to add them (adding the effect also triggers RealPlume to convert it to an RF engine, which causes throttling to act like we want it to.

Its probably a pretty simple patch-side/syntax/formatting/order-of-operations problem; as the plumes work fine for my patch, there shouldn\u0027t be any technical issues preventing the RO patch from working (and my patch auto-disables itself when RO is installed; so that should not be conflicting either).\n\nIf you wanted to tackle it yourself, I would recommend starting with my patch and adapting it for RO.  First change the definition to the standard :FOR[RealPlumes]:NEEDS[SmokeScreen] while leaving the rest intact.  If that works, start adding in the next modification (change the plume type), and retest.  If it still works, add in the lines to change the engine module; so-on and so-forth until you find what line(s) are causing the problem.\n\nI\u0027ll attempt to look into this sometime this week (and your attach-node/fairing problems) for this weekends\u0027 release, though no guarantees;  I already have 3 models to finish (mostly texturing) and quite a bit of plugin work to do still (finishing the texture-set stuff for fairings and procedural parts)."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T20:50:17Z","Content":"I have Real Chutes and it does not conflict with this mod\u0027s parachutes one bit.

Eve: Achieved approx 3800 upon reentry with a short 85\\* aerobrake node and only burned off 200. Seems this pod can survive re-entry from both these planets and at extreme angles of attack. I would imagine a more aggressive angle of attack would result in more being burned off, but I feel the modification for stock only works just fine. I\u0027m not sure about RO, since I do not use that mod.\n\u003E \n\nSweet, thanks for the testing and info.

Is there any use to this mechanic?\n\u003E \n\nTechnically the pod should begin heating quite fast as soon as ablator runs out; it should be as if the heatshield no longer exists, and start overheating and eventually explode like any other part.  However, there -might- be a bug in my implementation that is keeping it from doing so (will need to do a bit more testing / more info).

The SelectableNodeThis forces you to 1.) attach a part to that node, and 2.) press the \u0027enable fairing\u0027 button.  Appears to be a few other inconsistencies as well due to this interaction -- will know more after I can do a bit more testing and debugging.\n\nI\u0027ll give a bit of thought on how to get this working, but honestly it was never intended to function with a toggle-able node, so it might not be **cleanly** possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T00:35:22Z","Content":"[@davidy12](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143411-davidy12/)\n\nThe parachutes are confirmed to work fine in FAR -- whatever the problem is, it is on your end (wrong versions, wrong setup, wrong patches... something).
