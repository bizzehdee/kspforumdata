Chances are that the new career paradigm will in fact not really be any better than what we have if they just tag it on without really, really thinking about it. A good career system is honestly at least as hard to do as the whole physics aspect of the game itself. I\u0027d happily pay money for a DLC that fixes career mode if it\u0027s outside the scope of what should have been in 1.0---a space race, for example, since I think that has always been a \u0022Bridge too far\u0022 for the stock KSP.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like the \u0022mission builder\u0022 is really maybe just a drag and drop way of making what are \u0022scenarios/tutorial\u0022 type things now? That\u0027s not much of a leap, you can cheat ships to places now, and share a save game.\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I\u0027ll have to wait and see if they reveal more details on what is actually included.  It does sound a bit like whatever the new \u0027feature\u0027 is will be (mostly/completely?) separate from career mode, and likely just a scenario creator.  I\u0027m absolutely fine with that.  Still irked that they are leaving career mode such a tacked-together mess, but that is a separate discussion.\n\nIncluding new parts?  Not so cool after the cancelled \u0027rocket parts revamp\u0027 from 1.2.  Dangerously close to pulling an EA-esque \u0027day-1-DLC release\u0027 scenario.  I haven\u0027t touched an EA product in nearly a decade because of that garbage.  I\u0027m not about to compare Squad to EA, as Squad has proven they can at least listen to their customer base a bit (whereas EA just abuses their customers without remorse).  About the only way I would be okay with the \u0027new parts-in-DLC\u0027 is if they are merely new textures for the existing stock models in US/Russian paint schemes, or a config-level rebalance of the existing parts to allow for proper mass ratios/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for replica craft use.  The parts themselves don\u0027t offend me (I\u0027ll probably just patch them out/delete them anyway), its the fact that they cancelled the rocket part rework, and then within months of it being cancelled, suddenly decide that they do have time/assets to develop new parts.  I highly doubt that whatever is going to be included in the DLC would be those same parts that PorkJet worked on, and either way, makes no difference -what- they new models/parts are; its the flakiness of the situation.\n\nIn the end what I think it will really come down to is how they intend to handle the modding/API end of things, and if there is any invasive DRM that I would have to put up with (or not put up with, as it were).  If they fracture the install base and require mods be compiled for base game -or- expansion-enabled game... I simply don\u0027t have time for that level of development (or motivation, or patience, or desire).  I\u0027ve already asked in the announcement thread, and can only wait and see what the response is.  Either way I\u0027m not just going to \u0027poof-vanish\u0027; even if I do end up stepping down, I\u0027ll stick around long enough to clean up/finish up a few more things and find someone else who could at least do maintenance releases for the mods\u0027 plugin code.\n\nOn a more positive note, this weekends SSTU release should contain the RD-180 engine, model by [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) (with some finishing work and all textures done by me).

Engines should all have the same range of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as stock engines (lifters at least), tanks should have roughly the same mass-fraction and performance (wet/dry ratio, drag, volume).  Some of the spacecraft parts are a bit on the light side compared to their stock equivalents (SC-A/B/C; SC-E is actually very close to stock mass/cost), but that is because I personally feel that the stock pods need the lead-sheeting removed...\n\nHowever, if building replica rockets, you will find that while the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E should be about appropriate when built to-scale, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E will be insanely more than is needed for the stock system (even if the SC-A/B/C had higher mass, this problem would still exist, merely be reduced in severity).  A scaled-replica Saturn-V usually ends up with ~12km/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, a scaled-replica SLS at \u003E9km/s, haven\u0027t tested many others, but the trend is probably about the same.\n\nOne other point of note is that I use real-world density for LH2 tanks, whereas many other mods fudge the density a bit (NearFuture at least, unsure how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E handles it anymore, and have no experience with KSPI).  This can cause a large difference in the -size- of the craft when comparing SSTU tanks to other mods\u0027 tanks, but the performance should be roughly equivalent (depending on what those mods are using for mass ratio in the tanks)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T23:15:32Z","Content":"Few more glamour shots of the RD-180, on an Atlas-V semi-replica.\n\n![Bgrw1Zd.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bgrw1Zd.png)\n\nThe bulges on the side are some extra fuel tanks added to hide the fuel input line; on scaled-replica style craft (~2.5m 1st stage core), the fuel input line sticks out of the shroud slightly.\n\n![R4yLSKG.png](http://i.imgur.com/R4yLSKG.png)\n\n(emissive texture is WIP, will be made a bit prettier before release)\n\nThe first stage had enough fuel to take the entire thing to orbit (with a 6t payload...), but did include a Centaur-ish upper stage ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n![Jc4t76B.png](http://i.imgur.com/Jc4t76B.png)\n\nEdit:\n\nUpdated emissive/glow texture:\n\n![3axoNRd.png](http://i.imgur.com/3axoNRd.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-19T14:52:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2017 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-19T15:19:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/17/2017 at 5:20 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, if building replica rockets, you will find that while the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E should be about appropriate when built to-scale, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E will be insanely more than is needed for the stock system (even if the SC-A/B/C had higher mass, this problem would still exist, merely be reduced in severity).

If they fracture the install base and require mods be compiled for base game -or- expansion-enabled game... I simply don\u0027t have time for that level of development (or motivation, or patience, or desire).  I\u0027ve already asked in the announcement thread, and can only wait and see what the response is.  Either way I\u0027m not just going to \u0027poof-vanish\u0027; even if I do end up stepping down, I\u0027ll stick around long enough to clean up/finish up a few more things and find someone else who could at least do maintenance releases for the mods\u0027 plugin code.\n\u003E \n\nI really hope they are not that stupid. The modders that have joined the team would have informed them of what a horrible idea that is. That would absolutely destroy the modding community for just a few extra sales of the expansion. NOT worth it.\n\nHowever, as far as expansions in general. We can\u0027t delude ourselves into thinking that KSP can be developed forever without them. KSP is not THAT popular. And even if it was most people who have heard about it likely already own it. There are things in the core code that modders simply can\u0027t change. So once development stops those issues will be around forever. Or even worse another company could purchase the IP and decide to go full on paid mod like Train Simulator.\n\nI hope you will be understanding of them as long as they do not start acting like EA.

In manned space flight the closest engine setup similar to these fine Russian/Ukrainian engines is the US Aerojet LR-87 of Titan and Gemini fame. Like the RD-180 and the RD-170 engines, the LR-87 has it\u0027s pumps between the engine bells.  Often, like the RD-170 and RD-180, the LR-87 is said to be two (or 4 for the RD-170) engines.  This is not because it is two engines combined but rather the Engine bell is basically the same for the LR-91 engine (a single bell engine) on the Upper stage. This lead to a lot of reporters calling it two engines.   \n\nPlumbing and Fuel pumps are the true determination of how many engines a rocket has."}]}
