As well, make sure that you have all of your proper transforms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Dunno on that one myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: The reason it is difficult to balance or relatively undesirable, is because with an LF engine you need a pretty good amount of tank in order to not just burn through it instantly. If you only have a sliver of tank, you might as well just have the engine by itself. If you have a big tank, it becomes unwieldy. And the reduction in part count probably wont really help THAT much, though I guess it depends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as for the basic idea of it, that is precisely what the SRBs are.

General rule of thumb though, make it as simple as possible (so KSP doesn\u0027t calculate more physics than it needs to) with enough external polys to make radial symmetry work properly. 12 sided cylinders are generally the status quo for small cylindrical tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mesh for the model is essentially a visual shell that sits on top of the invisible collider.
