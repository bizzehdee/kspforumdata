I just thought of something for RvB about making nosecones that were separate from jammers and radars; there would be a regular nose cone, and a stealth nose cone that would only reduce the RCS of aircraft (obviously it doesn\u0027t draw power and isn\u0027t toggleable). Then I would make inline radar sets with various traits so players could mix radars with stealthy traits by swapping out nosecones. It\u0027s a few more parts, but it makes things more modular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it would work with stealthy nosecones and jammers... additive?
