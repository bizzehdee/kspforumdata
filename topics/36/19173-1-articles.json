I\u0027m doing something similiar with the tractor beams i got on lazor system. All you\u0027d have to do would be to change the lazor into a rope model. I\u0027d just define some points along the rope and add a bezier curve of cylinder meshes between them. Then it\u0027s just a matter of mimicing physics for the points you have defined. i.e. moving them towards the direction of gravity and simulate elastic movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KospY","CreatedById":33868,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T16:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd how do you change the lazor into a rope model ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to load a model programmatically in KSP and stretch it on the Z axis to make a simple rope ?
