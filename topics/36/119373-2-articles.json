I guess I\u0027m just fishing for an excuse to advocate for dark 1.25m tanks(like the mk1pod), shiny bare metal 2.5m tanks(like the current ones but not looking like junky oildrums more like mercury-atlas or early scifi), and light 3.75m tanks (or something like that just so its all easy to tell apart) it all depends on hooj\u0027s tastes and how far he wants to take this efficiency thing there is certainly room to take the 1 sheet per size route and still beat out stock, but why just beat stock on efficiency when you can utterly destroy it?
