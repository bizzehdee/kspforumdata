You just need to have a source of electricity. I used the module from an RTG so you don\u0027t get a power bar on the gun\u0027s right click menu. Also you don\u0027t need to worry about energy issues. And when I used the weapon manager on the hand held targeting pod. It would relay the coordinates to the missile fired from the rail on the Kerbal\u0027s back, as well as other crafts. So you could lase a target with a kerbal and shoot at said target from a drone. There where accuracy issues with the rescaled missile though, but I believe that was due to messing with the scale and engine output from the missile. I haven\u0027t managed to rebalanced that yet. But I believe if you where to say use that hand held pod and then equip a gun to the kerbals back (or any other open equipment slot) then you should be able to slave that gun to the targeting pod and weapon manager. I believe that BDArmory recognizes a kerbal as a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, Thank you Lordprometheus for taking care of everybody as much as you have been.
