A ship with an alcubierre drive would punch a hole THROUGH a planet or sun, without stopping (This is due to the interference effect at a space-time-distortion-barrier: alcubierre statements explain that the inter-spacial barrier that the ship uses is impermeable, and furthermore, matter within a certain energy density [it hits the ship at a delta-v of near or past lightspeed], the matter gets compressed into a \u0027alcubierre shock\u0027, a planeks-width thickness that can be INFINITELY dense, and have no maximum energy limit, as matter cannot leave the shock zone after entering, while energy can enter.
