I keep having this problem. While doing other parts, I learn new tricks and become more proficient at blender. Then I go back, look at the Orion and shriek \u0022Urgh!\u0022 at how bad I now think it is. This will, obviously, prolong the release, but hopefully also mean I will be able to produce a better quality Orion.
