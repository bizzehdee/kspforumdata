New material has an ability to include any module: from solar panels to landing gears. Test flights reveal that new ISS performs usually well while going two kilometres per second at 21,000 metres, unlike old capsules. Kerbalkind shall, for this, be eternally grateful to the inventor, dr. Bonkers Kerman.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T16:40:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by viktor19**"}]}
