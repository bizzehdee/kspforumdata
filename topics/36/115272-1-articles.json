Add a variable to kerbalEVA called virtualFuel.\n\n2. When a Kerbal goes on EVA,\n\n (2a.) deduct 5 units of monoprop from the ship\u0027s stores, or\n\n (2b.) reduce the ship\u0027s stores to zero if less than 5 units of monoprop are present.\n\n3. If step 2b was used, virtualFuel is set to (5 - ship\u0027s stores). Otherwise it is set to 0.\n\n4. When a Kerbal returns from EVA,\n\n (4a.) add its (EVA fuel - virtualFuel) to the ship\u0027s stores as monoprop, or\n\n (4b.) add 0 fuel to the ship\u0027s stores if virtualFuel \u003E EVA fuel.\n\nDoes anyone see anything wrong with my logic, if my intention is to make EVA fuel use reduce your monoprop stores without monoprop fuel use reducing EVA fuel stores?"},{"CreatedByName":"jofwu","CreatedById":94705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T12:51:03Z","Content":"The good news is that I think your logic is right. The bad news is that I think it\u0027s already been done. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSee this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94396-0-24-2-EvaFuel-0-0-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94396-0-24-2-EvaFuel-0-0-1)\n\nI think it\u0027s working without problems in 1.0.4, but it IS technically out of date. So maybe a new take would be a good thing. If you make something, post it in that thread. They\u0027ll probably be interested."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T13:58:31Z","Content":"Thanks for the pointer. I\u0027d call it good news if it had already been done, but the two mods do differ in how they handle empty monoprop tanks. In that other mod, if the ship has 4 units of monoprop and a Kerbal wants 5 units of EVA fuel to go on EVA, he only gets 4 units of EVA fuel. In this mod, the Kerbal gets 5 units of EVA fuel but also 1 unit of \u0022fuel debt\u0022. When the Kerbal reenters the ship, that 1 unit of \u0022fuel debt\u0022 means the ship only gets 4 units of monoprop back from the Kerbal\u0027s 5 units of EVA fuel.\n\nDone this way an empty monoprop tank will never leave your Kerbal stranded with an empty EVA tank, but EVA still reduces the amount of monoprop available for maneuvers. Or compared to stock, it changes the game from \u0022infinite EVA fuel\u0022 to \u0022infinite EVA fuel, but only after you run out of monoprop.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:21:04Z","Content":"^ I LIKE THIS!\n\nI\u0027m apprehensive of mods or the stock game adding a functionality to have Kerbals take the MonoPropellant from the ship, as it provides a legitimate, but frustrating, danger of being stranded helplessly. So if this will add that in, but let Kerbals use \u0022emergency EVA fuel\u0022 then I approve wholeheartedly.\n\nRegarding the VirtualFuel - instead of adding a resource, it seems like you should just be able to use a local variable and/or the existing EVAFuel resource. Worst-case scenario, why not just have the Kerbal use MonoPropellant as EVA Fuel and use the EVAFuel resource as VirtualFuel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:44:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Regarding the VirtualFuel - instead of adding a resource, it seems like you should just be able to use a local variable and/or the existing EVAFuel resource.

Kerbals on EVA are given 5 units of EVA fuel which they consume when maneuvering with their jetpack, and all those things can remain unchanged. The less I have to change, the less likely it is to interfere with somebody else\u0027s mod, or screw up on its own."},{"CreatedByName":"bgeery","CreatedById":128020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T20:24:40Z","Content":"I suggest making the virtualfuel a configurable option. Turn it off and no monoprop = no eva fuel (like current EVAFuel mod does things). That way everyone can choose how hard to make things, and we get a new mod that\u0027s being maintained."},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T05:57:31Z","Content":"I\u0027ve always been tempted to rig it so that 5 units of EVA fuel = 1 unit of MonoProp; or possibly a 10:1 ratio or the like. Not infinite, but more generous than \u0022Whoops, you only get two refills\u0022. The trick of course is that Kerbals would start with a full tank, even if the Monoprop hits zero before they ever climbed out.\n\nThat latter part is *really* important for not stranding Kerbals. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
