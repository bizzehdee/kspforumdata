With solar being ignored or marginalized, then the battery capacity has no reason to be there (since it\u0027s not intended to be used) and in terms of launch mass a NFP or KSPI nuclear reactor\u002B10 years fuel is going to provide much better value than pre-loading a PDU with construction parts (and not penalize overall base efficiency in the process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PDU can operate at 50% capacity (basically the same as about 10 RTG\u0027s) without crew and without it\u0027s generator active. So you can bootstrap with a PDU and some supplemental solar arrays. You\u0027ll also want battery reserves for things that are more spikey, like drilling for resources, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower wise, we\u0027ll call 5,000 ElectricCharge per hour a \u0027Power Unit\u0027. All MKS modules use between one and four power units per hour. So a module\u0027s batteries can keep it online for an extra 15 minutes to two hours, and a PDU can extend this another 3-12 hours depending on the generator\u0027s draw. So with some good balancing, you just need enough solar to rejuvenate the various battery components (and we\u0027re talking 100K\u002B) which can be enough to handle a generator or two in the night cycle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as a yardstick, A PDU without constructionParts (i.e. bootstrap mode) should have sufficient power, without solar panels, to keep a ColonyHub and active ConstructionHub rolling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I tend to really optimize where I place crew, and which modules I have active (which is part of the intent with MKS - it makes these details important).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan for this weekend is to redo two reference missions - one to the Mun, and one to Duna - and provide the loadout for both (along with new screenshots and possibly some video) for the tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T12:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also see what the issue of heavy consumption likely is while bootstrapping...
