It\u0027s for use with TAC Life Support, and it\u0027s basically a crew cabin in which your Kerbals can go into hybernation on excessively long journeys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, I\u0027m not sure how to use it properly. I did what I think I\u0027m supposed to do, but when I test it, the Kerbals die when the regular life support supplies run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t find a page for this mod, on the forums or elsewhere. The only thing I was able to find was an old \u003Ca href=\u0022https://plus.google.com/102502739527953687981/posts/VSkUvE9dDjK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E posted by the creator on Scott Manley\u0027s Google Plus page. I sent him a reply, asking if there were any docs for this mod, but I never got a response from him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know anything about this mod? If so, could you let me know how to make it work? If not, does anyone know of a mod that does something similar?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T06:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll be would know about it but squad decided to delete all the mods from spaceport....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"philotical","CreatedById":109390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T08:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elike this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92806-WIP-PaladinLabs-Dev-Thread-DeepFreeze-cryonic-crew-storage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92806-WIP-PaladinLabs-Dev-Thread-DeepFreeze-cryonic-crew-storage\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MerlinsMaster","CreatedById":112079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T09:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022montyben101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022montyben101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027ll be would know about it but squad decided to delete all the mods from spaceport....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue dhat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T12:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022montyben101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022montyben101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027ll be would know about it but squad decided to delete all the mods from spaceport....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought they backed all of them up, but they aren\u0027t able to be released without the mod authors\u0027 permission or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
