I\u0027m starting a new career campaign with a story-driven ultimate goal based on Mass Effect (i.e. an alien-built interstellar transport relay---and gateway to galactic civilization!---is discovered at Khato: prepare a civilian colony \u0026 transport hub way the hell out there). In short, your work is critical for the future of kerbality!\n\n**Question**: The [64K rescaling mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96792-WIP-64K-%28a-Kerbol-6-4x-reboot%29-v0-4-%28KSP-0-25%29) (which scales up the Kerbol system by 6.4x; here\u0027s the [GameData folder on GitHub](https://github.com/KSP-64k/64k/tree/master/GameData)) is compatible with Outer Planets Mod, once you incorporate [this 64K Config for OPM](https://github.com/Tellion/OPM_64K/blob/master/64k/OPM/64K_OPM.cfg) by Tellion. I was wondering if you\u0027ve looked into providing compatibility configs for your expansions to OPM? I\u0027ve tried to do it myself, but I\u0027m not familiar with ModManager so I\u0027m not quite sure which values to change---it doesn\u0027t appear to be *quite* as simple as multiplying all of the numbers by 6.4! Some of your changes do work \u0022out of the box\u0022, but others don\u0027t, specifically:\n\n- **RemoteTech Expansion**: 64K includes [this RemoteTech config file](https://github.com/KSP-64k/64k/blob/master/GameData/64k/Compatability/RT_Settings_Changer.cfg), which automatically upscales the range of RemoteTech antennas by 6.4x using a simple \u0022RangeMultiplier = 6.4\u0022 entry. But (possibly because of ModManager load order?) it doesn\u0027t seem\\* to apply to the new antennas added by your RemoteTech expansion.\n\n\\*\n\n*However,*\n\nI\u0027m basing this on the descriptions in the tech tree, and I\u0027ve read that those may be misleading. Should that RangeMultiplier value apply to your added antennas (regardless of what the tech tree says), or do they need to be modified separately?\n\n- **PluronKhato**: While the solar orbit of the DunaIke binary system is scaled up and appears in the right place, PluronKhato is unaffected (and ends up becoming an inner planet under 64K). Should fixing this simply be a matter of multiplying the semi-major axis in your config file by 6.4, or is there more I need to consider? Such as...\n- **Moons/Barycenters?** I\u0027m not sure whether scaling is needed for moons or barycenter offsets for any of the systems you\u0027ve changed (i.e. DunaIke Binary, PluronKhato Binary, Tilted Urlum\u0027s moons), or if they\u0027re already covered by the \u0022across-the-board\u0022 scaling provided by either 64K or Tellion\u0027s configs.\n\n I realize I\u0027ve been a little vague with the above---I uninstalled the 64K mod after seeing that it didn\u0027t work, so I can\u0027t easily check the details. But I am of course more than happy to reinstall and report back with more precise information on what is and isn\u0027t being scaled, I just wanted to check in before I do---in case you already know what has to be done (or indeed if it *has* already been done), and/or to see if you\u0027re willing to help with the config tweaks in the first place, what with you already on a mission to redefine \u0022busy\u0022 for us mere mortals ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf so, let me know if the above details would be sufficient, or if there are any other tweaks you\u0027ve made that I should verify are working alongside 64K.\n\nAgain, thanks for all of your effort on these mods! It\u0027s hard to appreciate how awesome something like barycenters or Urlum\u0027s tilt are, until you\u0027re planning transfers or watching the sun do weird things in the sky ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T16:15:05Z","Content":"**Eunomiac**, thanks for the kind words ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027ll try answer most of your answers:\n\n1- 64K is not supported on PK yet, but I can easily write a config for you to use untill I get it into the mod.\n\n2- I expect the RemoteTech rangemultiplier to work with all the antennas my expansions add. the description will not reflect the correct range of the antenna.\n\nyou can check the antennas range using hyperedit to put a craft in a suitable orbit and point the antenna back to a craft orbiting kerbin\n\n3- as long as the planet pack supports 64K, SigmaBinary will generate the correct barycenter for it. so answer 1 will solve this issue as well.\n\n4- OPM Tilt \\*should\\* not have any problems with rescaling, you should do a quick check just to be sure ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027ll pm you the 64K config, in the meantime you have the time to check everything else and report back if you find any other issue ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T03:12:07Z","Content":"Welp, I thought I found a terrain glitch on recolored Eve resembling that one time Danny got under Minmus\u0027s surface but it turned out to just be a small lake."},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T05:41:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welp, I thought I found a terrain glitch on recolored Eve resembling that one time Danny got under Minmus\u0027s surface but it turned out to just be a small lake.\n\nI think you should be able to find that feature on stock eve too.
