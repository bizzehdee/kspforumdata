That\u0027s how I started out at least, fumbling about with a mouse, poor UV maps and no idea what I was doing. There\u0027s a huge increase in quality between the textures that will be coming out in future compared to what I have out already since I\u0027ve been UV unwrapping things differently, and I invested in a tablet. I\u0027ll go over things in a bit more detail using the Cutter as an example, but take everything with a grain of salt, I barely know what I\u0027m doing. If you compare my work to that of say \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/40761?p=605382\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post605382\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehelldivers\u003C/a\u003E, you can really see how much of an amateur I really am!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is done using many many layers, although I probably don\u0027t use them to their fullest potential.

The idea here is to get a feel for how I should do the latter stages, as well as taking the same colours for use, like the orange paint used on Rockomax parts, or the shade of yellow some pipes use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep one\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter UV unwrap, the first thing I do is to play around with block colours, getting the shades as close to the stock ones as I can manage. I also move colours around, seeing what works where. If you compare the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kiq5PYO.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst version of the Cutter to it\u0027s current iteration\u003C/a\u003E, you can see the pipe was originally dull flat grey and the orange was too bright.

If you look at the stock parts, you see the edges of parts are a different shade of colour. This makes the edges appear worn, and helps make each face distinct from those around it. If you look closely at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a3nq7tk.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBac9\u0027s parts\u003C/a\u003E you can see he takes this to another level of detail. The stock artstyle isn\u0027t quite the same as that though, which is why I don\u0027t take my highlights that far. If anything my highlights are still wrong because they\u0027re too thin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep three\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter highlights I start fiddling around with other layers on the main colour blocks. Stock parts almost never have a simple flat face of one colour, they all vary a little bit. I try to emulate this by taking the original colour and making it brighter and darker by a few steps and carefully applying that. On the Cutter you can see that I went around the edges of the orange, and added some strips to the flat grey face of the nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep four\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part to do, faking shading. The goal of this is to add depth to the part by carefully darkening places that would be shaded almost all the time. Every change I make here I immediately go and see how it looks on the model in Blender, and I often totally scrap various areas in order to redo them. As you can see on the Cutter, there are areas that still don\u0027t look quite right. I also don\u0027t hand paint every part of these, sometimes it\u0027s easier to draw a straight line and blur it out. The 0.625m monopropellent rocket above uses this in a few places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep five\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W7fhqUu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W7fhqUu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of everything else I add details, like the little warning sticker and the design that sits on the top that you don\u0027t see most of the time. Each detail usually takes a few steps of it\u0027s own, and almost always requires plenty of fiddling around to place right, or to get looking how I want it.

Like, it makes me squeal. The four resistojet array lets me use non-nuke power to get nuke-like performance. It\u0027s just something that makes ion/electric engines valid in another context.

Many parts will be gone, and there will be new parts to play with. I do need some feedback on how people use the pack as it stand right now though to help me! Mainly on how often people use the different sizes and types of engines. Many people mention how useful the Resistojets are, and those are definitely staying.
