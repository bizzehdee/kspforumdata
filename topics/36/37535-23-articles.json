This will allow me to move their elements without screwing them up. It will also allow me to do a good projection without object interference that can block rays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I move all the elements of the Low resolution game model first. I then use snap to vertex and move the high resolution elements so that they match perfectly with the low resolution elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cbxwDGZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cbxwDGZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I select my low resolution game model and then Render to Texture and select my high resolution model as the model to project from (reference geometry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The projection cage (in blue) has to be fixed so that all rays are cast correctly and with as minimal errors as possible, otherwise I\u0027ll have a lot of work to do in Photoshop. This can take a very long time depending on how complicated the model is. The projection tools are similar to standard mesh editing tools making the job slightly easier. Setting it to shade also helps in finding areas with casting problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I bake multiple times, typically at 256 or 512 resolution looking for miscasts. These can be found by setting miscast areas to show up as red on the baked texture (ray miss color).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note about what you can and can\u0027t do to a game mesh after you\u0027ve gotten to this point. The KSP 3D Studio Max wiki has some errors in it that I\u0027d like to clear up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you CAN do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can edit the geometry as much as you like, including deleting or adding geometry. However, your UVW will be messed up on any area you added \u003Cem\u003Ewithin an element\u003C/em\u003E. If the area you added was an element and it already had UVW information, your mesh will be perfectly fine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In fact the KSO is composed of a ton of pieces (elements) each with their own UVW that were all made into a solid object. This allowed me to move the UVW islands until it all fit on a single texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can delete any part of your mesh and your UVW will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For advanced users dealing with the skin modifier, you can also delete and add to your mesh that has a skin modifier, you just have to do it down to the editable poly level. However, you have to be careful and do only one addition at a time. Move the addition over and close to the area you\u0027ll attach it at. Never add or attach objects at the Skin Modifier level or you\u0027ll wreck the vertex weight assignments. With some practice you can get really good at adding/changing legs, arms, torsos, heads etc on characters that are already animated and skin weighted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can\u0027t do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can\u0027t share the UVW information of two different objects that have their own transform and vertex count/order. That means that if you add/subtract an element or vertex, you can only share UVW, Vertex Weight and Projection Cage information with a clone of that same object, but not of a clone whom you added or removed elements or vertices from its parent. This is for purposes of exporting and importing a UVW file, something most users here probably wouldn\u0027t be doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You usually can\u0027t share the same Normal Map of one object with the clone of the same object if that object had vertices removed, since it violates the rule above. Keep in mind when you bake a Normal it picks up the vertex/face tangent information of the mesh you casted on. However, you CAN share the same normal map on the clone of the same object which has had an element added or removed, as tangent information is preserved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis error manifests in a big nasty black spot on your model. You have no idea what\u0027s causing it since your smoothing groups are correct, and the mesh has no holes in it. That\u0027s when you discover that the tangents got fudged and you need to recast the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-All textures I bake have to be fixed. In particular, Normal maps will always have geometry errors of some sort which have to be cleaned up using the smudge tool in Photoshop. This is why it\u0027s important to get as clean a cast as possible as you won\u0027t have to do as much clean up work. Also, the closer your projection cage is to your game model (without intruding into the reference geometry) the less geometry errors you\u0027ll have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The AO map is used as the basis for all the shadows, grunge, and areas where dirt or dust has accumulated. This one also has to be cleaned up and typically takes the longest. Most 3D editing programs have issues with floating geometry and determining exactly where two parts intersect. So you\u0027ll often end up with the shadows and grunge offset by half a pixel. All those areas have to be filled in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe completed model with base texture, normal map, and a basic specular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iP0NSI0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iP0NSI0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I move on to final detail texturing.

Really I\u0027m amazed I have had the time to get the landing gear, RCS, attachment nodes, control surfaces, main engines and the cargo bay working. However I do have a lot of free time coming up (i.e. from now onwards, hopefully) to really get this to a state you\u0027ll all enjoy. Sorry to keep you all waiting. I want to get this done as quickly as possible, but at the same time not cut any corners. I want there to be at least some parts of this that should say to Squad \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E is how it\u0027s done\u0022. That said as soon as the main feature set is ready for playtesting I will push this out to you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelldiver, the lifter and new rudder you sent me really are quite minor additions (in terms of work involved) that should not affect the main development of the orbiter, so I am going to wait until I have everything else mostly feature-complete (but untuned - ready for playtesting) before upgrading to the latest assets. One good thing about Unity is that it makes such a process relatively painless. I must admit that there are some parts of the engine and editor that are mostly well thought through. I can only presume that this was all done by the one programmer at Unity that cared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, back to Unity I go...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T18:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odyssey","CreatedById":28858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T18:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was curious how progress is with the cargo bay arm.
