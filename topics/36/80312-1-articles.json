How would I go about adding stats view-able in the VAB/SPH, and making them accessible in code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How would I add things to a parts right click menu?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What would be the best way of adding a new PartModule to a bunch of parts (in my case most of the stock parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Can I have some clarification on the difference between extending Part and extending PartModule? My current understanding is that extending PartModule allows its to be added in a parts config for the purpose of adding behaviors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
