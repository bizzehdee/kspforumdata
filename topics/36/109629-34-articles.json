I know dragon has his qualms with these forums but little to no work has been done by dragon in months. I am fully aware he is not obligated to. Don\u0027t misconstrue my tone with arrogance or entitlement. It\u0027s just this project has taken so long to revive because of dragon. Because of delays, because of dragons relationship with the moderators and the ksp community. I guess what I am saying is that you shouldn\u0027t abandon your projects because they are too beautiful hiwever there are better modders and coders in the community and if you are waiting for dragon it\u0027s probably not gonna happen. Just FYI\n\nYou did not understand me. As I recall Jovzin working on a model, and over Dragon CFG for its addon. Dragon raised Shuttle old, and made him an outstanding job. Should we expect from this duo\u0027s outstanding performance? I think worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T07:23:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Honestly I will believe that when I see it.

Just FYI\n\nI don\u0027t want this to get too tangled up in anything.\n\nI like the idea that this mod is (outdated and now just a previous model) a work of the community and its development is powered by ideas from different people and of course to get it functional for the current release of KSP.\n\nit is undergoing improvements for gameplay enjoyability and realism factors and to continue what was not completed from its original release in the form of parts and intended plans(Thanks DECQ)\n\nI am more than happy to be the one to help put this together and to figure out the coding and whatever is needed to get it to its fans.\n\nalthough it may seem I am being competitive with official releases I am not intending it to be that way. but by adding extra development to this version may seem like it is, and I would rather add some originality if anything"},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T07:24:35Z","Content":"It\u0027s not just the FASA clamps that are bugged.

Dont devote your work to the \u0027need n demand\u0027 of the community. I said that before, Jovzin: if you want to make a space shuttle, go for it! Several examples have been made about mods which resemble the same theme, everyone unique without hijacking another.
