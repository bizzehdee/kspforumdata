What does change dramatically with distance is signal power. A lower signal power means more errors, which means increasingly sophisticated error-correction coding must be applied to maintain data integrity. This means that you must send more total bits to get the same volume of \u0027data bits\u0027 across the channel. Even for a fixed power, this increases the total energy required for transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think making someone sit through a 15 minute transmission is very interesting, but increasing the required transmit energy over distance could be a valid mechanic.

Keep it simple. Focus on the challenge to have a com network available when your probe needs input. And make it so that you have to design your craft in a way that there\u0027s an incentive to use the smaller antennas, either to keep power demands low or because larger antennas are hard to package and heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like the integration with sending scientifical data a lot, though. For me, the new research mechanism is the logical point for RT to tie into the game. It seems to me that in historical real-life space exploration pre-programmed control of probes was available pretty early on, and transmitting your data back to earth was more of a motivation to make networks of relay stations and satellites. It also just seems to be the logical point to tie RT into the current state of the game, expanding on a mechanism that is already in the game now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I agree with Dexter, don\u0027t rush that. The most important point is to get the connectivity working. It might also be important to get the list of parts needed stable early on to lessen the pain when upgrades come along. The rest can follow and people will most likely be able to continue to use the networks they built with your first new version, so an expansion of the features will propably be painless for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cilph","CreatedById":21477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T02:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of core functionality, I\u0027ll have to modify some core bits.
