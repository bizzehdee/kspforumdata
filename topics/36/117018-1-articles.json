It seems like it should remain constant if the extractor isn\u0027t changing altitude or anything. Crustal resources don\u0027t continue to increase in amount/sec when you use drills, for example.\n\nMods installed: Module Manager, Astroid Day, BioMass\n\nOut of curiosity I installed the Karbonite mod and looks at how the atmospheric extractor in that mod functions, and it shows the same behaviour.\n\nI\u0027m including some snippets to show how things are setup:\n\n    PLANETARY_RESOURCE{\tResourceName = XenonGas\tResourceType = 2\tPlanetName = Kerbin\tDistribution\t{\t\tPresenceChance = 100\t\tMinAbundance = 0.934\t\tMaxAbundance = 0.934\t\tVariance = 0\t\tDispersal = 0\t}}\n\n        MODULE    {      name = ModuleResourceHarvester      HarvesterType = 2      Efficiency = 1      ResourceName = XenonGas      ConverterName = Xenon Filter      StartActionName = Open Xenon Filter      StopActionName = Close Xenon Filter      INPUT_RESOURCE      {        ResourceName = ElectricCharge        Ratio = 1      }    }\n\nAnd here is a very short video showing what I am talking about:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ftITEwuJso?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIs this expected behaviour for atmospheric extraction, or is this a bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbinspacecommand","CreatedById":145686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T08:46:26Z","Content":"Were you able to solve this issue?"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T19:01:09Z","Content":"For me, this levels out at some point."}]}
