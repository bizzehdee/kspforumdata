Don\u0027t use the Zarya solar panels and the truss system and you will be ok. I recommend Near Future construction and Kosmos solar arrays as a substitute for the bugged pieces.

He\u0027s doing a pretty good job at keeping them useable through the multiple new releases. However it would be truly wonderful if Bobcat officially came back to update everything, but like life things come and go. So the bobcat mods are very playable and useable. There are a few modders out there playing with soviet style rockets as well as base building mods. Alexustas is working on an epic base building mod called Konquest. If he ever releases it, it will truly be something to behold. Roverdude has released an incredible base building mod MKS/OKS. raidernick is building all most of the soviet and American probes launched along with some of the rockets that took them there. DennyTX although he hasn\u0027t updated much in while still look pretty active has some incredible High Fidelity Soviet and American Mods. His Proton is extremely accurate and a wonderful launcher if you can spare the memory. So I mean Bobcat set the standard but there are plenty of modders out there who are exceeding what bobcat did. I think when everyone first starts out they get drawn to Bobcat because of HOME and the Soviet and American packs. But even when I first started HOME was being patched and hotfixed, so they are quite dated and you can tell as the graphics get better in the game how dated they are. I mean if you see them in any version under .22 they look amazing. Now with the exception of he Soyuz its a little dated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-04T15:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2014 03:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crunch","CreatedById":108489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T10:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall i can say is r.i.p\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T15:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crunch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crunch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eall i can say is r.i.p\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the posts above!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T04:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have an Iss craft file PLEASE that they wouldnt mind sharing I am having issues putting it togther\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obscureengineer","CreatedById":137110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T18:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey Guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I am Lucas. i wanted to know if you need some help with detailed and functional interiors? i also have a mod in progress called \u0022The Requirements Mod\u0022 where the kerbals have to eat, and drink. that my interiors can work with, i also have a system where you can open the hatch between the modules, and see into the other ones. if you need Some sweet seats for your kerbals, let me know.
