K\u002B aims to expand the Kerbol system by adding new planets and dwarf planets. As of the current release K\u002B adds 4 new moons orbiting a blue ringed gas giant and 4 new moonlets, increasing the challenge and the fun of KSP. \n\nScreenshots\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I learned alot when making Kerbol\u002B and now I know how to fix stuff myself, learned some more PQS mechanics, how to make height maps match the tsxture... here\u0027s a tip when making planets: you only need a color map. To make a height map just get a monocrome color map and for normals use a specific onlyne tool where you use the created height map. I don\u0027t remember the link to that online tool... also, to make monocrome texture (height map) from your color map, you can use Photoshop online."},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T12:58:01Z","Content":"Good news everybody!
