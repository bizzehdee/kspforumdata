I have run into quite a few problems during the process so have not been able to get it done before I go on holiday tomorrow so development is on pause until 21/8. So keep an eye out for a release around that time (probably around 24-25/8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GF65HGz.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022GF65HGz.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarsz","CreatedById":113000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T22:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoooo... very nice!
