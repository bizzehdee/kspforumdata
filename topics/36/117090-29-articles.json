But...I will likely also offer a 1.04 dll as a separate download (just so it includes this weeks\u0027 bugfixes). Will probably be the last week I do a 1.04 plugin, as I plan on swapping my dev environment over completely to 1.05 over the weekend.  \n\nHave been thinking that some of these mounts will be re-used for some of the custom-upper-stage mount options (specifically, the S-II and S-IVB mounts would be usable for the common-bulkhead type upper stages). So you\u0027ll have the option to use the engine cluster with mount on stock/other fuel tanks, or can use the engine cluster sans-mount on the custom-upper-stage fuel tank. Now, the reason to use the mount as-included in the upper stage (rather than the engine cluster) would be that it will add additional fuel capacity to the tank when used as part of the custom-upper-stage.  \n\nSo basically:  \n\n-- mount option used on the engine cluster = no added fuel capacity (mostly for legacy/compatibility use)  \n\n-- mount used as -part of- the custom upper stage tank = adds fuel capacity to the upper stage.  \n\nAdditionally, I intend on adding free-scaling capability to the mounts as part of the engine cluster, which would further complicate the use of any resource-switching; the custom-upper stages will be available in pre-set diameters as-per the existing custom-fuel tanks (with pre-calculated fuel-volumes). Will also be adding free-scaling of the engine spacing within the engine cluster module/gui, to more easily accomodate adjusting the spacing to match a specific mount/scale better.   \n\nThese two changes will also clean up the config and persistence of the engine cluster module; I currently store the mount-type as a raw index, and any changes to the order of mounts can change existing vessels on reload; going to a single-mount definition-per-mount-type means I can just store the name of the mount, and the users selected scale for it; so you can change the config for the engine cluster mount options, and not break existing vessels (could even remove that mount option entirely from the engine cluster, and it would still load properly on existing vessels, as long as the model were not removed as well).  \n\nSo... consider this the  \n\n[SIZE=3]Advanced Warning -- Existing/saved Vessels with engine cluster-parts will be breaking in either this weekends update, or next weekends\u0027, due to the upcoming changes in how engine-cluster mount type is saved. I will[/SIZE] [SIZE=3]post further warning and notice with the release that this update occurs in.[/SIZE]"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T03:08:10Z","Content":"Oh no!
