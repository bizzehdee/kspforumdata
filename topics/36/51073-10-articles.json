Allow background scanning while you\u0027re in the VAB or flying other ships. This also lets you have multiple ships scanning the same planet at once, and can have ships scanning multiple different planets at once, without having to watch the paint dry on any of them. WONDERFUL!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fix the Kethane scanners so they don\u0027t go blind at warps higher than 100x (they drop to 10% coverage at just 1000x warp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make the Kethane beam the same width as the SCANsat beam. Actually, I\u0027d prefer both to be conical like ISA was, so you could get more timely scanning (in terms of BOTH gametime and realtime) from higher orbits. At present, both SCANsat and Kethane scan in the least gametime from the lowest possible altitude, which maximizes the amount of realtime required because this is too low to warp at high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EJust to be clear: this is trivial from an implementation standpoint. However, it wouldn\u0027t allow for consuming ElectricCharge, which is my primary objection. Over the last couple months my thinking has been slowly shifting on this, but simply removing the electrical requirement and enabling unfocused scanning is unsatisfying, especially since the larger, heavier scanner would either be hugely disadvantaged (no unfocused warp) or not as differentiated (since it currently consumes more power).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis is by design. It\u0027s unrealistic and needs tweaking, but logarithmic scaling of the timewarp factor achieves a few important gameplay goals. Removing it would also introduce some bugs and technical challenges.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI will probably be adding some kind of conical feature to Kethane, but it will be something like \u0022you can pick a cell anywhere in this cone\u0022 rather than \u0022you\u0027ve scanned all the cells in this cone\u0022 to keep scan rates from spiking.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these suggestions are things I\u0027ve previously given a lot of thought to. SCANsat makes for an interesting testbed for some of these ideas, so I\u0027ll definitely be watching it closely. Just remember that Kethane is a different mod revealing a different kind of data, and things like coverage requirements are much different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all that said, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis is a SCANsat thread, not a Kethane thread\u003C/strong\u003E.
