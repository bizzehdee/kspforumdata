This is more the work of a Kerbal prodigy of some sort... you know, the kind that usually get shot out into space in something really far fetched and die a horrible and spectacular death before leaving the launchpad. If this were truly \u003Cem\u003EKerbal\u003C/em\u003E it would have to (as stated in the rule sheet which I conveniently dropped in the rocket testing bucket, and has by now certainly been incinerated along with other incriminating evidence that, as I assure you all, does not exist) have some sort of explosive device used to push the ramp out from its storage space in the main module. This explosion would have at least a 48.67% chance of destroying the main housing unit of the ramp itself and a 22.3% chance of killing everyone on board. Very good odds, I assure you.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is one instance that I am glad the rules (which do not exist... at least not after Jeb excitedly pushed the ignition switch of our last batch of test rockets before we had a chance to lock down the testing arena) are being ignored.
