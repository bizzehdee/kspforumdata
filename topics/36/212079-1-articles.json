I\u0027m trying to do it as realistically as possible, so I need to be able to find out how much the cockpit of an aircraft weighs by itself. The dimensions aren\u0027t a problem since it\u0027s straight forward enough to determine from 3-view line drawings, and I can easily rescale parts with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patches. And in case of a fuselage that\u0027s not circular, I can rescale non-procedural fuselage parts along\u00A0 a single axis to get the closest match possible. But in both cases I have no idea how much mass to give the scaled parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay I\u0027m building a Boeing 737 replica. Is there any database online where I can look up the weight of individual sections of the aircraft? For example, how much does a single meter of round 737 fuselage weigh? Or how much would the cockpit section weigh (say it\u0027s arbitrarily defined as the section between the tip of the nose and a few meters down the aircraft)?
