So how is this gonna work?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe shuttle flys much more realistically now; like a brick! Although the roll authority is a bit op as it could get the 747 to do an aileron roll. But thats all. Did you change the lifting body issue in the lastest version? Because the shuttle no longer has any body lift. It has standard lift. It should have a a little body lift on the main body of the shuttle (cyan in aero forces overlay) and wing lift on the wings (dark blue in aero forces overlay). The thing is the shuttle is one piece with the wings. So this might not be possible unless the wings are separate parts.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThis is what im talking about ![YcLkmgL.png](http://i.imgur.com/YcLkmgL.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T21:17:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by XxDARKWOLF67Xx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T22:30:17Z","Content":"Control surface power has been reduced but have not uoloaded new update yet. \n\nLook in the cfg for the ine piece.\n\nIts quite simple.
