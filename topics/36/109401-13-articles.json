That said, I\u0027ll probably enlarge the window apertures a little bit.\n\n-Mk3 deployable wheels - kinda want to pass on this, if only becasue BD adjustable landing gear render everything else obsolete.\n\n-Mk3 solar array - I have a few ideas for something along these lines, but no promises.\n\n-Mk3 massive fighter cockpit - large-scale cargo/tanker/shuttlebus planes don\u0027t seem like the sort of thing you\u0027d need a high-vis bubble canopy for. Make a convincing argument for it, and I\u0027ll consider one.\n\n-Mk3 chine/fuselage adapter to wing adapters - The mk3 chines were designed to work as wing roots for the standard wing boards, and the fuselage extenders/saddletanks can do the same for the mk3 wing pieces. Or did you mean something mroe like a mk3 version of the mk2 spadetail?\n\n-Mk3 triple-mode engine - what particular niche would this fill? I could see a dual cycle vac engine that could toggle between high thrust, low ISP and low thrust, high ISP being useful, but what would the third mode be?

For tailfins, the idea would be to take tall vertical or diagonal tailfins and fold them down to avoid smacking into anything sticking out of the station, and for wings a two or three piece foldup to minimize the distance they stick out (I\u0027ll have to draw a concept sketch for that). Putting things on them like engines or something would obviously be a bad idea, since that would put (relatively) vulnerable components in the way of reentry heat. For a spaceplane, you\u0027d want to keep those high and out of the direct plasma stream on the body somewhere, and keep the wings low if you\u0027re making a folding-wing design."}]}
