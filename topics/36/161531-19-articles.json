This is because the normal, fuel-efficient way to use a thermal rocket is always to start with the lowest-ISP propellants first, and work through that list to get to the higher-ISP propellants, as you get MUCH better Delta-V for the same spacecraft when you consume your less efficient fuels first...

Right now for the 16000 liter tank it is 20, 15, 10 Ec/s (Hydrogen, Nitrogen, CO2). Regarding the exact power cost, I think we need some more accurate estimations. Besides cooling, I believe Hydrogen tanks should also always leak a little, even with enough power due to the small molecules peneatrating the tank wall. I need some good estimes of how much. This is already a existing feature of the Cryostat tanks but not applied. Also note I can already vary the power requirments depending on how much much the tank is filled yet. I also have a idea to modify the power cost depending on the temperature of the tank, that way, it would require significantly less power in the shade or far away from the sun. The opposite, will also be true, going to Moho, will require a lot of more power to keep your tanks cool.

Right now for the 16000 liter tank it is 20, 15, 10 Ec/s (Hydrogen, Nitrogen, CO2). Regarding the exact power cost, I think we need some more accurate estimations. Besides cooling, I believe Hydrogen tanks should also always leak a little, even with enough power due to the small molecules peneatrating the tank wall. I need some good estimes of how much. This is already a existing feature of the Cryostat tanks but not applied. Also note I can already vary the power requirments depending on how much much the tank is filled yet. I also have a idea to modify the power cost depending on the temperature of the tank, that way, it would require significantly less power in the shade or far away from the sun. The opposite, will also be true, going to Moho, will require a lot of more power to keep your tanks cool.

It is related to one thing only: the rate at which heat leaks into it (which is entirely determined by the surface area). For that matter the rate at which cryogenics boil off when NOT cooled is also related almost entirely to the surface area (bigger tanks tend to boil off a bit more slowly due to their thinker walls- a tank with 8 times the volume will have 4 times the surface area and walls twice as thick- for exactly the same ratio of tank mass to volume... But thicker walls act as better insulators...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E All this means that it can sometimes be more effective to split the same amount of fuel into a larger number of smaller tanks, even though each of the smaller tanks requires more electricity relative to its volume (I hope this relationship between tank volume and electrical requirements being non-linear is still represented with the new tank types, as it was with the Nitrogen tanks), if some of the fuel will be used earlier in the mission and some later- so you don\u0027t have to cool as much tank volume later in the mission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I mainly kept this sorting for historical reasons, but I\u0027m not pleased how it works now.
