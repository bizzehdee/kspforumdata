Some of the stuff is there, but not enabled. I have to go a completely new route as many things wouldn\u0027t work properly had I pursued the multi-projector route (eg. any transparent things like clouds wouldn\u0027t be handled properly, scaled space shadows shake violently with camera movement, and multiple bodies obscuring the sun would result in multiple darkening passes being very unrealistic.) so I\u0027m pursuing the single projector, multi-body shader for macro space, and an additional body material that handles multiple casts. I may turn this into a full scale lighting pass shader.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027blackrack\u0027]And another question about projectors, how do you geenerate them from the clouds texture for the shadows?[/QUOTE]  \n\nOooh... a loaded question... basically, we take the vertex, the sun Direction, the body position and the cloud sphere radius, and use sphere collision math to determine at what distance a ray from that vertex would hit the cloud sphere. Then we take that, and get the cloud position with vertex\u002B(sunDir\\*distance) and from there, we use the body position to get the point of the sphere that resolves to. From there, we just plug that into our existing formula to fetch the texture.
