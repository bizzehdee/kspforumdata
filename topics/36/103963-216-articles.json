All my money today goes to the Bank to pay my apartment.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was from that club, building PC Windows machines when i was younger. Today, i only use Mac. And seeing the time after Steve Jobs is gone, Apple is going slowly down the road, i don\u0027t see much light in the end of tunnel. But will be, soon. First Mac need to be cheaper in Brasil, then Apple or another business need to do a better system then OS X (For me, this is the best, i don\u0027t care for other opinions on that madder, so, put the war Windows/OSX aside, this is personal taste, only)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am thinking in the new Macbook Pro 15, but need a better price. Until then, i will stay without this mod.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think too it is gorgeous, i can install and use it, the thing is my FPS go to much down.\n\u003E \n\nOh well, I\u0027m currently putting together an i3-2120 and gtx 780 build from used parts (apart from PSU and HDD which I\u0027m buying new). The whole thing should cost me 300 euros and should perform more than okay for the price, eventually I\u0027ll upgrade the CPU if I find something good. So there is always the option to put together a relatively cheap PC for games if you\u0027re okay with some components being used and it will perform better than any mac your money can buy on virtue of the GPU alone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-28T20:59:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2016 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T23:19:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh well, I\u0027m currently putting together an i3-2120 and gtx 780 build from used parts (apart from PSU and HDD which I\u0027m buying new).

Like Dell/Alienware ones, and make it work. The upgrade is hard, but i now a bit of this process of open and dismantle an iMac, so i think i will try it. This because i love my iMac and if i can put an nVidia 765m, or 780m, 880m, this upgrade will give my machine at least 3 more years of good life. I already put memory and SSD (that make it scream). With a more or less 4 gb graphics card, that would be for real 5x better then the actual 6770m 512mb, well, and only for a fraction of the money. I will do it.\n\nBecause is not only the computer, but the operating system and the facility of use/manage too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-28T23:20:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2016 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Climberfx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tekener","CreatedById":117427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T03:52:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 27.11.2016 at 7:57 PM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm, I thought the whitecaps shading was messed up by the sky reflections, but your screens show the sky reflections. I\u0027m not sure, but try turning the sky reflections off and tell me what happens.\n\u003E \n\nI can confirm [@TheKurgan](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164104-thekurgan/)\u0027s issue with the whitecaps: they are gone and no matter which setting I try they don\u0027t appear. I still have a screenshot with the settings of the whitecaps I used to have, so I don\u0027t need to remember the values - but they are not working anymore, all I get as \u0022whitecap\u0022 is a slightly brighter blue than the ocean itself.\n\nI tried turning on/off the accurate sky reflection but nothing changed, the ocean looks still the same without any white ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\nEdit - what I noticed when actually comparing the old and new images:   \n\nAnd actually the sun reflecion on the water is nearly gone as well, only getting a \u0022brighter\u0022 ocean when the sun shines, but no real light reflecion on the waves like it used to be. Also the sky isn\u0027t that bright in the sunlight and the shadows are not that dark anymore? And the horizon is also broken in the new version.  \n\nTop image is 1.1.3, bottom one 1.2.1 with same ocean settings. Skey reflection does not really change anything.\n\n![ocean_comparisson.jpg](http://tekener.com/KSP/ocean_comparisson.jpg)\n\nHow can I get the same effect as in 1.3.1 in the above picture?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-29T04:15:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2016 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tekener**"}]}
