It is not a good thing to have the SRBs going at full power whilst the fuel is running out. That will lead to the TWR getting way to high and is not realistic. ETC is extremely useful as times, hence why I am working on configuring my launchers for this mod.\n\nYes Yogui87s mods are wonderful! The ESA pack doesn\u0027t currently work with KSP v.1.0.4 as nodes need flipping and engines needs to be re-configured. Hopefully he does update the ESA mod so that people who do not play in RSSRO can enjoy his launchers.\n\nMy mod is meant for Real Solar System and the launchers are much to powerful for stock KSP. This mod is not meant for every single KSP player, but serves more as a realism pack for the more advanced players.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Very cool.\n\u003E But can you make configs for Stock like the Vega?\n\u003E \n\u003E ETC decrease the Thrust of the Boosters.
