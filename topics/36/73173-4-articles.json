At the moment, BatteryLife can\u0027t be restored. Kerbals will have to change them out, hopefully with more proficiency than they do lightbulbs. Radials should be easy to do with KAS (small ones, anyway). Inlines, not sure.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple method\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you could use a resource, similar to the generators from interstellar, in how it changes resources from one type to another. Start with say Iron, convert iron to electric power, and create oxidized iron. Then convert oxidized iron to iron again, but with an additional waste product. This will give you true function, but no real purpose, as it is functionally the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplex method. Similar to above, only using more resources, to better simulate how batteries work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattery = multi fuel storage compartment, have some extra space, so say 120 for 100 resources. Say Iron and Copper. Both are needed to make electricity, you need a 1-1 ratio. When converting the oxidized form back to normal, have one convert at a greater than 1-1 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to start Batter = 120/120 storage with 100 iron/100 copper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrained, and recharged, now you have 120/120 storage with 105 iron/100 copper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDraining at a 1-1 ratio, you are going to end up with too much iron oxide to convert into iron, as you reach the 120 capacity. Because copper is stable, you can never get more than a full charge, even with the extra iron you get at first. As Iron oxide builds up (from lack of room to convert it back) your battery starts losing the charge it can produce (going dead). Eventually, you will not really be able to recharge it at all as it slowly dies over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they are KAS compatible you could change them out on stations and mutli usage ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T20:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Umbrae\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T20:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWrapping my head around that.

Unless I am missing something, I don\u0027t see any advantage to that over just replacing the battery itself, specifically as it saves on texture space which is extremely limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, let me re-explain my idea a bit more. I have often have trouble explaining complex system, I apologize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll numbers in this are for simplicity only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 new resources, Iron, Copper, and Oxidized Iron, and Oxidized Copper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatters work like a generator, using both iron and copper to produce electric power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe waste product of this conversion is Oxidized Iron, and Oxidized Copper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatters cannot be recharged forever, but they can be recharged several time before they stop holding some charge, then eventually die totally. To simulate this, here is what I propose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth iron and Copper are used in equal amounts to make electric change, and each one gives off an equal amount of oxidized version. So 1 electric charge for example takes 1 copper, and 1 iron, also produces 1 oxidized iron, and 1 oxidized copper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recharge, use electric charge to convert oxidized resources back into the normal form (taking a bit more charge than it does to get electricity, so overall batteries are a power sink for the convenience of storing it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here is the trick, to simulate the battery going dead over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince only the non-oxidized versions of a resource work, have one resource convert back to the non-oxidized for at an increased rate. So 1 oxidized iron becomes 2 iron, but one oxidized copper becomes 1 copper. Naturally, there will not be room to convert all of the iron, so you will end up with more and more oxidized iron that is nothing more than waste. This would instantly lower the available charge, as both Iron and copper are needed, but you now have 100 copper, but only half that of iron (the rest being oxidized with no room to convert).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut batteries don\u0027t instantly start going dead, so we need another trick for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave extra room for resources in the battery. For example if the battery holds 400 iron (or iron oxide), and 400 copper (or copper oxide), but only 100 iron and copper, first charge, works fully 100 electric power generated, and are left with 100 of each oxidized resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvert back from oxidized, now you have 200 iron, and 100 copper, which is then used and converted into 100 electricity. Recharge, now you have 300 iron, and 100 copper. Over time as you keep recharging the problem exasperates itself, the next charge 400 iron, 100 copper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is where it starts getting interesting. The next recharge conversion will run out of space to convert iron. With 300 extra iron, but only 100 space left it will only make 50 iron for a total of 350. Now you are on a downward spiral, but as you still have 100 of both non-oxidized resource, you are still producing the same power output. As you recharge, you now have even more oxide built up with no room to convert, 300 iron. Then 250, 200, 150, 100... Once you have 300 oxidized iron built up that is your last full charge with 100 iron to make electric charge from. Once that is used, the next recharge, you will only get 50 iron back, so you will only be able make 50 electric charge. Each recharge is going than half the electric power your batter can produce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain these numbers are just for simplicity, but I hope you get the concept I am trying to describe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T10:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m going to dissect this.

SAS/ASAS is like an Autopilot. Both use Gyroscopes (even the earliest Electric or vacuum autopilots had Gyros in them. The main difference, the SAS/ASAS impart control moment themselves. An Autopilot senses a change in directionality of the plane in question, then adjusts the control devices (Ailerons, Elevators, Rudders, RCS etc,) to bring the plane\u0027s flight path back on track. Modern Autopilots use a combination of GPS and Gyros to determine aircraft plotted vs real location and can self coarse correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rohanguard1","CreatedById":118303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T17:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some suggestions, Incorporate Bargin Rocket parts and/or homegrown rockets.
