Landertrons can now be armed from an action group. Also, you can now decouple Landertrons when you\u0027re done using them, either from an action group or EVA. Finally, less horrible stuff should happen if you attempt to limit thrust via tweakables.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea was to make small SRBs designed to aid with parachute landings, but they actually work pretty well without a chute! Like the Soyuz capsule, they\u0027re designed to produce a short powerful burst just before landing to slow you down to a safe speed. The lander in the picture below can freefall from Kerbin orbit and land safely with the Landertrons firing a few seconds before impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T8xUhc9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022T8xUhc9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDependencies \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82341-23-5-Bahamuto-Dynamics-CritterCrawler-AnimatedEngines-etc-v1-0-%28Jun7%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBahamuto Dynamics Animated Engines\u003C/a\u003E (These models are being used for the Landertron parts.

That means once you start them up they can only fire at full throttle. Normally, SRBs can\u0027t be turned off. Here, I explode them when I need them to stop. In either case, there\u0027s no way to turn them back on. Yes, this could be a much gentler landing autopilot, but those already exist and that wasn\u0027t my main goal. I will keep working on fine tuning the landing process to make it as gentle as I can for this type of rocket. If the Landertrons aren\u0027t good enough for you on their own, I suggest adding a small \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-WIP-0-22-x-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-parts-and-real-drag%21-v0-3-1-4-12-13\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealChute\u003C/a\u003E parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T23:53:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by XanderTek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Desrtfox","CreatedById":80185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T04:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XanderTek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XanderTek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Desrtfox\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked into it a bit more, and KIDS probably is affecting the landings. I\u0027m working on improving that. Its a bit tricky, because I don\u0027t want to sacrifice the normal performance of the Landertrons, which is a very delicate thing. It should work at least somewhat better in the next version. For now, feel free to play around with the .cfg settings (heightmultiplier and offset) to force the Landertrons to fire earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll keep thinking about liquid rocket options. While I would like this system to work with any engine, for now I think I\u0027ll focus on getting it working with a small selection of parts.

Perhaps a more universal or even refuelable system might make the current landertrons OP. I wouldn\u0027t say that I have a need for a reusable system, it just seemed like the obvious next step. Perhaps though, it\u0027s better to leave them one shot, simple systems like they are now.

The thought is that the rocket fires normally until touchdown, and then the vent nozzle pops open. With a much larger opening and no nozzle to speak of, the rest of the fuel burns off at a downright horrible ISP with the downward thrust dropped to almost nothing. (In fact, I think this behavior is preferable even for the one-shot version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually this would be quite useful as we may not have been able to kill all lateral motion. With all the gas venting up and out it would produce a downward force that might be enough to keep all our feet on the ground for that crucial moment while the lander is trying to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to get really fancy, you could animate part heat for the nozzle, plug casing, and maybe even the vent nozzle (hell, the seals may not be perfect, and the part could \u0022leak\u0022 combustion gas, damaging any part that\u0027s in the wrong place at the wrong time, quite kerbal I would say \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).In fact if you wanted that last extra bit of detail you could make the paint on the fuel plug char from the heat, giving a visual indication that it has been spent, and refreshing the texture when it\u0027s been refueled and is ready to go again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea I had for placing the nozzles \u0022underneath\u0022 the pod becomes easier with the vent valve. Just have a part made so that the vent sits flush against the surface and clip the main body of the part through with the nozzle clipping back out the bottom. That would make it impossible to refuel though, but you could have the vent and plug access both sit flush with the skin if you didn\u0027t want to keep that limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
