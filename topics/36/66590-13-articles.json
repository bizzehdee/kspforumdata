A Hayabusa re-entry capsule was requested a few times. It would surely be good to reduce the part count. My solution for orbital sample return was a cluster of tiny rockets, each with two of talisars \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escience containers\u003C/a\u003E. Two containers would be good to allow you to return full science value of e.g. Minmus soil samples.

A two-part design might make sense. Use a capsule with a heatshield, one (or two, as Cpt. Kipard suggests) sample storage spaces and a small parachute. Add a backshell with a decoupler built into the top, 50-100 M/S RCS fuel/motors and an hour or so of battery power. By itself it could get down from LKO. Pop the backshell off when the parachute opens. Use the backshell for attach points for whatever motors and such are needed to get the capsule back from further out, Remotetech antennas, and whatever else someone might want to stick on. Should be a fairly simple to use system that can be pretty much glued onto an existing vehicle and separated without leaving any parts laying around. It\u0027s probably a separate project all by itself, But would be nice to have around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
