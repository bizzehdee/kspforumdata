I have used GMAX and not unity but I\u0027m sure I can get the hang of that with out too much trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as for the ideas for feedback... Creating kind of like a large mod, that includes life support (need help writing resources which I do not think that is too hard). Adding a new form a fuel with a new series of engines that runs off of new fuel that was I mentioned. Along with new command pods and a whole set of other essential pieces basically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation parts and maybe base pieces. I realize this is a very tall order and would take a lot of work but I need help with the coding part of everything also I have no former expereince in unity only in GMAX and sketchup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a few questions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is it possible to model stuff in GMAX or Sketchup and import and fine tune in Unity? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

What I do is install with steam, then make a copy of install folder to your desktop and play from there. Not only is it easy to get into the folder to install mods and make tweeks, but iy leaves you a clean install waiting in steam folder to be copyed again if need be. Plus you dont have to worry about steam auto updating ksp and leaving it possibly unplayable due to mods being installed that need update as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T19:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I have an additional setup for testing which is basically a copy of the KSP subtree but with the Squad parts trimmed right back to the minimum half-dozen or so needed to launch a rocket, so it loads in seconds rather than minutes.
