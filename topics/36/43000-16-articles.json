But apparently, there is a confusion between KerbTown plugin and Kerbin City Project, I feel embarrassed that from the video it sounds like it\u0027s Razchek\u0027s lack of organization. Yeah, I must say I had a big time problem with organization as you know but it\u0027s a one-of-a-kind project and apparently I don\u0027t know sometimes where to put things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t quite understand the confusion with links. If people want to download a mod, they should go to modding showcase forum, the development thread is used just for that, development. Most of the mods have a development thread, AND the showcase tread. The catch in this project is that there is not just one modder who publishes and sends links to showcase, but since it\u0027s a community project that invites anyone to join the development, I need to put info about it also to inform those who download it, that is why it\u0027s maybe confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is that the download is... one day old. It still is \u0022hot\u0022 and didn\u0027t cool down so of course there is a lot of confusion and I ran down to publish it as soon as possible (well at least I did the newspaper thingy xD).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd actually, there is only one requirement, and that is KerbTown plugin. So 2 downloads in total. The reason why I am not bundling it with Kerbin City is, firstly, in this way I pay full respect to Razchek for making the awesome plugin by redirecting to his thread, and secondly, if Razchek puts a new version of the plugin, I might not be right away there to update it in my bundle too, so the versions might be out of sync and cause a lot of trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the future of the project:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a big confusion about the phases too xD Some people are asking what is phase 3 (or C) now. If you read the phase description carefully you can see that phase B is not about modelling, it\u0027s about the masterplan, the more precise layout of what is to come and then, laying down of the streets, but not the plots. Phase B is meant to have everyone involved in brainstorming about it. I wrote people down in Phase 3 or C (C from now on, I always confuse numbers and letters) in the readme, cause these are people who asked for plots. So, lets say that phase C is going to be the actual modelling of the plots, but there actually will not be plots in the sense of the phase A because the method will be different (you can read about it in phase B section of Dev corner). CONFUSING, I know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, I will give you a more extensive description of phase B. I will update you on this later and hopefully things will be much clearer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, back to work =) I have an airport to finish and overlook how the rest are doing =)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-28T00:01:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2013 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T00:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwaiting if my plot should be remodeled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Desmond Tiny","CreatedById":68311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T01:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, good to see this project made it into ksp weekly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, about my plot, I am taking a rather long time.
