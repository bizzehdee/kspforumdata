Some people say 7k tris is too much per engine, some say its fine. You have to balance the tri count per object based on how many you think players are going to use per scene. Engines for instance will probably be singular, or in pairs typically... but trusses and girders need to be much more optimized due to them being used multiple times per rocket/station/base. I won\u0027t know what my triangle counts are until I finish the first release and see if it needs further optimization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using this image I made as a rough reference for part modeling. The number on the left is the low poly segments per cylinder. the number on the right is the number I use for the highpoly reference mesh. I still will probably adjust the 5m radius (6.25 scaled,most likely my largest part radius) low poly, due to conversion/step down optimization to the lower radius polygons. If you look at the bottom and top of my engine mesh posted a couple pages back, you\u0027ll see what I mean by conversion/step down optimization. I\u0027m sure there is an actual technical name for this technique, but I don\u0027t know it offhand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8424612/KSP/singularity_scale.png\u0022 alt=\u0022singularity_scale.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a power of 2 grid in photoshop, but when i drag these parts into my 3d app, i make sure to convert their pixel dimensions to metric units (100 pixels for 1meter part, 200 for 2meter part, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-20T14:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2014 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Daemoria\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed image link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daemoria","CreatedById":103696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T14:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is why sleep is recommended, kids. otherwise you derp on image links.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cziken20","CreatedById":95907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T18:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals ar just 75 cm?

You could easily do way more with the system resources stock parts consume, the mainsail is over 8K, but it\u0027d probably look fine under 3K.
