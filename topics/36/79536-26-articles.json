However, let me detail some of the major consumers of memory one will bump into with Kopernicus. At the moment, even if you don\u0027t use the built in planets the resources for them still consume memory. This is because the assets for the stock planets and moons are actually in the autoloaded unity asset bundles. It might be possible to destroy these assets at load time, but the issue is that KSP doesn\u0027t intelligently load things. Kopernicus won\u0027t know what stock bodies could be deleted until after Kopernicus processes its config files, at which point the game has already crashed from breaking the memory barrier because we literally can\u0027t process configs until the asset loading is done. We are probably stuck with some of the memory overhead of the stock planets (dunno if the MapSO source textures are destroyed), I suppose someone can experiment and see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for Kopernicus generated bodies, there are some notable sources of memory consumption\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Heightmaps - The best possible storage on disk is of one channel, grayscale textures. KSP stores heightmaps internally as 8 bits per channel, one channel textures of the source resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Colormaps - Surface color maps are stored internally as 8 bits per channel, 3 channel textures of the source resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Biome Maps - stored internally as 8 bits per channel, 3 channel textures of the source resolution, which doesn\u0027t need to be that high. (Why squad didn\u0027t use a one channel \u0026lt;uncompressed\u0026gt; texture or a 4-5 bits/pixel packed binary format with the value corresponding to the biome ID escapes me, 32-256 biomes would still be ridiculous)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should note however - since none of these textures end up on the GPU, as they are used as part of the PQS or other systems \u003Cstrong\u003ETHEY CAN NOT BE COMPRESSED IN MEMORY (SO NO DDSLoader)\u003C/strong\u003E. Best practice also would have these textures places in the PluginData/ directory of your mod so that they aren\u0027t loaded into the texture database, as they aren\u0027t needed by the GPU. However, the two remaining uses\u003Cstrong\u003E CAN \u003C/strong\u003Ebe compressed, so I highly recommend using DDSLoader or ActiveTextureManagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Scaled Space Colormap - The colormap used to texture the scaled space body of your planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Scaled Space Normalmap - The normal map for the scaled space body\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recommended mod layout would be as follows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGameData/MyAwesomePlanet\u003Cbr\u003E|\u003Cbr\u003E---- MyAwesomePlanet.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E---- PluginData/\u003Cbr\u003E    |\u003Cbr\u003E    ---- HeightMap.png\u003Cbr\u003E    ---- ColorMap.png\u003Cbr\u003E    ---- BiomeMap.png\u003Cbr\u003E---- Textures/\u003Cbr\u003E    |\u003Cbr\u003E    ---- ScaledColorMap.dds\u003Cbr\u003E    ---- ScaledNormalMap.dds\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a thought experiment, lets say you are running seriously high quality textures (8k x 4k)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe height map and color map together represent 4x 8 bit channels (32 bits x 8k x 4k) = 128 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biome map you can get away with like 1024x512, so 1.5 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scaled space color map of 8kx4k is a DXT1 (rgb, 6:1) compressed texture for the color, so 16 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scaled space normal map of 8k x 4k is a DXT5 (rgba, 4:1) compressed texture for the color, so 32 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, for an 8k x 4k textured planet, you\u0027re looking at a 176 MB ram impact (ouch...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a 4kx2k textured planet, you\u0027re looking at 44 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a 2kx1k textured planet, you\u0027re looking at 11 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a 1024x512 textured planet, you\u0027re looking at 2.75 MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and so on ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is just the memory consumed by the resources themselves, there is potentially up to a 2x overhead because of how the PQS functions, but since those resources are freed when not needed, its not cumulative consumption. However, these are some alternatives for simplistic bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best memory efficiency is with planets/moons like Gilly. Gilly doesn\u0027t have a heightmap or colormap that is used in the PQS generation process. There is a low resolution color map and a normal map that is used to texture the scaled space (map view) version of the body. Other than that, Gilly is procedurally generated for the height and the colors, and has far lower memory impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo its up to the artist to strike a balance between raw quality and the performance considerations. I will disclose however, that I\u0027ve exclusively run KSP on 64 bit Linux since the Linux version was available, mind you I\u0027ve been a Linux user since 2004. KSP just runs so cleanly, as Linux handles high load tasks more efficiently that both Windows and OS X (you will still hit a performance barrier because KSP is still single threaded). If you have an ATI card, your results may vary, but if you have an Nvidia card, you\u0027ll have nothing but smooth sailing IF YOU INSTALL THE PROPRIETARY DRIVERS. You\u0027ll also want to make sure to install the ttf-msfonts for KSP uses the microsoft Arial fonts. After that, launch KSP with these options, as it will instruct the Nvidia driver to use its multithreaded workqueue system, and it ended up doubling my KSP performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E# Launch KSP with some special sauce\u003Cbr\u003ELD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 ./KSP.x86_64 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003EYou may ask why there is a separate scaled space texture and PQS color map texture, just use one and save memory right? Well, sadly it doesn\u0027t work that way. The texture is used as a source to generate an object called a MapSO, which feeds things like the PQS colormap, heightmap, and the body\u0027s biome map. It can\u0027t be fed from a compressed texture, but is stored raw internally. The source texture can then be deleted. Instead of having two copies of a large texture in existance (MapSO, scaled space), we just kill off the source texture of the MapSO and load a compressed texture for scaled space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T22:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teknoman117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teknoman117","CreatedById":53200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T06:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I\u0027ve got rudimentary support for PQS loading.

Well, sadly it doesn\u0027t work that way. The texture is used as a source to generate an object called a MapSO, which feeds things like the PQS colormap, heightmap, and the body\u0027s biome map. It can\u0027t be fed from a compressed texture, but is stored raw internally. The source texture can then be deleted. Instead of having two copies of a large texture in existance (MapSO, scaled space), we just kill off the source texture of the MapSO and load a compressed texture for scaled space.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was about to ask, yes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i have to wait until the PQS stuff is finished (no pressure at all, you guys do an awesome job) i\u0027ll just draw some maps for different sized planets/moons to find a good compromise for all the different shapes then.
