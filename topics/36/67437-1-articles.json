I just have a quick question. Ok so I downloaded the old Command Pod Mk1 and am now trying to edit it because there is no hatch. So to make up for the pod having no hatch and Kerbals not being able to get out I have gone in the part file and added Crew Report, EVA Report, and Take Surface Sample. All three work perfectly. The last thing I want to do now is add Plant Flag, but I don\u0027t know how its supposed to be written in the part file. Does anyone know? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randomness5555","CreatedById":53367,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T19:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe look under the modding information section?
