Is this using KCT with or without StageRecovery? If it\u0027s with StageRecovery, just add \u0022clamp\u0022 to the ignore list. If it\u0027s without StageRecovery then I don\u0027t think you should even be receiving failed recovery messages. The reason it happens is because KSP for whatever reason is firing the OnDestroy event for the launch clamps and that\u0027s the event that StageRecovery listens to for determining when things are being deleted. You can also turn failed recovery messages off in StageRecovery if you don\u0027t care for them much (but the flight GUI will still list them if you really want to see them).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T03:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust saw the new build, so the in came checking worked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Will check existing saves first and if that goes ok will install RSS again to check that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the KCT button, on continuing games there is initially no buttons at all in the space center screen including the stock bar.
