It\u0027s too much to write all of that down but I hope this will bring everything in line and I don\u0027t have to change anything vital after that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know yet how well I can support the older version in the new update. For example the texture from MobileVAB is used on the OritalHangar, PAM, PAM(small), FabricationContainer and the StationTanks. I\u0027m gonna update this texture and the old models will look horrible.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E BTW I plan on dropping the OrbitalHangar in the next release because I mostly forget that it\u0027s even there.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That is exactly what happens with current stabel versio\uFEFFn of KD and EL and why I switched to % ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now your patch does exactly the same if SC is installed or not.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So far SC support was only necessary because of the differeing density of Metal but I found a way avoid that once and for all with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E. Here is the important part of the ResourceConverter config as an example :\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \t\tINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = Ore\t\t\t//\tDensity(Ore) = 0.01\t\tRatio = 0.02 // t/s\t\t@Ratio *= #$@RESOURCE_DEFINITION[Ore]/volume$\t\t@Ratio /= #$@RESOURCE_DEFINITION[Ore]/density$\t\tFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\n\u003E       \t\t}\tOUTPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = Metal\t\t\t//\tDensity(Metal) = 0.039\t\tRatio = 0.002 // t/s, 10%\t\t@Ratio *= #$@RESOURCE_DEFINITION[Metal]/volume$\t\t@Ratio /= #$@RESOURCE_DEFINITION[Metal]/density$\t\tDumpExcess = false\t\tFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\t}\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E KSP expects the Ratio in InGameUnits / sec. For the conversion to make sense, the ratio must be calculated with masses. Previously I m\uFEFFade the calculations manually but now I just enter a tons / sec value and have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E multiply it by the Resources Volume and divide it by the Density to obtain IGU / sec. This way the mass-extraction-ratio is kept independant from resource-density. 20 kg Ore will always yield 2 kg Metal.\n\u003E \n\nso dropping SC support is upcoming, right? (having in miond SC might just update to use the new EL 6.0 reciepes then, which make a reciepe change obsolete, at least partially)\n\nthe orbital hangar is none of my concerns in my save, but good to know it\u0027s beeing dropped too. I just hope the current WIP parts might change but not that drasticly as introducing them as new parts but for making balance this was necessary, so I understand that aspect.\n\nMostly I use the Launchpads because I love the flavor that they give for EL supplied building, even in orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-17T15:23:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2018 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by LatiMacciato**"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T15:17:39Z","Content":"Since the update takes more and more time I wrote a little bit about the current state. Configs are pretty much done by now, just the models and textures need more work.\n\nThe **Planetary Assembly Management** (aka SurveyStation) has a new model with its own texture and this time with proper IVA(unfinished):\n\nSpoiler\n\n![7SOwndY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7SOwndY.jpg)\n\n![1D2fgEF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1D2fgEF.jpg)\n\n![CVS3Kel.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/CVS3Kel.jpg)\n\nManagement demanded an increased clearance for their high heads and so the part became a bit taller than the old one. The smaller version of PAM is no longer available.  \n\nTo give PAM a real purpose, it will be the only part that can act as SurveyStation. I will add a config to re-enable the SurveStation on the MobileVAB via PM.\n\nEarly state of the new, smaller recylcer **\u0022Krushenator\u0022**:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![tGzgDso.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tGzgDso.jpg)\n\nThe old one is a really bulky but the new one should still be able to eat 5 m parts. So this is the smallest variant I could come up with (3.75 m bottom, 6 m diameter top). The texture leaves me enough space to do a smaller one. It will be one of these two options (opinions are welcome):\n\n1. 2.5 m part that can eat 3.75 m parts\n2. 1.25 m part that can eat 2.5 m parts\n\nThe overhauled **3DPrinter**:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ed5gnI0.png](https://i.imgur.com/ed5gnI0.png)\n\nNot much to say besides the new model. Since the FabricationContainer is also no longer available I might do a 1.25 m variant of it.\n\nV.3.0 of the **CargoTanks** with a total of 14 different resource setups, including multi-resource setups like MetalOre, Metal and RocketParts in one tank:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![pvWdpXN.png](https://i.imgur.com/pvWdpXN.png)\n\nNow you can choose which switcher you want to use (IFS, FS, B9PS), no more auto-detection with priority. I still highly recommend the use of IFS (enabled by default) because it\u0027s build to work with the new modular fuel-setups, thanks to [@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/). The other two have some limitations. As usual the tanks have lights to indicate their content even in the dark of night and also an IVA. Station Tanks are no longer available.\n\nBy default the converter-parts have all **converter-modules** added. Now you can disable the ones you don\u0027t need/want/like:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![VCwkbQZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/VCwkbQZ.png)\n\nWould anyone like to have a MetallicOre --\u003E Metal converter available? Suggestions are welcome.\n\nAs mentioned before the update includes some major changes and it\u0027s unlikely that you can upgrade from older versions ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) To give a little heads-up of the critical aspects, here is a list of removed parts and renamed parts:  \n\nRemoved (no replacement):\n\n- KD-PAMSmall\n- KD-OrbitalHangar\n- KD-FC (FabricationContainer)\n- KD-StationTanks (all)\n\nRenamed or replaced:\n\n- KD-3D-Printer --\u003E KD-3DPrinter (this bothered me for ages)\n- KD-TXXXXFS --\u003E KD-CTXXXXFS\n- KD-OrbitalPad --\u003E KD-Keronica / KD-Launchpad\n- KD-Recycler --\u003E KD-Krushenator\n- KD-SledgeHammer --\u003E KD-KDA\n\nOther parts keep their name but that doesn\u0027t mean they are 100% safe. All models, textures, animations, etc (except KD-Pad and KD-Keronica) are beeing re-made from scratch. For example PAM is not on the list but the attach nodes and collider change.\n\nYou may ask **\u0022why all this effort?\u0022** - Some parts like the Furnace are very old and I\u0027ve learned a ton of new stuff since I made them. New parts will feature:\n\n- All animations made in unity, no imports with hundreds of unused keys.\n- Proper use of specular maps instead of separate materials for glas, foil, etc.\n- Texel-density of 170 pixel per meter for all parts instead of a random texel-density. (I\u0027ve tried to go for 200 but I couldn\u0027t fit stuff on 1024\u00B2 textures anymore.)\n- Reduced tris-count.\n\n**A note to other modders making configs with/for KD:**  \n\nI no longer use module-indices to asure the correct loading order with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E but instead use different :FOR[KDXXX] definitions.
