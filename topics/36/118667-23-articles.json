The advantage to a Cabasa Howitzer (CH for the rest of this post) is that it can direct the energy of a nuclear blast very well. So rather than having your 10 Kt bomb be wasted on irradiating it\u0027s energy every which way in space, you can focus most of that energy on a target, potentially a target far out of the range of a more conventional nuclear bomb. This would allow you to completely bypass most CIWS and AMM systems while still being absolutely devastating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe warheads could, in theory, be used in two distinct roles, shooting enemy ships and bases on the ground, or shooting enemy ships and bases in space. The ground based one would probably be a cruise missile or an artillery gun with guided shells. The bomb would detonate when it reaches a point where the jet of hydrogen plasma will connect with the target, thereby bypassing any short range anti missle systems.
