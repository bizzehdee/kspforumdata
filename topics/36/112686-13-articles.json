Nasa has been experimenting of late with small fission reactors to replace RTGs, but these are test platforms (so look like random plumbing to the untrained eye). There is the 1950s SNAP 10A reactor which was actually flown by the US and a few russian ones, but since these craft were mostly test vehicles, the point of the craft was the reactor, so it\u0027s conical and at the front of the craft.
