I\u0027d like to keep the bulkheads free for use by the Landing Leg/Parachute strap-on kit, so this leaves 2.5 cm thickness of the rim of the taper itself for any flush-mounted RCS ports (as per the inset).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe geometry of the thrusters themselves are not final - I\u0027m juggling the following options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Protrubing cylinders, as they are right now but with textures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Holes drilled directly into the end ring, as in Prime flux\u0027s original CAD concept\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A blister housing added to the end rings, with the recessed thrusters within them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock RCS tanks are only there to visually offset the end rings from any flat-ended FusTek Karmony modules - in reality, the End Ring RCS thrusters will directly consume the modules\u0027 monopropellant reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne observation (0.20\u002B; not sure if 0.21 is also like this) is that when rolling the vessel with the Q or E keys, the RCS thrusters don\u0027t fire, whereas when pitching (W/S) or yawing (A/D), the thrusters do fire. I suspect that it may have something to do with probe/command pod torque, but since I don\u0027t have a working 0.21 setup, there\u0027s no way for me to disable command pod reactions wheels in order to test Q/E rolling with RCS alone.
