Which makes sense given how KSP works. This is not a Unity issue, it\u0027s flat out a KSP and DLL conflict issue - I just don\u0027t know what that issue is.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to finish up for those interested in the oddity of the situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deleted and reinstalled your mods. The station still crashed with the Karbonite Folder in the default location. Since I could access the station running in 32 bit with OpenGL, I did so. No crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI collapsed all inflatables. Turned off all generators. Shut down anything else that was running, scan sat, additional communication antennas, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReloaded the game with the problem 64bit Open GL client. The station was slow to load, but it loaded. So, I guess related to either the inflatables having been inflated or something that was running that I shut down. SO, add that to the weirdness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be done with the headaches, I used Hyperedit to \u0022land\u0022 the station, recovered the crew and cash. I\u0027ll now build a new station with all mods up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station represented the most time and effort, but I\u0027m glad to have salvaged my communications satellite network, contract progress and crew roster. All the satellites load and work with out issue, so I\u0027m going to take the risk that the save itself is safe to build on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station predated the parts changes to MKS. I had edited the persistent to get it working in the aftermath. Maybe that contributed to the weirdness, who knows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably one of your very very 64-bit OpenGL testers, so I\u0027ll let you know if any further weirdness occurs, but only if it isn\u0027t limited to a particular deprecated save game, but can be duplicated in a fresh save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting in OpenGL 64 with a very limited mod set, MKS, Karbonite, their mod dependencies, Scansat, Mechjeb, Hyperedit and one or two more \u0022core\u0022 mods yielded no problems with a station I slapped together with all the parts recommended in the OKS tutorial. I\u0027ll see how things go with my normal mod load out. (I\u0027m running 65 mods total in the recently rebuilt GameData folder, all of them current versions and most specific to 24.2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the problem ended up being path related, I was hoping that might ring a bell with you as to something that changed recently that might play into that. I have no problem, though, just righting it up to some odd game save breaking confluence of mod updates. (The station was very over engineered and there were a lot of different mods represented in the construction of the station, so there was more opportunity for conflict).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for acknowledging my issue and thanks for the great mods. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T23:27:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Fiontar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T23:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mischief\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mischief\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the solutions!\u003Cp\u003EUpdated to scansat 7.0.
