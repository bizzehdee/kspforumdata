In real life, chemical jet ISP is calculated based on the consumption of liquid fuel (Kerosene, Hydrogen, etc.) not based on the total airflow/ exhaust-velocity. That means if a Turbojet has an ISP of 2500, but only 1/10th of its mass-flow is in liquid fuel, its actual Exhaust Velocity corresponds to an ISP of 250 seconds, not 2500 seconds- the reduced fuel flow is due to the use of atmosphere as propellant. However, our Thermal Turbojets rely *ENTIRELY* on the atmosphere for propulsion-mass, which means the rates ISP is what you get for exhaust velocity, and there is no possibility for a mix-up like this. A sea-level Exhaust Velocity of 1278.787 m/s (130.4 seconds ISP) is actually quite *low* for a real-life jet engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2)\u003C/strong\u003E The atmospheric and velocity-curves of the stock jet engines are quite generous compared to real-life engines.
