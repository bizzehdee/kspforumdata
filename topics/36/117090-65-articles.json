And to -force- you to try to implement something you wouldn\u0027t do otherwise, just makes my eyes roll in the back of my head and I obtain the giant facepalm pose. Like you keep telling these people: If they want to apply FAR, make a pull request and go for it. If they want to do all the work to develop this for that mod, they can go for it. I wouldn\u0027t capitulate an inch to make this work with FAR if that\u0027s not where you want to go. No one is twisting their arm to use this mod and you are certainly not going to allow someone to twist your arm to add something you could do without. \n\nI probably will get a lot of flack out there from the FAR users, but that\u0027s the way you want to play your game, so be it. There are a ton of mods out there that use FAR that I won\u0027t go near and wouldn\u0027t even approach the developers of those mods to \u0022change\u0022 it back to stock so I can play, too. You can\u0027t get everything you want in KSP. If you want to make something like this, you get blender, unity and an image editor and go to town and make it FAR compatible to your hearts content.\n\n ![giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/KL7I5MXrcvezC/giphy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T21:40:33Z","Content":"1.)

Well, technically, the segments don\u0027t -have- to have segmenting lines/geometry, so you could still get a smooth body; and with pre-compiled models, technically it doesn\u0027t even need to be segmented (as long as the whole thing would fit on the texture at least).  And as stated, there is nothing enforcing a set segment size; so you might have a 10m tall booster with 4x 2.5m segments, or an 8m tall booster with 4x 2m segments, or a 7.5m booster with 3x 2.5m segments.  (And as segments scale with model diameter, smaller diameters will have smaller height increments; same functionality as the MFTs).\n\nWill I include a set of smooth models with the initial offering?  ... Maybe, if I have time to do the modeling.  But there would be nothing preventing them from being added to the part in the future, or even setup as a separate part.\n\n2.) Yep, exactly.  My one problem will be figuring out how to get MJ/KER to properly calculate DV with these connected -- they have severe issues with any part that has both engines and decoupler (even if decoupler staging is disabled).\n\n3.) In theory, yes, as long as you ran the fuel lines properly (and enabled the auto-staging for the LRBs), the rest would take care of itself.  The only caveat would be #2 (dV calc).\n\n5.) Aye, if you wouldn\u0027t mind locating some images, that will at least save me some time from searching (and save me from guessing at the model geometry as I did with the existing nosecones).\n\nModular Launch Tower - no, not really.  I don\u0027t even use the stock launch-clamps aside from holding down engines during on-pad testing."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T22:20:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 42 minutes ago, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can see the usages of the radial decoupler (I.E.
