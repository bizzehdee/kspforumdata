Be gentle because this is my first KSP mod, first 3D model, first Youtube video and first C# program. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Charge Meter mod gives you a visual indicator of how much electrical charge remains in your vessel. An indicator light shows Green when the remaining electrical charge is \u0026gt; 50%, yellow until it gets down to 10% remaining and then flashing red until the power is drained. The percentages can be changed in the part.cfg file. The meter is designed so you can view the indicator lights from both sides. Hopefully it won\u0027t be too resource intensive because it uses a single sphere that is moved and recolored for the \u0022light\u0022 instead of an actual light source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t publish it until I receive permission from BigNose because it uses code snippets from his Aviation Lights mod but here is a sample video for comments and suggestions.
