Should give it a clean silver look with not-so-sharp ambient reflections.  Higher specular levels will actually give a darker looking metal, but give sharper reflections.  Very low specular levels on metallics will also make it appear darker.. and give no reflections.\n\n(tip:  there should very seldom be anything but 0 or 255 for metal values, it is more of a black/white input than a grayscale;  nothing in the real-world is \u0027semi-metallic\u0027.. it is either a metal, or not.... but do with it what you will...)\n\nFor the color presets, I intend on including a patch with SSTU-PBR that increases the brightness on the silver and steel metallics.  The other metallics were already specified with PBR in mind.  I didn\u0027t want to adjust the existing colors as it would make things seem a bit off with the non-pbr-recoloring shaders (as the silver ends up looking like really shiny white).\n\nTechnical:\n\nMetals will almost always look darker than a non-metal surface if given the same base input color. The metal slider controls how the light is simulated to interact with the surface... through some methods that I haven\u0027t fully wrapped my head around, but the results of it can be more or less summed up:\n\n- When set to not-metal, the brightness of a reflection depends mostly on the specular/smoothness/gloss.  Reflections are of the color of the light source (generally white).\n- When set to non-metal, the albedo brightness depends mostly on color of the object and lighting level.\n- When set to metal, the brightness of a reflection depends upon both the color of the diffuse texture, and on the smoothness.  Reflections are the color of the light source \\* the color of the diffuse texture.  *This is where you get colored reflections, e.g. solar panels.*\n- When set to metal the albedo brightness depends upon the color of the object, smoothness/specular, and light level."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T05:18:23Z","Content":"I will play with those combinations some more.\n\nNow all that remains is those engine parts on the PDC and my dream of an all-gold Saturn V has been realised ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\n![pbr_03.jpg](http://jimbodiah.com/ksp/sstu/pbr_03.jpg)\n\nThis feeling is better than christmas morning...

One is a simple scaling. You scale a leg like this until it lands about right on the tank model.\n\nAnother idea might be to have the final leg part (the pad and the main shaft) be a certain size, and have the upper part change in some fashion like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E stand offs. So you have a flush mount leg (most of the ones we see in game, including stock and foundries) as default, but a slider allows one with crossbars, or some other additions that make it take up more room laterally, or vertically, so it looks like it\u0027s attached to something. Another might add a \u0022blade\u0022 of material, but the node is such that it intentionally buries.

Just like they should have been the whole time.  (I bet if you slapped a real giant metallic rocket out in full sunlight... it would cast a crazy glare as well.)\n\nIt helps if you keep the values used for the colors within plausible ranges; nothing in real life is fully smooth, or fully rough; the specular slider should generally be between 20 and 225 depending on just how smooth the surface is supposed to be, with a few very special mirror-like surfaces having even higher smoothness.  I would bet most common \u0027shiny\u0027 metals are in the 150-200 range.
