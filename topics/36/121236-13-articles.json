I was quite surprised I could _read_ the new forums, let alone post.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am not so sure I believe in regenerative braking. Joules at least fall out of the sky onto our solar panels; the extra mass needed for regenerative braking equipment has to arrive on rockets. Mind you, many of the KF parts don\u0027t exactly look like they were designed with gram-shaving in mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA part specified as \u0022max torque | max power\u0022 wouldn\u0027t have the same problem with feeble reverse torque at high speed. At present some of the parts do because the floatcurve has dropped torque to near zero; but a part specified as I suggest would always deliver full power at high speeds. (The torque would drop off proportionately to speed but never wither away to nothing.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the issue of maximum speeds, I think partly that small wheels _should_ have low speeds. Railway wheels can be small because they travel on perfectly smooth surfaces, and even motor car wheels travel on relatively smooth ones. Off-road vehicles tend to have large wheels for a reason (and likewise the ISO 622 mountain bike wheel has largely supplanted the ISO 559 wheel simply because with a larger wheel less needs to be done with suspension).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat so, \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it almost worked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said, it\u0027s basically down to gearing. Electric vehicles don\u0027t have conventional gearboxes because they naturally have good performance over a wide range of speeds (rather like a steam locomotive where at higher speeds there are more valve events \u0026amp; the exhaust is a draught on the fire so more steam is generated when more steam is being used.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart of the gearing is \u0022baked in\u0022 by the wheel size. If I take an electric motor and double the size of the wheel it is attached to, it produces half as much shove at ground level (so half as much acceleration) but can go twice as fast (ground speed) before hitting that rev limit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the rev limits of electric motors are very high (eg on a Tesla the motor goes up to 16000 rpm) and there\u0027s usually a fixed gearing stage to reduce the revs and increase the torque. That might be configurable in the VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point of this rambling story is that - with sensible defaults and maxima - the user should be able to adjust torque and rev limit in the VAB in a way that (torque * rev limit) would remain constant. Across the range of parts, (torque * rev limit) would probably be proportional to mass of the part. The maximum value for rev limit would be about the same for all parts (maybe higher for parts whose text says they are \u0022fast\u0022 like the long tracks, probably higher in general for wheels); you can make the small parts go reasonably quickly, but not as fast as the big parts, and by doing so you put up with lower torque. (A half-track could then be powered by large tracks and steered by small wheels without the small wheels spending all their time revved out).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechJeb implements a feature where, with Stability Control, the brakes are disabled if less than configurable% of the wheels are on the ground. This largely eliminates nose-wheelies (although beware; if you have just driven a long rover halfway over a cliff it may catch you out). Likewise, although I think this is a thing to do in MechJeb not KF, it would be possible to disable drive torque if a configurable proportion of the wheels aren\u0027t on the ground, which would reduce the tendency to do wheelies when starting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I also think Stability Control\u0027s main feature of keeping the rover body level to the ground could use a configurable option to only do that when the wheels aren\u0027t _on_ the ground - on high-g worlds Stability Control otherwise burns a lot of EC for no reason).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kenobi McCormick","CreatedById":57254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T16:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou wouldn\u0027t need any special equipment in the tracks, though, to at least take advantage of the effect to brake. All you need is a speed controller that shunts the motor contacts from the EC source to resistor networks and you get the braking side. You waste the energy, admittedly, but still stop no prob getting the braking effect I\u0027m calling for. There\u0027s more than enough room in the long tracks, at least, to hide said resistor networks. Could also be done with a seperate part, I s\u0027pose. Have the plugin scan the craft for the resistor network part on unpack, if detected, enable the electric braking. If not detected, no electric braking. Or, we could have resistive networks the default state and have a seperate part that, if detected, would dump power back into the batteries first rather than just waste it as heat?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be nice to, rather than waste it, dump the EC back into the batteries.

If by a misfortune it\u0027s on an airless body with earthlike gravity (I\u0027m looking at you, Tylo) air resistance won\u0027t help, so all of that (whether consumed by rolling resistance or intentional braking) will become heat.
