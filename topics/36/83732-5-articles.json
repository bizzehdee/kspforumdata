The volume of the pods works out to be about 220 litres. But that\u0027s based on external dimensions and we\u0027re shoving a kerbal in there which will displace some fluid. Let\u0027s make the math easy and say you need 100 units of glykerol to put a kerbal into suspended animation. That works out to 1.2 tons of resource per freeze. The big chamber planned for the mod has 10 cryopods (which double as glykerol storage) so we can reasonably assume that it can hold 1000 units. With the weight of the chamber itself (at the moment, same as the science lab), a fully loaded cryochamber is 15.5 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m months late, but what planet do you live on where 100 liters of glycerin is 1.2 tons?

TL;DR: I\u0027m still behind the idea that resources are only used on freezing/thawing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite like the way the the current system changes your mission planning process. I don\u0027t think it completely negates having and LS mod install, but it does change how you plan you missions. It replaces the total mission time to resource calculation of the life support system. With DeepFreeze you\u0027re planning you mission around total working time for your crew, how long they\u0027ll be active, and the total number of freeze/thaw cycles you\u0027ll need to complete. Take for example my most recent trip to Jool: before, I had to calculate out both my launch window and my return window, and the travel time back to Kerbin, and use that total trip time to figure out how much food/water to bring along (I think it was a few Kerbin years), but with cryonics available, I knew that my crew would only need a few weeks of working time at the most because all of my long time could be spent in stasis. It was a much easier calculation for me to handle, since neither my travel time nor wait to my return window mattered for how many tanks of food/water/oxygen I brought along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll freely admit that DF scales back the difficulty imposed by life support; that\u0027s my goal. Life support \u002B DeepFreeze provides a sort of compromise in difficulty, where you trade off a little bit of extra complexity in your craft and trip in order to let you have slightly easier time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I won\u0027t be adding a constant resource requirement (EC or other), but my code is open source and my license is permissive.

The thawing process does require some source of command (so either unfrozen crew or a probe core). As long as you have a probe core, you should be able to freeze/thaw even the one crew member of the ship. That being said, if I can think of a way to have even the last crew member with no probe core freeze themselves, I\u0027d be tempted to add that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I\u0027d be interested to hear feedback on my proposal for an external glykerol tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fQrfcJO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fQrfcJO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly uses a stock KSP texture to minimize RAM usage, but that center band could be used to distinguish the contents (so it\u0027d be easy as pie to bang out versions for any other resources).
