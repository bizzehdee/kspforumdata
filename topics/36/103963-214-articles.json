What you are showing in that screenshot is the light correctly scattering near the horizon on a planet with an atmosphere. Your vessel is far enough behind the planet that you indeed would see the sliver of light on the right side of the planet. Being directly behind the planet that has an atmosphere would have this effect as well. Position your vessel to be more lined up with the terminator and you will not have that sliver of light any longer.\n\nHere is a picture of Titan taken by the Cassini Orbiter.   \n[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA17180](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA17180)\n\nand another  \n[http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14613](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14613)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-11T02:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2016 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"darkracer125","CreatedById":159295,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T08:32:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On \u200E10\u200E-\u200E11\u200E-\u200E2016 at 4:01 AM, Lmoy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Regardless of which angle I view a planet from, the atmosphere is always illuminated on the horizon.

IMHO, the soft sky/orbit shaders are much better and manages the colors in a much more natural way than this old blending mode.
