That means for reasonable loads they will be very solid but for larger loads, particularly unbalanced ones, you\u0027re going to need to think just a little more.

They are set high enough that you should be doing something quite unreasonable before this happens, and will probably break something else first.

At my Gilly base gravity is so low I use RCS to fly them into place Starcraft 2 style. On planets with more gravity you could use a large rover, or rockets, or winch it there with KAS or... be creative!

Look in \u003Cem\u003EGameData/Foundations/Parts/Foundations.cfg\u003C/em\u003E to see how the parts are put together, all that makes it a foundation part is the MODULE block at the end.
