Never mind, I figured out what I was doing wrong - I have the instrument clusters grouped so I can move/scale them together and such. I was trying to paste the component data to the new control *before* putting it into the group. Once I put it into the group then paste the component data everything lines up as it should.\n\nLooks like the Fuel Flow and Electric Generator gauges are not working either. I think it may be due to me using Kerbalism, which really messes with EC, and Advanced Jet Engine, which also uses its own modules. Will this just require some config tweaking?\n\n~~I\u0027m also able to adjust the frequencies for the Nav/Com radios but not swap or light them up~~ Ah, so I had the instruments too far over to the left and they were beneath the transform you click on to look out the window\n\nLast question for the night!
