I probably should do a proper diff-style comparison, but it suggests that if I really want to use an engine from an older mod, I can just go for it. Though I shouldn\u0027t really complain if something goes wrong. If a Mod doesn\u0027t need a plugin to work. what traps are there besides wheels and landing legs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd some of the standard plugins, such as KER and Interstellar Fuel Switch, have got their v1.1 upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did some checking on command pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe K2 pod, one of those Gemini-style two-seaters, doesn\u0027t have any significant changes from the stock Mk1 in the modules it uses and the relevant variables. It\u0027s different, because there are differences between the two mods, and I am not sure if the K2 got a full v1.05 update, but it looks as though it would work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some things I am waiting for. If you\u0027re using extended life support\u00A0mods. there are plugins involved, even for something as simple as Snacks, and that maybe explains some of what has and hasn\u0027t appeared yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am going to give one or two things a try, because, for one thing, I like the look they have. but I don\u0027t quite expect the full Monty from them. But the comparisons I have made are reassuring. I\u0027ve never compiled a plug-in, and I don\u0027t want to diminish the problems in that, but I am feels a lot less worried about when some stuff might appear for v1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
