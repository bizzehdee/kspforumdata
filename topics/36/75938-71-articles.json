We do need landing gear that doubles as repulsors! Would certainly help with the effort of getting MK3 stuff off of the ground when loaded. My current effort is trying to deliver a pair of Rockomax Jumbo 64 tanks, plus their landing gear, to Kerbin\u0027s North Pole. I\u0027ve got a research base up there and, well, given all the driving around we\u0027ve had to do, some of our machinery is threatening to run out of gas.

I\u0027d say both a track that that can retract vertically into a compartment like a landing gear unit would, and perhaps one which would retract sideways, or better yet extend slightly, rotate sideways, and then vertically retract. Better yet if they had a half-way animation point where the \u0022wheels\u0022 inside the track deployed repulsor disks. that would be some ultimate stuff there.

IR parts aren\u0027t very steady though, and have some weird wobbly issues. Never did try them for parts with more complicated suspensions though. We\u0027d need an easy way to, with one action, lower the suspensions to their retracted level and then lock them into place so that they don\u0027t try to respond to their own change in height as they are retracted. Otherwise it\u0027ll be like trying to lift a ball and chain straight by twisting the end of the chain. Gravity doesn\u0027t like it when you try to cheat it.

Your problem, however, feels like the collision area is too low and too large for the wheel, causing it to clip with the ground before the suspension collision area can react. I\u0027m no expert in any of that though, so it\u0027s all speculation at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose large wheels are rather hard to keep stable though.
