The current location of the hatch is unfavorable compared to its previous location and it\u0027s ok to say that.\n\nFair enough, it\u0027s a small issue, though, IMO.\n\nIMO, the unfavorable location is not really different than a hatch that is substantially too small for a kerbal to enter though.\n\nAlso, What about the rescue issue? Is there a way to force the game to not use a specific \u0022capsule\u0022 for any rescue missions? Because it seems to borrow any that have crew. I was more concerned with a frustrating gameplay issue than aesthetics. Though the roof certainly is also an aesthetic problem, I agree.\n\nPerhaps a redesigned hatch? A hatch could be added to the lateral part of the deployed hab/greenhouse/lab, but the IVA would likely have to reflect an airlock...\n\nOK, here is the current situation on all the deployable units, the hatch before was a even smaller as it fit in the space the kerbal is facing, slightly above the side red band on the helmet I think, maybe halfway between that red, and the top stripe:\n\n![height.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/height.jpg)\n\nHere is the only alternative for a hatch that almost fits our kerbals:\n\n![possible%20hatch.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/possible%20hatch.jpg)\n\nYou\u0027d have a not terribly secure hatch (it has an angle, and is large), and even with the area inside the orange as the hatch, the kerbal would have to be assumed to duck as he enters, then sit, close the hatch, and remove the suit.\n\nThe hab could assume that one of the staterooms has a bunk bed to buy the space, else it\u0027s the public space. The greenhouse would need to lose one window, not a real problem, and the lab has plenty of room.\n\nI\u0027ve always been surprised that Squad did;t just make the kerbals ever so slightly smaller, this is an issue with most all the hatches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T05:24:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zypheril","CreatedById":148850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T04:52:17Z","Content":"Looks promising! \n\nDefinitely trying it out."},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:05:28Z","Content":"So, i had a long look at the KIS issue and think i have found a solution.\n\nAs said i set the default capacity for the deployable parts to the deployed capacity, which solved the KIS issue.\n\nThe last issues for the Parts without IVA will be solved once they are done ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nTo address the fact, that Kerbals can be placed in the part in the VAB now is also solved.
