A common area of concern is the fact that we have infinite resources, with your only variance being efficiency. Efficiency was annoying without rails, and becomes irrelevant with rails (other than extreme cases).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could argue this could be a concern for manned bases (life support limitations), but as of now, I could just drop a probe core and a drill, add a REALLY big tank, and just let it ride on the rails till my Duna team gets there a year or two later, all with zero penalty for hitting more or less efficient hotspots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods have solved this through resource scarcity and a lack of on-rails support. I would like to propose a different approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtractors will wear out over time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this is a function of how many running hours the equipment has been online and processing. It will result in a static decrease in reliability and output, eventually dragging down to zero (and a \u0027Broken!\u0027 status). This can be repaired through Kerbal EVA operations. So now you have an inconvenient choice. You can still run stuff on rails (until such time as it wears out and falls over), but you have to consider yield and cost (i.e. if your gear is only going to last 2-3 years, you may want to drop it on a hotspot with significantly better gains). Alternatively, you can land on a crappy spot and increase yield if you\u0027re willing to constantly EVA and keep the equipment operating at top efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, efficiency comes at a cost and requires ReplacementParts. These are not cheap, and have to be hauled in (or manufactured if you have MKS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe net result should be gentle encouragement to consider efficiency, but still allow players to throw efficiency and cost to the wind and just go mine stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically a nice idea.

Not sure if that is something that should be applied in this case or left as is.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad did the same in whatever update introduced the RAPIER engine. Although the throttle indicator beside the navball doesn\u0027t move, under the hood jet engines throttles down as IntajeAir decreases, thus showing thrust decreasing over time if you have the right-click menu open. This is why since that update SSTOs have been much easier to do, as the player no longer has to throttle back manually and the computer\u0027s control of the throttle is more precise and fine-tuned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that despite this fundamentally Squad thing presumably still going on in the background, the Kerbonite jets act like old-school (pre-0.23?) SSTOs. That is, by carefully throttling back manually as you see the ScoopedAir bar start to decrease, you can work them up to over 40km doing and about 2000m/s. I have no problem with this because this nostalgic bit of SSTO-pilot9ing skilz keeps me from feeling the Karbonite jets are OP due to their sky-splitting thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all this is really beside the point I was trying to make. No matter if the engines throttle back by themselves or not, symmetrical flameout (assuming the thing is going prograde with respect to the yaw axis) is totally dependent on the order of intake and engine parts in the craft file. To the extent that combined intake/engine parts don\u0027t follow the game engine\u0027s approved part order for symmetrical flameout, they will always cause asymmetrical flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-17T00:26:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2014 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T00:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI see what you mean, the main purpose of the intake is to make the engines useble with FAR/NEAR; I didn\u0027t anticiplate it would lead to the issue you are experiencing, thanks for making me aware of it.
