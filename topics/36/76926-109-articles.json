Avoiding internal ordinance explosions is always good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBD, would it be possible to set it up so you can select how many weapons will fire when the fire key is pressed? For example; with cannons and lasers they will all shoot at the same time, but other ordinance will only shoot once for every fire command. Being able to change that setting as needed would be very helpful. You could fire broadsides of either missiles or cannons in series or as a volley. This would functionally extend the magazine capacities and increase the rate of fire for things like howitzers and Abrams turrets, as well as make massed missile attacks or bombing runs less carpal tunnel inducing. It could also pull double duty as a ripple manager for dropping bombs; if they\u0027ll only drop when they have clearance to do so, putting in a volley amount will drop them as fast as clearance will allow with the push of a single button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UI for a function like that could be included as a line in the weapons manager with a click box for \u0027series\u0027 and \u0027volley\u0027 with a blank dialogue box that the user can enter the number of guns or missiles that will fire at once.

Just run your favorite text editor (I recommend Notepad\u002B\u002B ) and open the .cfg file of the part you want to make explosive. Then paste the code BEFORE the last squiggly bracket. Save and your edited part should go boom and do some damage. If you want both the unexplosive and explosive variants of your part, just copy said .cfg file and paste it in the same directory where the .cfg file of the part you\u0027re editing is stored, and then open your copy of the .cfg file and paste the code BEFORE the last squiggly bracket (This is VERY important).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T15:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI watched DasValdez play with this mod the other day and holy moly it looked fun!
