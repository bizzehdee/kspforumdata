I thought it\u0027d be pretty straight forward with the SSTUSelectableNodes module, I tried adding a top node and even followed the exact convention in the (experimental) MFT Service Module part, which has selectable top and bottom nodes (I noticed the MUS tank is a bit different, and the selectable nodes are referenced in the MUS module). The new selectable interstage node would occur in the middle of the tank instead of at node\\_stack\\_noseInterstage = 0,1,0,0,1,0,2. I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s more to the SSTUSelectableNodes module than meets the eye.\n\n\\*edit\\* a selectable top node would really come in handy when using the hemi-spherical end caps too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-02T01:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2018 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by DocRockwell**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T02:22:34Z","Content":"[@DocRockwell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174979-docrockwell/) very nice, that design has been a favorite of mine for awhile.

It takes some tinkering to build, the HAB and detachable supply module have to be assembled backwards, then rotated and translated, and the docking port for the reloadable fuel truss had to be mounted to the truss instead of the propulsion module.
