I know the feeling.  Is why I mostly do modding at the moment;  I can\u0027t even play my career games due to poor performance (part count/physics) and crashes (OPM/Kopernicus related issues).\n\nDocking -- I have noticed a null-ref from the SSTU docking ports in the editor (have not tested stock ports to see if they do it); but it is related to the editor-tests rather than the actual function of the docking port, so I\u0027m not sure if it actually has any effect while in-flight.  Sadly my available time to test things in-game is... not quite adequate to actually test everything.  However, if you can come up with a simple (sstu\u002Bstock parts) craft that duplicates the problem reliably, I will gladly investigate... just gotta have a place to start the investigation from.\n\nHowever, also, the stock code for running docking ports is... well... less than optimized, as some of the tests by riocrokite showed (massive performance drops just having ports -on- a ship.. whether they were docked/undocked/whatever did not matter).\n\nStrange though that just having kerbals present would decrease the FPS so noticeably (unless it is related to the IVA pictures; have heard of issues with those before regarding frame-rate).  As you saw earlier in the week though, my computer is not the best test-case for many of the performance related problems; I probably wouldn\u0027t notice them much unless it was a -massive- problem.  Hmm... perhaps I should setup KSP on my media computer for a lower-performance-testing setup? (i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz, 4g (might be 8? don\u0027t remember.. it just plays movies/tv shows) ddr3, gtx460x2 (sli; disabled...))\n\nKraken - I\u0027ve certainly seen my share of exploding stations after docking (or undocking, or merely coming within physics loading range, or a myriad of other causes).  Generally for me though restarting the game will solve it for a short time, until I jump between ships too many times.  And of course, it always seems to manifest much worse the further you get in your game.  I\u0027ve rarely been able to do outside-of-Kerbin-SOI missions because usually by the time I get there (progression wise) the game is so unstable (and performs so terribly with the interplanetary craft) its mostly just aggravating to play.\n\nI certainly hope that the move to PhysX 3.x improves some of the stability of the underlying simulation.  Sadly, we won\u0027t know until 1.1 is released.. as Squad is being extremely quiet on the subject."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T23:18:16Z","Content":"I have the same thing along the progression of a carreer. The further I get, the worse it is. In the beginning it is rock-solid, huge stations, 5 ships docked, ATV in the back... little lag. Then by the time I have all science from mun/minmus and am prepping to go to Duna, I get Krakens on even small stations with 2-3 ships docked on it, up to the point that even one is touch-and-go. It;s freaking rediculous.\n\nI run a 4790K @ 4GHz, 16GB ram, only blazing fast SSDs (windows 7 boots so fast the windows icon does not even have time to complete). My GPU is a GTX 650 Ti Boost, not a GTX970, ut not too shabby either. Runs 3D shooters with no effort. My PC is not the problem, KSP is.\n\nSo I now have two career saves that are maxed in science and have a fleet of ships underway to Duna and preps for Eve, and I am about to just delete them all as they are basically frustrating to play. And sandbox has it\u0027s usefulness, but without anything to do, it\u0027s gets boring fast. Running rescues, tourists and satelities at least gave me something to do in the meantime, and it;s not like it\u0027s hard to get all the science or money you need to play like it is a sandbox.\n\nAnd without mods, the ships just look ridiculous and god-awful. Not to mention part counts that are ludicrous because the entire game is made to be played using 0.625 and 1.25m parts it seems. Blegh... I just gave up on my latest career as of today. Sent my Kerbals out to see if they could land on the Mun/Minmus just with eva. Minmus is actually quite easy to reach escape velocity from, or just EVA and land on it.

Put in the small ones first, no clusters until later, add the J2/H1 early on somewhere, F1B a step later, F1B later, RS25 still later, RS68 near the end.

The contrast should not be too big. I don;t see the techtree as a time-line, rather as a career progression (getting more science as you go from Mun to Minmus, by that time you will have 3/4 of the tree cleared if you gather all the science. I basically clear most of the tech I need by doing two runs to the Mun and two to minmus, progressing the rocket I use each time. First one is a godawful KSP contraption, the second already starts to use some other mod parts, third is a full fledged SSTU with nukes/NFprop."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T19:28:39Z","Content":"CTT adds some additional nodes beyond Very Heavy Rocketry: Experimental, Gigantic, and Colossal Rocketry (I think Experimental Rocketry used to be a stock node).

You\u0027re still somewhat limited to the stock \u0022bigger = more advanced\u0022 paradigm.\n\u003E \n\nI think that is probably a large part of the problem; the stock tech tree is indeed balanced towards bigger=better; which is patently not the case.  Not to mention the whole \u0027starting manned\u0027 problem (really, the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the tech-tree should be building up to figuring out -how- to get kerbals safely into space and back down).  Trying to view it as a timeline is probably also part of my problem.... its all backwards/mixed up, and stops in the late 60\u0027s....  \n\nEngines -- seem to be the most difficult parts to balance, due to the stock setup, with perhaps tanks or pods/service modules coming in as a close second.\n\nAs an example from the GitHub conversation, the Merlin-1D is superior to the F1 in nearly every stat that matters (ISP, TWR), but is most definitely a smaller engine, and should be placed later in the tech tree due to the... well, technology needed to create it.  The problem there is that stock would place the F1 at the end of the tech tree (being the biggest engine, and the tanks for it not being unlocked until then), leaving no room for advancement/upgrading to the Merlin.\n\nEven using CTT and its extra \u0027more advanced\u0027 nodes wouldn\u0027t really solve the problem (and would probably just make it worse), as the player would still need to do most of Mun/Minmus (and unlock 3/4 of the tree) before they could unlock the tech that is -supposed- to take them there in the first place (e.g. Apollo-era stuff, specifically the tanks/engines).  Nor would placing the Merlin into \u0027Gigantic Rocketry\u0027 make much sense.\n\nI suppose I need to decide if I\u0027m going to go for \u0027timeline\u0027 type progression, or stock \u0027bigger=better\u0027 type progression.  A timeline-type progression would place stuff like the F1 squarely in the lower-half of the tech-tree, somewhere close to stock 2.5m unlocks (along with RL10, J-2, H-1...), with the RS-25 somewhere near the 1/2 to 2/3 mark, and the RS-68, F1B, and merlins at the end of the tree.  Stock progression would see nearly the opposite positioning for most of the engines. \n\nI also think it would be cool to have some \u0027upgraded\u0027 parts near the end of the tree, such as the Merlin engines and J-2X, so that your space program can become more-efficient as time goes on (rather than just using larger rockets); where these would be positioned in a node that the player has to work on a bit to unlock (1000\u002B science nodes).  So they already have stuff that \u0027works\u0027, but can optionally work towards tangibly \u0027better\u0027 stuff if they want.\n\nAnd I suppose another part of the problem that I\u0027m facing is my....assumption?... need?... want?... for players to have access to realistic-progression-technology for their operations; e.g. Apollo-era gear for exploring the Mun.  I\u0027m just not sure how to reconcile that versus the stock tech-tree setup while maintaining compatibility with other mods.\n\nLoL... I should probably just stop now before I give myself a headache.  I\u0027m in no rush to get things slotted on the tech tree (my goal is sometime -after- 1.1 is released), so have a bit of time to weigh options, try out various balances, etc.  I\u0027m sure that we (collectively) can figure out something acceptable, as it sounds like we are all on generally the same train of thought regarding progression."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T01:31:15Z","Content":"Yeah, [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/). You really don\u0027t need to rush this, because it is a big step towards a release. The thing with CTT and having your own mod is that you can choose where ever you want to put your parts at to be unlocked. It makes sense to think about your engines and think of the technology timeline to base it off of. There are other technology nodes to unlock that may be used, creatively, to unlock more parts/sizes. Even looking down the road towards interstellar space travel, you\u0027ll have to broaden your scope on what kind of technology you\u0027d want to work on to make this happen. Even having to consider logistics is a nightmare.

I put in 0.5t, where it should have been 1.6t.  The resultant change should give them the same mass fraction as the rest of the tanks (15% of fuel mass) regarding their dry mass minus the engine mass.  Will be available with the next update."}]}
