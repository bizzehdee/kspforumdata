Would custom part scripts still operate after disconnection if the \u0027operates after disconnection\u0027 flag is active?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Will scripts be able to tell KSP \u0027Don\\\u0027t unload me, I\\\u0027m not done yet!\u0027?

Retro-thrust module: Can liquid engines now fire in reverse? Are solid engines the only ones that can be made into retros?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. SAS (the moment wheel kind) does not appear to function, even with ActivatesEvenIfDisconnected = True. Or am I on crack? Do some experiments!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Same with ASAS and RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do we need SAS? If the rocket part we want to recover is tumbling, there is a small chance that when we fire the de-orbit stage it will be pointing pro-grade, boosting it to a higher orbit, instead of to a lower one! Therefore, we need to force the part to an orientation suitable for the retros.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-25T20:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*grabs popcorn and takes a seat*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-25T21:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0: They should, since the script has access to all part parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a: Doubtful, things that are far away have to be on rails, because they farther from the scene origin a part is, the more imprecise actions are, so you wouldn\\\u0027t want a remote part running calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b: They have the same thrustvector parameter (which allows you to change the direction of thrust), and even if they didn\\\u0027t, a custom engine module could be created to allow it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: You are correct\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Still correct - probably something can be done with custom parts, we\\\u0027ll have to see how things work a bit more to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe: SAS, even it really isn\\\u0027t up to the task of an extended deorbit burn, since it maintains an ABSOLUTE heading and not one relative to an orbit (it won\\\u0027t turn you to maintain alignment with your TVV marker) we\\\u0027ll need a true autopilot module for that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samonite","CreatedById":2123,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-28T17:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be quite easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
