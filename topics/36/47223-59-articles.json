Reason: Dawn uses ModuleEnginesFX by default now, patch is still trying to target and convert ModuleEngines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Dawn now has a stock exhaust effect. Replacing it with Near Future\u0027s still works, but is it necessary? Your call.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- VASIMRs in xenon mode have wrong Ec/s numbers. Filing this under \u0022as expected\u0022, considering the density is different from hydrogen, which means the Ec propellant ratio is now off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Lithium tanks fragile? Yep. Flew an aggressive ascent, tank was by far the first part to go. Flew a normal ascent, tank survived. Means you can get them into space fine, but aerobraking or reentry with these will probably be very difficult.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If lithium is supposed to be the extremely cheap fuel with extremely expensive tanks, it might make more sense to have a different fuel with the fragile tankage, since this setup encourages making efforts to refuel an existing spacecraft with a reusable vehicle that must reenter safely to be recovered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- MPDTs work fine with lithium as far as I can see.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Mass ratios: A penalty of ~0.03 for argon tanks will not do anything noticable. For reference, the performance difference between 1.4:1 and 2.0:1 ends up being about 4%... you can imagine how big the difference between 1.25:1 and 1.28:1 will be \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Even if you only want a very small penalty, this one is so small as to be negligible. Also, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m a fan of the concept of penalizing argon tank mass ratio to make up for the fuel\u0027s cost; I\u0027d rather adjust the engines (or rather, buff the xenon ones a bit). With the KSPedia to inform the player, IMHO that will be the more intuitive option for handling things. Players will look at it like xenon is the higher priced performance fuel at the gas station that makes your car run better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Mass ratios part 2: For the same reason as given above, lithium tanks won\u0027t feel markedly different unless the difference in mass ratio is larger.

As billkerbinsky noted, it would apply to thermal engines, but the VASIMR is not a thermal engine. It\u0027s an electric engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectric engines work (broadly speaking) by expending large amounts of electric power into their propellant, giving the atoms a charge and turning them into ions. These ions are susceptible to electromagnetic forces, and thus, the engine can produce such a field to push against the ionized propellant, shooting it away from itself to generate thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why use xenon, of all things - an absurdly expensive element? This is not by mistake, or because someone trolled their fellow engineering colleagues. No, xenon is simply the ideal electric engine propellant. It has a huge amount of electron shells, making it very easy to ionize - the xenon atom more or less doesn\u0027t resist this process, in contrast to smaller atoms which hold their electrons much more tightly. That means the engine has to put hardly any energy into the ionizing phase, and can put nearly all of it into the electromagnetic pushing phase. A propellant like argon is way cheaper, but you have to fight the argon atom to put it into the same ionized state. Thus you have to expend more energy on that process, and have less left for pushing; your engine performance suffers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, xenon is used widely, while other propellants see only niche use. In a spacecraft, the propellant cost is usually negligible, even at the price point of xenon - especially if you need only a few dozen kilograms of it, since xenon generates such high specific impulses for the amount of energy invested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s only with engines like the VASIMR, which is expected to run at up to a hundred times the input power of contemporary electric engines and to be refueled multiple times over its lifetime, that it actually makes sense to pay attention to the price of the propellant. That\u0027s why the IRL VASIMR runs on argon. It could, however, run on other propellants just as well, including xenon. And the engine performance will depend on how well each propellant is suited to electric engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I\u0027ll note here that I\u0027m by no means an electric propulsion engineer, and so I can only give a layman\u0027s explanation which may not be 100% technically correct. But xenon is indeed preferred in many engine types for its near-ideal propellant behavior - you can look this up all over the place, and I invite you to do so because it\u0027s a really interesting topic.

Since the M-EXP called for 150-200 kW of radiator power in the VAB, I packed four small thermal control systems (50 kW core transfer each).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means you should immediately notice something odd, which is the very thing that is confusing me. Currently, I only have one radiator extended. And yet, the M-EXP is perfectly stable at 650K/650K, 100% core health, and generating its full 50 Ec/s. This is not a moment snapshot, this is steady state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done some experimentation, reset a few times, and ultimately came to the following conclusions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- RadUsage and RadCoolAmt show the amount of core transfer available. Not sure of the difference between the two, but they always show identical numbers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- RadCoolTot appears to scale directly with the reactor control slider. In the screenshot, at 33%, it is at 47.7, which is less than 50, thus the reactor remains stable. If I would turn it any higher, RadCoolTot would exceed 50 and thus the reactor would start gaining core temperature. Interestingly, RadCoolTot never shows more than RadCoolAmt shows, which probably means that this number describes the total amount of core heat being transferred out of the part at any given time (which obviously cannot exceed the amount of transfer available). Though if no heat is transferred at all, this value doesn\u0027t become 0, but rather equal to RadCoolAmt? Super confusing. It also appears that \u003Cem\u003Ethis amount of heat transfer scales itself to what the reactor currently produces\u003C/em\u003E. I can for example turn the reactor control slider all the way down to 5%. That is the minimum setting. RadCoolTot shows 5.7 at this point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The strange thing here is this: even at that setting, the reactor remains stable at maximum heat, and generates maximum power output. It does not cool down, because the amount of heat transfer throttled itself automatically to stop the reactor from cooling down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis reliably lets me go all exploity and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot70.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edo this\u003C/a\u003E. Yep, this is a MX-L reactor, outputting 3,000 Ec/s steady state... while being cooled by three small radiators. Total heat throughput: 144.7 kW out of 150 kW capacity. If I could turn it down all the way to 1%, it would even work with one small radiator. (Amusingly, fuel usage seems to scale off of temperature, not the reactor control slider, meaning that fuel usage is actually the proper 100% burn rate, despite the reactor being set to 5%.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads me to believe that power created depends on nothing but current core temperature. Any setup that will hold that temperature steady state gains full output. Unfortunately, this \u0022any setup\u0022 includes those which do not transfer anywhere near the total amount of heat throughput the reactor is able to create. It works because you can simply throttle down. This is why, Nertea, you are finding that the slider doesn\u0027t really affect what the reactor is doing unless you move it down to essentially zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion on how to fix this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- In the real world, a heat engine\u0027s energy throughput is defined by the amount of heat it moves from A to B. Therefore the power output of a generator connected to a heat engine is also defined by the amount of heat the heat engine moves from A to B. Where A is the heat source and B is the heat sink. In other words: the reactor\u0027s power output should scale linearly with the amount of heat transferred away from it, into the radiators. That means you always only ever get the Ec output for which you have radiator power onboard.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- At the same time, fuel usage must scale with the reactor control slider, if it is really meant to signify the reaction rate. That you burn more fuel with a higher reaction rate only makes sense, yes? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- And what does core heat do, then? It could define the rate at which that heat transfer to the radiators happen. Right now, a reactor below nominal temp transfers nothing whatsoever to the radiators, but a reactor at nominal temp transfers everything it currently produces (and one above nominal will also transfer excess to cool itself down). This sudden 0 to 100 isn\u0027t very satisfying. It would be nicer if the radiators would start transferring even below nominal, just not at the full rate. For example, a linear increase over the temperature spread from 400 K (arbitrary minimum heat to generate power) to whatever the nominal temp is. For a M-EXP, 400 K to 650 K (a range of 250), where at 400K it would transfer 0% of the current output to the radiators, at 525 K it would transfer 50%, and at 650 K it would send 100% of the heat output into the radiators. This would result in the reactor temperature rising quickly at the start, but growing more slowly the closer it comes to nominal. The amount of power produced would do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDISCLAIMER: I don\u0027t know if you can actually mod these systems like that. The above is just how I would do it if I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s something else that I would like to mention:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen coming out of a scene change to a deactivated reactor, all of the debug numbers only show questionmarks. If you turn on the reactor, it is supposed to detect that there are radiators available - at least if you have any that are currently working - and fill in those numbers with the relevant info. Even if no radiators are available at the moment of reactor start, the reactor should notice when radiators are toggled on afterwards. This works just fine if you for example switch to an active vessel from the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when the reactor comes fresh out of the VAB, and was never on before, this does not work reliably. The very first time you activate the reactor, it starts and begins to heat up, but it does not resolve the questionmarks. Sometimes waiting helps, but that is dangerous, because the reactor may reach full meltdown before anything happens. Sometimes turning it off and back on again helps (thank you tech support!), but not always. Sometimes toggling a radiator helps, but not always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as the reactor properly resolved the questionmarks once, you can turn if off and change scenes as much as you like; whenever you come back, it will reliably identify its cooling situation.
