I figured, why not simply change the background for the VAB - as in, instead of looking out over the launchpad during construction, you look out over Kerbin from orbit while you\u0027re throwing parts together. While I don\u0027t really have traditional understanding of coding, I was looking through my squad files to try to figure out how they use the background the do for the VAB. I normally am able to logic through the progression of code, but this has so far been entirely elusive to me. If someone wants to help me through this, that would be SO awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027m strictly interested in switching the VAB background to that of an orbital view of Kerbin or a view of literally any other background (oceans, from the mun, Jool orbit, etc., you guys get the idea). I also wouldn\u0027t know how to actually insert the background (a static image I\u0027m sure would be easier, but I\u0027d love to watch Kerbin rotate whilst building rockets). So all told, I propose the following phases for development:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase I - Replacement of the VAB background with an orbital view of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Static image\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Orbital Rotation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase II - The ability to actually release ships from an Orbital VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Spawning of ships into orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Integration with EPL capabilities to have a part to spawn from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An actual physical building in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Animation of a ship being released from the OVAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase III - Modification of the VAB internals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Floating Kerbal engineers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A more sensible design for oribtal construction (cylindrical shape, no floor as we know it now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch clamp-like tethers to prevent whatever you are constructing from floating away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase IV - An orbital SPH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know what you guys think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wants to take over that\u0027s cool too... I just wanted to get the idea out because I think this would be incredibly awesome to have. I just figured that instead of asking people to create mods, I\u0027d attempt to create one for once (albeit with copious amounts of assistance from modders).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T18:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first issue that comes to mind for me is I\u0027m pretty sure that is not a background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would require testing, but from what I see in the VAB, I think you are actually \u003Cem\u003Ein[/in] the VAB building, just with the doors open looking out towards the launchpad.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYou\u0027d have to find the camera we are looking though to confirm this though.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI suppose it is possible that the \u0022doors\u0022 leading out of the VAB are actually a screen showing a second camera\u0027s view for the main camera we work in, but again, testing this would be finding and determining what cameras are active in the VAB and where they point.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ED.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"electronicfox","CreatedById":43373,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T18:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna assume that you are actually IN the VAB, as mentioned above.
