I play extensively with Kerbal Construction Time and Stage Recovery (well, not now, no update yet) and I\u0027d like to see some clever integration with that. What I mean is, in the long term, not sure if this is possible I\u0027d like to see something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each site has a base cost for opening (appearing on the map). Recovering outside the range of these bases should COST money. A small interface to allow you to recover just crew and science and destroy the vessel (again, at small cost) would help. However, this merely allows you to use the basic non upgraded site. At each launch you still have to pay extra for the transport, and loose more time in KCT. Worse, you are limited as to how much mass you can actually move to a site and the refunds for landing near get diminishing returns. \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 still means shifting the thing back to KSC and that costs money. Planes have the alternative to be left at the alternate sites until needed again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now for upgrades:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fuel depot. Ignores the fuel mass during transport and gives money back for the fuel remaining at the end of a mission if landed near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hangar. Allow you to Refuel, reservice (reset failure times for Dang it) and recrew any aircraft landed or left near the airport. Not sure if possible to STORE the craft \u0022in the hangar\u0022, that seems difficult, but you can always just park your craft and recover the crew only. Although will need a very small \u0022bus\u0022 to be able to launch crew at that site (nice as it also simulates crew transport costs to the site). Will need an interface to recover science back to KSC tho. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Data Link. Allows a link between the site and KSC. Signal travel time still applies. Quite expensive might I add. Alternatively, build a sort of network, only allowing you to connect to nearby sites (so that you don\u0027t just buy the one site at the other end of the planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mega Antenna Array. Since some arrays already are implemented, a humongous range that covers the entire Kerbol System would be fun, but veeeeeery expensive. Maybe just one for the entire planet. This would be able to create a link to any antenna, but at cost, so that you can unfold that forgotten solar panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Basic Assembly. Greatly reduces costs of launching at the site, as it mimics breaking the rocket into parts for transport and reassembly on site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Full blown mega launch site. Works normally, as an extension to KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S yes, I am a masochist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I believe that Stage Recovery in particular should work a bit differently. The KCT \u0022revert button\u0022 should allow you to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-destroy the vessel, for a tiny bit of money, only if landed and on Kerbin of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-recover crew and science, again for a tiny bit of money, depending how far you are from KSC (although the closest KerbinSide site should reduce the cost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-recover the craft. This should COST money, the further away you are from KSC. KerbinSide sites should reduce the cost, but not nullify it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-at the end of this, the parts would be reconditioned and allowed further use (meaning you get some money back). I\u0027m not sure if KCT keeps track of existing part in the inventory for cost, or only for build time. An utopia would be to have some label on the parts in the VAB (such as the *Experimental* label) that shows how many of that part you have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-moving on my utopian view, every part should have a \u0022durability\u0022 resource, hidden, influenced by G\u0027s, heat, time in use, that decides how much the reconditioning costs. The upside would be to give a bit of science in return (the boys at the labs would love the radiated melted parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KerbinSide does open up the possibility of an interesting \u0022HARD mode\u0022 option, where landing outside your base areas might mean that your \u0022time to recovery\u0022 might take days, killing your stranded kerbals at sea or starve on land. Or die of cold in the mountains. Hehehehe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough wishful thinking, KCT has been a great mod for a long time, a MUST in any stock career.

Normally all you have to do is download the last official release, then replace the .dll with the one from the build server linked on the first post. With recent changes, you\u0027re actually supposed to create a plugins folder and then put the .dll in there, while also deleting the .dll from the old release. There was a slight change in the file name and it will need to be organized like that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe betas are purposefully a little complicated to set up to deter people from installing them without fully comprehending that they are, more often than not, totally broken or missing features.
