They are very performance expensive, and only add to your game experience for a short period of time on the way into space. Also, there is an old trick for getting performance from the game if you decided not to use scatterer\u0027s ocean shaders. It involves modifying values in the settings.cfg file for ksp (the one in the root folder, next to the .exe for the game), so make backups and proceed at your own risk.

In any case your best bet is disabling the ocean shaders or the volumetric clouds, nothing else hits the performance as hard. Or maybe just use less volumetrics layers.\n\nAnd turn the ocean fourierGridSize down to 64 if you haven\u0027t already, set m\\_resolution to 8 instead of 4\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, AndrewDrawsPrettyPictures said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry it\u0027s taken me a while to post my output log.

Perhaps you just need to mess with the DOE settings?  \n\nEDIT: I would like to add that I have been noticing inconsistencies with DOE\u0027s skybox dimming lately, and am also using SVE. I doesn\u0027t bother me much, so I haven\u0027t paid attention to the exact conditions for repro steps. My issue is sometimes the skybox doesn\u0027t dim when it should because the camera is facing the sun, so I can see Kerbol and the skybox at the same time. A bit different then your issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-15T23:08:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2017 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Errol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Agustin","CreatedById":172127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T21:05:07Z","Content":"THanks!
