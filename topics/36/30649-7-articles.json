Instead of messing with coordinates, why not use Kethane\u0027s new feature? It generates gas/ore deposits from the \u0027seed\u0027 and entire hex counts as deposit area. So: what about making new resource called \u0022minerals\u0022 and set \u0027seed\u0027 to generate only 10 single hexes randomly spread over the planet\u0027s surface. Every hex contains only 10 units of samples, so you can analyse each spot only once - after it\u0027s drained it disappears from the map view. Now for missions: \u0027easy mode\u0027 would require to analyse (or return if you use a probe) 1-3 hexes. \u0027Normal mode\u0027 4-6 places. And in \u0027hard mode\u0027 you would have to visit all 10 hexes. Though maybe not in one go - for our nerves sake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E Hmm, it occured to me that for the same reason would be better to generate some more \u0027sample hexes\u0027. Just in case couple of them spawns in unreachable areas. Generally it should not matter if you are analysing rock, gas or liquid in each hex, so it could be used for any body in system. Though one thing i\u0027m worried about is Eve\u0027s and Laythe\u0027s oceans. Reaching middle of the sea to sample one, final hex could be hard and tedious if someone doesn\u0027t use hydroplane or some kind of boat.
