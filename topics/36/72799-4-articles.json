I captured an asteroid, which I am aiming to turn into a fuel depot while I am waiting on a full release of the mod. I started hollowing it out and got enough space to store all of the fuel I had left over on the capture craft, which came to just about 6400 total space. I left the asteroid (and in fact the game for the night) to begin working on a propulsion rocket block so I can maneuver it into a better position. When I went back to the asteroid, all of the fuel and ox were still in the asteroid, but the max value had been reset to 0 and the available units had been zeroed out as well. I am glad the fuel is still present, but I am very concerned that I the max value went to 0, because any further increases start at 0 instead of going back to the correct number. I have tried to edit the persistent.sfs file to fix it back, but I guess I didn\u0027t quite understand the currentAmounts = (2615.866, 3200, 3200, 3200), I know that the first number is the amount that is actually in the tank, but I am not sure about the other 3.

I captured an asteroid, which I am aiming to turn into a fuel depot while I am waiting on a full release of the mod. I started hollowing it out and got enough space to store all of the fuel I had left over on the capture craft, which came to just about 6400 total space. I left the asteroid (and in fact the game for the night) to begin working on a propulsion rocket block so I can maneuver it into a better position. When I went back to the asteroid, all of the fuel and ox were still in the asteroid, but the max value had been reset to 0 and the available units had been zeroed out as well. I am glad the fuel is still present, but I am very concerned that I the max value went to 0, because any further increases start at 0 instead of going back to the correct number. I have tried to edit the persistent.sfs file to fix it back, but I guess I didn\u0027t quite understand the currentAmounts = (2615.866, 3200, 3200, 3200), I know that the first number is the amount that is actually in the tank, but I am not sure about the other 3. I have a shot of the problem...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y4qYXKk.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/y4qYXKk.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you tell me from what mod do these trusses are?
