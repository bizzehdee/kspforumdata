This is similar to what BobCat did with his MPCV. Ideally, you want to cut the drogue when you deploy the main. One of the problems is that it\u0027s hard to set up the part actions in the VAB because both the drogue and main have the same labels \u0022Deploy\u0022 and \u0022Cut Chute\u0022. Also, I find that it tends to sometimes start deployed on the pad.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said in my previous post, I hacked up BobCat\u0027s CFG so that the drogue more or less will be automatically cut around the speed at which the mains would deploy. I may have to play around with values, but it\u0027s definitely doable without mucking with action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had chutes deploy by themselves on the pad, and even then that is only possible if someone had deliberately put the parachute in the wrong stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T19:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elook the SLS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C81CRBA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C81CRBA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T08:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProgress Report, 29 September 2013\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded the first of the two Docking Port / Parachute combos, a variant of the standard Clamp-O-Tron:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/272/6/b/ksp_sdhi_paradock_clampotron_final_29_sept_201_by_sumghai-d6oflb6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_sdhi_paradock_clampotron_final_29_sept_201_by_sumghai-d6oflb6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFig 11\u003C/strong\u003E - SDHI Clamp-O-Tron Parachute Variant - (Mostly) Final\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned previously, this part simply reuses the existing stock KSP Clamp-O-Tron docking port and adds various bits and pieces to it such as the docking lights and the two parachutes.
