So yeah the thing about the depth buffer mode (what enables a big speedup since a few versions back) and the new blending is that they are both incompatible with MSAA (the stock AA) so scatterer disables it on scene changes. If you re-enable it after scene changes you will indeed see that it causes aliasing around objects and around the horizon so it\u0027s no bueno. Thr only alternatives left are SMAA and TAA. SMAA works well enough for me at 1440p that I consider it viable, TAA looks better in motion and I personally play with it if I can keep fps above 30, but when fps drops it causes trails and I haven\u0027t looked into it. Another option may be to use FXAA through TUFX. These are just the normal limitations of these rendering methods. For the shimmering I will see if I can reproduce it next time\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, OrbitalManeuvers said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s my log and a few screenshots from a minimal JNSQ install.
