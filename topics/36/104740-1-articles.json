According to [this webpage](http://nickyguides.digital-digest.com/bilinear-vs-bicubic.htm):\n\n- When scaling images up, bilinear sampling results in blocky images, while bicubic sampling gives a smoother result\n\n- Conversely, when downscaling images, bicubic sampling gives harsh, hard pixels, so bilinear sampling is better\n\nI suspect Unity may be defaulting to bicubic sampling regardless of up/down scaling, hence the reduction in quality of downsized logos and necessitating a separate scaled version to allow better control over quality.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:11:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**\n  \nFixed broken quote"}]}
