Well, it seems wrong. Not to be critical or anything, you understand, but I don\u0027t think of landing gear when one mentions fuel systems. I would advocate moving the LS-40 Landing Frame, the LSX Landing Frame (and taking out that massively overpowered battery) and move them to Advanced Construction and move the Radial Lander Leg to Landing. Also, the LS-40 might also want to be in landing or taken out altogether (since it appears to be a combination of the other two parts). I\u0027d also move the Karbonite Sensor Array to Space Exploration or Science Tech. Also, in looking through sandbox mode, I don\u0027t see the landing leg by itself.
