This is possible I think, just not when inheriting the ModuleScienceExperiment like your plugin does. You would need to use IScienceDataContainer and recreate the experiment that way. \u003Cp\u003EUsing this method you can point the module to whichever planet you want the science experiment to apply to. Normally you would just use something like vessel.mainBody, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any reason why you couldn\u0027t just always point the experiment towards Kerbin, so that every experiment thinks you are in Kerbin orbit, regardless of where you actually are. You can check out the SCANsat or the Tarsier Space Tech source (or mine if I can ever get it working right), those are the only two that I know of that use this method, but there are probably others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit more complicated to use IScienceDataContainer, but it gives you a lot more flexibility in how you can set up your experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool, thanks!
