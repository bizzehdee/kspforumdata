We have mountains, but they aren\u0027t waves as high as\u00A0the clouds. We have an ice planet (Eeloo, Vall is a moon) but no idiot to blow an airlock and make an intense scene. We have deserts, but no Wolf Edmunds. So, how will we get these things? Me, Dr. Kaboom (I\u0027m not hijacking any ships and blowing out airlocks, unlike my colleague Dr. Mann) of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how will I do it? Space Engine (yes, I\u0027m that guy), Kopernicus, and Kittopia Tech. Now, I\u0027m sure a guy\u0027s\u00A0already\u00A0workin\u0027 on it, but he hasn\u0027t done a thing!
