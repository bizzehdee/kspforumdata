I pinged MOARdV for that, [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105821-131-rasterpropmonitor-still-putting-the-a-in-iva-v0293-1-january-2018/\u0026page=71\u0026tab=comments#comment-3281853).  \n\nI think that needs to be fixed from RPMs side. If this can\u0027t be done there, you could inverse the calls in your configs too (I fixed it here for myself) but the configs would be counter-intuitive then.\n\nBTW, may I ask how one places the buttons in the cockpits when one designs a new cockpit?
