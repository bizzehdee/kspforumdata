Hence a differing set of parts. No need to worry about C#, the mod doesn\u0027t use any plugins or coding (my own coding knowledge is limited to python and excel, which I\u0027m basically only learning to try and automate the boring part of my job.

It made sense while I was making it, but I doubt it makes even the damnest bit of sense to anyone else (especially judging by the number of people who have said exactly that). Well, I was dealing with moving from the old part loader to the (buggy and limited initial versions of the) new part-loader at the time, but it works pretty well now, so I think it could manage with a better ordered file structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe separate parts really need moving to their own cfgs and/or folder. But they\u0027re all held together by judicious use of the MODEL{}, so you need to be careful with that as there\u0027s a lot of cross-referenced parts.
