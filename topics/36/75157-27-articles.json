I really don\u0027t have the time to work on this mod properly at the moment, let alone post endless replies about install instructions for it. Please \u003Cem\u003Eonly \u003C/em\u003Einstall if you wan\u0027t to test or are, for whatever reason, desperate to try it in \u003Cstrong\u003E[acknowledging its unfinished state]\u003C/strong\u003E. If that is the case then please read the info on the GitHub page about install info and KNOWN BUGS, and then report back anything else, although I most likely already know about them and am working on getting it fixed when I can find the time. This is also dependant on when rbray has the time to get fixes/features out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words I purposely didn\u0027t wan\u0027t to place this release on the OP as even more people will assume it\u0027s an official release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add any info I forgot to before to the GitHub repo now and thanks you for your patients.
