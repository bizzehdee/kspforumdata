Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct. KSP looks for a blank transform named dockingNode, oriented with the y-axis pointed in the direction of docking (if I am not mistaken with the orientation). It is not a big deal to add it, but as you said if you are already opening it up you might as well make your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are however mistaken about how to add it. It must be added in Unity, not just in a modeling program. Basically the order for making is a part is Model -\u0026gt; Unity -\u0026gt; Part CFG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry Moar, but I tried that once and it failed, then learned about the dockingNode transform. Unity has to have a reference for what direction to apply the magnetic force, and it cannot do that without a transform in the hierarchy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThirdHorseman","CreatedById":77825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T15:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PringleMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PringleMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou are however mistaken about how to add it.
