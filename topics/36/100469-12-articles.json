As others have noted, and I just tested it will import stock craft files just fine, other than texture rotation/position problems, most of which I managed to fix by rotating the UV mesh (or rather, mirroring it on the Y axis, though some had to be mirrored on X axis, and repositioned, the RTG\u0027s on the ion probe for example). Craft that I made in the VAB or SPH though only import the root part. When I tried to import a jet I made, it just imported the first cockpit I put, and a collider for the 2nd cockpit. When I tried to import a rocket I made, it imported the capsule, and because I had 2 of the same capsule that one imported as well, along with 2 struts, but the script crashed and nothing else came in.\n\nI downloaded the new MU importer (well, new as of when I downloaded it last night) but before that it would do the same thing, except no textures at all."},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:26:37Z","Content":"So, have smoke effects from engins been put in yet?

It\u0027s been a while so I might have already figured this out, but stock craft load no problem, other than maybe part placement and textures. I tried loading crafts from 0.9 and the loaded too, though again part placement and textures. However, 1.0.2 craft only seem to load a few parts (same texture alignment issues, easily fixed in blender uv editor). I might try some more testing with it and see if I can help figure out what could be going on.\n\nThough...I know next to nothing about python scripts lol.\n\n**Update** Thought I\u0027d start by trying to figure out why the addon crashes, so I started out with a simple ship. Mk1 pod, Adv SAS, fl-t800 tank and the reliant engine. That imported fine pretty much except the mesh for the engine didn\u0027t come in. However if I added another part after the engine the mesh does come in but it doesn\u0027t grab the right textures, lacks an actual color image map for the engine. I added the swivel engine and the texture came in but again the engine mesh didn\u0027t load. So far though no crashes, at least none that it throws errors about. All the parts have been attached one after another so far. Later I\u0027ll try attaching radial parts, and also parts before and after the root part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T15:24:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**\n  \nAdded Testing results"},{"CreatedByName":"Kussris","CreatedById":138854,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T08:17:43Z","Content":"![ksp_booster_rocket_at_launch_by_michawlo-d8vy1wy.jpg](http://img09.deviantart.net/568a/i/2015/155/0/e/ksp_booster_rocket_at_launch_by_michawlo-d8vy1wy.jpg)\n\nThanks for the importer!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"electronicfox","CreatedById":43373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:01:04Z","Content":"This really helps with seeing how new mod parts look with stock parts without having to compile everything first."},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:18:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://img09.deviantart.net/568a/i/2015/155/0/e/ksp_booster_rocket_at_launch_by_michawlo-d8vy1wy.jpg](http://img09.deviantart.net/568a/i/2015/155/0/e/ksp_booster_rocket_at_launch_by_michawlo-d8vy1wy.jpg)\n\u003E Thanks for the importer!!!\n\nNice!
