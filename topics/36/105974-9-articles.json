Good luck flying a helicopter in ksp while using a chin mounted Gatling gun but if all goes to plan it will be a thing.\n\nOn a side note I\u0027ve also been very interested in the armaments of the AC130 spooky 2 and predator drones so maybe a griffon missile of small diameter bomb are in the mix. I want to try and screw with the rocket pod code to make a Zuni pod too since everyone talks about it but no one does it. Any requests guys I need inspiration!
