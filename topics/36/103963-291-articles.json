Also, there are plenty of visual mods out there and if one is abandoned (rssve) a dev doesn\u2019t have to give an explanation.\n\nas far as clouds in scatterer, I would say no.

They don\u0027t appear to centered on anything, just floating off in space next to the associated stellar body.

So, that brings me back to my original question of what each sunflare config setting actually does and what the input ranges are.

I get that extracurricular activities like coding scatterer can get put in the back burner for a while. Stuff happens and real life is more important. I don\u2019t blame anyone for taking time on a mod update for a **game.** \n\nAnd excuse me for not being correct in my assumption as to why you closed your thread, but like the comment said that I responded too, there was no real explanation, and the only obvious thing was the frustration with scatterer in real scale and most forums users don\u2019t think to check the GitHub of a closed forum thread ![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022) can you blame them?

Since i can\u0027t figure out how to post screenshots without using Imgur, i\u0027ll describe the issue: Basically, i can\u0027t change the ocean effects and they\u0027re stuck on a really weird thing where they show the blue color but are transparent all the way down to the ocean floor. I can also see the underwater portions of land masses in the distance, such as islands, except they look sort of highlighted. It only does this in flight mode, however.
