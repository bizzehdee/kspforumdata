(Think Category 5 hurricane winds for a start...)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the default stock atmospheric model for Eve could not physically exist. Lets take the most simple model of the atmosphere, isothermic, and calculate the scale height from the physical properties of the planet. The scale height of a planet is equal to the (Blotzman constant (k) * Temperature in Kelvin) / (average molecular weight of air * gravity). Assuming that Eve atmosphere is mostly CO2 you end of with a scale height of 4.88 km which is way smaller than Venus of 15.9 km. The scale height is smaller than the one for Kerbin which means the atmosphere is heavier and closer to the surface of the planet. If you do the same thing with Duna you will find the scale height is 15.921 which means Duna\u0027s atmosphere which is thin extends far from the surface of the planet, over 200km in fact. Now if model the lower atmosphere with a adiabatic model then the atmosphere extends a bit further out for all cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why a planet atmosphere is hot is not the thickness but the opacity in the infrared range of the atmosphere. The opacity = 1 - (Effective Temperature/Surface temperature)^4. Plug in the number for venus and you get .98 which means 98% of the solar radiation reaching the planet is absorbed. For earth only 40% of the energy from the sun is absorbed. Now if you take Mars its opacity is 17% but its atmosphere is .06 ours which shows the power of CO2 at retaining heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022silverfox8124\u0022 data-cite=\u0022silverfox8124\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Everyone, Wow this thread just BOOMED up over night. I\u0027d like to say that while yes, cars and planes are engineered to take lightning strikes, but you have to ask yourself, are kerbals that prepared for it? Lightning in the least damages what it touches in some way or another. The bolt itself is quite hot and packs a ton of punch. Having parts explode and break would encourage the player to not fly in storms.\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of Rbray\u0027s clouds, rbray and I have been talking a tad more since he\u0027s picking back up on EVE. One problem we\u0027re facing is having individual cloud segments and controlling each separately. It\u0027s a tad harder than you all may think, as even the both of us are stumped for ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have thought about this as well but it will be a great amount of work to do. Especially since cumulus clouds seem to generate over the ocean travel a bit building up moisture and then dumping it as rain. Unlike the current Eve cloud model those clouds don\u0027t travel very far before then break up. If you look at this GEOS simulation \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY3ko8xJ4iY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E you can see what I mean.

So we\u0027re going out on a limb when we try and simulate those, sadly we can\u0027t guarantee how accurate those planets(Eve and Jool) may behave in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add to that, Laythe is an entirely new planet with no IRL analogue, we\u0027d be tackling that salty water ball with blind eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I was just discussing this in the 10x kerbol forum. Their exist an excellent paper on why stratospheric inversion happens. The research discovered that the lower atmosphere obeys a adiabatic behavior until the atmospheric pressure reaches .1 atm then switches to a isothermic behavior. The reason is convection is no longer the dominate influence at that pressure and this behavior is true for all worlds independent of position in the star system or atmospheric composition. The paper can be found here : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Robinson2014_0.1bar_Tropopause.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Robinson2014_0.1bar_Tropopause.pdf\u003C/a\u003E. So models do exist for exoplanet atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you are aware the stock star Kerbol is totally messed up. If you want to perverse the 1360 W/m^2 radiance on Kerbin and use its surface temp of 5840K this will change the properties of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe star as well as the amount of radiation reaching all the other planets. This impacts the range of temperatures a planet can experience. Remember energy has to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[QUOTA]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that Kerbin != Earth. It\u0027s close, but it\u0027s not there, it tries to be, but it\u0027s not there. Kerbin\u0027s geographical layout is also MUCH different than Earth\u0027s.

I\u0027ve open the paper you have linked and will give it a thorough read-through soon enough. It\u0027s an interesting find to see a similarity in the way the atmospheres are on different planets. However, what I mean by not greatly studied is that we have live maps of the weather and ocean currents here on earth that are easily accessible by the public. We also have weather simulations being run everyday for the planet to give us weather reports. We as the public don\u0027t really have access to that same kind of data for other planets, if there\u0027s even the same data for the other planets, so to study the behaviour in weather on other planets is a tad more challenging for me to do with a lack of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of kerbin being different from Earth, I stick by my point of the geography being different.

But really depends on what we are interested in, e.g. in case the purpose is to study particles interaction with the Solar wind (at the limits of magnetosphere), the densities are a lot less than what is considered affecting drag and spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDensity is function of Pressure P, Temperature T, and Molar mass M: \u00C3\u00C2(z) = P(z) * M / (R * T(z)), where R is the universal gas constant, of course both P and T change with altitude z.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe variance of Pressure with altitude is commonly represented with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScale height\u003C/a\u003E H. Now, H(z) = Kb * T(z) / ( M/Na * g(z)), where Kb is Boltzmann constant, Na = R/Kb the Avogadro constant. It is clear then Scale height depends from the Temperature profile with altitude, varies (but very slowly) due to gravity change with altitude, and is tied to Molar mass of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, computing the Scale height and comparing with values in KSP shows what this atmosphere height issue is really about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin atmosphere has a Molar mass = 28.9644 g/mol. Its temperature averaged for altitude is = 233.22\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0K.

In the case of Kerbin, the correct data for pressure correspond to a scale height (averaged with altitude) = 5463m, 20% less than the \u0022natural\u0022 value. The resulting \u00C3\u00C2(70Km) is then = 5.06E-6 Kg/m3 (7.7% of the non-corrected value), considered low enough for practical purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if H was uncorrected, the same density would be found at atmosphere height z= 87500m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther bodies in KSP are more extreme in the \u0022correction\u0022 applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe has same M as Kerbin = 28.9644 g/mol, an averaged T = 214.42\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0K, g(0)=7.85m/s2 and P(0)=60795 Pa.
