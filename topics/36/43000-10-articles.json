First I had to open it up as a new project, configure folders that they don\u0027t appear in \u0022assets\u0022 but a separate \u0022BobCat\u0022 folder so it doesn\u0027t mess up my own project. Then export the model as an asset, and then import into the other project, and then I realized the part tools were incompatible cause you are probably using a newer version. So I had to redo all your materials to be compatible with my KSP shaders. Then there were some strange \u0022mono develop\u0022 components on each model that I had to remove. And there is animation on the top that doesn\u0027t do anything (???). I think there are a few smoothing problems on the models, on the tall round buildings, if you look at those vertical white stripes you can see they are dark on the top and light at the botton, that looks like a normal problem (smoothing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for colliders, the monument doesn\u0027t have it, I guess there should be a non-convex mesh collider on it, also on the round highrises IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd DON\u0027T raise the ground like that that it has slopes on the sides, make it completely flat. I don\u0027t see the point of raising it. The \u0022plot\u0022 poly that I put there I remove when I import your model. Also, make it only the top side, you don\u0027t need the whole box, except for the waterfront side, but if you don\u0027t edit waterfront then I will put a poly over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the scale was strange.
