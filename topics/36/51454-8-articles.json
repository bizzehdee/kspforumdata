Mass Relay part will explose due to overheating while warping the vessel. 20% chance of loosing the vessel to a random orbit too during the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Jamming. Sometimes (5% of chance?) the mass relay will jam. No warping, and require a Kerbal to right clic on the part to fix it (like wheels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Recoil.
