My rationale is that biomes aren\u0027t actually biomes, but more like different types of terrain, e.g. grassland vs. sand, or on Mun it\u0027s simply different craters that only differ in which shade of grey they are. When I worked with SAR data in the past, that\u0027s almost exactly what we used it for (along with buildings and vehicles, e.g. identify a tank model by its shape on a SAR image).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s about all I have, so I\u0027m definitely interested in a better explanation of how these sensors could work. Maybe SAR would be better for the high res altimetry sensor, and then multispectral for biomes? There\u0027s no visible band sensor yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s less obvious with other planets. With the Earth, at least, \u0022biome\u0022 detection is quite easy with a relatively simple multispectral instrument, as biomes are defined quite well by their vegetation and thus their NIR/visible properties. That\u0027s why I suggested that that. Thinking of other planets... well, if you expand multispectral (\u0026lt;15 bands) to hyperspectral (up to 100s of bands), you can do geological analysis quite well, so if you wanted some logic to extend that to the Mun, it could work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say SAR is good for altimetry indeed, no doubt about that. If you had some way of making high res and slow res sensors different, you could try splitting SAR into high-altitude capable, low to high res, and add LiDaR (essentially large area laser ranging) as a low-altitude only, super-fine resolution ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisible would just be true colour, I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damny","CreatedById":78621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T19:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022a__gun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022a__gun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have heard that Unity loads EVERYTHING in the gamedata folder regardless of wether its used but don\u0027t know for sure.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a bunch of very large images in a part directory and my KSP used 2.7 GB of RAM.
