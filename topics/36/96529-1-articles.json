The large part that spins is probably the hardest one to make and when I finally finished and got it into the game, the pods don\u0027t load up. This is a very basic part - it doesn\u0027t spin... yet. Can someone shed some light on why the pods don\u0027t load up? And not just the pods, but random bits of the main structure as well. It\u0027s all one part, so I was wondering if perhaps I\u0027m exceeding some sort of vertices limit. In which case, why does it let me write the mu file in the first place? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(to clarify, the picture shows the part in question in the middle.
