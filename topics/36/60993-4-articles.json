This means less battery power, less monopropellant, less torque on the reaction wheels, etc. This way by itself it can act as a sort of mk 1-2 \u0022light\u0022 version, not as good but less weight. In this case you can just attach it using the built in shroud (shown in red) and it will fit the large size parts fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you instead use the dedicated service module (shown in blue and a separate part from the pod) you get a heavy duty system. I\u0027m planning for the service module to contain extra battery power, extra monopropellant, a supply of fuel and oxidizer, and a reaction wheel of its own to add to the torque power of the craft. It will also likely include a built in decoupler to keep the part count in both the VAB and this mod down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this gives a better idea of the sort of design direction I\u0027m planning to go in with this pod.

Even if you hate the idea. Progress is moving slowly but surely. (lol progress) But I don\u0027t want to show anything until I have at least most of each piece done, just because Soyuz is a spacecraft that\u0027s more than the sum of it\u0027s parts and I think just seeing a single part doesn\u0027t have the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind it . But as you accidentally mentioned progress (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) I wanted to ask if you maybe als want to make an extra set of parts which don\u0027t have any crew capacity but solely storage purposes for replacement of the manned capsule/orbiter. So as an unmanned craft which bases on the manned spacecraft just like progress. I guess that would also work with a Shenzou style ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really a request just some thoughts thrown in the room .. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T17:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s something I\u0027ve thought about but if I do it it\u0027ll be something I do later.
