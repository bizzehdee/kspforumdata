Maybe even finish up the textures for the LC2-IVA since it is done geometry wise.\n- Balance pass on costs, mass, tech-tree placement; initial cleanup for usability in career mode.\n- Some minor tech-tree re-arrangement of a few stock parts; yes the stock progression bugs the \\_\\_\\_\\_ out of me in some regards... so I\u0027m going to \u0027fix\u0027 it.\n- Initial public \u0027stable\u0027 release.  Most parts and plugins are getting to the point where I cannot see needing any more broad/breaking changes to them.  This will entail opening up a new thread in the \u0027Add-On Releases\u0027 section of the forums, and I\u0027ll start working on branched development (stable\u002Bbugfixes, dev)\n- Merlin rocket engines - would like to have these finished and added in for the initial \u0027public\u0027 release, but they might come as part of the first post-release update.\n- Modular Cargo Bay module and parts (multiple geometry variants).  Not sure if/when these will be done.... but I can certainly see some uses for them.\n- More MFT variants -- cryo fuels, spherical, semi-octagonal containers, radial-tanks.  Not sure if/when these will be done.... but I can certainly see some uses for them.\n- Take a break and play some KSP ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)    This is actually a -very- important step... as it will allow me to mull over what other parts/series that I will need to do, as well as give me some personal experience regarding the general balance.  Haven\u0027t sat down and tried to actually -play- since like 1.02 or so; so I\u0027m a bit out-of-touch regarding using my own parts in-game.\n\nRe: Merlin engines\n\nAnyone have some hard-data on their dimensions?  Schematics, diagrams, blueprints?  \n\nAfter several -hours- of searching, the -only- mention of diameter that I can find is a single reference here: [http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets/falcon-9-v1-1-f9r/](http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets/falcon-9-v1-1-f9r/)  Which gives me an -approximate- diameter for an M1D at ~1m.  I cannot locate a single schematic, diagram, or 3-view drawing.... nothing usable as a detailed reference for any of the Merlin variants.  Lots of pictures; a few renders of other peoples models... but no info on the actual engines....  \n\nNotably I need schematics of the bell curves/profiles and some precise dimensions (cm precision or greater, prefer mm precision) for A/B, C, CV, D, and DV versions.  I can find schematics and diagrams for their conference center buildings/launch complex... but nothing on the actual engines ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)  I might be able to fake a lot of it from the images (though I loathe doing so)... but I need at least some precise dimensions for each of the engines.\n\n....\n\n![WAPFW5s.png](http://i.imgur.com/WAPFW5s.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T19:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"}]}
