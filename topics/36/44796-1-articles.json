It would be somewhat bulky, the exchange is very nearly 1:1 almost no loss in the system. The exchanger takes advantage of the thermal properties of gases while they expand or are compressed which responds in kind with exothermic properties and endothermic properties. In this way you can make the \u0027hot\u0027 end hotter from the \u0027cool\u0027 end. thing to keep in mind that is as the hot end gets hotter the cool end get cooler, as each side reaches it\u0027s saturation point the (longer/or higher pressure) the exchanger has to work to change the temperature. So it can be insanely efficient at temperatures close to the operating range of the gases in the exchanger, but out side of that it begins to get saturated and eventually destroy itself (melting)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sypress","CreatedById":39246,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T06:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShoved another update to Github.
