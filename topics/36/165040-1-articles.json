From my current understanding of how KSP works, the .mu file will search for the texture file its mapped to and will use the first one it finds in that folder. so without a plugin if you used one folder with all the textures and the one .mu file you would only ever see one picture on your billboard, irrespective of how many .cfg files there were. However if each part had its own subfolder, for instance:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EGameData[folder]\n\t-\u0026gt;YourBillBoardMod[folder]\n\t\t-\u0026gt;Agency[folder]\n\t\t-\u0026gt;Parts[folder]\n\t\t\t-\u0026gt;Billboard1[folder]\n\t\t\t\t-\u0026gt;billboard1.cfg\n\t\t\t\t-\u0026gt;model.mu\n\t\t\t\t-\u0026gt;texture.dds\n\t\t\t-\u0026gt;Billboard2[folder]\n\t\t\t\t-\u0026gt;billboard2.cfg\n\t\t\t\t-\u0026gt;model.mu\n\t\t\t\ttexture.dds\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that gets the vague idea across and that\u0027s just one way of doing it without plugins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I feel that it probably wouldn\u0027t take you long to learn to drive blender and unity than you could build the model you actually want?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
