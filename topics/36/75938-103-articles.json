That\u0027s why you can place wheels are strange angles and still have them work the way you expect (within reason). KF wheels are much more finicky about where they are initialized and if you move them, they get cranky. I believe some sort of \u0022reset\u0022 would be a good idea for many of the problems we\u0027ve faced with KF products. Included is the issue with repulsors within physics range only functioning on the last vessel to be launched. If a reset could be activated when such issues arise, you might be able to get around those issues without having to reload the scene. Eventually, with some testing, we might even be able to automate the reset process for certain situations, such as when a vessel change is detected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me, you could export all the scene-load initializations into a separate function and call it from the scene-load event, but also be able to call it from a GUI item labeled \u0022Reinitialize\u0022 which would, when activated on any KF part, redo the initialization process for the current vessel.

When you export DDS files from the asset files, which are loaded before DataFiles, you have a DDS file which is upside down. If you use a generic image viewer (such as IrfanView) to view the DDS and then re-save it as a PNG, you will need to manually flip it vertically for the PNG to be loaded into the game correctly. When converting to DDS, you need to not only change its format, but also flip it again in the vertical axis for KSP to use it correctly. I don\u0027t know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E it works that way, but it does. The DDS conversion utility that was mentioned does this automatically for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for quality, DDS is actually quite accurate if you use the correct DDS format. Some formats will screw up different images in different ways.

Unless you generate mip-maps using Gimp (in which case you can specify the filter to use and what not) then the mip-map generator will simply do what it does by default and KSP will then load those mips instead of the full resolution file based on whatever logic it uses to determine what the texture resolution for each instance is supposed to be. Sometimes that first mip-level will be a major reduction in quality. Some tricks I\u0027ve found while modding games like Skyrim is to manually delete a mip-level from the file (I used utilities specifically made for those mod flatforms, so not much use here at this time) forcing it to re-adjust its mip-levels to compensate for the lowest quality level being a different mip-level than it expected. Other tricks were to simply replace the first mip-level with the full resolution texture. This bloats the DDS file a bit, but tricks KSP into thinking that it\u0027s loading a lower resolution version of the texture than it really it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I do it: I make sure that the texture isn\u0027t overly large (I do a lot of resizing before I install due to running KSP on a laptop that wasn\u0027t specifically designed for games) and then I launch the utility and I unclick the box that tells it to generate mip-maps. KSP will load the full resolution every time it needs the texture. Even at extreme distances. Yes, this has an impact on performance for large textures, but it also reduces the situation where a very close proximity texture is being loaded under a mip and is appearing lower in quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really hating that mods are now distributing in DDS format because it makes quickly editing them for performance a bit of a pain.
