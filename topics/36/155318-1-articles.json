This is a dev thread for my upcoming BD Armory mod \u0027Random Ordinance Emporium.\u0027 This is my first mod that taps into the complexity that is 3d modeling and texturing. I am VERY new to this, so tips, tricks, and suggestions are VERY welcome! Below are some of the ideas I have for the first update coming later this February/March.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent Weapon Ideas. (NU = Next update)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGR-12 Swarm Rocket: A tiny, short-range radar-guided missile that gets all its punching power from \u0027lethal impact velocities.\u0027 Meant to be launched 2-3 at a time. (NU)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTTG-99 \u0027Crackle\u0027 50cal mounted gun: A compact 50cal surface mounted machine gun. Not very powerful, but great if you want to stay small. (NU)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBAMO-05 \u0027Jabberwocky\u0027 30mm: A large, automatic 30mm cannon. Great for making sure things stay dead. Not a rotary cannon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDRO-02 \u0027Thunderdrake\u0027 Missile: A large, medium-range radar-guided missile. It has a large warhead, but it travels relatively\u00A0slow. Great for shooting down bombers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
