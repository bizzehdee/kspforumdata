Remember it is heavily optimized for vacuum operations. (or at least very high altitude)\n\nTechnically its thrust at sea level should be approximately half of its vacuum thrust as with the J-2. I tried to find some sea level statistics for the J-2X and cannot. That information just doesn\u0027t exist. What I did find was information on a NASA blog (author Bill Greene) which stated that it couldn\u0027t be started on the ground because it would rip the nozzle extension apart. (obviously it is operated on the ground for test fires but has no nozzle extension)\n\nSo what the correct answer would be here is tricky. We don\u0027t have individually damageable components so can\u0027t simulate the result of a destroyed nozzle. The engine this part is based on can\u0027t even be operated meaningfully at all at sea level and can\u0027t even be throttled below 84%. (actually I\u0027m not even sure it can be throttled between 84-100%; it\u0027s either 84% or 100%) So it\u0027s pretty limited as to what situations it can be operated in and anywhere near sea level wasn\u0027t meant to be one of those situations. So... no. 11 kilo-newtons of thrust is nowhere near correct but being able to operate the engine on the ground isn\u0027t correct either. \n\nSome things have to be abstracted in this game and sea level thrust of a vacuum rated engine is one of them.\n\n(blog post below comparing J-2X to RS-25)\n\n[https://blogs.nasa.gov/J2X/2013/08/06/inside-the-leo-doghouse-rs-25-vs-j-2x/](https://blogs.nasa.gov/J2X/2013/08/06/inside-the-leo-doghouse-rs-25-vs-j-2x/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-11T14:38:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2019 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"jinnantonix","CreatedById":188889,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-13T08:18:09Z","Content":"My first video in my mission log [Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186864-the-artemis-program-in-real-solar-system-to-the-moon-and-beyond/\u0026tab=comments#comment-3643789) in Real Solar System.  \n\nMany SSTU parts used in building a LAS test vehicle, Delta IV Heavy, Orion and modified Peacekeeper missile.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEQKmHPTgFw?start=64\u0026feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-13T11:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2019 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by jinnantonix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-13T20:38:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 8/11/2019 at 8:37 AM, Starwaster said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So... no. 11 kilo-newtons of thrust is nowhere near correct but being able to operate the engine on the ground isn\u0027t correct either.\n\u003E \n\nThat is pretty much the correct answer.\n\nI could possibly, maybe, put in a custom \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E/thrust curve that was zero until ~\u003E10km, but at the end it would still be a rough approximation of the effect of \u0027this isn\u0027t an engine that can run at sea-level\u0027.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 8/11/2019 at 8:37 AM, Starwaster said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Some things have to be abstracted in this game and sea level thrust of a vacuum rated engine is one of them.\n\u003E \n\nYep.
