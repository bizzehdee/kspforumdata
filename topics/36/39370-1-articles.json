Most people forget, that even with tort reform, anyone can file a lawsuit for anything. It has to go before a judge/magistrate to be ruled as \u0022without merit\u0022, which means it still requires you to either defend yourself in person or hire a lawyer to do so. That then costs the modder many times more to deal with than what little bit of money he took from that person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m speaking from experience here. While I wasn\u0027t the one sued, I know several in the FlightSimulator community who have and I\u0027m aware of people in several other communities that have as well, and it\u0027s driven many good modders off because it soured the relationship between all the modders and the users regardless of whether they accepted \u0022donations\u0022 or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason it works in FS and Train Simulation is because you have very distinct lines in what a group is. There are payware developers who are paid for what they do and there are freeware developers who are not. Freeware developers may accept donations to pay for their web hosting costs because that only creates a contract that they provide a website that works and hosts their products, nothing more. Donationware is a thing of the past. Too many lawsuits and hurt feelings came of it. About 15 years ago, FS was almost crippled because of several payware developers suing freeware developers for breaching the \u0022exclusive rights\u0022 agreements they\u0027d entered with manufacturers and airlines and the effects of it has only just recently been fully washed away, but not until after the cancellation of FS11 and Flight!. The Train Simulation community too has had issues because of a certain railroad and its licensing requirements for even freeware releases and it had effects on MS Train Sim 2 and was part of why it failed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to see KSP go the same way.

With small claims suits costing less than $50 to file in most states (and thus the total liability in some states), it can be an attractive way for someone who feels \u0022wronged\u0022 (even if the reasons are very suspect) to file suit. One of the things done in an FS case was that a developer filed multiple small claims suits in their home state (which followed the \u0022no fault\u0022 rule where if you filed as the plaintiff and you lost you didn\u0027t owe for the defendant\u0027s costs) against small freeware developers who lived out of state and were unable to fly in or pay for a lawyer to appear in their stead, so the freeware guys simply plead no contest or simply closed shop (thus eliminating the competition for the \u0022payware\u0022 developer). Another case, a user sued a small developer who produced \u0022donationware\u0022 because they didn\u0027t think it fair that because they donated one amount they only got part of a collection while another person who donated a dollar more got the full thing. This resulted in a ruling against the developer (who did fight it) because the judge found that it was not a \u0022normal\u0022 business practice to split a collection the way he did where there was no defined donation bracket (i.e. donate $5 you get this, donate $10 you get this). The developer had to give the whole collection to not only that one user, but all others who\u0027d donated at that level prior. While he probably should have simply made 2 packages out of the collection, he didn\u0027t and it got him in trouble because of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the total number of lawsuits filed that I\u0027m aware of in the FS community over the years is probably under 200 (there were probably more, but they just didn\u0027t make any FS news service), it was less than 10 that made major changes in how the community worked forever and how many games were designed afterwards and how their addons were handled if they allowed modifications. It was these 10-or-so lawsuits that led to what we see today with micro-transactions. It was the move away from donationware and shareware due to those litigations that made it where you either offered something totally for free or you charged for everything because the middle ground was too rife with legal risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t get is why all you people want to give away your money so desperately.
