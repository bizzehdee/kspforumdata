I could see going a KSPI route and maybe creating MEGA-RESOURCES, like a new count system for extraction (10 Mega Oxygen = 10 million O2 units), maybe with a sweet awesome compressor tank that weighs a ton but uses wobbly gobbly space-magic singularity to compress them for transport.. maybe have a Terraformer that you plug into that then calculates resource mass off-loaded and makes changes (increases atmospheric density by a small fraction, stored in a planet save file, which will reflect in science experiments).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea for how to integrate it into the game itself.. of course there would be dependencies on resource mods (maybe Community Resources, MKS/OKS or kethane).
