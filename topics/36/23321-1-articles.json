Look, If you wanted to do this right, You would build the tube so that inside, where the craft is accelerating, there is a vacuum, to decrease the required energy needed to accelerate the projectile, right? The issue is when the object DOES end up hitting atmosphere again, you end up with the equivalent of (and I hate to use the human analogy, so I\u0027ll use this instead) a grape being dropped from 50k feet and hitting a pond. Due to the speed, the grape appears to hit a solid wall, and gets destroyed, as well as loses most of it\u0027s energy into the water. Even if you keep the acceleration -zones of the tub filled with atmos on the planet, there is always the issue of superheated plasma-shock getting tangled inside the magnetic acceleration and supporting lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the issue: plasma is, by definition, a superheated and magnetic form of gaseous matter. IE, Plasma has a noticeable effect upon magnetic fields. Plasma shockwaves would occur at the speed that these would need to be traveling, interfering with the overall accelerative medium (the magnetic field that levitates and pushes the craft up to speed), and as soon as the craft leaves the barrel, the plasma-shock would be providing an immense amount of force on the craft, slowing it down to sub-orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this point, here is an analogy. Take that grape, and put it in a cannon that can fire it at mach 20. Now, lets fire the grape... Wow. That grape exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets get a titanium marble then, with a magnet at it\u0027s core. the gun then levitates the object and fires it. The resulting upscale-downscale sonic booms you are hearing is the result of all the energy that the gun is putting into the marble being lost as the marble hits air faster then the air can move out of the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen studies for this, and in order for it to be feasible the \u0027end\u0027 of the railgun wpuld need to be in a pressure zone of 100 millibars or less, approximately 10 miles up, or 3x the height of everest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if there was no atmosphere, this would be feasible.
