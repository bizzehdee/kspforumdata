I mean, everything he\u0027s working on right now, even ALCOR and the ERS rover, JSI and RPM, is technically \u0027not done yet\u0027, right? I mean, they\u0027re all in perpetual development because the game itself isn\u0027t capital \u0027F\u0027 \u0022Finished\u0022 yet, this \u0022Version 1.0.4\u0022 b.s. notwithstanding, the game ain\u0027t even CLOSE to being \u0022Finished\u0022! Anyway, all respect to the guy, but I have given up on ever seeing ANY finished product of any kind from this otherwise fantastically talented modder. I suspect that he\u0027s very much like I am: I\u0027m great at making grandiose plans and starting out at a furious pace, but then about halfway through I realize that this project is WAY bigger than I thought, so I kind of stall out and never finish it. Or, because it\u0027s taking so long, I get distracted by some other newer idea and go off to do that, or just get bored, even. Whatever, but you have to acknowledge that all of these projects that are waiting until \u0027something else is finished first, then I\u0027ll get to this one\u0027 will ALWAYS be waiting, because NOTHING gets finished! The thing is, though, is that eventually you have to just grit your teeth and pull the trigger, and put SOMETHING out there, because if you\u0027re waiting for it to be perfectly totally absolutely 100% completely done finished signed sealed and delivered, well, frankly, there just ain\u0027t no such thing! No, it\u0027s not \u0027perfect\u0027, or \u0027finished\u0027, there may still be a few bugs, but we\u0027ll deal with it. \u0027Don\u0027t let the Perfect be the enemy of the Good\u0027, if you will.
