(check out the LCS sinking video for illustration of the low level performance problems)\n\nThe other reason of course is that LP found the same things as I and went with what works best ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RGBPeter","CreatedById":62128,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-24T22:44:28Z","Content":"Christmas is the time of giving...

Something like slow rockets that just actihnging fuel load ates under water and keeping their deep up to target.\n\u003E \n\nHi sadly for BDA and PEW torpedo\u0027s, as evidenced by the NAS torps,  require a pile of code in order to function anything like a real torpedo, \n\nThere are several problems to overcome , if  the torpedo is cfg\u0027d strong enough not to explode when hitting the water it will also act like a battering ram when it hits a target rather than exploding on impact.\n\nThen there\u0027s the buoyancy issue, in an ideal world the torp would be neutrally buoyant, this requires adjustment on the fly, changing fuel load as the torpedo runs means that a torpedo that is neutrally buoyant at launch will become more buoyant as time goes on , \n\nThe real stumbling block is that there is no AI  missile or shell flight path that will natively  guide a torpedo to target, even the flatest Air to Air trajectory has some element of gaining height .   Which would effectively cause the torpedo to cllimb out of the water\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for stock BDA torpedoes is that I\u0027ve tried on several occasions to get something workable but ultimately I run into the issues  outlined above\n\nThanks for your interest and comment ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-06T16:19:25Z","Content":"Hi all just a quick note to let you know that I am creating a new thread for PEW for the 122 release in addon releases.
