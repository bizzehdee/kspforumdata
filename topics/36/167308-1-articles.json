It is called the Vlatic System Mod. It is based off of Nibiru (AKA Planet Nine) and it\u0027s mysteriousness. I am using the examples, but I honestly don\u0027t know where to start making my own planets. The idea is a gas giant in the center, about 80 megameters (80000 km) across. It has 5.6x Kerbin gravity, and is named Vlatic (Has the texture of Bastion). A small star orbits it, with VERY low mass for a star (Tanglo), but Vlatic\u0027s energy keeps it stable and fit for fusion. A small terra\u00A0planet (In this case, Oceanus) fit for life orbits Vlatic, and in no way is it frozen, even in night-time. It is Kerbin temperature (288 Kelvin) all year-round, because Vlatic is there. A small Mars-like planet (In this case, Kopernicus) is orbiting Tanglo, which is binary to Kopernicus. A very VERY hot planet (Rio) orbits Vlatic in a high-orbit. did I mention Vlatic\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E is about the Sun to Eeloo? Tanglo\u0027s mass is broken, though... I kind of need help making my own planets for this... Rio isn\u0027t an example, but very broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-07T18:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a planet pack, not a plugin.
