Is this by design or a bug?\n\nBy default Rotatrons ignore any limits you set until you turn them on via the right-click menu.

Also it doesn\u0027t help that most players create very weak contraptions to lift very heavy objects, which would just not work at all if done in the real world.\n\nYah I know, however having some kind of tweakable value for stiffness would be good since KSP imposes limitations that doesn\u0027t exist in RL. For example a cable system in cranes lets extendable frame to be relatively tiny (considering amounts of material used) and light compared to weights lifted.\n\nMost of the crane mass and volume is in engine, wheels and counterweight. For example 5 ton crane skeleton is able to lift 70t\u002B (using steel cables). Now in KSP we can\u0027t use cables system or to very limited degree (via KAS) so in order to have comparative stiffness when lifting 70t the IR parts themselves have to weight 40-80t depending on how complicated model is and how long the boom extends ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:38:41Z","Content":"So I got to testing IR Rotatrons once more.

From my limited interaction with the system, you have to manually supply the preset settings one part at a time. I was thinking maybe you could have a \u0022Group Preset\u0022 window where you can see all the part presets for a group in one window so you can see which setting on one part corresponds with another (probably in columns: parts names on the left with preset number going across on top).
