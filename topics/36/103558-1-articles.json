{"TopicId":103558,"ForumId":36,"TopicTitle":"[WIP][1.8.x] KabinKraziness (v0.4.7) 9th Feb 2020","CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T21:50:36Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T21:50:36Z","Content":"**Kabin Kraziness**\n\n![T8dHqU5.png](http://i.imgur.com/T8dHqU5.png)\n\n![yZuJ95v.png](http://i.imgur.com/yZuJ95v.png)\n\nA modifier attached to crew-able parts. The KabinKraziness goes up over time based on how much space the crew have, how far from Kerbin you are and if your Cabin temperature is within 5 degrees of the climate control setting. This Mod is an ADD-ON to [AmpYear](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/114991-105-ampyear-power-manager-reserve-power-ion-rcs-v1050-10-nov-2015/) and does not function without it.\n\nThere are two levels of Kraziness Alert - Minor and Major (configurable via AmpYear (required) settings menu on Space center screen).\n\nOnce these levels are reached random events may occur where the crew may:-\n\n- Disable Autopilot functions for a period of time (cumulative).\n- Throw out (dump) some resources.\n- Throw out (dump) some science results.\n- A crew member may decide to randomly go on a space walk... (EVA).\n\n**Luxury Fitted Command Pods**\n\nYes all command pods now come with Klimate Kontrol, Jazz music and Massage chairs.\n\nThese items reduce KabinKraziness, consume electricity and makes missions more pleasant for the crew.\n\nThe Klimate Kontrol function maintains the cabin temperature to a pre-set value, and the cabin temp can be viewed through the command pod right click menu.\n\nIf turned off Cabin Temperature will slowly change towards the outside ambient temperature having a negative effect on KabinKraziness of the Cabin Temperature is \u002B/- 5 degrees from the Klimate Kontrol Pre-set Temperature.\n\nThe Klimate Kontrol, Jazz Music Radio and Massage Chairs reduce KabinKraziness over time at the cost of electric charge.\n\nKabinKraziness will Hibernate at high time warp settings (can\u0027t be avoided due to issues with electric charge in KSP at high rates of warp).\n\n**ChangeLog:**\n\nSpoiler\n\nV0.4.7  \n\n  Re-compile for KSP 1.8.1  \n\nV0.4.6  \n\n  Re-compile for KSP 1.5.x  \n\nV0.4.5  \n\n    Re-Compile for KSP 1.3.0  \n\n    Localization ready.  \n\nV0.4.4  \n\n    Re-Compile for KSP 1.2.2  \n\nV0.4.3 Re-Compile for KSP 1.2.1  \n\nV0.4.2 Re-Compile for KSP 1.2  \n\nV0.4.1  Re-Compile for KSP 1.1.3  \n\nMoved config.cfg file to \\Plugins\\PluginData to avoid Module Manager cache reset.  \n\nRemoved Foreach loops in FixedUpdate (reduce Garbage Collection).  \n\nV0.4.0 RE-factored code to remove need for KKInterfaces.dll and AYInterfaces.dll. Now uses Reflection to communicate between KabinKraziness and AmpYear.    \n\nV0.3.2 Support for KSP 1.0.5  \n\nV0.3.1 Support for KSP 1.0.3  \n\nV0.3 Converted Kevin to Celsius in the temperature displays for command pods.

Moved AmpYear and KabinKraziness to shared folder in /gamedata/REPOSoftTech.  \n\nV0.1 Removed KabinKraziness from AmpYear and made it separate option implementation (hence this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

Yeah probably might have messed up some of the settings while I was testing. But you can change pretty much all of them via the settings menu which allows you to set your own difficulty.

Hmm.. what would the heat radiator due? yes I know - radiate heat .. but now sure I am following how this would interact with this mod itself.\n\nAre you suggesting radiating heat instead of using the KlimateKontrol? I find the KlimateKontrol usually is all about raising the temperature.. rather than lowering it.. because space is soooo cold. But I have been looking for a while for something that can radiate heat from other parts into the cabin, which could bring this into play.

KlimateKontrol doesn\u0027t REDUCE it, but it does reduce the negative effect of being outside the \u002B/- 5 degrees range to ZERO if you have the KlimateKontrol and the temperature is within this range.\n\nThe key difference I have currently:-\n\nKabinKraziness is Applied to the Crewable PART rather than the Kerbals themselves and is expressed as a percentage (iE: It\u0027s an atmosphere within the part/cabin rather than attached to the Kerbals themselves).\n\nKabinKraziness accumulates onto the crewable PARTS based on the above factors over time.\n\nKabinKraziness does not accumulate within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\nWhen the KabinKraziness reaches the initial warning amount then the probability of the Kerbal\u0027s doing something occurs whilst above this warning amount.\n\nThis increases again when you reach the Critical warning amount of KabinKraziness.\n\nWhat do they do:-\n\nWell currently they may dump resources, dump science results, disable the autopilot, one of them might just go on EVA... which is all a bit silly.\n\nBut then KabinKraziness is meant to be silly.\n\nSo Where to from here?
