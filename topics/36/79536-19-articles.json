I started poking at the PQSMods again. I am not quite sure how to handle them, as a handfull seem to be implemented already in 2 or 3 locations, so any dynamic loading system would have to have exceptions built in to ignore them. Things get more complicated when you consider if it\u0027s an update, no-update, or an overwrite system. Because the loading is dynamic, I also don\u0027t see how I could leverage the node extensions that Kopernicus uses, and may instead have to use just stock node functions. It\u0027s kinda a mess...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I will try!

To do this I need to create \u0022planets\u0022 with the same orbital period as the smaller object in the pair at a radious that is wrong. So far this dosen\u0027t seem to work by simply editing a Kopernicus config or by adding a new parameter to change the speed or period of the orbit C# object.
