Artwork on the ET need some cleaning up, but they are not terrible. I will report more as I play with the parts this week.\n\nand photos:\n\n![zilUNt7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zilUNt7.jpg)\n\n![mqBZ3NV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mqBZ3NV.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T22:07:53Z","Content":"EDIT: Okay, I\u0027ve spent a few hours tearing my install apart trying to find out why pieces are missing, ect. I thought it might have been a RAM problem.  \n\nWell, in the log file, I\u0027m getting a lot of errors that say something like: \u0022Cannot compile part/Cannot clone model/Model doesn\u0027t exist\u0022 for every model included in this mod, however somehow it fixes itself as the models show up in-game.  \n\nThe second part to this is that I was missing the SRB nosecone, and couldn\u0027t get it to show up. Turns out in the code, you have: \u0022model = Benjee10/DIRECT\\_LV/Parts/SRB/SRBnoseCone\u0022  \n\nBut the directory given in the download doesn\u0027t include the first \u0022Benjee10\u0022 folder, so the nosecone never shows up because KSP can\u0027t find the folder named \u0022Benjee10.\u0022  \n\nKinda blows because I spent a few hours frantically looking through my install of KSP, thinking there was something I screwed up or it was my computer, ect but in reality it was an \u0022oopsie\u0022 in the config file.  \n\nOther than that, I\u0027m having major issues getting a launch vehicle for a shuttle working. Not sure if it\u0027s a collision mesh issue or not but the physics upon loading up the launch pad are very strange, and it blows up immediately on throttling up. I\u0027ve been using a stock shuttle strapped to the orange ET tanks and using two 5-segment SRB\u0027s from this mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T01:31:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-**"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T12:08:46Z","Content":"Ah, sorry about that! Forgot I\u0027d changed the directory in the middle of development, must have forgotten to change the .cfg for the nosecone.   \n\nI think 1.0.5 changed how part colliders work a little so I\u0027ll look into the exploding thing.

The large rocket parts look brilliant but personally I\u0027m getting grabby hands for that pod, it looks properly awesome! I\u0027m a massive fan of the Taurus HCV pod because a) it\u0027s huge and b) it\u0027s got lovely big windows and a great IVA - and from what I can tell your Fortuna pod very much fits that mold, except it\u0027s a 3.75m-2.5m pod instead of a 3.75m-1.25m pod like the Taurus is. Would be absolutely perfect to fill a niche for me! If I may ask, is it planned that the first release of the pod itself will include an IVA or will that come in a subsequent update?  \n\nThis mod as a whole looks fantastic, can\u0027t wait to see more and to get said grabby hands of mine on it! :D"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T20:19:47Z","Content":"Found out the fairing config file has that extra \u0022Benjee10\u0022 folder in the directory path as well.   \n\nOther than that, everything looks good.

Made some changes which should fix most issues and switched to using PorkJet\u0027s SSME model for the RS-25 engines (original Vector engine is still in place)  \n\nAlso made an External Tank part which makes balancing shuttles a whole lot easier since the CoM doesn\u0027t shift during flight:  \n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Nh7Giwg.png[/img]  \n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/igJ1Gk7.png[/img]  \n\nI\u0027ve bundled the Shuttle craft file with the release.

For most parts that\u0027ll just mean tweaking some textures here and there and tightening them up, whereas for others (looking at you SRBs) I\u0027ll be doing a complete remodel (keeping nodes and everything in the same place).\n- IVAs for credible parts.\n- **Give *Fortuna* Command/Service Module a separate release.** This pod doesn\u0027t really fit with my vision of the mod anymore but I\u0027ll be doing it up and releasing it on it\u0027s own.\n- Finish original DIRECT plans. That means adding the massive fuel tanks for the Jupiter III and a couple of structural adapters.\n- **Spacecraft parts**, starting with a 3.75m Porkjet style **Orion** and accompanying **Altair** lander.\n- Heavy Duna lander parts. Something that can be used to ferry either crew or cargo and offload it.\n- Heavy habitat parts (think modern Skylab, centrifuges etc.).\n- Various Shuttle-derivative parts, e.g. allowing building Shuttle-C."}]}
