One of those big engines burns a significant amount of fuel just to keep turning, and the spinning prop or the hot exhaust of the jet engine is dangerous on the ground.\n\nBut how often do our Kerbals need to worry about that? Jebediah laughs in the face of danger.\n\n(Yes, Jebediah is a looney.)\n\nI decided that something like this might be very useful for somebody using an aeroplane to explore Kerbin and collect Science, so I built it. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to build an air intake into the config and make it work, and I decided to use the same model as the stock fuel cell. So somewhere on your vehicle \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC I\u0027ve been testing it on a rover, running around the KSC area and picking up some Science \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC you need an air intake and a fuel tank.\n\nFor my test rover I used a short Oscar tank, 0.625m diameter, with an intake from Modular Rocket Systems. It now has a couple of APUs on the sides of the tank, the air intake on one end, and a KIS connector to allow the rover to be refuelled in the field. It doesn\u0027t look bad as a sub-assembly.\n\nThis is the test-file. Let me know if you figure out how to build the Intake functions into this. You don\u0027t need anything else since it is using the Stock fuel cell model and textures. It may use rather a lot of air, and I am not sure of the balance between fuel in and electricity out, but it didn\u0027t seem wildly wrong.\n\nYou just need this part.cfg\n\nI put it in GameData/WolfBaginski/Parts/AuxiliaryPowerUnit/ which helps make it clear.\n\n    PART{// Kerbal Space Program - Part Config// --- general parameters ---name = Auxiliary Power Unitmodule = Partauthor = WolfBaginski// --- asset parameters ---// Uses Fuel Cell model.MODEL    {    model = Squad/Parts/Resources/FuelCell/FuelCell    }rescaleFactor = 1// --- node definitions ---node_attach = .06, 0, .03, 1, 0, 0, 0// --- editor parameters ---TechRequired = basicScienceentryCost = 1000cost = 250category = Utilitysubcategory = 0title = Auxiliary Power Unitmanufacturer = Beartech Aerospacedescription = This is a small generator driven by a tiny engine which provides a small electricity supply by burning fuel and air.

Having two in a subassembly had a better feel. I could run one APU while driving around, and switch on the second for when I was doing Science and transmitting data.\n\nThe Corbus capsule pack has an RCS tank which uses a similar piece of code to convert monopropellant to electricity. Revert to that and you have something which doesn\u0027t need an air supply.\n\nThe advantage of operating in vacuum is that you don\u0027t hear the scream of the turbine.\n\nI SAID, THE ADVANTAGE OF OPERATING IN VACUUM..."}]}
