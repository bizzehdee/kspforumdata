No real weight limit but they\u0027re scarcely able to outrun continental drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium capacity, Medium speed, suspended. Think M4 Sherman or Panzer IV tracks.

Tracks off a modern MBT(M1A2 Abrams, Leo2A6, Challenger II, JGSDF Type 10, Russian T-90, etc). 60 ton weight limit, blisteringly fast. Overpowered cheat part that people can use for screwing around and making tank replicas. Also, I suppose, if you want your kethane refinery to get a speeding ticket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeather-duty, Suspended: Think the sort of thing you\u0027d put on a racing quadbike-turned-tracked-vehicle.
