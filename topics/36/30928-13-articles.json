I know I haven\u0027t been around in forever, but things haven\u0027t exactly been favorable so I haven\u0027t had any motivation for modding or playing. I will try and get round at some point to adding the Atlas V into the R \u002B D system and updating any necessary things (I haven\u0027t played with the new science stuff yet so I will have to try it out first).

One concern though is the tri count. I was told not to go over 10k tris when making my Atlas V, and the whole system is probably around 5k. By comparison that Delta IV model you uploaded to sketchfab is 96k! I don\u0027t know how it will run in game now that things are updated, but I was told not to go too high because of the performance hit. Hopefully it shouldn\u0027t be too bad as I want to try this bad boy out!
