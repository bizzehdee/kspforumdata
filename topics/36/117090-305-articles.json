That\u0027s fantastic! Thank you so much!  I might have a idea to make it behave with stock aero, I imagine the drag cube is calculated around part colider? If yes, it probably only see the base, so increasing the angularDrag and maximum\\_drag might do it. If not, I will try make a part with the heat shield included, that or a base plate. Since I now I feel guilty of wasting your time, let me do these test myself to redeem myself!\n\u003E \n\nI think the drag/CoP situation is caused by a few things. \n\n- The drag cubes are updated to represent the deployed state; the \u0027drag\u0027 value in the debug menus will confirm it (cannot confirm if it is -correct-, only that it changes).  Drag cubes calculate from visible meshes (as well as colliders? might only be visible meshes....).\n- The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the petal-adapter itself does not change as the panels are deployed\n- The CoP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is located at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E regardless of deployment (really not even sure how I would calculate this, and I would -think- that the drag-cube would be responsible for the CoP calculation)\n- Calculating proper \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and/or CoP positions could possibly be done.  \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E I\u0027m fairly certain I can figure out, CoP... no clue where to even begin on that one.  Possibly just setting it to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E would be sufficient.\n\nNot really sure how to solve it, or even if it should be solved.  Use of the petal adapter as airbrakes is really...so far from a standard use case as to probably not warrant consideration; it was never intended to be deployed while moving through atmosphere, let alone used as a drag system.  I just couldn\u0027t resist when I saw how they deployed... it seemed like the perfect airdrop system.\n\nDon\u0027t feel bad though; working on these has been on the todo list for at least a few weeks now, but just now getting around to it as most of the PBR-related chaos has died down a bit.\n\nThe real painful bit in all of this is there are some.... issues... with some collider generation code that went uncaught until now.  The actual work needed for the petal-adapter retract function is nearly done (small bit of UI/consistency cleanup), but the collider problems still have a ways to go.  It requires digging into my procedural mesh generation code, which isn\u0027t so much a mess as it is some sort of arcane scripting; it works, and it is very well organized, but it always takes me a week to wrap my head around it all before I can make much progress with it.

There is no wind on the moon, but there is on Mars. The model I am working on have a metallic textile covering the top, I used that to hide the junction with the real ground surface on one side. The other side have its ground junction hided by a large deck, that also make sense as dust is bad for airlocks. I suspect that any medium to large scale installation will not come in \u0022IKEA\u0022 kit but  will be made using generic material. So I tried to give hab entrance a little makeshift taste.

Ie: to make similar parts for different uses you might imagine?\n\u003E \n\nSadly, not really.  The petal-adapter code is specific to only those two parts, and was only ever intended to have very specific and basic functionality.  I can\u0027t see any uses for it elsewhere.  The \u0027cargo bay\u0027 parts will all be using pre-compiled models and animations.\n\nI did finally track down that collider generation issue last night.  After that was fixed up most other bits seemed to be cooperating acceptably.  Still have a couple minor UI/usability problems to clean up, but I would anticipate that I can have it cleaned back up later this evening.\n\nAlso realized why it wasn\u0027t working as an airbrake -- because it was \u0027stack-occluded\u0027 (all of its stack nodes were occupied), which causes KSPs drag simulation to apply only very minor \u0027skin drag\u0027.  The exposed stuff from inside the fairing was producing far more drag than the giant seemingly-made-for-drag deployed fairing.  Not sure there is much/anything I can do about that, nor do I think I\u0027m going to spend much time on it.  The part -works- for its intended function (and many un-intended ones)... not going to hurt my feelings if it can\u0027t be used for absolutely everything.\n\n[@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) -- Yes, regolith covered bases are completely doable, probably 90% like you would be desiring/expecting.  Including \u0027growing\u0027 of the regolith over the top of the parts, and proper collisions for your mound of dirt.  Land your base, break out the bulldozer (abstracted a bit, of course), and watch the dirt pile up.  A simple subdivided planar mesh could be easily deformed to form the regolith pile; the texture could be borrowed from the surrounding terrain (either use the same material, or literally \u0027project\u0027 the terrain texture onto the regolith mesh seamlessly).  The \u0027base\u0027 part could be examined for its bounds/render extents to determine how much to deform the regolith mesh, and where to keep it open for the \u0027door\u0027.\n\nHowever it is not something that I\u0027m going to have time to work on, certainly not anytime soon.  Unless someone else offers to pick up modeling/texturing work for SSTU, my time is pretty much spoken for at least for the next year (and probably 2-3 with all of the random requests I deal with)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T15:58:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There are 3d printing ideas to stabilize dust as well.\n\u003E \n\nThinking about it.

Solar panels are **not** scaled with the core, so at very small core sizes, not all solar panels will fit.\n    - If fuel cell or RTGs are desired it would require a completely separate part(s) due to limitations in the stock modules.\n- Integrated switchable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, with vertical-position control.\n    - Several \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E block types will be available, including \u0027none\u0027 as a valid option.

There are certainly a few ideas that I\u0027ve never had time to explore properly, and a few long-standing problems that I would love to clean up (a few in each of my mods even...); but that could only go on for so long / only so many things to cleanup and fix.\n\nI\u0027m just a bit burned out after the MFT-LV fuel tanks (lots of modeling work), and then the big PBR-texture conversion (so very much texturing work).  Was not only a ton of work... but was mostly boring, repetitive,... work.  Need a break for a bit after that, though I am still working on cleaning up some of the missing/unfinished stuff as best I can.\n\n^^^ Is why I\u0027ve been tackling some of the more complicated plugin side stuff this week.  Needed to do something more engaging and with more material returns for the time invested.\n\nI do plan on doing more modeling (and texturing) work in the near future as there are still a few part concepts that need to be developed.  I pretty sure next up will be some accessories for the new MFT-LV tanks (landing legs, service/cargo bay), with possibly a refresh of the LC-POD parts coming shortly after that."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-29T01:52:49Z","Content":"The holidays are coming up.

Even some of the stock-pbr-converted parts aren\u0027t too bad. (also been finding and squashing quite a few minor visual and balance bugs... so bonus\u0027 for you all as well)"}]}
