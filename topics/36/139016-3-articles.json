I\u0027ve been playing with that installed. The problem seems to usually be achieving 100% efficiency. Even with, say, food generation at the base, the efficiency that comes from growing things or converting waste and water waste back to something usable isn\u0027t 100%, meaning eventually, things run out. In USI for example, supplies turn to mulch, which is useful for hydroponics and such... but it\u0027s only 50% efficient, unless I have fertilizer... in which case it\u0027s far more efficient, but still not 100% - and fertilizer isn\u0027t available as something that can be produced planetside. It has to be shipped from Kerbin... which isn\u0027t self-sufficient. It\u0027s only with mining a source of water/etc to help the crops can I supplement fertilizer and produce enough of a third resource to offset consumption and achieve efficiency at very high cost - which is fine, as long as it\u0027s possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was generally pointing at whether or not such a thing would be possible with TAC LS - that is, with the usage of USI Kolonization for example, and with Planetary Base Systems, is 100% efficiency doable, given money being no object (which it will be in my career, but hypothetical). Just knowing it\u0027s possible with USI LS is the only reason I use that...

I\u0027ve been playing with that installed. The problem seems to usually be achieving 100% efficiency. Even with, say, food generation at the base, the efficiency that comes from growing things or converting waste and water waste back to something usable isn\u0027t 100%, meaning eventually, things run out. In USI for example, supplies turn to mulch, which is useful for hydroponics and such... but it\u0027s only 50% efficient, unless I have fertilizer... in which case it\u0027s far more efficient, but still not 100% - and fertilizer isn\u0027t available as something that can be produced planetside. It has to be shipped from Kerbin... which isn\u0027t self-sufficient. It\u0027s only with mining a source of water/etc to help the crops can I supplement fertilizer and produce enough of a third resource to offset consumption and achieve efficiency at very high cost - which is fine, as long as it\u0027s possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was generally pointing at whether or not such a thing would be possible with TAC LS - that is, with the usage of USI Kolonization for example, and with Planetary Base Systems, is 100% efficiency doable, given money being no object (which it will be in my career, but hypothetical). Just knowing it\u0027s possible with USI LS is the only reason I use that...

The info window doesn\u0027t update correctly, but it appears that its not really relevant as the contents of the craft take precedence. I launched a small craft with solar panels and a year\u0027s supply of consumables and then fast forwarded until the EC monitor had shown -1 day... plenty of time to kill a kerbal, but jeb was alive and kicking just fine, so at least it seems to be an issue with the info window and not the underlying process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valkyria90","CreatedById":81931,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T21:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222573643\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139016\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462910891\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281931\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Valkyria90\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Valkyria90 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy to see this mod active again \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m trying it out now, and I have an issue that the Life Support Monitoring window is empty, even when I have kerbals on board, and they seem to not consume any resources while on board the vessle.
