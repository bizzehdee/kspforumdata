Now, I\u0027m not saying that there should be an actual satellite feed window, or anything of the sort, but in the background you could run a similar simulation to that which unlocks portions of the map in ScanSat. You could include a module that lets players \u0022begin exploration\u0022 and with that, in a ScanSat fashion, a background function would keep track of what areas have been visited by the rover since that module was activated.

Let\u0027s say, you activate it at coordinates 4879, 4335. For simplicity, it reads it as 4880 and 4340. It logs \u00224880, 4340\u0022 as visited, and keeps track of coordinate change. If the new coordinates turn out to be closest to 4880, 4350 out of those divisible by 10, then it also marks that as visited. While the coordinates are closest to a \u0022visited\u0022 point, it doesn\u0027t expand the list of visited coordinates. Once x number of coordinates are marked as visited, it completes mission. ScanSat is much more complex than this, and I think it might take more effort to get relevant information out of it, than to just keep track of visited area in this fashion. Of course this isn\u0027t absolutely precise like this, but it does give leeway for exploration in whatever way the player wants to explore. Plus, this could let the mission do more frequent sub-completion notices (even without rewards), so the player doesn\u0027t need to drive 5 minutes to be told that now they are half way there and may turn around, on a longer haul.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusSam","CreatedById":116426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T00:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll help in the dev if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t modded for Kerbal yet, but I\u0027m a good 3d programmer (fractals, procedural planets, physics engines...) and I\u0027m used to modding games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo contact me if you need a little help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T01:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also love contracts that rely on previous contracts.
