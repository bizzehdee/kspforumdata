In addition to that I have included some converters for intake air to oxidizer. So you can fuel up your oxygen tanks in mid air if you have installed some air intakes on your ship. This needs some electricity. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is V 0.2 and attachment nodes are configured for KSP 0.23.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe girder system includes: 1x Girder, 3x Girder, Octo, Cross-Girder-Joint, L-Girder-Joint, T-Girder-Joint all in 0.5m, 0.75m, 1m, 1.5m, 2m, 2.5m, 3m and 5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air converters are: 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m and 5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruss System parts in 5 sizes: 4x Truss, Cross-Truss, L-Truss and T-Truss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETank Connectors: 0.625m, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m and 5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdates in V 0.2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- added Truss System parts in six sizes, 4x Truss, Cross-Truss, L-Truss and T-Truss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- added Tank Connectors for in 0.625m, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m and 5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- added Girder Sytem Parts in 5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- updated mass, cost, breaking forces and crash resistant parameters for all parts \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am locking for someone to give the oxygen converters an nicer look, because I am not so good with unity.

Why not do something like this? The thin truss could also be scaled (in cfg) to make short thin sections.
