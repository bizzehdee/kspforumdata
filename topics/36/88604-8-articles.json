I have included notes on those panels to denote that they will be removed in the future (pics below..). I am fairly happy with the other panels, but of course I\u0027m open to suggestions. I would like to hear what you think needs to be tweaked. I would like to replace the panels marked for removal with something that faces the kerbals more directly (those old panels just are not very useful at those angles).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are the photos showing the panels that I want to remove later (the notes will be in the release):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kIbTKdR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kIbTKdR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CwcGyJ8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CwcGyJ8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn a side note, the only thing I have left to do is CKAN integration. I have not dealt with CKAN before so I need to read up on it first, but I will probably have the update ready sometime tonight..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T07:29:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yarbrough08\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
