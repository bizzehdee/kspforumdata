I have been filling the DT tanks with Tritium using the slider. I realised this last night when I finally unlocked the antimatter containers. Plan to launch some to my station sci lab so it can start producing, but when I looked in the VAB I was able to fill containers with antimatter using the slider.

Contracts give loads of easy money so since about 2/3rds the way through the stock techs I\u0027ve had \u0026gt;3m cash at all times and right now have something like 12million so cost is not going to stop me filling up on Tritium unless its 1m / unit or something. I think if you make those breeding changes, it will be even harder to figure out what a craft needs to launch with without accurate info in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that the same for antimatter? I was under the impression that you had to collect or use a sci lab because it was simply unavailiable in VAB, but if I can buy it then why bother with the hassle of collection... :-) I may anyway since I\u0027ve set up much of the infrastructure already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the solar power satelite stuff, what I want is to get 2.5GW received power anywhere for the vista so they\u0027re not going to help given I would need 25 at least, probably more like 30\u002B given losses etc. Not a practical solution now we can\u0027t get very near the sun. More realistic I guess though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
