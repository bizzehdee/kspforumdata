It was one of the last things Fractal_UK implemented before he went away, and I\u0027m not quite sure exactly how he made them to work.\u003Cp\u003EA *REALISTIC* implementation would basically use ChargedParticles as the only propellant. That is, it would (SLOWLY) convert Uranium into propulsion, at an ISP of over 50,000 seconds! However, the Thrust for this would be DEATHLY low- as in, on the order of magnitude of Solar Sails. So, I\u0027m not quite sure how Fractal_UK *ACTUALLY* made these to work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only runs off of charged particles because that\u0027s the only form of power you can use to heat your propellant directly. The rest of the output comes in the form of neutrons which heat the solid portions of the reactor, thus the temperature you can heat your propellant to is limited by their failure point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Magnetic nozzles have always been a little strange in this mod, ever since their implementation. I think, in their most ideal sense, they\u0027re the answer to everyone asking about fission fragment rockets (which, at the expense of producing practically no thrust at all, could conceivably have Isps as high as 1.5 million seconds). In practice, though, they\u0027d suffer the same exact problems as other realistically-low-thrust engines in KSP if they were proper fission fragment rockets: no one wants to sit around and wait for a 30-newton thruster to change the orbit on their 50-ton ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Solar sails have partly addressed this problem by allowing your ship to experience forces while on rails (during timewarp), but there are problems with doing this for regular engines. Fractal seems to have done it by using liquidfuel to \u0027gear down\u0027 the engine - adding extra mass to the reaction, so the exhaust velocity drops and the thrust increases. The exact mechanics of how this works for the charged particles released by various reactions (ie fission vs. fusion) are a little dubious, but it\u0027s ostensibly valid physics, and suffers only from the fact that the \u0026lt;1 charged particle ratio of reactors means that the thrust power when using these engines is limited. I think they might see more usefulness if the \u0027gearing\u0027 were variable like on the DT Vista - keep the power consumption constant, and make lower throttle equal higher Isp and lower thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The other main problem with magnetic nozzles as implemented in KSPI, of course, is that they don\u0027t work on antimatter reactors. Ever since the thermal nozzle nerf (in which Fractal apparently decided that thermal nozzles are thermal nozzles only, and we can\u0027t pretend they\u0027re plasma-core rockets or other such things), antimatter propulsion has been all but useless- there\u0027s no way to get a decent Isp out of it, and thanks to some recent bugs, you can\u0027t even really get decent thrust out of it either (most of the power just vanishes into thin air). Antimatter reactors seem like they would be the best niche for magnetic nozzles - the huge power output means you can enjoy respectable thrust along with your very high Isp - but, for whatever reason, Fractal decided that antimatter won\u0027t work with magnetic nozzles, because apparently antimatter reactions don\u0027t produce charged particles that can be deflected with a magnetic field. Indeed, the antimatter reactors in the game don\u0027t produce charged particles, so on some level, it makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Except it doesn\u0027t, because \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#ambeam\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eantimatter reactions \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E produce charged particles\u003C/a\u003E. The charged pions emitted from the reaction are short-lived and quickly decay into gamma rays, but not so quickly that redirecting them with powerful magnetic fields and gaining incredibly powerful propulsion at pretty good efficiencies isn\u0027t possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course, if we\u0027re talking about direct-annihilation beam-core antimatter propulsion, we\u0027ll run into two main problems: one, the thrust will still be absolutely microscopic for the power levels in question ((405 GW / 100 Mm/s * 2)*60% eff =~ 1.2 kN, which is higher than a fission-fragment but still not a lot when you\u0027re pushing a giant reactor around), and two, you\u0027ll need prohibitive quantities of antimatter and no meaningful quantities of anything else, since your propellant is equal parts matter and antimatter - that\u0027s going to kill your mass ratio. Plus, your Isp is going to be so ludicrous as to be unbalanced. 10 million seconds? KSP doesn\u0027t have interstellar flight just yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The obvious answer to both of these issues is the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#amplasma\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplasma-core antimatter engine\u003C/a\u003E.

They probably need a significant nerf to account for the fact that you aren\u0027t going to get more than about 80% total efficiency out of that kind of engine, but they\u0027re at least not pulling power out of thin air. I would definitely still say that the thermal jets are in no way in need of a buff, though - they now have quite significant TWRs with small engines and are pushing the limits of theoretical efficiency, so increasing their power would benefit neither realism nor game balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I want to change that.

Well, collecting antimatter in the mod\u0027s current state is pretty much pointless, because there\u0027s no nice powerful propulsion system to use with it ever since Fractal nerfed thermal rockets. Just for gameplay reasons, a high-thrust high-ISP antimatter propulsion system would be great to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for numbers, I can probably help a little more with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Rho\u0027s page on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunexotic.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExotic Weapons\u003C/a\u003E has a bit about the kinds of things antimatter gets up to during annihilation. Based on what I found there, it looks like approximately 55% of the energy from an antimatter reaction will show up as charged pions, while the rest is going to end up as gamma rays (which, for the sake of simplicity, I think the mod refers to as thermal power). Of course, there are other small details to consider as well - mainly, you\u0027re not going to thermalize all the gamma rays. What that means is that, say, the 405-gigawatt antimatter reactor, in order to produce 405 gigawatts of extractable power, might have to annihilate considerably more than 405 gigawatts\u0027 worth of antimatter. The gammas, particularly those formed as a result of neutral pion decay, probably are going to be tricky to trap. Project Rho seems to be of the impression that about 1/3 of the energy of the reaction will be from neutral pions, so if we assume that half the neutral pions and their subsequent decay-product gamma rays escape the reactor without providing useful heat, that means that only ~66% of the antimatter energy is captured. Furthermore, if we assume that all of the charged pions are captured, that means that our charged particle ratio relative to the total power is going to be something like 0.55/0.66, or about 83%. Assuming that from that point on, the charged pions are expelled from the magnetic nozzle with near-perfect efficiency (an assumption that the mod apparently does make for the other kinds of charged particles), then we\u0027ll see quite handsome engine performance (in the neighborhood of 320 gigawatts, if you make the same assumptions I did.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, antimatter reactor consumption is a little strange. If we assume that the speed of light c is the same in KSP as it is for our universe, the 15 milligrams/second draw of the 405 GW reactor comes out to E=2*0.000015*299792458^2 or about 2.7 terawatts. That\u0027s a rather low efficiency, about 15%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that\u0027s forgetting one small detail: For the Alcubierre drives contained in the mod, the speed of light for the itty-bitty kerbal universe is assumed to be 1/10 of the one in our universe. Originally, this was just to keep the drives from being unreasonably fast relative to the system, but it also has the implication of reduced energy/mass equivalence. Using c*0.1 for our antimatter yield gives us E=2*0.000015*29979245.8^2, or only about 27 gigawatts! In short, that antimatter reactor is getting a lot of power out of nowhere if you assume that the speed of light is consistent between the antimatter reactors and the Alcubierre drives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find the antimatter draw that would really be required for a 405 gigawatt reactor assuming the above 66% total efficiency, we could use M = E/2*c^2, so M = (405 GW/0.66 eff) / (2*29979245.8^2) = 0.000341 kg/s or 341 milligrams per second. It\u0027s a little high, but I think it\u0027s reasonable - if it\u0027s really an issue of game balance, the capacity of the antimatter containers could always be bumped up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this physics is making me hungry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Addendum-- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just remembered - the differing value for c would also drastically affect the yield of fission and fusion reactions, because the energy released is due to the change in mass defect of the nuclei. Since it would probably wreck everything to try and fix all the reactors to account for this, it might make more sense to keep antimatter yield calculations using normal real-world c (in which case the antimatter draw to produce 405 gigawatts at 66% efficiency would drop to 0.0000034 kg/s or 3.4 milligrams per second).

I suggest you make two different kinds of antimatter reactors - the gas core ones, which produce all of their output as thermalpower (since the charged particles are instantly thermalized) and don\u0027t tweakscale above 3.75 meters or so, and the plasma core ones, which produce most (~80%) of their power as charged particles and don\u0027t scale below 3.75 meters.

This has implications for the performance - with the solid or gas core, you\u0027ll be driving a thermal rocket and see lower Isp (about what current thermal nozzles can manage), while the plasma core will be the one capable of driving the magnetic nozzle and achieving super-high Isps. I suggest you make two different kinds of antimatter reactors - the gas core ones, which produce all of their output as thermalpower (since the charged particles are instantly thermalized) and don\u0027t tweakscale above 3.75 meters or so, and the plasma core ones, which produce most (~80%) of their power as charged particles and don\u0027t scale below 3.75 meters. That way, the super-powerful antimatter engines have to be \u003Cem\u003Ebig\u003C/em\u003E, meaning they\u0027ll be very hard to lift and will use a lot more propellant and fuel to haul around the reactor.

Based on what I found there, it looks like approximately 55% of the energy from an antimatter reaction will show up as charged pions, while the rest is going to end up as gamma rays (which, for the sake of simplicity, I think the mod refers to as thermal power). Of course, there are other small details to consider as well - mainly, you\u0027re not going to thermalize all the gamma rays. What that means is that, say, the 405-gigawatt antimatter reactor, in order to produce 405 gigawatts of extractable power, might have to annihilate considerably more than 405 gigawatts\u0027 worth of antimatter. The gammas, particularly those formed as a result of neutral pion decay, probably are going to be tricky to trap. Project Rho seems to be of the impression that about 1/3 of the energy of the reaction will be from neutral pions, so if we assume that half the neutral pions and their subsequent decay-product gamma rays escape the reactor without providing useful heat, that means that only ~66% of the antimatter energy is captured. Furthermore, if we assume that all of the charged pions are captured, that means that our charged particle ratio relative to the total power is going to be something like 0.55/0.66, or about 83%. Assuming that from that point on, the charged pions are expelled from the magnetic nozzle with near-perfect efficiency (an assumption that the mod apparently does make for the other kinds of charged particles), then we\u0027ll see quite handsome engine performance (in the neighborhood of 320 gigawatts, if you make the same assumptions I did.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, antimatter reactor consumption is a little strange. If we assume that the speed of light c is the same in KSP as it is for our universe, the 15 milligrams/second draw of the 405 GW reactor comes out to E=2*0.000015*299792458^2 or about 2.7 terawatts. That\u0027s a rather low efficiency, about 15%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that\u0027s forgetting one small detail: For the Alcubierre drives contained in the mod, the speed of light for the itty-bitty kerbal universe is assumed to be 1/10 of the one in our universe. Originally, this was just to keep the drives from being unreasonably fast relative to the system, but it also has the implication of reduced energy/mass equivalence. Using c*0.1 for our antimatter yield gives us E=2*0.000015*29979245.8^2, or only about 27 gigawatts! In short, that antimatter reactor is getting a lot of power out of nowhere if you assume that the speed of light is consistent between the antimatter reactors and the Alcubierre drives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find the antimatter draw that would really be required for a 405 gigawatt reactor assuming the above 66% total efficiency, we could use M = E/2*c^2, so M = (405 GW/0.66 eff) / (2*29979245.8^2) = 0.000341 kg/s or 341 milligrams per second. It\u0027s a little high, but I think it\u0027s reasonable - if it\u0027s really an issue of game balance, the capacity of the antimatter containers could always be bumped up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I a bit confused about the numbers.

For a drive using a 405-gigawatt reactor (assuming 80% charged particles), I\u0027d probably cut the Isp slightly to about 42000 seconds (after all, we\u0027re probably not trying to make actual torchships here the way I was), which would then give us a very reasonable maximum thrust of roughly 1500 kN. It would be like running a much stronger DT Vista, which I think should be the goal.

Allthough Thermal Jet Engines attached to Particle Reactor are very powerfull in the lower athmosphere, the low performace in high athmosphere, makes getting into sub orbit without a steep climb very difficult. Getting anywhere further than low ortbit and the dead weight of the unused nuclear reactor becomes counter productive. This effectivly limits the (unupgraded) Thermal Jet Engine to atmospheric/suborbital exploration only. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the main problem is that the reactors can only be connected to either a thermal thruster or thermal jet engine, not both at the same time. That\u0027s because the heat from the reactor needs to be efficiently transported to the thermal thruster or thermal jet engine. For most reactors this makes a lot of sense, except for Molten Salt Reactors, which thermal heat (in the form of molten salt) could in theory be transfered further. My Idea is to allow Molten Salt reactors to transfer their reactor heat one part further than other reactors. This would allow you to connect a single Molten Salt reactor to both thermal truster and thermal jet engines at the same time. Another advantage it it would allow you to put the heavy Salt core reactor in a more central location of the vessal, which should be very usefull for any airplaine. This will give the Molten Salt reactors, which are significantly less powerfull compaired to the Particle Reactor, an edge when building SSTO as they allow less dead weight to be carried around and located at a more convenant location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis valuable feature should be easily implemented by slightly changing the method in how the thermal thruster/jet searches/thermal generator finds a thermal source, I allow it to look 1 part futher.
