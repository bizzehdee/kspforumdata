Normally this is just a cosmetic annoyance, but if one is trying to balance RCS thrusters with the aforementioned RCS BA, it\u0027s impossible to do, you\u0027ll ALWAYS get some kind of torque because of the misalignment. On your pod, that is, and many others as well. But, on the stock Mk1-2 pod, one CAN place an item at 0 or 180 degrees, and it will stay aligned just fine, making 3 or 4 or 6 way symmetry for RCS thrusters a snap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that the hatch of the K0110 (I think that\u0027s the designation, sorry if I\u0027m wrong) is at zero degrees, right on \u0027top\u0027 of the pod, that\u0027s one of the many things I like. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking if it\u0027s at all possible to make it so that RCS blocs or antennae or whatnot could be affixed at 45 degrees, as well as maybe 90 and 270 as well (the \u0027sides\u0027, as it were).

In this case, I can rotate the collision mesh so it\u0027s not the edge that\u0027s on the cardinal directions but the poly (so a flat surface).

The check-if-we-should-fire works by doing a cross product between the part center and the vessel\u0027s CoM. Since they\u0027re in line in the case where the RCS is stack-mounted (or in the root part itself)...you get unpredictable results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(One reason I\u0027ll soon be writing a replacement module)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ledenko","CreatedById":57833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, I\u0027ll pass on RCS for now, if it doesn\u0027t add anything but trouble.
