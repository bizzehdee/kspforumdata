Also, a lot of those are artist conceptions where they may have omitted planned body flaps and stabilizers. Not sure WHERE those body flaps would be unless they are curved and fitted to the bottom of the aeroshell. In fact I think that\u0027s the only way that would work. But there are documents out there that do depict body flaps on the aeroshell landers.
