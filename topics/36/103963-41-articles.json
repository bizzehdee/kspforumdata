I had an Idea. Is it possible to have a settings menu for in atmosphere viewing, and a completely separate settings menu for outer atmosphere viewing? Then an automatic transmission between the two during ascent? It\u0027s a simple suggestion that I\u0027m sure has monumental coding mountains to overcome. But the idea would be to tailor what it looks like when you are flying through a planet verses passing over one. I have not been able to find a happy medium between the two. Scatterer makes in atmosphere look breathtaking. But as soon as I enter orbit. It looks like a ball of blue soup. I am sure some of this is my own ignorance in not being able to find a happy medium in the settings menu. I will keep playing with it. And please don\u0027t take anything I just said as negative. Scatterer is freaking amazing! And KSP will never be the same again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T14:55:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vandest","CreatedById":122250,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:04:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m at 50 mods and counting, with scatterer ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117224-Windows-64-bit-community-workaround](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117224-Windows-64-bit-community-workaround)\n\nThank you V8jester, now i run with KSP 64 and I have no memory issue.

I\u0027m not sure I even see a specific answer to that one. I accept I could be 100% wrong. And I know a lot if people have been asking repeat questions.
