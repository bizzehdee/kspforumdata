I\u0027ve been playing with the rover pads and the only thing I see is the icons in the VAB parts list are very small. The ten meter one is just a dot. I\u0027m not sure what causes this but I\u0027ve seen it in other mods too - may be a stock bug? Other than that had some fun spawning things way above the ground and inside other objects (in addition to normal spawns) and every thing worked as expected.\n\u003E A suggestion. Have the spawn point a tweakable. (I\u0027m thinking this probably requires a plugin but thought I\u0027d throw it out there).\n\nNo problem, was a bit distracted myself lately ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) New vessels spawn at point 0,0,0 of the model. The collider-part is just offset in one direction (plus height). The icons in the VAB shows the entire model.\n\nI\u0027d like to make the spawnpoint tweakable but haven\u0027t figured out a way to do so. Ideas/suggestions/contributions/etc are highly appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I had looked at the recycler at one point and was unable to figure it out. I had imported the mu file into blender and noticed it had what looked like a collision box to trigger the recycle - I got the idea somewhere that the collision box had a special layer (could easily be wrong) but still couldn\u0027t get it to work and I can\u0027t remember where I got that idea.\n\nTried that too with the .mu importer for blender but no working result ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I dont know if it\u0027s possible, but having the orbital space dock support crew transfer (either via stock or [CLS)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122126) would be great.\n\nIt is actually possible to transfer crew to a new vessel after the build is finalized but before it\u0027s released; Or did you mean something else?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E where do i put the customization config files?\n\nAnywhere inside your GameData folder should be fine. If that doesn\u0027t work, try to put it in the KeridianDynamics folder.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E FINALLY!!!\n\u003E I\u0027ve been looking ages for a simplified EPL mod. Thank you so very much. \u002BRep.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: What parts can I delete from the original EPL folder?\n\nYou\u0027re welcome and I\u0027m glad you like it! \n\nAbsolute minimum to keep is the Plugins folder, Resources folder and the EL\\_MM.cfg file. The Textures folder should also be kept since it contains the icon for the toolbar and nothing else (EL 5.2.2 \u0026 5.2.90)."},{"CreatedByName":"TheAnswerIsIsaacNewton","CreatedById":147772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T02:24:59Z","Content":"A bit late responding, but...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![quote_icon.png](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/misc/quote_icon.png) Originally Posted by **TheAnswerIsIsaacNewton** [![viewpost-right.png](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/buttons/viewpost-right.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php?p=2192326#post2192326) \n\u003E \n\u003E  I dont know if it\u0027s possible, but having the orbital space dock support crew transfer (either via stock or [CLS)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122126) would be great.\n\u003E \n\u003E It is actually possible to transfer crew to a new vessel after the build is finalized but before it\u0027s released; Or did you mean something else?\n\nHrm..I always get a \u0027Joe Kerbal cannot reach $module\u0027 message.\n\nI\u0027m using a personal mod that uses the mode from the [Stock-alike Station Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814) radial attachment node with the orbital space dock\u0027s functionality (build a station in orbit!).

In the VAB or SPH, you\u0027d construct, say, a hut made of metal plates with a probe core or command pod, then attach the concrete foundation like a launchclamp to the bottom. When built using EPL (using survey stakes most likely), the slab would anchor the hut permanently to the ground, precisely level. It could either be available in a number or sizes, or with some kind of Tweakscale functionality.\n\nIt would be perfect for anchoring the recycler to the ground, for instance. The only way to shift them afterwards might be demolition. And any opportunity to use demolition in KSP can only be a good thing.  \n\nI\u0027m not sure how launchclamp functionality works, but you could add nodes to it, which might not be affected by it, only the connection via surface attachment.  \n\nThis mod would work very well with it:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128954-the-cube-transformable-blocks-designed-to-fit-your-structural-needs-super-sexy-edition/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt could spark interest in parts designed for static us - large command station, research and comms pods with IVAs, KAS pipes designed to pass underground (only the connectors at each end would be visible, ideal for fastening to the concrete slabs), and associated damage mods like Kerbal Krash System, which allows such installations to get rather battered looking without disappearing with a puff or boom.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T17:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**\n  \nAdded The Cube link"}]}
