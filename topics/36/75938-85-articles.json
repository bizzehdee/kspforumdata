I know alot of that has to do with the fact that the CoM is low on the tracks and what I\u0027m building is not, but even in lo-fi\u0027s video we see some pretty extreme tipping when he starts and stops (especially after the trailer is hooked up). I figure that while I can\u0027t remove the possibility of tipping, I should be able to adjust the settings on the tracks to limit it to some degree. I\u0027ve got a base on Duna that will knock itself over simply by accelerating from 0.0-0.2m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kenobi McCormick","CreatedById":57254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T03:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight, but you don\u0027t see a T-34 flipping itself over because it starts or stops moving.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, you do.

Even if the CM is low, if the vehicle\u0027s too lightweight for its engine, the torque caused by a sudden acceleration can cause the vehicle to pop a wheelie (no matter what kind of suspension it has).
