I feel like this might be a good place to get my feet wet as i have been mostly been handling code for a good majority of my gaming life. One problem, I dont know CPP or any C related code. That\u0027s not saying i wouldn\u0027t be unwilling to learn it. The mod that i want to personally fork is the Civilian population mod. I have my own opinions on how the mod chooses its balancing in career and I am confident that that is something simple that i can change as i have seen in some part files. on a more important note, i want to add compatibility with Eve, Duna, and Laythe space program by changing the way the code is handled when referring to the parent (starting) body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe First thing i want to do is update the game to work with the current version of ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing i want to do is \u0022revive\u0022? some GUI code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo elaborate ive combed some of his source code and it looks like\u00A0@rabidninjawombat had plans to implement a GUI.\u00A0I feel ashamed by not being sure if he ever did because I started by running the mod in a unsupported version of the game.

The reason is that KSP modding by defenition is hard (especialy UI), as it it hard to figure out what went wrong if you make a mistiake, which is inevitable. Second I would advice to take one step at the time. Instead of one big project, try to approach it as many mini problems, which you solve one at the time. Third. after you feel you have solved a significant number of mini problems, make WIP release, do this regulary as it allows other developers and players to take a look at your progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-17T11:41:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2016 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GGumby","CreatedById":122189,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T17:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the advice\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022117389\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@FreeThinker\u003C/a\u003E! after i figure out whether or not he actually had a working gui, i\u0027m going to begin the wonderful journey again of learning C#.
