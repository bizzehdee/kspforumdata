I am working on this mod KerBalloons which will bring balloons that can be sent up to collect science.  \n\nThere will be special science parts dedicated for this as well as balloon based contracts (hopefully).  \n\nThe balloons will come in various sizes with different lift capabilities allowing simple science balloons or the ability to lift small rockets.\n\n**The Plan**\n\n**v0.1:**\n\nThis release will have 3 balloons; 1 standard balloon, 1 higher altitude balloon and 1 heavier payload balloon. In this release all 3 balloons will be 0.625m size and will be designed for use in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The balloon will expand as air pressure decreases (as altitude increases) as well as lose lift. When the air pressure it too low, the balloon will burst - no parachute on these balloons.\n\n**v0.3:**\n\nThis release will bring all new balloons, they will have varying lift capabilities and minimum pressures. Balloon sizes will range from 0.625m up to 3.75m, for each size there will be the same 3 variants as in v0.1.\n\n**v0.4**\n\nEven more balloons coming in this release! Some will be designed for use in different planet atmospheres and higher tech balloons will come with a parachute as well to protect your glorious science.\n\n**v0.5:**\n\nThis release will include some new specialised science experiments for use with the balloons such as an atmospheric analyser. A service bay will be included as well for 0.625m and 3.75m balloons as they are not included in stock KSP.\n\n**v0.7:**\n\nThe big one! I hope to get contracts included into the mod at this point. Such as take an atmospheric reading at 5km, 10km and 15km with a KerBalloon.\n\n**v0.9:**\n\nIf I can find a way to get it to work, I will add the ability to tether balloons to the ground in this release. A use for this could be for RemoteTech ground relays.\n\n**v1.0:**\n\nFor 1.0, I will add any last features and fix any remaining bugs. After 1.0, I will still update KerBalloons to work with the latests versions of KSP as best I can.\n\n* * *\n\n**Media**\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/uPnxb](http://imgur.com/a/uPnxb)\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/bOIRr](http://imgur.com/a/bOIRr)\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/TqKXtWJtLps?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n* * *\n\n**[Download](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kerballoons-v0-4-2)**  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003EReturning soon to CKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n[Donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026hosted_button_id=5Z736NGY8KFTE)  \n[Source Code](https://github.com/JoePatrick1/KerBalloons)\n\n*The MIT License Copyright (c) Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The balloons can be deflated but they are deflated in ~2 seconds. You could use them as parachutes though as they have very little lift, so not enough to lift a rover, but very large surface area so create a lot of drag - basically is a parachute"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:26:36Z","Content":"Excellent work so far!

I imagine they would have difficulty surviving transonic speeds for example.\n\nWill you be making a custom parachute for the radiosonde? Something that can be launched in a deployed state attached to the balloon would be useful.\n\n![weather_balloon_parachute_instrument_launch.jpg](http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/sites/lawrencehallofscience.org/files/stories/weather_balloon_parachute_instrument_launch.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"JoePatrick1","CreatedById":104094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:31:43Z","Content":"**Release 1 - Now available**\n\n**Download** [**here**](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/230197-kerballoons) **** \n\n![iBftZpL.png](http://i.imgur.com/iBftZpL.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Firewolf7887","CreatedById":12273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:13:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Release 1 - Now available**\n\u003E **Download** [**here**](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/230197-kerballoons) **** \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/iBftZpL.png](http://i.imgur.com/iBftZpL.png)\n\nTime to drop bombs with balloons like Japan did in World War II \u003C3"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:24:57Z","Content":"Can uninflated baloons survive reentry, I want to use them as an alternative to parachutes."},{"CreatedByName":"JoePatrick1","CreatedById":104094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:26:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can uninflated baloons survive reentry, I want to use them as an alternative to parachutes.\n\nNot really tested it but should do"},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:29:40Z","Content":"Okay I will try it tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:18:55Z","Content":"Hey Joe, this is fantastic!
