The parachute module splits the covering mesh off of the main model and makes it its own rigidbody (as debris), but currently does not remove it from the highlighting cache.  As the covering mesh gets deleted as it moves out of rendering range, the next time the user mouses over the part (or other part of the craft), or otherwise causes the highlighter to activate, it will simply crash the game (without logging any errors or exceptions, thats it, just crash.  Seriously SQUAD?).  I have no idea what the precise cause of it is, but seems to be a null-reference to something that is getting fed into the graphics pipeline;  KSP code is probably doing some custom rendering-to-texture without bothering to check if things are null first (or in fact, ever updating the highlighter cache; they assume 100% static unchanging models).\n\nHave updated the parachute module to update the highlighters after the parachute covering mesh has been split off.  Hopefully this will fix the crashes when using those parts.\n\n(Still have not been able to duplicate it, but that is because it would take running the game for longer than my typical testing sessions for the debris to go out of range and be deleted).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t have real plumes installed, but I suppose it could still conflict.

Not that the other mods are doing things wrong as far as they know, but the wiki and tutorials are just giving wrong instructions; they follow the instructions correctly, and this is the result.....

I wonder if the RP wiki is unlocked....could possibly update it myself).\n\nOh, also:\n\n![vWXTHkE.png](http://imgur.com/vWXTHkE.png)\n\nNormals work out decently under the in-game lighting, textures already look quite usable (at the scale these things will normally be seen at), and the parts are functional.\n\nBalance is borked at the moment (all using cloned configs with the same mass/resources/etc), but I\u0027ll be working on that a bit today.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Forgot to ask, are you going to put in the option to inflate the HABs without rocket parts?\n\u003E \n\nProbably not; but would be super simple to setup a patch to do it yourself.  Just patch the SSTUInflatable module to have \u0027inflationMass = 0\u0027, and then they won\u0027t require any rocket parts.  Of course, they will be just as heavy as if you had used the RP, even in the deflated state; so you\u0027ll have to launch \u003E120t to orbit for the 50m torus, all in a single launch.\n\n^^^ That is part of the reason for the use of rocketparts -- reduce the mass of the part as-launched, making for easier to design launchers for the torus itself, while allowing for standard resupply craft to be used to deliver the rocketparts."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T16:52:16Z","Content":"Wow, so very, very cool.

Would by default be empty, but could be configured pre-launch to be used for any available resources.  This would be done in a separate CONTAINER node in the VolumeContainer setup, and be independently configurable from the existing Battery, Propellant, and Supplies containers (which each have locked/limited resources, as they represent dedicated storage containers for those resources, configured and balanced specifically for the functions and use of the individual part).  Using the ratio controls the user could fill any portion of this \u0027empty volume\u0027 with any other existing/available resource.  Initial balancing in the configs for the parts would be setup with this storage space being empty / having no mass, and would be intended to be filled with resources post launch. \n\nWant more space for EC, or LS? Simply add it to the \u0027storage\u0027 container.  Need to turn a torus into a fuel-depot?  Easily done.  Perhaps the crew capacity could scale with the inverse of the used portion of the empty space?  So your fuel depot would be literally just storage, rather than crew quarters.\n\nTo that effect I\u0027ve been considering the best way to add \u0027empty space\u0027 to the VC setup.  Currently the best option I\u0027ve come up with is a dummy resources with zero mass but standard 1-liter volume, which can be used the same as any other resource in the VC configuration GUI; the resource would be untweakable, and not display on any stock resource GUIs, and would exist solely to take up space in the VC volume calculations.  Sure, its a little bit hacky, but one of the cleanest solutions I\u0027ve come across as far as integration into the existing code; I already use a similar setup for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage space (a dummy zero-mass resource), so I know that most of the intended functions already exist and work properly.\n\nAm also considering allowing in-flight reconfiguration of this \u0027Storage\u0027 container.  This option would only be available on specific parts, and there would be a resource cost and/or other requirements in order for it to be used (such as the presence of an engineer, a workshop-enabled part, or ???).  This has been a long-term plan for the VolumeContainer and quite a bit of the back-end code for this functionality already exists, but I have as-yet been unable to find a good method to balance its use in flight (esp. as with MFT tanks where the dry mass depends on the resources it is configured for); much of that balance problem does not apply to the current implementation of the StationCore parts as they use a constant pre-configured dry mass (changing their resources, aside from EC, does not change the part mass).  This might take a few weeks / releases to get figured out and implemented.\n\nWill likely prototype/test this system on the CFG parts, and if it all works out well and is well received, work on adapting it into the other StationCore parts.  Eventually after I figure out the in-flight reconfiguration/dry mass calc problems I can even add it into the MFT tanks and other parts using the VolumeContainer system."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T21:34:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This also confirmed my theory that you could create a stationary object inside of the rotating torus by throwing it against the rotation direction at a very precise speed\n\u003E \n\nSo I could leave a donut floating around and eat it later?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T21:36:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, \\_Augustus\\_ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So I could leave a donut floating around and eat it later?\n\u003E \n\nLoL, Yep.
