I\u0027ve been slightly annoyed personally that the Spaceplane pieces (and a number of other parts) don\u0027t all have matching grays and textures. There is a base light gray coat that is for the most part the same for all parts, but there are about three or so shades of dark gray/black that are currently used. SO..... rather then complaining about it, I\u0027m going to try and solve it!\n\nWIP link: [SPPCC v0.01 (dropbox)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sba9p0dz83is8zz/SPPCC%20v0.01.zip?dl=0)\n\nExamples:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I guess what I\u0027m trying to get at is that SQUAD seems to have designed the wing pieces so that they all have the same white base (inconsistent), but the \u0022airliner\u0022 parts have a light gray trim (relatively consistent) , and the spaceplane parts have a dark gray/black trim (inconsistent). I\u0027m trying to get both styles of trim to match as good as I can but no matter what I end up doing, the jet liner wings will be the only parts with the light gray trim. **What I really would love is the option to choose which color variant to use (have a plugin to switch between part texture files in editor similar to procedural parts)**. I can\u0027t write code though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T15:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Adyx","CreatedById":70890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:17:53Z","Content":"Firespitter has a texture switcher.

Shades of gray were always crushed into miscolored mess in every single version of KSP and in every single other game (majority of them, really), using DDS format. The only differences between 0.90 and 1.0 in that regard are:\n\n- 0.90: Lossless source files converted to DDS on startup\n- 1.0: Source files already in lossy DDS, startup just loads them into memory\n\nYou might also want to ask Porkjet for the source files, since editing lossy DDS textures is a very bad idea artifacts wise. Upon saving your DDS texture edits, you\u0027ll be applying the extreme compression yet again, multiplying the artifacts.\n\nP.S.: As about the color, it\u0027s a good idea to never ever use true blacks even in the textures of materials that are supposed to be truly black, because you are not dealing with an unlit environment and past shading your objects might very well be black in many situations even if they had gray textures. Dark gray (e.g. 40/255) is far better for looks and texture readability than black as it rarely turns into a dark void in majority of lighting conditions. Only exceptions are elements like 1-4px seam lines on very dark fills, where black is the only way to provide contrast and depict a deeper element. Anything wider, though, I can\u0027t recommend.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T16:36:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bac9**"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidBowman","CreatedById":111419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:50:29Z","Content":"Much appreciated!
