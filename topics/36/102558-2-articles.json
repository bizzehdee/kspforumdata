Upon entering the editor (either one), no parts are available, the mission flag is represented as one that doesn\u0027t exist, and the part list is blank with the subassembly dropzone box at the bottom, mashed with another box. This, and the NullReferenceException, only occurs when playing without ModuleManager. This occurs regardless of whether or not the mod has been activated.

I saw the same line in the debug output that made me suspicious.\n\nI was able to reproduce the error by creating a new save with ModuleManager installed and then deleting ModuleManager.dll plus the extra files Module Manager creates. It behaves the same on Mac and Windows. Look in your save file (persistent.sfs) and search for \u0022TechTreeUrl = \u0022. If it reads \u0022TechTreeUrl = GameData/ModuleManager.TechTree\u0022, I think we\u0027ve found the source of the error. When you delete ModuleManager and ModuleManager.TechTree, the game save doesn\u0027t know what Tech Tree to load. I recommend either starting a new save or installing ModuleManager again. Both solved the issue for me.\n\nAs ObsessedWithKSP mentioned, let me know if you have any more issues, but this seems to be ModuleManager issue."},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSmith","CreatedById":102438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:53:30Z","Content":"Thanks for your help everyone.
