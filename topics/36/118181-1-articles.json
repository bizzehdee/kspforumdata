Well it\u0027s been a pain and I\u0027ve spent 95% of the time just working with the archaic GUI system but I\u0027ve got something useable.\n\nStateFunding 0.1.0\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_10_at_10_54_07_PM.png](http://s22.postimg.org/ojfkpdlkx/Screen_Shot_2015_08_10_at_10_54_07_PM.png)\n\nThe mod introduces a new way to generate revenue besides doing contracts. You can choose between the USK and the USSK governments with their own risk/rewards. This introduces 2 new metrics, Public Opinion (PO) and State Confidence (SC).\n\n**Public Opinion**\n\nHaving more Kerbals in active flights and science labs in orbit or on other planets will increase your public opinion. Kerbal death decreases public opinion.\n\n**State Confidence**\n\nHaving more satellites in orbit of any celestial body and landed mining drills increases state confidence. Crashing vessels decreases state confidence.\n\nWith enough time you will eventually have enough satellites and kerbals to be making enough to rely solely on state funding for cash. And you still put in the work to get it. Of course you can continue to do contracts on the side.\n\n**Performance Reviews**\n\nEvery Kerbal year you will receive a performance review. Your achievements and failures will be added up and you will get paid. It\u0027s possible you f-up so badly you get fined. But just don\u0027t do that.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\\* Multiple StateFunding app launchers buttons start showing up at the Space Center.\n\n\\* If you view a past review from the StateFunding app launcher menu and close the window a NullReferencePointer Exception is thrown. Still trying to track it down.\n\nPlanned Improvements\n\n\\* Natural decay of PO/SC.\n\n\\* Instead of just counting satellites, calculate the coverage around a planet. If the planet/moon is completely covered there shouldn\u0027t be additional funding for redundant coverage.\n\n\\* In addition to satellite coverage, require surveying equipment to count as a surveillance satellite.\n\n\\* Detect stranded Kerbals.\n\n\\* Government Contracts.\n\n\\* Relocate Space Center depending on the Govt. you choose.\n\nSource / Download\n\nSource on GitHub: [https://github.com/iamchairs/StateFunding](https://github.com/iamchairs/StateFunding)\n\nMod on Curse: [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/234837-statefunding](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/234837-statefunding)\n\nMod on Kerbal Stuff: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1069/State%20Funding](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1069/State%20Funding)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T04:46:17Z","Content":"Oh, this looks cool!"},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T05:02:29Z","Content":"KSP: Now With 50% More Bureaucracy!![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T05:51:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Public Opinion**\n\u003E \n\u003E Having more Kerbals in active flights and science labs in orbit or on other planets will increase your public opinion.

He would probably tell you about spectacular rocket laches, astronouts in zerro gravity, spacewalks and going to the mun or mars and jump around. He would not be so excited about advanced scientific experiments and communications, soil samples and other boring activities.\n\nThe goverment and the public are fundementally different actors. The Goverment are burocrasts that want you to be efficient and effective. The public want to be entertained and inspired. The trick is doing both well. NASA is an example of a Space Agency that currently mainly pleases the burocrats. Only during the Apolo mission, they got a lot of intrest from the public. But the public is where the Big money comes from so although the goverment is a relatively reliable source of income you can\u0027t do anything spectacular unless the public wants it. The problem with the public is that they get bored fast, for example you can\u0027t repeat the same mission to the moon, instead you should quickly build a permanent base and regulary switch kerbals. Everybody want to go to space. Although it will have little science value, the public just loves stories about astronauts on the mun. So the more kerbals go to the mun and return safely, the more you will be appreciated by the public and therefore rewarded.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T12:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T06:58:00Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t this kind of redundant with the existing Reputation system?

It would also help if you would be rewarded for sustaining permanent bases and infrastructure. THis could be achieved by running some monitoring code which tracks equipment/kerbals time in/on orbit/muns. This wouls give insentive to create a real space economy instead of only achieving some quick mission objectives.\n\nAlso the goverment and public have different intrest and motivations. The public is like a 8 year old that wants to see cool stuf happening in space so perhaps that one day he too will be there. Goverment are mostly intrestied in control , which means they need to know what is out and if they can benefit from it. Goverments are more likely to send probes and droids which can perform research cheaply and efficient. The public however is not going to get exited about robots in space (except from a few nerds), they want astronouts doing all the stuff. The more exotic, the better.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T07:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T07:26:53Z","Content":"Dramatically backlit government kerbal\n\nvery nice."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T08:02:06Z","Content":"Like the idea but I would suggest revisiting the time frame for your rewards.

For examply, you launching your rocket into orbit, the public get\u0027s excited by the show. You collect some research, and send it back home, the goverments approves you did something usefull with their funds. You land on the mun , go eva and do a report and the public gets wild. Doing multiple actions in succesion , will give give you bonus rewards with the public as they like to watch you live and get bored easily. The goverment on the other hand, the goverment are burocrats that want you to complete your mission as fast as possible, therefore you recieve bonusses the faster you finish a mission. This should give you some insentive to complete your missions fast.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T11:59:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T12:42:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I may make a suggestion: instead of yearly rewards, rewards should be continiously, meaning, the goverment and public will follow you where ever you go and will get exited or bored depending on your actions giving you rewards.

I actually could envision a way to balance the rewards out nicely by a combination of the on-going mission rewards \u002B time period rewards. This would allow smaller increments to assist all along the way of your program enhancing what you earn from contracts without giving you a bankroll that gets used up while at the same time rewarding long term mission goals with bigger rewards for a nice boost without going over the top. Almost a combination of the two ideas basically. The public rewards you immediately while you\u0027re in mission doing things and keeping them entertained. The bureaucrats on the other hand are wanting you the get your stuff done and look at total progress - satellites, stations, total # of missions, total research outputs etc. Kind of like most space programs are treated right now with regular reviews and awarded budgets. You could even tie both together by having a well entertained public push your bureaucrat reward higher through \u0022public pressure\u0022 type bonuses or a bored public create penalties by not \u0022speaking out\u0022 to defend you against the penny pinchers.\n\nDepending on how far you\u0027re willing to go to push this mod as well as how far KSP will allow you to push it, this could turn into a very fun career enhancement."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T12:59:54Z","Content":"Indeed, goverment look at the cold hard facts, what did you achieve and how long did it require for you to achieve it? The public just want you to do exciting stuff like it\u0027s an adventure. Initialy they could be entertaned with some airplanes but this quickly get\u0027s odd. The want you do do more changing stuff, like putting a Kerbal in Space.\n\nNote that technically, this mod is idealy combined with a simulated advisary. This allows for space races to orbit, the mun or duna. This will put the heat really on. The first nation on the mun win the glory of all Kerbalkind, the second a footnote in history. No time to screw around, you needs to get there ASAP.\n\nI think there should be a difference between playing the USK or USSK. The Commies will have Big Goverment bonuses, while the USK will have the free Public Sector. It will therefore make it more rewarding to make moon walk (APOLLO) with USK while USSK will reward you more for building large research space station into orbit (MIR)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T13:39:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"iamchairs","CreatedById":143189,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:38:13Z","Content":"@FreeThinker\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of 1960s - 1990s space race.
