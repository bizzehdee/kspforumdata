They fall vertically because that is the angle at which they left a vehicle. If you make a Kerbal fall sideways it will continue falling sideways until it hits the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"glen.mack","CreatedById":75413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T15:28:19Z","Content":"Thanks, thats good to know. I didn\u0027t realise Kerbals are treated as a singe object it seems, because their limbs are apparently unaffected by wind resistance in the current aero version. They flop downwards even when falling at high speed.

Kerbals are still rigid when in freefall, unless they\u0027re hit with something and ragdoll, then they will go limp and stuff will move. If a Kerbal is in rigid freefall mode, and hits the ground, he will ragdoll. If he\u0027s ragdolled and hits the ground, he stays ragdolly."}]}
