Its basically just an adapter to connect between a 1.25M common berthing mechanism on a station (like Fustek ones) to the standard stock docking port. \n\nMuch like the ones on ISS, its primarily used for docking connections for visiting spacecraft. If you build stations with the standard stock docking ports instead of full-diameter 1.25m or 2.5m ports, then this part really isn\u0027t needed. \n\nIf you use the 1.25M ports, then you can moved the PMA around as your station expands to still give you some areas to dock ships using the smaller port.\n\nFor station assembly, just use normal docking ports. And if you want to use a ship/tug to maneuver the station, just use a normal docking port to not worry about issues with the thrust axis not lining up withe the station\u0027s CoG (unless the station is not symmetrical, then the offset adapter could help)."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T13:12:07Z","Content":"Fixed up the external model\u0027s mesh and UVs to make the other station parts much easier to create and consistent.
