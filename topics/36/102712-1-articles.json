And now we are extremely excited to present you the latest revision of the famous Infernal Robotics. It has not been updated for far too long, and it deserves better. And now you can make it better too. The deal is - we provide you with the hot-off-the-press pre-release version of the Infernal Robotics mod and in return you unleash your creative powers to create more robotic contraptions (or just blow the dust off some of the old robotic creations of yours) and most importantly **give us some feedback.**\n\nOne of our goals for the rework was to provide as much backwards compatibility as possible, and we hope we succeeded in that aspect, so we don\u0027t expect any crafts to be broken (but study the changelog carefully, especially those of you who use kOS to control your robotics).\n\nYou can use [TweakScale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693)with Infernal Robotics, although it is not required. But it does bring a lot of flexibility in building your robotic creations, and most of our parts were designed with TweakScale in mind.\n\nFor your convenience we\u0027ve included Legacy robotic parts in the download, but we do recommend using [Zodius\u0027s Model Rework parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65365-WIP-MSI-s-Infernal-Robotics-Model-Rework-%28Structural-Pre-Release%29)\n\nYou can download the latest version of the Rework project\n\n[HERE](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases/tag/v0.20C)\n\nThis is a work in progress and has not been fully tested to work with existing saves. you have been warned\n\nYou can provide feed either here or via submitting an issue on [github](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/issues)(or even both).\n\nHere\u0027s the brief video overview of the new features:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/53GvpPNlh04?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n    Changes in v0.20c* Minor UI Events renames* Bugixes: invertAxis\u0026Keys persistense, min/max range tweakbles hidden for translating parts* Fixed min/max range ot showing in Flight for translating parts* Peristence Related BugFixes \u002B InvertAxis ButtonChanges in v0.20b* More Code Cleanup* GUI Enhancements    * Custom category in Editor listing all robotic parts.    * Editor and Flight window width is scaled dynamically    * Editor window now has an option to revert servo to 0    * In Preset Editor added button to move servo to preset, works in flight too.    * Position and ranges for inverted axis parts are now shown correctly and in different style* Some new icons* New Tweakscale configs* Some minor bugfixesChanges in v0.20a* **BREAKING:** Field \u0022Coarse Speed\u0022 has been renamed **in UI** to just \u0022Speed\u0022. Will affect all KOS scripts that read or change that field. Field name in part.cfg has not changed, so all existing crafts should load successfully.* BREAKING: part config fields \u0022maxRange\u0022 and \u0022minRange\u0022 are now obsolete. There are no current or legacy parts that use those two fields.* NEW: All controllable servos now have acceleration parameter. As the name suggest it is the rate at which servos speed up or slow down. Default value for legacy parts is 4x. * NEW: You can create preset positions for all controllable servos and switch between them in flight (editor preset position switching is coming up soon). Presets are automatically sorted from lowest to highest and you can only switch from current preset to next or previous one. For examples refer to the video overview linked below.* Redesigned Editor UI to fit most of the relevant fields and actions in one window. You can now move individual servos and change their main parameters from single IR window without the need to right-click every servo.* Redesigned in-flight controls to accommodate all new changes and for better readability.* All IR in-flight windows now obey F2 command (hide/show UI) and should not get in the way of your awesome screenshots.* TweakScale configs on Legacy parts have been fixed to work with the latest version of TweakScale.* All buttons now have basic tooltips.* Servo sound\u0027s pitch now scales with servo\u0027s movement speed \n\nThis software \u0026 parts are released under the GNU GPL version 3, 29 July 2007.\n\nThe IR Rework Team\n\n erendrake,\n\n pellinor0,\n\n ZodiusInfuser,\n\n sirkut,\n\n Ziw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T08:05:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by erendrake**\n  \nPrerelease 2"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T04:51:05Z","Content":"Awesome!
