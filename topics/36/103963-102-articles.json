Removing EVE didn\u0027t help with the green jaggies, but running in dx11 did remove them. However the post processing layer, the ocean layer and the edges of landmasses especially [interplay between sea and sky shaders?] have begun to flicker like crazy in dx11. There was some flickering before when moving the camera, but moving the camera or zooming now causes serious flickering especially at high altitude. Everything else, as far as I can tell, is working great.\n\nBTW: I was also having the weird halo over Kerbin [which I thought best not to complain about ha] and those new files you provided cleared that up quick smart, good stuff!! x\n\nEDIT: Oh my stars, flickering aside, it looks so convincing; can\u0027t compliment you enough.\n\nEDIT 2: Did anyone disclose the settings for the ocean shader as seen in the OP screenshots? It reminds me of the sea in Empire TW and I want it!! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T21:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Space Cowbuoy**\n  \nquestion for the room"}]}
