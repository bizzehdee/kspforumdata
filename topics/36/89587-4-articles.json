I dunno... I had an earlier experience that I had attributed to integration pains where I had a lander and a 200 ton orbiter at Ike. The orbiter had been in an extremely stable orbit. The lander and ground crew were just fine but the orbiter was out in interstellar space on an interglactic trajectory... =( I had to cheat-burn about 40 km/sec to get the thing into a circular orbit over the course of like two hours.
