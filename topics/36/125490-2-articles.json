Right now, a player chooses to make a percentage \u0022commitment\u0022 to a strategy, typically in 5% increments between 5% and 100%. Discrete choices are much better than a slider. With a slider, the player is just trying to put it as far to the right as possible. With discrete levels, it\u0027s much easier to balance them to make each level a more viable choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Strategia, I\u0027ll have two kinds of strategies. One-offs that do not have any levels (like the celestial body program strategies that I showed last week), and leveled strategies. Leveled strategies will have 3 levels (which conveniently lines up with the number of Admin Building levels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aCbKHqs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aCbKHqs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially I had implemented this using 33.3% commitment increments, but I quickly found some pretty serious problems with that approach. Using the example of Stagnated Research, if I took it at 33% commitment but later wanted to upgrade, I had no way of seeing what the 66% and 100% levels actually give me without cancelling the strategy. When most strategies have a setup cost associated with them, that\u0027s a pretty bad design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other limitation was that any numeric values that are built in to the system had to be derived from the percentage. Which means if I wanted to set the science levels using a simple geometric progressing (say 100, 200, and 400), I can\u0027t do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, this is all implemented through one config file that gets expanded (so I don\u0027t have to maintain three separate copes of the Stagnated Research strategy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClear Requirements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock strategies give you a reason why you can\u0027t use a strategy at the top of the strategy description. But it only gives \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E reason. If a strategy that I really want says it needs 100 science, then as a player I may go do something to get that science. Having happily grinded out some science, I\u0027ll be rather upset when I come back and find out that I was also 500 reputation short and didn\u0027t know it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is solve fairly simply with a section that shows the requirements for the strategy and gives a quick and explicit visual as to which requirements the player does and doesn\u0027t meet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IMG\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z315ach.png%5B/IMG\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iE28QjL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iE28QjL.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Pd8Rrd.png\u0022 alt=\u00221Pd8Rrd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENotifications\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228vajiwZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8vajiwZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last problem with Strategies in the stock game is that they are just kind of... just background noise. As a player, I rarely see the need to go to the Administration Building at all. A big part of that is that the strategies aren\u0027t interesting - obviously a player installing Strategia is going to have a little bit more incentive to visit the Administration Building. Still, I felt that something more was needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve implemented is a notification system. Any time a new strategy becomes available (or an old one is no longer available), the player will get a notification in the message area.

A player with Stagnated Research I will now get a notification when Stagnated Research II becomes available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStagnated Research\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should probably also quickly discuss the strategy that is showcased this week - Stagnated Research. Because I\u0027m getting rid of all of the stock strategies when using Strategia, I felt that I still needed a way to help the player bootstrap reputation. The reputation gains apply to all contract rewards (including parameter rewards), even if there isn\u0027t already a reputation reward. For a one-time science cost, the player can get a sizeable increase to reputation gains from contracts.

A wise troll once told me, \u0022no pics, no clicks\u0022. Nothing to click on yet, but here\u0026#39;s the pics!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the first set of strategies that I wanted to show off are what I collectively refer to as the \u0022Celestial Body Programs\u0022, which are broken into \u0022Moon Programs\u0022, \u0022Planet Programs\u0022 and \u0022Gas Giant Programs\u0022. These strategies can\u0026#39;t be turned on/off at a whim - once you choose one, you either have to complete it (and get a reward), or let the timer run out (and get a [I]stiff[/I] penalty). They have some pretty big upsides (vastly increased milestone rewards for the chosen body, cheaper research, big reward at the end) compared to the downsides (modest setup fee, vastly decreased milestone rewards for other bodies, giant penalty for failure). But we\u0026#39;ll see how it looks with other strategies I come up with - I\u0026#39;m willing to call it balanced if a player isn\u0026#39;t automatically choosing these over other strategies.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and these are dynamic, of course. So players of RSS will get things like \u0022The Apollo Program\u0022, \u0022The Ares Program\u0022, and \u0022The Zeus IV Program\u0022. Players of New Horizons will see options like \u0022The Serran Program\u0022, The Arin Program\u0022, and \u0022The Vanor VI Program\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]http://i.imgur.com/JM2FV7G.png[/URL][URL]http://i.imgur.com/LAoSPXc.png[/URL][URL]http://i.imgur.com/IkJpilH.png[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m really happy with how the icons turned out for these. I was going to keep the black and white look of stock KSP, but for planets I wanted just a little bit more to it. I didn\u0026#39;t do custom icons for any planet packs (for some I hard-coded a mapping to a \u0022close\u0022 stock icon, others will just fall-back on a default icon).
