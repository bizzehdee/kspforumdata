maybe we find a better solution than english..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - I never deactivate Impulse to save..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- there is a make slow to save function - admittedly not as stable as it should.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee here in Wiki: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/philotical/StarTrekImpulseDrive/wiki/Function-Panel#make-slow-to-save\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/philotical/StarTrekImpulseDrive/wiki/Function-Panel#make-slow-to-save\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- second, what I allways do - I just pull my ship to the ground (click on down) until it stopps moving - then I can change scene and the game will save..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it - it works very well..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit, mostly it does not work - so, if you ment there, I know and you are right - but on the ground this is a good alternative that saves one right click..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill - I didn\u0027t understand the rest of your report -

I guess it\u0027s the way KSP places objects on the runway..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emostly they are a bit to low (inside the runway) and when the physics starts, they get pushed out of the ground - since voyager is (with impulse) weight less like in \u0022no gravity\u0022, this from KSP induced movement will not stop until you hit full halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I\u0027m right and this is the cause, this will not be fixed, since I can\u0027t change KSPs behavioure there..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is why I implemented the full halt in the first place - the thought of using an anchor was kind of non-realistic for the peoject - full halt does the same without mideval sailing ship touch :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mjy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mjy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut this is a breakthrough for me with that impulse, as it was similar as the air bags, but much much better, as u got better control. and I can finally make a battleship, it will be \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edeadelus from stargate, got it started, but I am testing the impulse and some new meshes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill use it no matter what, a bit of lag for me won\u0060t stop me from using it, not sure why I got lag from it, will just be carful to turn off the impulse. will try it with a new load up game to see. lots of fun with it. reason I\u0060m doing the deadelus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you like it :-D -

you may not add the plugin directly to your download..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I gave StarVision the exclusive publishing right - so this is final. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough he has ofcourse the right to decides otherwise -

two non-english speaker try to commnicate on english - I hope you see the irony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you explain me how to replicate the lag you have, with a starvision shuttle if possible, I will do my best to fix it - I promise..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euntil than - hmm - not much I can do.. - all you said does not produce lag here.. - I tried it all..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the one unchangable rule of the universe..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EIf I can\u0027t replicate it, I can\u0027t fix it\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 -

the only leak in the plugin is currently the planet scanner - it\u0027s a huge leak! - it will produce those 2.9Gb within one minute or less - so if you get lag after using the transporter mode \u0022ShipToGround\u0022 - than this is caused by the planet scanner - there is NO - I repeat NO other leak in the plugin and this is confirmed by several independent peoples - me included of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first leak you\u0027ve reported, I didn\u0027t spot right away -
