First, max thrust should be set reasonably considering the size of nozzles and the physical/chemical limit of it. It means, smaller engines are normally not as powerful as those bigger ones are due to smaller nozzle size (which means that it can\u0027t redirect too much flame thus can\u0027t achieve a high fuel flow rate because of the underexpansion of nozzles). Also, engines that burn woods should have less power than those burn LH2/LO2/Hydrocarbon (xD).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when it comes to the Isp, well, things are getting complex now. Various categories of engines have different characteristics, but any kind of engines do have a natural limit of Isp. See below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png/800px-Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022 alt=\u0022800px-Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limit varies with engine type and mach number. Also, design and production process play much more important roles. That\u0027s just said, what if we use new type of engines, like those driven by electricity and have way higher Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main idea is to first work out the certain principle (i.e. how your engines are gonna work), then set the numbers while referring to useful information for given design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, O2/H2 burners do have higher Isp over HC burners, but no higher than 9000 sec (ASL). There\u0027s an exception, the GE CF6 turbofan which powers the Boeing 747s/767s can deliver an Isp of 11700 sec at sea level using hydrocarbon fuel (Jet-A1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I\u0027m not a programmer, so I don\u0027t have an idea on the feasibility of having the Isp gradually reduced as mach number increases in this game. If it is practical, then it\u0027s gonna be the best engine mod ever (already is though, lol, nice work bro).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you need to set the mass/cost properly to make it more realistic. Normally (but not necessarily), powerful engines weigh more. But this only applys when same type of engines are compared. Rocket engines are the lightest (TWR, thrust-weight ratio) due to the lack of fans, compressors and shafts which weigh the most in a jet engine, whereas jet engines (turbofan/turboprop/turbojet) weigh much more. Ramjets and scramjets are between that two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnit Cost:...um, whatever.

Stock wise, the atmosphereCurve defines ISP as a curve related to atmospheric density on a percent scale based on sea level on kerbin, and the velocityCurve should define your thrust along a curve based on velocity, so you can make an engine work less well at given speeds (ie, less thrust when going slow, but them tapering it off past some limit). Though i do know that KSP does some things weirdly, and impacts thrust instead of ISP or the other way round. Experimenting should show that pretty easily, especially if you get telemachus or graphotron. It\u0027s important to note, mach doesn\u0027t exist in stock KSP, you should be able to calculate mach values based on atmospheric data but those values have no meaning, and frequently have little bearing on gameplay due to other systems lacking. Mach 3 might turn out to be a pretty low number given ksp\u0027s flight dynamics. If you want realism, balance your mod to be played in the presence of a plugin like FAR that makes the environment more realistic, without that, all the graphs in the world (nice graph btw) will only help you start somewhere, and from there you\u0027ll have to playtest to find what you actually want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KanneRyo","CreatedById":78765,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand your concept now. It\u0027s kinda like an hybrid engine which incorporates normal rocket engine principle but uses electricity to ionize and boost exhaust gas. Am I right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, if so, it\u0027s in fact high-tech. This kinda engine is still under develop in the real world. I think it IS a pretty good idea to have it inside KSP bro, great thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this kinda engine, the weight won\u0027t bother much cuz the exclusive electric boosting system consists only some wire and metal polar board. But you don\u0027t need big nozzles or altitude compensation for this. The gain is massive so the extra weight pays off well. Let\u0027s say, about 70%-80% the weight of normal rocket engine for the same amont of thrust, which will give it a perfect TWR number. The unit cost should be a little bit higher due to high-tech (something like 150%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it still uses rocket science to fly except some new tech, the max thrust thing should be (but not dramatically) higher. The nozzle limit (underexpansion) is well eased in this design because electric field has the abiliy to redirect ionized exhaust gas, thus fuel flow can be very high. Max thrust should be about 30%-50% higher than normal rocket engine that has the same size (aspect ratio) of nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Isp, the usage of electricity makes the fuel comsumption pretty good at the cost of massive battery charge. For liquid fuel and oxidizer, the Isp should be pretty high over normal rocket engine, depending on the energy rate of electricity. maybe higher than hydrocarbon turbojets. 2000 sec is a good starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectricity usage can be something like 10 unit per sec at full thrust. Or other reasonable value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe usage of electric field not only benefits the nozzle size but also improves thrust vectoring. So it should have more angular ability to redirect thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cooling, I recommend using fuel itself rather than air that creates drag. You can have a small size of intake to work as a radiator that cools down fuel, and let the unused fuel cool the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my thought:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor hyper, max thrust 7500kN (sea level, cooled by fuel with radiator) 9000kN (vacuum, cooled by fuel), Isp at sea level 2000, Isp in vacuum 2500 (lower exit pressure, vacuum permittivity), mass 15 tons, electricity energy rate at full thrust 18 unit per sec.
