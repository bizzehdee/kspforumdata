I tried it this way but thought the performance hit wasn\u0027t worth it and the visuals were good enough with just extinction on the volumetrics, I guess not in all cases.\n\nFor the clouds color, it all depends on how much the multipliers are set to, really, any multiplier set too high will overpower the original cloud color which is normal. A high color multiplier will make any clouds look white, high scattering multiplier will make it take the atmosphere color and so on..."}]}
