The working title is Generic Inline Cockpits, which isn\u0027t a very good name, but that\u0027s the general idea. The point is that inline cockpits give you a lot more freedom when it comes to placement and looks than regular ones. When designing jet fighter style planes (armed or not) inline cockpits are very useful, but the stock ones don\u0027t always look the part for those kinds of designs (especially the Mk2), and there are a lot of mods that add some cool cockpits, like QuizTech, MasterTech Aero, and FantomWorks, but they\u0027re all front placement, and sometimes it\u0027s all too evident on what planes they\u0027re inspired. I thought it\u0027d be nice to have a greater supply of cockpits, especially ones that look generic enough that work on a lot of designs. Also, I\u0027m going to try to make it very lightweight, using stock textures if possible, or maybe trying to use one texture for all the models. Here are the models so far (I don\u0027t think any more are needed, but if someone has an idea that goes well with the concept of the mod, let me know):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/URWwU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Mainly, though, because I would not see much use in making a nosed cockpit, because there are already good mods with Mk1 fighter cockpits with a nose. Now that being said, my main issue with the new Learjet revamp is that I think the old one looks much more spacey. I do agree with the devs that it looked a little dated when compared to the new models, but probably something a little more sci fi would have been nice\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T18:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you get a chance would you put up some more screenshots of the cockpits with a bit better lighting.
