The config fix was just adding a Gilly template stripping it from all of its PQS mods. CaptRobau had some bugs in OPM\u0027s Tal before doing the same thing, even trough his issues were even bigger. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nBack to testing, one hour today I have received Q\u0026A\u0027s test report and EVERYTHING WORKS FINE!!! No glitches regarding the status of Landed ships, no issues with kerbals, they are performing normaly at last! THE BIG HOTFIX will come in 2 days depending on Olympic\u0027s work. BTW experimental purple giant crystals on Faz are awesome but still need polishing. Today I\u0027ve also tested my new idea, to randomly generate buildings like farms, houses and abandoned bases, all randomly generated per save, like ground scatter.

The bug was that the ships were counted as flying low instead of landed and that prevented returning to space center or contract completion. Also kerbals had EVA problems interacting with the planets. I\u0027ve fixed these bugs in the last tester build, where Project Pluto tested one of the new fixed configs and even shown some pictures!\n\nAlso, releasing multiple parts of a simple hotfix seems rather unprofessional and my reputation would crack down to nothing (as it might already happened) so people would no longer like the mod seeing how disscorganised the releases would be.
