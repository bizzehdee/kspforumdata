We at the Oritz INC team are creating a new modpack: The Kerbgon modpack! We are currently making a new fuel, and will have some other things in it. We are working hard on it, and will be here at the end of the month (which is our goal, a modpack a month). Any recommendations for it would be appreciated. Again, the fuel is very difficult to make, especially since we only have 1 person working on it, so please be patient. Thanks, and again, please give us recommendations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are making new engines, fuel, and fuel tanks, but we are currently using stock models. It can\u0027t be used as RCS, works best in space, and this fuel is a bit like xenon, but it takes longer to get rid of, and doesn\u0027t require electric charge. It is meant for space, mainly probes, but can be used for landers and ships. Shouldn\u0027t be used in atmosphere, and is very, VERY lightweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe flights!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emeans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esoftware to the public domain.

We are trying to make it like Argon, which is pretty light, and used for many things. And why you wouldn\u0027t use unlimited fuel is because that ruins the fun, this fuel is it\u0027s own special fuel, we are trying to make the game still fun and challenging, but still a bit easier to do things. Also, look at Hyperedit, why do you neeed anything when you can use that? Just like this answer: You can still have challenges when using this, and not just cheating your way into orbit. This doesn\u0027t have unlimited fuel, and people didn\u0027t like the modded stock parts we had, so we decided to do custom fuel.
