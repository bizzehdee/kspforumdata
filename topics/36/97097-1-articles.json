For me, the main goal is to make rockets that look and preform like their real world counterparts (in 3.2 or 6.4 scale kerbin at least), Something like the shuttle or a Delta 4 has a huge fuel tank, and small engines, trying to make something like this work in normal ksp is hard, and a real fuels mod would be nice to fix that. Also, i like the idea of a built in engine igniter thing, with built in ways of switching between modes, instead of being held to one way as in the mod that already does this. Stuff like making engines have more then 1 ignition should be easy to add, though weigh a lot on larger engines, and take a while to unlock in the techtree, causing more kerbal rockets with stage and a half setups, or weird systems of srbs and liquid engines so it\u0027s always under thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zengei","CreatedById":75233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T13:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sauron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sauron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I would prefer a slightly \u0022gamier\u0022 interpretation of fuel types that does the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Names propellants using a (simplified) kerbal psuedo-chemistry rather than RL options with kerbal element names.
