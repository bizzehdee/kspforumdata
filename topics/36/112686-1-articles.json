You make a good point about the TWR. If we were to simply scale up the stock dawn engine by a factor of ten, the weight would then be 2.5 t. However, the diameter would be 6.25 m. I essentially cut the size by half of that, then doubled the weight (well more than doubled) to justify the smaller form factor. The problem with a part like this is that one would normally need about 50 dawn engines to propel a craft as big as the Kerbodyne Plus Test Platform, but the endurance engines cut the part count down by a factor of ten. Not to mention the amount of energy generating parts you would need to supply those engines that the NRAX combines into one. Basically, I\u0027m just trying to keep the gameplay balanced. I\u0027d, love to hear anyone\u0027s suggestions that address those concerns!

Some other modders ran into it before. This is probably the solution:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For some \\*unfathomable\\* reason, Squad decided that the cost of a part as specified in a cfg is the cost \u0027wet\u0027 rather than dry. Which means every time a resource has less than its maxAmount, the amount less than maxAmount is \\*subtracted\\* from the part\u0027s cost.\n\u003E So you have to set cost (in the cfg) to be the cost dry PLUS the cost of all resources added.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As to the xenon, i think I may add a second ModuleResourceConverter for the xenon, that way you can choose whether or not you want to convert that resource.\n\nSounds good.
