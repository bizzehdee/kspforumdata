Something like this:\n\n@PART\n\n[\\*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleScienceConverter]]\n\n{\n\n @MODULE[ModuleScienceConverter]\n\n {\n\n @name = WBIScienceConverter\n\n }\n\n}\n\nThis will give you the basic right-click context menu buttons. The fancy UI is part of Pathfinder\u0027s operatins manager and I\u0027d have to add an extra button to display it independently of the manager (which is easy to do). I\u0027ll look at that for next release.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E LMAO! You used the recycling icon. I was integrating that into my decal for the Recyclables material then changed it because I was betting that you had it in mind for something either greenhouse or material re-use related. Thank you so much for all the connector ports - that will make laying out bases SOOoooo much easier.\n\u003E I do a ton of work with labs and MM so are you specifically looking at having the pieces from Pathfinder that allow for the Rep/Funds conversion?\n\nYup! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Reducing part count is good, hopefully it\u0027s not killing the framerate too."},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T16:31:45Z","Content":"can i use this mod without CRP, like if they were stock parts bases?"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T16:44:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E can i use this mod without CRP, like if they were stock parts bases?\n\nGood question. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The mod is tied to CRP, so you\u0027d have to do a lot of modifications to the resource converters to do away with CRP resources.

That said, you\u0027d lose a ton of the flavor the mod gives you because of the use of CRP.

A Ponderosa, three containers full of rocket parts, and a Saddle, all add up to more than a Hitchhiker container. With the Ponderosas you also need to either shove them all in a Conestoga (as large as a hitchhiker and adding a whole tone of mass) or find a way to carry 4 containers, 5 if you want one for mineshafts, saddles, and other goodies. With a hitchiker, you really just need to attach some fuel tanks, engines, landing legs, and a probe core to have an instant habitat.\n\nPerhaps reducing the amount of rocket parts required? I might end up just using this mod for the mine-shafts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T06:01:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 06:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Kosmos**"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T06:02:36Z","Content":"The big advantage is the fact that they\u0027re fairly compact when stored, allowing you to bolt it to the side of your rover/rocket hopper and go exploring for the best spot to set up a more permanent base using the Hitchhikers."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T06:09:41Z","Content":"And the fact that Hitchhikers can\u0027t be reconfigured in the field to be whatever you want/need them to be..."},{"CreatedByName":"Der Kosmos","CreatedById":7632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T06:42:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The big advantage is the fact that they\u0027re fairly compact when stored, allowing you to bolt it to the side of your rover/rocket hopper and go exploring for the best spot to set up a more permanent base using the Hitchhikers.\n\nCompact-ness isn\u0027t as important as mass or part count, and A Ponderosa is almost as big as a Hitchhiker when you consider it needs Three containers full of rocket parts. Not to mention saddles and mineshafts. As for the reconfiguring aspect, maybe just make the reconiguring more expensive to balance. It definitely shouldn\u0027t weigh more than a Hitchiker in any configuration.\n\nIt ought to be lighter than the Hitchhiker because the Hitchhiker has a lower part count and can be used on a mobile vehicle. The factor balancing Ponderosas is that they are stationary instillation that can only be deployed to a planet\u0027s surface. You mention bolting them to the side of the rover, but there\u0027s no reason not to just build a rover with a built in hitchhiker, or the Mk2 crew cabin which is even lighter.\n\nIf it only needed say, 300 or 600 rocket parts, I\u0027d say it would be fair, but as it stands it\u0027s way too clunky unless you have an IRSU setup already in place.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T06:55:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Kosmos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:35:02Z","Content":"You get more than just a place to park your kerbals.

This mod gives you the buildings you need in order to do that without having to carry a massive amount of parts...\n\n 2) If you have issues with weights of any of the structures, again, why not build them on site? Using the Workshop from the Ponderosa or the Clockworks from the Hacienda, you can build out your entire base by simply harvesting the materials you need and building everything there without having to carry very much at all.\n\nThe costs to convert the buildings are fairly reasonable, especially as you start gaining experience with your engineers/scientists and the ability to switch functionality of any part you want is a HUGE advantage to have in the field and reasonably should cost a fair amount in order to utilize. I\u0027ve been playing with this mod since before Angel added in the costs to swap the buildings and not once have I encountered an issue where I was looking at the costs and wondering why they were so high. This also applies to the weights of the structures since I no longer carry them with me and instead build on site."}]}
