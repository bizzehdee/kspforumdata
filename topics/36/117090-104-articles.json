Just assumed it was inline, stupid me\n\u003E \n\nThe \u0027core\u0027 tank should be at 1.4375m diameter (set it to 1.25m diameter, and then set the \u0027diameter adjust\u0027 to 0.3, IIRC), and hit the \u0027prev nose\u0027 button once (this selects the soyuz nose adapter).   This sets the top of the adapter to be at 1.875m to line up cleanly with the upper stage, allows the RD-108 engine mount to lineup with the tank size, and gives proper proportions between the 1.875m boosters and core tank diameters.  I don\u0027t remember what length the main tank needs to be set to ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) (I just line it up visually), but I\u0027ll make some notes / set of instructions for those before too long (and craft files should be coming within a month; just waiting for the 1.1 update/breakage)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T18:32:49Z","Content":"And here is the -nearly finished- shuttle cargo bay / docking adapter textures (more so the docking adapter in this shot):\n\nGoing to do some small touchups to the coloring of the DA frame and/or struts (add some contrast between them), and then I think the base shuttle textures are about finished.\n\n![ql0DDz0.png](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DDz0.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T18:38:43Z","Content":"CKAN: You don\u0027t suppose that you having your mod on Curse has anything to do with this, [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)?
