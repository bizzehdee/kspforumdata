The fix removes the problematic (in 3D) shadows. Everything else seems to look awesome in 3D!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real 3D problem is the starfield background; this is rendered too close! This is most noticable in the Tracking Station where you can see the star-box is too small. As you zoom out, the planet etc. seems to go behind the stars! Very disorientating. Would it be possible to edit the star background? Ideally, the box would be much larger so it would be set behind the furthest an object could be zoomed out, doing that would solve the issue completely, making KSP awesome in 3D. (Though this might make the textures appear a little low rez.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an alternative, would it be possible for to allow people to edit the texture of the skybox\u0027s net i.e. use a graphics editor to remove the stars, leaving a black (featureless) space?

Skybox rendering is usually fine in any kind of 3D/stereographic setting because the camera used for the skybox is fixed permanently in the centre (or alternatively, the skybox is centered on the camera). If this is done correctly then scaling the box has zero visual impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you actually using for 3D? A \u0027correct\u0027 stereographic render should use two slightly different camera positions pointing slightly inwards to simulate the separation and focus of eyes. An optimal one will probably not render the skybox, UI or other \u0027fixed relative to the camera\u0027 elements twice either... if it is some depth buffer reconstruction thing then the better solution would be to not write out to the depth buffer with the skybox and to clear it - doing a single depth clear is often faster than doing none on modern hardware, including mobile devices, since each pixel starts from a known state enabling various optimisation strategies that are ruled out with \u0027buffer feedback\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious about replacing the skybox - the current one, whilst a relatively beautiful approximation of the milky way, is rather dull considering we are in an alien space with artistic freedom.

It generates the two cameras by using the z-buffer within DirectX. The z-buffer (IIRC) calculates where things should be relative to each other, what object occludes another, how big each should appear etc. 3D Vision converts the z-buffer information to camera vergence. As you can imagine not every game is 100% perfect but gaming in 3D is awesome! You pretty much remove the screen face of your monitor. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately for KSP the devs have drawn the skybox too close to the camera which mean the mission control building, and consequently the in space starfield, looks odd.

Pushing out the skybox might degrade the quality of the stars because the cube of the skybox (it really is a cube, you can see this when viewed in S3D) would need to expand to encompass the whole Kerbal star system and beyond!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the momemt it is too small and in S3D the planets cut though the \u0027box\u0027 which is really uncomfortable to view. The editing solution I mentioned would work because it replaces the box with black space so you wouldn\u0027t be able to if an object was clipping the box. I would rather black space than uncomfortable space anyday.
