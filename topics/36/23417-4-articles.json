Nothing can pass through the shield. Not matter, or energy, or gravity. The bubble would move in a straight line out of the solar system and galaxy, with the speed it had before turning on the bubble, but with no mass to be effected by the gravity well of a star, it would just KEEP GOING.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanets, stars, and any structure that gets in it\u0027s way would get a bite taken out of them by the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe propulsive effect is defined by a self-perpetuating positive/negative distortion created by the SHAPE of the distortion field, and since nothing could pass through the field, a driver would need to precisely calculate the time needed to turn on the field, at full acceleration, then the reverse acceleration time, then the time when the field needs to be turned off so that the micro-flickers of the field as it shifts the ship back into normal-space utilizes the higgs-field to accrue momentum, slowing down from superluminal to below just from the ship passing through space, like a plane with airbrakes opened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the ship would want to do this? To shed the alcubierre shock at below the speed of light, so that the ship does not receive any excess backscatter radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the pilot utilizes the frameshift engine (Technically it is the same engine, just without the bubble that allows superluminal travel, the frameshift effect can be seen as a completely different engine) to set a proper orbit, and then uses the frameshift to maneuver through the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what would it seem like inside an alcubierre bubble?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be dark, sort of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo light can pass through the bubble, so as soon as the computer finishes the timing calculations for the FTL movement, and the engine turns on, the stars would appear to blink out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, any light or radiation would be contained within the bubble with perfect efficiency, meaning that if you went on EVA (not wise to do at FTL, but assuming you are Jeb and did anyway), the flashlight on your suit would perfectly reflect off the domain \u0027wall\u0027 of the bubble. The ship would reflect some of the light, but a set percentage would be absorbed by the matter within the bubble, and that would dim the light down to nothing (in effect) after a little time delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you return from EVA, and buckle yourself in, as the pilot alerts the ship that the ship is about to begin braking maneuvers. (Higgs field-effect braking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou look out the window, and see stars start to flicker on and off, as the bubble becomes semi-permeable, and a hellish glare forms from the \u0027front\u0027 of the field (the direction the field was moving).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat glare is the alcubierre shock-wave, and as you watch, what appears to be a star flares in \u0027front\u0027 of the ship, flying away from the ship at a sizable percentage of the speed of light, so fast that the light and energy it is emitting is red-shifted to a nearly painful extent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilot then announces that the frameshift drive is active, and the ship starts to decelerate. You don\u0027t notice that, of course, as the frameshifting makes the ship \u0027fall\u0027 in a desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what it would be like.

That is why there is the alcubierre shock effect- to allow for high-enough energy densities to be taken into account, (In theory, at FTL delta-v between two objects, with the assumption that the bubble is impermeable, the energy density within the shock effect would be akin to that of the universe within less than 1/10th of a second of it\u0027s expansion, and therefore the energy can be, in effect, infinite), so it is perfectly reflective from the outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if the ship is under frameshift drive, then the factors are different. There would be a semi-silvered effect (Barely noticeable, unless you are outside the ship, and even then, mostly around the drive) around the ship, as the bubble is partly generated to allow the ship to be protected from gravitational shearing, but light would still pass through, as would large-enough clumps of matter (Asteroids bigger than the ship, planets, stars, etc.), but the ship would be effected by relativity, as the bubble is not perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... Stars and light sources from the \u0027front\u0027 (direction the ship is moving in while under power @ 100g\u0027s) would be severely blue-shifted, while light sources from behind the ship would be severely red-shifted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the gravitational point-source in front of the ship would act as a lens, further blue-shifting the light as it enters the point-source, but then red-shifting as the light crawls out of the gravity well.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to look for alcubierre ships, look for the supernova-bright flashes as the superluminal drives have the shock vented after a long journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to simplify- when the drive is in Alcubierre mode, the bubble is active, and nothing can penetrate the bubble- not light, not matter, not anything. If the drive is in frameshift mode, there is no significant bubble effect, so the light in front of the ship traveling at 100 g\u0027s would be blue-shifted significantly, while at the rear the effect would be a significant red-shift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the book \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPushing Ice\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E by Alistair Reynolds, a whole moon uses a massive frameshift engine to accelerate out of the solar system at 50G acceleration, taking nearby ships that are unfortunate enough to get sucked into it\u0027s semi-bubble to be towed along, taking the crew of the \u003Cem\u003ERockhopper\u003C/em\u003E and on a journey several billion years into the future. The front of the moon is described as \u0027a hellish landscape, where the blue-shifted starlight can drive a man mad\u0027, until the moon intersects with a secondary accelerator that provides a shield as the moon is accelerated to 10,000 g\u0027s, up to 99.9999999999999% the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to the wiki- I have the book, so hey.
