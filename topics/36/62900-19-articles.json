Can you clarify please? I\u0027d rather not have to run both if I can help it, but I think I do want configurability, which brings me on to my next point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStagerecovery - why did you opt for 75% of base recovery value? Was it for simplicity? To my mind it should work like this: as parts are added to your inventory, you shouldn\u0027t have to pay for them again (except for fuel). I don\u0027t know how codeable that is though, so I have an alternative, which is 100% recovery (based on distance for KSC) for everything, OR change active vessels to 75% recovery as well (but thats probably outside the scope of this mod). Having said that you are making it configurable in the mod, so I\u0027ll wait for an answer for point one before making my mind up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaaand, a feature request. Currently (ie 23.5 version) the warp to completion button will slow warp as the deadline approaches. This is good, however, if you turn timewarp on yourself, when the timer reaches 0, you are lurched violently out of warp, which can introduce floating point errors and mess up orbits/transfers. Currently I work around this by putting a raw alarm in KAC, but it would be nice if it slowed itself down anyway (as KAC does).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, cheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I love your mod,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmikesecrist3","CreatedById":99603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T16:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh the work to recondition the pad can start soon after launch, and it can go on well your doing other things. there might be was to hurry things along, I seem to recall 2 Titan launches back in Gemini less then a week apart.

It would start as soon as you launch and would take some amount of time dependent on the size of the craft you launch (in my mind currently it\u0027s 1 day per 10 tons launched, divided by the sum of your applicable build rates). With that method, increasing build rates will decrease reconditioning time.

If SR isn\u0027t installed then KCT will recover funds at 75% of what you would get if you were manually landing the stage (therfore modified by distance from KSC, so max 75% at KSC and min 7.5% on the other side of Kerbin). I chose 75% for balance reasons. You\u0027re getting recovery of something that is pretty easy to exploit (just strap some parachutes to literally everything) without having to do much, if any, work for it (you don\u0027t even have to watch them land). I feel like the convenience is worth a price, and it\u0027s still better than what stock offers of 0% \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably make it configurable in KCT too, I just also feel like I make things too configurable sometimes and wonder what settings people are using.

Making it configurable is very easy to do though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStageRecovery is a separate mod that just takes the booster recovery code from this and makes it available without all the other KCT bulk.

Is that with ForceStopWarp active? I think the Settings Menu version is \u0022Force Stop TimeWarp on Complete?\u0022.

It\u0027s just for estimating build times in the editor at different build rates (clicking the \u0022*\u0022 button will cycle through the appropriate build rates that you currently have). As for your first question, DebRefund is not needed as KCT has it\u0027s own funds recovery. If it is installed then KCT won\u0027t do funds recovery but will still recover parts (but no message is given by KCT). DebRefund is in fact NOT RECOMMENDED to use with KCT at the current time, until the author adds the compatibility we talked about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is because our recovery requirements are different. It\u0027s possible that KCT would recover something that DebRefund wouldn\u0027t, not giving a message about the recovery (and not returning funds). The reverse is possible too, where DebRefund recovers something but KCT doesn\u0027t, meaning you\u0027ll be given a message by DebRefund saying parts were recovered but they wouldn\u0027t be added to KCT\u0027s part inventory. If you need science or kerbal recovery (which KCT does not do and will not do, since you shouldn\u0027t drop Kerbals or science on lift off) then my other mod StageRecovery may suffice until DebRefund adds the requested compatibility. StageRecovery uses the same recovery requirements as KCT so they will work together just fine. Science and Kerbal recovery is disabled by default with StageRecovery though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, if your build rate is still at 0.1 BP/s, you will definitely want to spend some of your upgrades (Open the build list, click the upgrades button.
