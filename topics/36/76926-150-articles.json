It\u0027s really frustrating when the only thing close to having a realistic tank battle is when tanks run in straight lines, not taking cover and stuff. When you\u0027re implementing this consider letting the AI tanks use the terrain around them, including the KSC buildings to go into hull down positions and angle their armor with their vulnerable sides against a building or a steep terrain feature. Maybe even implement some kind of AI coordination system, where tanks would pin enemy tanks and another friendly tank could go around and flank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a suggestion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to be able to add a \u0022fuse\u0022 to a shell. So that when it hits a part and or meets a certain condition, a fuse will activate. When the fuse runs out, it explodes as normal. And when a shell hits a part it has a chance to go through or penetrate the part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought this would be useful because during my tank battles (In KSP), it is VERY hard to disable the internal components of a tank due to the toughness of those structural panels, making it very time consuming to kill just one tank. This suggestion would help because when the user configures a turret\u0027s ammo to activate it\u0027s fuse when it penetrates something. It makes some sort of APHE shell. Basically when a shell hits a structural panel, it\u0027s fuse would activate. While it\u0027s fuse is counting down the shell goes even deeper into the internal components of the tank, and when the fuse runs out KABOOM. The internal components of the tank would get rekt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may think this is quite overpowered. But there should be a few parameters that could prevent the shell from penetrating the armor and delivering the explosive content upon the insides of the tank. For example, one basic one is to increase the chance that shells could bounce off angled armor, since the shell is not exploding on contact, it has many reasons to just bounce away. One more parameter is to set a \u0022shell strength\u0022. One problem with most WWII shells is that due to the shock of hitting the armor plate they could disintegrate before penetrating the armor, doing virtually nothing to the armor and crew inside (If you\u0027re curious to how they solved this problem, they just used caps to reduce the shock of the shells hitting the armor, thus some shells are named APBC, or armor piercing ballistic cap. Meaning that the shell has a ballistic cap, the thingy that reduces the shock from the armor). One more solution is to make the shell undergo \u0022shock/penetration tests\u0022 each time they go through armor, so there is a chance they would disintegrate everytime a shell has to pen an armor plate. So the user could just stack a lot of armor plates on top of eachother, or create Sch\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrzen type armor (Spaced armor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the user plain does not want this feature. They could just set the fuse timer by right clicking in the turret and setting the fuse timer to \u0022zero\u0022 (So they would explode immediately). Turrets will have their own individual fuse timers. Users could also just disable it through the Alt \u002B B menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DsGGKEE.gifv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIf you did not understand this wall of text, here is a proof of concept GIF i put together in GIMP.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading through this gigantic wall of text!
