I\u0027m kind of a fan of the Extraplanetary Launchpads mod, which piggybacks on Kethane to add its own ore resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Regarding the often mentioned \u0022maybe we will add SCANsat functionality to all capsules and probes, but you can also do so yourself\u0022, I was thinking: there could be a simpler, more fitting way. Namely, adding the functionality to antennas instead. In contrast to all the capsules and probe cores, there\u0027s only three antennas, so it\u0027s much less work. Also, these parts are woefully underutilized. Capsules have tons of options in their rightclick menu, adding more just overloads the UI even more. On the antennas, there\u0027s no overcrowding, and it gives the player a reason to mount antennas on all spaceships. I mean, what RL spaceship would launch without communications equipment? Yet in stock KSP, antennas are mere convenience options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also makes sense from a logical standpoint, because all you\u0027re basically doing here is connecting to the satellite network to download the map data. Clearly, giving a communications device this functionality is very believable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotential ideas there include having the SCANsat button only show up when the antenna is extended (cloning the behavior of the transmit science button), and potentially having a small energy draw while SCANsat is connected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T15:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvidently, I have the dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I get SCANSat to actually appear in JSI RPM?
