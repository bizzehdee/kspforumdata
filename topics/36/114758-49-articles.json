One part with the bases etc and one for the storage system so they could coexist. Also thought about splitting the parts that were added for mods into a third sub-mod...or lets say a mod-suppor- addon so one has more options to decide what to use and what not.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But this would have been a pain to maintain and also would eventually break the mod for everyone that has used it before...so this was not a good idea. But the rover would be in a separte mod.\n\u003E \n\nYay! Rovers confirmed in the future. It can wait. Seeing this mod to its completion is its own reward. And plus, this mod makes base building pratical to a much larger degree than the stock parts allow. I still cant stop praising this mod, over a month or two after first getting it.
