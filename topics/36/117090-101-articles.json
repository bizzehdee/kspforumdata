For example, the Skylab was originally conceptualized using this \u0027wet workshop\u0027 concept. Since you are in the \u0027early concept dev\u0027 stage, I figured this was a good time to mention it as it certainly doesn\u0027t seem like a feature that could be thrown in at the end.\n\u003E \n\nGlad that stuff worked out well for you.  There is still a load of improvements and new variants that could be done with the MSRBs, just hoping that the few that I did up work as a good enough example ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nWill consider a fuel-\u003Ehab conversion;  I\u0027m honestly not sure if you can alter the crew-capacity of a part at run-time...it is one of the first things I\u0027ll be investigating when I start working on the station stuff.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 5:29 PM, MatttheCzar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My mistake, Service Module.

It likely won\u0027t be Apollo styled, but it will have options for longer/shorter/different bay options.

Very few of my parts use actual procedural mesh generation; most of the parts are made modular by swapping in and out pre-compiled models, and adjusting stats accordingly.  So... need some models to swap between to get started.  For probe cores this would likely start as a set of probe bodies (a few sizes if not using scaling, possible variants as well), perhaps some trasmitters and dishes/antennas, solar-panels/generators, possibly some experiment/science bits.  Oh, and they would all need to be modeled in such a manner that some of the models can be swapped out without disrupting the overall look or layout;  so your probe bodies would likely want a few \u0027attachment points\u0027 for the swappable bits, possibly different sized attach-points for different classes of attachment.  It is / will be a -very- similar setup to most sci-fi-ship based games;  start with a basic hull with \u0027hardpoints\u0027 that get filled with various goodies.  And...thats about all the concept work I\u0027ve done for that stuff so far ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nFrom there it would need the custom module work to link it all together, position the models, scale stuff (if needed), and do the module-swapping for any modular bits that need special code to drive them (e.g. for the antennas, science experiments).  It would be a few weeks before I could do much regarding the probe-core stuff (though would likely take that long to get the first batch of models created).  The probe cores (and stations/bases/service modules/rovers) are all going to need module-switching capability, which I\u0027ve not yet written the code for (and don\u0027t plan on starting until the 1.1 update is finished).\n\nIf this all sounds good to you, feel free to shoot me a PM when you have time and we can start going over more details.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Skylab was not a fuel tank converted into a hab while in space, it was an old tank Saturn 3rd stage tank converted on the ground into a lab and then launched on top of a Saturn V.

It fits fine (attachment wise), but the bell is larger than the tank, and it still has about 2x the thrust it needs (TWR \u003E= 1.5; could be far less then half of that).\n\u003E \n\nThe Lockheed/Bell Agena engine family would fit well.  Most of the later Agena probe cores had a tank that narrowed down to the rocket bell from stock size (in case of KSP from 1.25 down to 0.625)   The Agena-D engine would have most of it\u0027s motive components buried in the tail of the fuel tank anyway...  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM-81_Agena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM-81_Agena)\n\nLots of pictures on the Wikipedia link showing the various Agena configs.   On the Agena Target (for Gemini) the smaller section between the fuel tank and the smaller yet Bell Rocket is the Mono Tanks and lower assembly RCS thruster block (with additional forward thrusters to assist fine maneuvering.)\n\nAlso Agena is great for making early satellites out of... After all it was the CORE of several early Recon Sats as well as other Sats!"}]}
