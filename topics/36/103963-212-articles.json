I will add it later as a per-planet option anyway.  \n\n-Clouds in the main menu or the tracking station might be messed up or completely black, this will be fixed later.  \n\n-Same for viewing distant planets from map view.  \n\n-There might be an exception about a key not being in the dictionary if you have the option on without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed. This is harmless and should only appear once every scene change. It will be fixed later.  \n\n-I only did a basic config for Kerbin, there are 4 new variables you can play with for the clouds.  \n\n-The stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E cloud colors for Laythe and Eve may not work vey well for this, might look better with just white clouds, experiment.  \n\n-I suspect having 5 cloud layers on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E is a bad idea with this but I\u0027ll let you find out if it\u0027s the case.  \n\n-If you want overly dramatic red volumetrics like the ones I posted above, set volumetricsColorMultiplier to 3, it will not match up well with the 2d clouds though, better control will be added later.  \n\n-Water reflection is fixed  \n\n-\u0022Mountains going white over the horizon\u0022 should be fixed if you use the new cloud integration and not the old draw over clouds option.  \n\n-\u0022Disable Scaled space ambient light\u0022 is fixed.  \n\n-Sky and orbit shaders reverted from soft blending to old blending mode.\n\nReport any other issue and enjoy: [https://mega.nz/#!yEQiwYra!ba4MVcJlH69P51-AE-yJ4ad7-lOEMSKnvikDKfGObh0](https://mega.nz/#!yEQiwYra!ba4MVcJlH69P51-AE-yJ4ad7-lOEMSKnvikDKfGObh0)\n\nPinging the usual suspects: [@Proot](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98932-proot/) [@Poodmund](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128643-poodmund/) [@Galileo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150430-galileo/) [@Astronomer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/18673-astronomer/) [@pingopete](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/74168-pingopete/) [@sDaZe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111181-sdaze/) [@V8jester](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136093-v8jester/) [@cobbman11](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76711-cobbman11/)  \n\n(sorry if I forgot anyone)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-07T19:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2016 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"}]}
