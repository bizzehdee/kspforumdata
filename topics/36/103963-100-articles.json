I haven\u0027t added that option yet but you could just set the postprocessing alpha to zero in the configpoints for now.\n\nIn earlier versions of scatterer, to edit the config height you had to generate new configs with the config tool. You could still just try going in the settings and changing Rg but it will definitely cause other issues.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T16:27:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Binho","CreatedById":142470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T17:16:25Z","Content":"Hey Blackrack!
