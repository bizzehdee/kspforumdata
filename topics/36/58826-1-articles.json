I am assuming that has something to do with the way the resource calculations are perpetrated for an RCS thruster, namely that it is something like thrust = isp/mass, and electricity has a mass of 0 in this case, so it can\u0027t do it. I have looked at the wiki and it doesn\u0027t list any of the RCS thruster specific properties, so I am really left wondering. Does anyone else know?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adamkdean","CreatedById":148910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T15:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having this issue too.
