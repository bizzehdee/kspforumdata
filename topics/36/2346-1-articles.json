The only caveat to the name is you can\u0027t use an underscore followed by a number because that\u0027s how the program tracks multiple instances of the same part within a craft. The first LFT would be fuelTank_1, the second fuelTank_2 and so on (the game actually uses a much longer random number). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we as a community have been doing is adding the abbreviation of our make believe companies to the front of the folder name, for example, mbr_fuelTank would be a fuel tank from my Monkey Business Rocketry.
