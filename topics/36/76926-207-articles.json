The AI targeting needs improvement and upgrade to current targeting standards. Possibly RCS and overall fuel supply needs improvement to handle longer ranges\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There currently is no way to use the AI to pilot craft in space. This needs addressing, if possible. I foresee the possibility that it may require setting up specific ranges and speeds that the A.I. will consider suitable for combat maneuvering. As in - the A.I. can only handle maneuvering for intercept or pointing a ship within those restrictions. Such as restricting maneuvers that will drop an A.I. piloted craft too low and intersect atmosphere or raise the orbit too high and wind up on escape velocity, or use too much fuel combined with the above, etc, etc. I accept that it may not be possible to solve this without player input. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Guard mode I think needs longer loading range options for space. Both visually and with radar. In practical terms 20-25 miles radar range is WAY too small for practical use in space. Optical acquisition would in theory be far more useful. Though one could argue the semantics in a scientific sense - radio waves are simply another form of light just farther along the radiation spectrum from visible light. What range for determining a threat is practical? Does anyone think that light speed delay should be a factor at extreme range? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffhanded thought - anybody ever play the original Traveller Pen and Paper RPG?
