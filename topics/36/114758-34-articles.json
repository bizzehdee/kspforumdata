That is already fixed in my work-version. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) It is really good that RPM now supports the ability to toggle the transparent windows off.

It\u0027s much less of a headache to make sure things are working then release the update as a whole.\n\nAnd a \u0022hotfix\u0022 isn\u0027t a small thing despite the name, it\u0027s still a patch or set of replacement files, this takes effort to make and takes effort from development, especially if the fix was a stopgap that has to be worked around when the real update comes later.\n\nSo I very much doubt Nils can make a \u0022hotfix\u0022 for this, please be patient for the proper updated release ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T19:17:36Z","Content":"Yay for CTT support!
