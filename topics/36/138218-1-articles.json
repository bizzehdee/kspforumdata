Once I am able to display it via in game buttonclick events, 2) I\u0027d like a radial gauge widget to appear similar in shape to a compass. Are there any good examples of both of those you could point me to. I\u0027ve looked through Github at example code but a lot of the code is a mess and almost none of it is commented. All of the tutorials like the one above are close but not quiet what I am looking for. I feel like I need to use Unity to create a UI gameobject and then import that gameobject into KSP but I am unsure if that is the right course and if it is, how to even begin doing that. Thank you in advance for your help.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T06:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 1.1 you are better off creating the UI in Unity if it is of custom shape and/or more than just a simple window. This thing is pretty new, but you can try to look at some simple code in latest Beta for Sequencer (check my signature). Look inside SequecerGUI class for a method InitSettingsWindow()\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have to tie the UI to a part, you can have a Monobehaviour as your KSPAddon that runs, for example, in Flight mode. You can see the syntax for it in the same file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook for Unity docs on Monobehavoir for more details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
