However, this also meant we couldn\u0027t restrict it to just crafts with a KF repulsor unit on it. Instead, we have now moved it back to a part module, but it is added to the root of the craft when the flight scene is initialized from the repulsor modules, so it should only affect repulsor enabled craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know that, but theres no reason why the middle wheels should be behaving like that, even if they aren\u0027t on solid ground.

However, there are some differences with my installation than the standard one. lo-fi experimented with retractable wheels a while back and some of those settings remain in some of the parts despite there being no animation to go along with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027d like you to try something for me and see how it goes, if you\u0027re comfortable with editing some part files. First off, go into the KF directory, then the Parts folder, and look for \u0022WheelLarge.cfg\u0022 and open that up. Under the module named \u0022KFModuleWheel\u0022 you\u0027ll see some parameters that go along the lines of \u0022hasRetract\u0022 or some such. I don\u0027t have those lines in front of me and I need to leave the house like 5 minutes ago, so bear with me. Some of those parameters will be set to \u0022True\u0022 and I want you to set anything that has to do with retracting to \u0022False\u0022 or, alternatively, just delete that parameter from the module. Relaunch the game and relaunch the craft. (Re-attach the wheels if you can spend the time) Let me know if this changes anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In theory, the part might be getting stuck in a \u0022retracted\u0022 state which would effectively make it unresponsive in much the same way you are describing.
