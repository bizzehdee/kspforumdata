One of the biggest problems to solve will be dealing with the stock docking port UI code; cleaning it up and hiding it in favor of a single module that would run the UI for multiple port modules (and keep them in synch somehow).\n\nEdit:  This particular implementation also doesn\u0027t solve needing a total of two parts per booster-to-be-mated; solving that would require that the docking ports (both models and code) be integrated directly into the fuel tanks... which I don\u0027t think will be happening.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-08T15:08:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2017 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T15:18:39Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s obviously going to be a part sink, you need symmetric ports on the core, and then one on each tank.\n\n![maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gZFlKc3TZoQ/maxresdefault.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T15:22:08Z","Content":"I think the stock docking module may support some sort of alignment check now.
