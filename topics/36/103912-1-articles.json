Right now I have only done the two containers and they are far from done.\n\nBut I decided to show you guys my work to get feedback and suggestions and mostly to see if there is any interest ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe parts use the same .cfg as with the mod with some modifications. I tested it and they should work just like the orgininal ones. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Download**: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-pq4KhmYle3M0xaYWlreVcxaGc\u0026authuser=0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-pq4KhmYle3M0xaYWlreVcxaGc\u0026authuser=0)\n\nJust install like any other part, it will automaticly be placed in the KAS/Parts folder. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I have had no contact with the original develeoper of this mod and therefor I take no credit for anything. Rright now this should be seen a addictonal parts and no replacement.\n\nSo like I said please leave some feedback and suggestions. Hopefully more parts are to come. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T12:30:08Z","Content":"You do realize that the containers of KAS are going to be depreciated, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Lucius","CreatedById":89422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:31:49Z","Content":"Indeed, you need to look into Kerbal Inventory System"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:31:52Z","Content":"Please also make some nice looking inline containers."},{"CreatedByName":"Gue__1","CreatedById":97916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:47:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You do realize that the containers of KAS are going to be depreciated, right?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please also make some nice looking inline containers.\n\nI see.... well that is a unexpected change. ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif) This will require some brainstorming\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please also make some nice looking inline containers.\n\nThere is a mod with inline containers but I forgot the name.
