Alternatively would it be possible to create 4 seperate FX trails and position them in the correct locations, or would this be an issue with performance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Will try and post pics later but I\u0027m now away from my home computer for a couple of days (though I do have a copy of the files on a memory stick) so trying to do what tinkering I can to the CFGs in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-15T15:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you can add more than one exhaust trail. There\u0027s a massive engine part on here somewhere, I mean it\u0027s just a freaking HUGE nozzle, and it has multiple flames on the bottom instead of a large scaled up one. That might be a start to getting more than one flame. As far as scaling it up, I\u0027ve no idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1909","CreatedById":5178,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-16T08:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Capt\u0027n.
