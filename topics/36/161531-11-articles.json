The Timberwind Reactors on which they are based operated at 3000 K, and we had already come to an agreement to use a compromise value of 2750 K for balance... 2750 K is 10% hotter than 2500 K, and as heat-radiation is to the fourth-power of radiator temperature, this makes a BIG difference in the efficiency of electric generators and required mass of radiators...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you end up using a ISPMultiplier for the Thermal Rockets such that you felt it necessary to reduce the reactor temperatures versus what we decided on before or something? If so, it\u0027s worth considering that the effect of that is that the reactors require quite a bit more radiator mass when not running in open-cycle mode (that is, when not pumping their ThermalPower into the propellant stream of a Thermal Rocket), thus effectively posing a significant penalty to nuclear electric propulsion when using Particle Bed Reactors... Of course, maybe that was your intention all along (Molten Salt Reactors sill have the 3200 K operating temperature we decided on- so they are unaffected), I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the effects on nuclear-electric propulsion and Microwave Beamed Power, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, did you fix TweakScale being unable to recognize when players have upgraded heat radiators and defaulting to the \u0022Mo Li\u0022 version rather than graphene-radiators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast I checked this was still an issue- which means you end up needing even more radiator mass for your Gas Core Reactors... (which operate hot enough to benefit from the radiator upgrades, and don\u0027t have their ThermalPower adversely affected by temperature to the degree that you need such a large amount of radiator mass as that you never benefit from the higher maximum temperature of the radiators regardless like with Dusty Plasma and Particle Bed reactors...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last but major note about Graphene radiators- they are currently too weak compared to real life.

Any body with a thermal emissivity between 0 and 1 is thus known as a \u0022grey body\u0022, and this encompasses most known materials in the universe, including anything you would normally make a heat radiator out of without nano-engineering...
