I know I\u0027m missing something but I haven\u0027t been able to figure it out. I went to the trouble of modeling my own docking port in Blender (dimensionally identical to the Clamp-O-Tron Jr.) then imported it into Unity. I used the cfg file for Clamp-O-Tron Jr. changing only the name to match my new port. It looks great connects to other parts in the VAB, but it will not function as a docking port. I\u0027ve read everything I can find on docking ports and your kind replies to my previous questions about docking ports. I\u0027m just becoming more confused and bewildered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help.
