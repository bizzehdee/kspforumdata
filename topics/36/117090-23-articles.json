Shadowmage already made his plugin to communicate with RO/RF, so that is a thing that already works, maybe a MM patch for a stockalike RF config could be offered for those willing to use non-stock fuels but also not interested in having RO?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E the texturing looks amazing Shadow, I\u0027ll have to ask you for a quick tips\u0027n\u0027tricks tutorial one day ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E as for ISP/thrust/mass stuff - personally I liked a kind of simple approach of KW rocketry mod. So the higher thrust, the more mass and then lower isp. Most of engines were quite balanced. Also you might consider adding delay to thrust change; I also liked this thing in KW rocketry - the biggest engines had helluva delay so they couldn\u0027t be used efficiently for vac operations, also the delay meant that they used a bit of fuel before getting to 100% thrust and lift off thus further reducing their effective isp.\n\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t take KR-2L, or the biggest engine as isp point of reference; for me their isp is weird and they are too op; so I would expect that squad might nerf them sooner or later. You might take a look at awesome but not updated anymore rebalance of engines by stupid\\_chris:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14)\n\u003E \n\u003E I used this mod extensively when I used to play KSP (hehe)\n\u003E \n\u003E I think that he basically downgraded isp of largest engines and upgraded smaller engines so they all followed the rule - bigger engine - higher thrust - less isp. In this way every engine had its purpose.\n\u003E \n\u003E Another (maybe future), more complicated approach would be to divide engines into RP-1/LOX and LH2/LOX (and CH4/LOX?). Then introduce new fuel tanks for that engines (LH2 being much bigger/heavier for the same amount mass of fuel etc), or add another fuel config (LH2/LH2\u002BOx)for your existing tanks. You can see what Nertea did in his LH2/LOX cryogenic engines mod; from what I remember at least for vacuum engines, the higher isps were offset by higher tank mass so in the end vac engines were maybe 5-7% better dV-wise than their counterparts. I think that for SL engines LH2 and LF engines have similar performance so I think personally I wouldn\u0027t bother using them since it meant higher, more unstable rockets (with bigger 1st stage) with the same performance.\n\nFeel free to hit me up sometime, am more than willing to share whatever tips/tricks/techniques that I can. I would still not consider myself an artist, but I\u0027ve learned enough tricks to let this programmer/engineer make some decent looking textures.\n\nSetting up an RF patch might be in store for the future. Would love to set these engines and such up in a bit more realistic manner (at least in regards to fuel/ISP). I still have some problems with the way others\u0027 have balanced fuel tanks for LH2 though, which is one of the main things keeping me from supporting that as a fuel at all (mostly the ........ mass fractions... 30-50% by mass; where real mass fractions for LH2 are LOWER than for the RP1 tanks (3.5%-10%), not triple to quadruple the value).\n\nEngine delay - easy enough to add in through a patch. Not sure if I want it as the default behaviour (as it is not the stock behaviour), but is something that could be looked into at some point. I suppose I\u0027ve already slightly set precedence by setting all the gimbals to be not-instant, so will probably do something similar for the larger engines (mostly just the lifters / multipurpose engines).\n\nOn that note.... should I include stock based full-range engine throttling, or something a bit more realistic?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hopefully the RS-68?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, sorry. Anyways, one more thing.\n\u003E What\u0027s next after the F1?\n\nHere is what will be finished next - F1B\n\n--Mostly because I already had the unwrap 3/4 done from the full F1... (only took like 1 1/2-2 hours for unwrap/layout). Will be working on texturing it for the rest of the day/til it is done. Next up will be the unwrap \u002B texture on the initial mount selection (4 models). -Might- be able to squeeze in one more engine this week as long as it is one where the geometry is mostly finished already (so.. RS-68 is really the only good candidate; the rest need tons of geo work still).\n\nTexturing not even started yet, this is just a raw AO bake:\n\n![KLNGaDK.png](http://i.imgur.com/KLNGaDK.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T21:28:17Z","Content":"Thoughts on engine balance:\n\n**Isp** - Stock Isp is about right for kerolox, so I\u0027d say for real kerolox engines just use their real Isp. For hydrolox, RealFuels has a conversion factor of 1.3 at sea level and 1.27 in vacuum. It doesn\u0027t have to be exactly that, but somewhere in that range seems to produce reasonable values.\n\n**Thrust** - My first thought is to just go with the scaling, so if the engine is 64% scale, then the thrust should be 64% ^2 = 40.96%, but there are a few problems with this: (1) A stack with the same proportions as in real life will have a higher TWR, but this is mitigated somewhat by higher engine, tank, and payload weight in KSP, (2) Greater fuel density means that the (previously) hydrolox engines won\u0027t be quite right. So maybe give them a thrust boost to compensate for this ... the RF conversions give about 1.33 but this might be a bit low ... maybe more like 1.5.\n\n**TWR** - I\u0027d say just start with the RL TWR and multiply by a constant.

I only had to use Sketchup at work for engineering/CAD stuff, before I was familliar with using Blender (though, probably could have used blender had I taken the time to learn it; it is so much more powerful). I have little idea what powers sketchup has for texturing/baking, but I believe they are non-existent.\n\nBlender, on the other-hand, is one of the most powerful (and convoluted/unfriendly) pieces of software I have every played with (and its free!). Even as it, I am only using a small fraction of the features it offers (though, most are not really applicable to modeling game-assets; many of its features are for internal scene design and rendering). The learning curve is steep though; more cliff-like than curved. Granted, I\u0027ve never played with Maya or 3DSMax, so they could actually be much easier to use or more powerful, I wouldn\u0027t really know (not being a modeler/artist by training, I never had reason to invest in such expensive software; whereas VS2010Pro I got \u0027free\u0027 when I was in school).\n\nEdit -- I use GIMP for texturing work; again mostly because it is free, and I\u0027ve never had the need (or the gobs of cash lying around) for Photoshop.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-06T19:04:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T19:11:20Z","Content":"yah blender is nerve-wrecking at first but then it has many advantages as a free open source software; many free add-ons (including taniwha\u0027s KSP assets import addon) and great support; most of problems can be googled since 99% of the time someone had similar problem before ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T19:15:05Z","Content":"And...I think I\u0027ve found a good balance on the... erhm.. engine balance.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJtB_ma_ZW1HGOtkfO05KQm07zoGvmkGY3JZFbHs0s4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJtB_ma_ZW1HGOtkfO05KQm07zoGvmkGY3JZFbHs0s4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nCheck it out if you have a moment and let me know what you think of the ISP values for the given list of engines. It is essentially a normalization of the real-world ISP values for the engines against the clipped ISP curve of KSP engines. Basically the lowest ISP real-life engine will use the lowest KSP engine ISP, the highest real-life will use the highest KSP, and everything else has been rebalanced inbetween based on where it sits in the real-life ISP distribution.\n\nWorking on thrust/TWR/mass at the moment. TWR will be roughly 1/4 of what the real-engine has, and the mass will for each part will be derived from the thrust and TWR. Should likely have something figured out by the end of the day.

I\u0027m leaving the old ones in place for a few releases until I can get the balance sorted out on the new stuff.\n\nSpeaking of balance, what do you guys think of the stats on the new engines and updated rs-25 stats?\n\nI think they are pretty close, but could perhaps use a thrust increase all around, and perhaps even another bump in the LH2 engine\u0027s thrust. I\u0027ve noticed the thrust on LH2 engines is generally poor compared to the RP1 engines, as in real-life they don\u0027t need to push as much fuel mass (and plumbing/fuel density differences), however this does not translate well to KSP with its single type of (dense) fuel.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Shadow, why didn\u0027t you fix the EUS fairing issue?\n\nWhat issue?
