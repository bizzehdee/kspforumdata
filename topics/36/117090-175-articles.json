Is a true/false value, defaulting to false.  Currently it does not return any resources from deflation (may change/make that configurable in the future).  \n\nExample usage in a patch:\n\n    @PART[partNameHere]\n    {\n      @MODULE[SSTUInflatable]\n      {\n        %canDeflate = true\n      }\n    }\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you wanted to make your own spaceplane add-on, seems like you could have them stretch by segments, right? The stretches are discrete, so 1xmk2 hull, 2xmk2 hull, 3xmk2 hull, and so forth, right?\n\u003E \n\nYou can already make an MFT-style tank out of the stock spaceplane/mk2 parts and adapters.  It could then include adapter switching, scaling, and fuel switching.  You could even pre-weld multiple segments of tanks together to make super-long single-part tank options.  The body-lift wouldn\u0027t scale with the tank diameter or lengths, as that is something that would need to be coded into the plugin/partmodule.\n\nI, however, have no current interest in doing spaceplane or other aero related parts.  Fairly good procedural wing mods already exist, the stock mk2/3 tanks can already be MFT-ized if someone really wanted, and I\u0027m really not that interested in designing or using spaceplanes.

I\u0027m thinking of just axing those textures (which I know is trivial to do), but your other stuff is so much nicer, at some point that trims a little off the size.\n\n2. Fairing textures---They are anti-aliased along the edges, whereas the stripes on the tank textures are clean edges.\n\n3.

Unless you introduce more of those two rotation axis panels. I love them. Thinking about it, it would be nice to be eable to scale down the ST-MST-ISS a bit. The structure is proportionaly too big for the rest of station part I think. You can put that at the bottom of the already long nice to have list if you wish."}]}
