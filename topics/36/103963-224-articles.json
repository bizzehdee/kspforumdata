I noticed another thing, in my career mode i use a mod called PlanetShine and while it works perfectly with version 0.0256 it doesn\u0027t work well with the experimental version, all but one function of PlanetShine aren\u0027t working, only the PlanetShine light intensity works. I know that PlanetShine is not your responsibility and I prefer to use Scatterer than PlanetShine. I don\u0027t have a log file at this moment but if you need one I\u0027ll post it here.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And I\u0027m sorry but I don\u0027t know how to use Imgur correctly, I don\u0027t know what are the correct links to put a image here, I\u0027m a noob in this things.\n\u003E \n\nI will check with planetshine, do I just grab the latest version? Also the lighting in the second image doesn\u0027t look right at all, for me ingmae it still looks like the first image. Which experimental version you use? The one from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

The Scatterer that i used to do the second image was the one that you shared in this page, the scattererTrackingStation.zip. In relation to the planetshine its the latest version witch is  v0.2.5.2. But the images that i show you were only with scatterer. maybe its better for me to test again and post here a log file."},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T20:40:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, PmThay said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E hi, thanks for the response.

Does it happen at any and all altitudes? Can it happen at say, an orbit of 3000km?"}]}
