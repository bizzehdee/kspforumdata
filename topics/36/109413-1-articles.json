It\u0027s a great idea that I\u0027d like to use in my own game, but I was a bit put off that it re-purposed stock parts rather than using a custom part. However, rather than complain to the mod\u0027s creator, I decided to make one myself. Here\u0027s my model:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/qlsEp)\n\nAs you can see, I only have a placeholder texture so far (just the AO layered over a metallic texture I downloaded). \n\nThis is where I need help. I don\u0027t really have an eye for this type of thing, so everything I\u0027ve tried adding to it so far has looked... strange. I\u0027m looking for suggestions for how I should texture this model: what the tanks should look like, any decals or warning labels, etc. Just to clarify, I\u0027m not asking *how* to texture, I think I know my way around GIMP and Blender well enough. What I want to know is how to make it looks like it belongs in KSP.\n\nAny advice is appreciated,\n\nAurum6"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T12:29:49Z","Content":"If it\u0027s atmospheric, it has to be streamlined.\n\nIf it\u0027s atmospheric, and designed to be flown from the ground, up into space, then re-enter, it must look like it has some sort of thermal shielding.\n\nBasically, take your pick of stock Mk1/2 textures, make a dark pit for the intake and have your pick of protruding tank colours.

A hot chemical reactor running on Mars/Duna would heat quicker than on Earth/Kerbin due to the thinner atmosphere and lack of radiators. Since sunlight is low, the black color helps it radiate its heat away."},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T23:45:10Z","Content":"White, to radiate heat."}]}
