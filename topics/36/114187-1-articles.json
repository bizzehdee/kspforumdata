Notepad just gave me a jumbled mess, so it\u0027s obviously more than just a config file I could copy, alter, and paste back into the directory. Any assistance here would be great. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T01:06:34Z","Content":"The DirectDraw Surface (DDS) format is used for texture files. Because it is based on Microsoft\u0027s propiertary S3 compression algorithm, most programs aren\u0027t natively able to decode them.\n\nHowever, you don\u0027t need to examine the contents of a DDS file in order to create custom agency assets:\n\n* * *\n\nTo define an custom agency, you need three things:\n\n - A **Agents.cfg** file defining your custom agency\n\n - A **Large logo image** with dimensions of 256x160px, in **.DDS** file format, that would used in the Mission Control contracts screen\n\n - A **Small logo image** with dimensions of 64x40px, in **.truecolor** file format, that would be used in the VAB/SPH part list manufacturer filters\n\nThe general workflow is as follows:\n\n - Use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, Inkscape or GIMP to create the logo images on a transparent canvas\n\n - Save/export both images in **PNG** file format\n\n - For the large logo image, use the [KSP to DDS texture converter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter) to get the DDS file you need\n\n - For the small logo image, **don\u0027t convert it to DDS** (DDS conversion causes nasty artefacts in small images); instead, just rename that PNG to have the **.truecolor** file extension\n\n - Write up your **Agents.cfg** file, making sure it is referring to the correct file paths to the logo images\n\nTips:\n\n - Since the small logo image is going to be used in the VAB/SPH part list manufacturer filters, it is highly likely it will get scrunched up beyond recognition; simple logo designs work best\n\n - Don\u0027t put your custom agency stuff inside the GameData/Squad/Agencies folder; instead, create a new folder under GameData for your mod stuff, and a subfolder containing your agency assets:\n\n    -GameData    -Squad        -Agencies        -Parts        -(etc)    -TachyonSpaceTech    [B]\u003C----[/B]        -Agencies        -Parts        -(etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jexpler","CreatedById":198699,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-10T22:16:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/25/2015 at 9:06 PM, sumghai said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - A **Large logo image** with dimensions of 256x160px, in **.DDS** file format, that would used in the Mission Control contracts screen\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - A **Small logo image** with dimensions of 64x40px, in **.truecolor** file format, that would be used in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E part list manufacturer filters\n\u003E \n\nI did this but the logos are just white in game."}]}
