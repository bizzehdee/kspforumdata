It is an icy proceduraly generated asteroid moonlet inside Sarvin\u0027s rings.\n- One of Keelon\u0027s moons is now in eccentric retrograde orbit, being a proceduraly generated asteroid.\n- Manai\u0027s oceans now light at night.\n- Manai\u0027s oceans destroy your ship before even touching it because of extreme temperatures. Asteroids are instantly destroyed.\n- Made so the cryovolcano of Potatus is aligned better and isn\u0027t offset as in previous versions.\n- Made so the cryovolcano no longer uses Kittopia Space, but instead uses Kopernicus\u0027 own particle system.\n- Intergration with many rescale mods.\n- Intergration with many planet packs.\n- Optimises\n- Bugfixes\n- Intergration with science mods.\n\nCheers! Next week I want to finish the dwarf planets adding them PQS mods.
