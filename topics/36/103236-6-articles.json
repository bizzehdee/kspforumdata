If this mod uses them, that\u0027ll be handy since there are so few uses for skills.

This would give you a bit of leeway if you make a mistake but would start punishing you harder and harder the longer you went to prevent people from abusing it. This would also make it better for people who like to pull things with roleplaying out a scenario where with TAC you could technically under feed your kerbals and still complete a mission but the moment they passed that specific mark they are dead and no need for rescue. While this made for some interesting things, in my case kicking one of my kerbals out of the airlock on the way back from Jool so that the other could survive long enough to get the science home, it still made rescue missions impossible for far flung ships since by the time you realized you weren\u0027t going to have enough food they were too far out for you to get anything to them.\n\nI think I got off topic there so the TL;DR version is a good idea is to have them start breaking things after X days until X days have passed at which point you would need a living kerbal to come revive them."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T13:01:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E make a science lab or experiments no longer work\n\nEat the Mystery Goo?

Any ballpark figure as to how much Ec/s you\u0027re considering per Kerbal?\n\nAlso, if you end up implementing the ship dismantling feature, can we get the option of setting loss of crew as the second stage consequence? Or, even better: a config file that lets you set individual thresholds for each consequence. Like, default could be something along the lines of:\n\n    strike=15scavenge=30death=0\n\nWhere each number is the time elapsed since food ran out in Kerbal days, and 0 means disabled. That would allow for maximum flexibility for every playstyle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T11:26:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**\n  \nMobile browsing is awful"},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher48","CreatedById":135642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T23:28:40Z","Content":"Small problem: say I send a mission to minmus and get stranded because that totally happens.
