I will gladly take a non-replica capsule before adding non-standard docking port sizes.\n\nStill undecided on the Gemini rescale.  I really don\u0027t like the 1.40625m sizing; its doable with the MFT tanks, but not with any of the standard adapter ratios -- you would be forced to use an ISDC or engine fairing in order to get a smooth rocket when using the CM without the SM.\n\nStill a ways out (few days/weeks) from doing any real geometry work on those parts though, so have a bit of time to weigh the options and pros/cons.

No need for a model, as its all built through code.  Textures/masks already exist from either the decouplers or fairings (possibly with some UV adjustments).  The plugin code would be 95% copy of the decoupler code, with some adjustments to allow for separate control of top/bottom diameter, as well as adjusting the \u0027hollow collider\u0027 toggle to also toggle the visible mesh from solid/hollow.  One final tie-in to add resource capacity when in non-hollow configuration and to link into a VolumeContainer module, and I would call it a usable part ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nWill give this one a bit more thought before committing to anything.  What is proposed above would be quick to do, and functional and useful, but would also be very basic being limited to only cones and cylinders and existing textures/UV maps.  If I were to invest a bit more time (substantially more), I would love to add in things like curved sections with various profiles (adj?), and full multi-segment construction with custom GUI for the complete procedural tank (and fairing?) experience.  I might be willing to settle for \u0027quick-and-usable\u0027 in the near term (weeks), and put the full \u0027procedural part\u0027 bit on the longer-term todo list (it actually already is...).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 35 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The trick would be to allow a zero size tank body, or make a frustum of a cone SM/US.\n\u003E \n\nNot a trick at all... simply add \u0027Model-None\u0027 as an entry to the existing MUS main-body defs, and it should \u0027just work\u0027 from there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).  Sadly you would be limited to the fuel volume offered by the upper and lower adapters which have a limited selection, with your only other adjustment being the diameter.  The upper fairing would form the \u0027procedural part\u0027 bit of it, with limited height adjustment offered by the nose adapter currently selected.  More adapters could be added to increase the selections, if desired.  Feel free to try it out, and if it works out well I\u0027ll consider adding it as a new option (along with a slightly longer main tank / increasing the max scale limit a bit). \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The other command modules already have adjustable size node fairings, which can get you to the correct diameter.  1.5m for the CM and 2m for the SM makes the most sense to me\n\u003E \n\nThat seems like it would probably work out decently; and very good point on the node-fairings.  Those do come included when used in the stand-alone setup (lower attach node), so really its a non-issue; the adapter is built-in.  As long as the top node can be a standard size (or slightly larger), sounds like it will all work out.
