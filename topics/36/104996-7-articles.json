The release I\u0027m aiming for this week will have colliders simplified for all the parts, so I\u0027m hoping that could fix some of the lag users might have with lower spec computers.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My own more general experience suggests that the texture sizes may be excessive, and I have also see some crazy-excessive detail in IVAs.\n\nI\u0027ve been setting up the IVAs to share textures. But I still have a bit of optimization to do for the texture maps in the props folder (will do that closer to completion). I\u0027ve also removed the normal maps from the IVAs since I can get similar shadowing result with texturing, so that helped reduce the size for the pack. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Getting Unity 5 in 64-bit may make a big difference.
