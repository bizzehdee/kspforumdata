Even a single in-game settings change (which people do far more often than you\u0027d think) will be enough to re-enable the stock AA, which causes some visual bugs. Again, few people would have any idea of this being a thing until it happens, potentially by accident, leading to more unnecessary bug reports and the like.\n\nThere should be more information on the main post explaining this, and if possible the ability to disable the mode should be kept for those who prefer visuals over performance like myself. I have a good GPU, I like my MSAA and I\u0027d prefer to be able to keep it on without having to rollback my Scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, and AVP versions."},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-16T19:37:25Z","Content":"How about you write this documentation that you desire?

If the way a mod works induces some side-effects by default, users have a right to be informed of that somewhere clear - could save them a lot of time slowly disabling mods to filter down where the problem\u0027s coming from if they decide to check the front pages of their visual mods to see if any of them mention it first.
