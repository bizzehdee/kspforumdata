The problem is that the lever doesn\u0027t visibly move, but you can grab an invisible version if you guess the location of where it should be relative to the thrust level.

I\u0027m not really sure if the flight computers serve a purpose, but it\u0027s cool to just press buttons anyways to seem like you are doing something. But, this is a props pack. If you wanted to add functionality to the flight computers, I\u0027m sure there is a way you can do that, but don\u0027t ask me how, I don\u0027t know, lol. dV might know more about adding more functions to these switches and gizmos.

I\u0027m almost positive this is a case of user error. For example: I had used the targeting computer to set my target for Duna. Alex Moon\u0027s planner told me my ejection angle would be ~150\u00B0 to prograde. So I time warped to the window, waited until the orbital display\u0027s ejection angle readout was at 150\u00B0, then burned prograde. I ended up on a transfer going almost entirely in the wrong direction. I watched one of [@nukeboyt](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/68397-nukeboyt/)\u0027s all-IVA videos, and noticed they performed their transfer to Duna when the ejection angle on the orbital display was approaching 0\u00B0. I quickloaded, and tried again, this time waiting until the display was close to 0\u00B0, and the transfer turned out perfect. So it seems that the ejection angle readout is actually reading the angle TO the ideal ejection angle, maybe?\n\nMy original question was whether there was a resource that clearly explains what the readouts mean, since they weren\u0027t immediately apparent to me. I\u0027ve since gotten the hang of all-IVA flying, but my first couple of flights were almost always just shots in the dark.\n\nAnyway, again, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a problem with the mod.
