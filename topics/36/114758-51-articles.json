It is hard so say which length the garage has. You\u0027\u0027 have to have at least one adapter at each end. (Adapter for landing legs) and it depends on how many \u0022normal\u0022 garage parts you put between. But on garage part is roughly as long as the science lab.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m using Blender as a 3D Program. I really like it. And honestly any other program i know that has all the functions Blender has costs more than 1000$ ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Glad to hear you solved the problem ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When you don\u0027t use other mods, you can delete the \u0022PlanetaryBaseInc\\Parts\\Mod\\_Support\u0022 Folder.In there you could also decide which mod you don\u0027t use and delete the folder with the names of the mods not installed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A already heard of this problem a few times. I think it most often appereas when therea are multiple stack nodes on a part. Sometimes the game does not register that they are decoupled. The only solution i found was reloading (Or in editor replacing the part with the missing node). I am afraid that i can\u0027t do much on that end.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm maybe the decoupler from KSP does only work when attached at a node. (The node for surface attachment is another node). I  have to look it that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I will have a look at it once the next update it made ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the information.

Big trick is to orientate prior to attaching, as this makes life easier. After that just hold down the so called mod key to disable surface attaching. The mod key differs based on OS, but for windows its the \u0027alt\u0027 key. From there, you can use the duplicate function to speed up the construction process further. with surface attaching disabled, you only way for parts to connect is to use the nodes."},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T17:52:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 13/01/2016 at 9:20 PM, Orisi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah I\u0027ve seen this on mine they\u0027re quick to snap to other positions, the easiest way is to snap them to something without placing, rotate them to the correct position, then rotate your camera so you can overlay the two green nodes without getting too close to any other part of the body.

I would have to go and double check about this, but assuming im right, that could be a solution. Have the radial mounting disabled by default on the wheels. No idea if that would actually work, or how it would affect the mod, but it might serve as an answer.
