Not sure how Dr. Jet wants to approach that. The frame idea he proposed is outstanding and can work with stock or RO pretty easily.\nThe parts we\u0027ll need, from where I\u0027m sitting right now, are:\n\n- Water Electrolyser\n- Water Gas Shift Unit\n- Sabatier Reactor\n- Methane Pyrolyser\n- Haber-Bosch Unit\n- Anthraquinone unit\n- HTP-Hydrazine Unit\n- Solid Oxide Electrolyser (this can double for any old fuel cell, actually)\n- Bosch Reactor\n- HTP Decomposer\n- Ammonia Oxidizer\n- Fisher-Tropsch Unit\n- Atmospheric Intake (or two)\n- Ice Drill (or two, already borrowed)\n- Regolith Sifter (or two, can use a drill I suppose since we already have them)\n- Cryogenic Compressor (or two)\n\nNow, these parts don\u0027t have to match historical models in many cases since there really aren\u0027t a lot of historical models to choose from. All those pictures I posted were pretty much just for inspiration or nernie reference since many processes are either simply proposals or in the prototyping phase, lacking compacted space-ready housings. ISRU is still very much in its infancy. Sure, we may want an Elektron-esque model for replicas but they\u0027re generally *inside* a hab unit because they\u0027re crew-serviceable and simple vent to the cabin. The same goes for current Sabatier reactors. Obviously we\u0027ll want to have the ability to add those units, but having them look exactly like the historical models isn\u0027t necessary.\n\nWe can also double-up some models if we want to use different textures on them, as I understand things. For instance, the Ammonia Oxidizer, Fisher-Tropsch Unit, and Haber-Bosch Unit may all look similar in some regards so could use the same model with different textures in certain parts.

Since I have project time at work today, the plan is:\n\n- Square away asteroid and ice mining, adding resource definitions as needed.\n- Integrate Real Fuels/Modular Fuel Tanks and FSFuelSwitch.\n- Add a refrigeration unit (stock part, probably the fuel cell array).\n- Move the Solid Oxide converter over to the Fuel Cell part.\n- Finish up and assign parts to the processes that are left over (Anthraquinone Process, HTP-Hydrazine Production, HTP Decomposition)\n\nNo idea if I\u0027ll get to all that today, but it should provide the basic skeleton of the mod from where we can add custom-made parts and move forward.\n\nAs far as the fuel tanks are concerned, I\u0027m thinking we should prefer Real Fuels/Modular Fuel Tanks (you can only have one installed), then shift to FSFuelSwitch if neither is installed, then prefer copying tanks (last resort). This satisfies both stock and RO needs since Firespitter is a pretty popular add-on because of it\u0027s usefulness, but not everyone has RF/MFT installed. RF/MFT are incompatible with FSFuelSwitch, as I understand it, so we will prefer those mods over FSFuelSwitch.
