Dunno about the radial docking stuff, sometimes stuff like that just happens with moving colliders. anim module might need updating for that, also.\u003Cp\u003E@MongrealWulkin,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some of that sort of thing in the link in my post 2 posts above yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, thanks I have downloaded this but not tested it yet (actually I have a other addon pack, the one who add the 3x1 and 4x4 parts (Tanks maybe ? I don\u0027t remember)). It\u0027s the same pack or does this one add more parts ? And it is functionnal (I mean, if I build a rover with thoses parts, using the others LLL parts, the thing will keep together or break appart ?) ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lack","CreatedById":47978,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T12:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dakota2063\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dakota2063\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m referring to the static ring made out of 20\u002B mk1 hull parts, went back and grabbed to older model, but the spacing is all off. Holes every where. Only part that is a mash up of many smaller parts that seems to be broken. I\u0027ll look into the animation module, but I honestly don\u0027t know quite what I\u0027m doing with that one. Tweakscale seems to work with most of the new parts, so that\u0027s good, and I plan on sitting down later this week and rewrite the .cfg files that aren\u0027t formatted properly. (I\u0027ll hopefully post some images of my large carriers and cruisers once I start to put them together.\u003Cp\u003EPlayed around with your ion cannon and I think I might have an idea of how to make it work. I was thinking of taking BD\u0027s gua-8 and editing it to fire lasers, and then wrap your ion cannon mesh around that. Should keep it firing straight forward. Going to make laser variants of your turrets, but as some one else pointed out earlier, the large single barreled one fires two shots instead of one, still, it\u0027ll be fun. Now if only I could change the laser color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radial docking part is kind of funny to watch blow up my ship.
