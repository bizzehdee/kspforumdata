It turns out I was just a couple versions behind on magic smoke, so I was doing 10 times more work then needed. I could still use some MagicSmoke experts to help with this thing if your interested. Mostly trying to determine the what the lift and mass become as the robotics move things around. In the editor you can rotate parts but I need to see how they affect the ship as they move the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks in advance, clown_baby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://cdn.makeagif.com/media/3-03-2014/uaOIq2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022uaOIq2.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-04T01:52:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2014 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T00:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what is your question exactly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T00:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason the robotic parts would work correctly launching from the hanger, but move the opposite direction whenever I reverted back to launch.
