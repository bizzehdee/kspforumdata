The goal of this plugin is to make solar sailing and continuous thrust engines a practical means of travel throughout the KSP solar system. The modules [PersistentThrust](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133735-WIP-1-0-5-PersistentThrust-v1-0-4-alpha) and [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-5-Module-Manager-2-6-13-%28November-9th%29-With-more-SHA-and-less-bug-%28Upgrade-%21%21%29) are required.\n\n![Solar_sail_controls.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bld/SolarSailNavigator/images/Solar_sail_controls.jpg)\n\n![Ion_engine_controls.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bld/SolarSailNavigator/images/Ion_engine_controls.jpg)\n\n![Ion_engine_navigation.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bld/SolarSailNavigator/images/Ion_engine_navigation.jpg)\n\nThe [Module Manager plugin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-%28Nov-11%29) is now required. Download the zip file from the latest release, and unzip into KSP\u0027s GameData folder: [https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/releases](https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/releases)\n\nAlso available on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143140-ckan-the-comprehensive-kerbal-archive-network-v1181-13-july-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\nThe source code and README file are available at: [https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator](https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator)\n\nTutorials to walk you through the current features are at: [https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Tutorials](https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Tutorials)\n\nThe current features are:\n\n- Command the attitude and throttle of a vessel during realtime and timewarp for long duration, continuous thrust missions\n- Lock the vessel attitude relative to a reference frame that rotates around the sun\n- Schedule multiple attitude and throttle maneuvers of specified duration in days and hours\n- Preview the future trajectory and the final orbit those attitude maneuvers produce\n- Select a target object, and see how far off you are at the end of the maneuver sequence\n- Use multiple persistent thrust engines and solar sails\n- Control all sails and persistent thrust engines from any command pod\n- Type in angles/throttle/days/hours\n- Change default control values on a per vessel basis for new command segments\n- Two reference frames available\n    - Radial/Tangential/Normal with Cone/Clock/Flatspin angles\n    - In-track/Cross-track/Normal with Flight-path-angle/Azimuth/Flatspin angles\n\nKnown issues and limitations\n\n- Really only supports trajectories orbiting the sun. Sailing around a planet or moon hasn\u0027t been tested, and tools to help navigate around a planet haven\u0027t been written.\n- Plotting trajectories is entirely manual, and is time consuming, especially if you are trying to accurately rendezvous with a target. It is suggested to have a backup high thrust propulsion system to close the gap. Future versions of SolarSailNavigator may have a \u0022fine tuning\u0022 tool that takes your initial trajectory and hones in on the target orbit.\n- At high time warp, the ElectricCharge usage of an ion engine spacecraft has an error where stored energy drops (even to 0), even though energy production is high enough. The vessel keeps operating, and the propellant mass use works correctly.\n- Preview doesn\u0027t detect when the trajectory enters the sphere of influence of another body\n- Final orbit not drawn when parabolic or hyperbolic\n- Recalculate target line and error when new target is selected - toggle \u0022Show Preview\u0022 to workaround\n- Some important convenience features are not implemented yet:\n    - Automatically tune the trajectory to rendezvous with a target\n    - Show start date/end date/duration in years/days/hours/secs\n    - Check mass and resource use of persistent engines during command sequence against remaining\n    - Check resource rate (e.g. Electric Charge) against vessel generating capacity\n    - Update the vessel orbit state when you leave it to work on something else and come back (\u0022Sails on Rails\u0022)\n\nChangelog: see  [https://github.com/bld/PersistentThrust/releases](https://github.com/bld/PersistentThrust/releases)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-09T13:28:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2017 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by mrsolarsail**\n  \nUpdated to work with KSP 1.3"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:54:41Z","Content":"Looking very interesting! perhaps we can also adapt this for other low thrust propulsion methods\n\nWhat do you think about the idea of putting the solar Engine in a separate Mod, since it\u0027s completely different from all KSPI engines which require a lot of power?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T19:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrsolarsail","CreatedById":121532,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:03:03Z","Content":"Thanks.

Is a formula that works in polar coordinates which has into account the time, angle, gravity , etc. Drawing the trajectory spiral in 3d.\n\nTell me a little more about your system.

But the mass is 1T, which it fix with the current mass of a real solar sail of 400m\\*400m using current solar sails materials as the Sunjammer, which is a density of 6g/m2 (including support structure) \\* 160000 = 1 metric tonne.\n\nIt will be nice to have different solar sails technologies, this will provide different densities and max temperature parameters.\n\nAlso it will be nice to include a Dusty Plasma Sails as you said, it will have a density of 0.01 g/m2 with a reflectivity of 1%, this increase just the particle effect scale, (as a magnetosphere), the model it will be like just a wire loop where the dust is injected to inflate the plasma.

I need to sample \u0026 save fewer of them, which should reduce the calculations and memory used when redrawing the preview.\n\nI have a companion project called the Solar Sail Flight School to explain the physical principals of solar sailing. I agree that this plugin assumes a lot of knowledge in its current form. It\u0027s similar to how professionals plot trajectories. What do you think about adding some tutorial features, like I have in the flight school? A realistic attitude control mode, with solar torque, is another possibility. [http://flightschool.solarsails.info](http://flightschool.solarsails.info)\n\nI\u0027m working on some illustrations to explain the reference frames and angles. The \u0022Cone\u0022 and \u0022Clock\u0022 angle are common terms used by pros. They are relative to the frame described here (though, mine are a little different). \u0022Clock\u0022 rotates about the position vector of the sail from the sun. \u0022Cone\u0022 then rotates about the orbit normal vector (after it\u0027s been rotated by the \u0022Clock\u0022.

They plan on building a 2nd generation craft, and the PV cells will power ion engines that will serve as a 2nd stage to rendezvous with Jupiter and the Trojan asteroids. Sails have good thrust by themselves close to the sun, and use no propellant. Out at Jupiter, their thrust is very low (~1/27th), but the solar power over a large array is still high enough for ion engines.\n\nI think it would be very interesting to add options features like hybrid solar sails / solar power arrays. Any large, lightweight spacecraft turns into a solar sail - whether you want it to or not.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The idea of this mod sounds brilliant, three questions:\n\u003E - Does this add/plan to add solar sails, or just a way solar sails can operate?\n\u003E \n\u003E - Does this work for other low-thrust propulsion methods (for example, does it make a 10-hour burn practical?)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Atomic rocket\u0027s engine list has a large section on solar sails, have you looked at that?\n\n- This includes a solar sail part, with integrated navigation tool. I\u0027m probably going to separate it, though, so you can apply the navigation tool to any low thrust part, like sails and ion engines.\n\n- Not yet.\n\n- Could you post a link to Atomic rocket\u0027s engine list? I\u0027m not familiar with it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Awesome mod effort! \n\u003E Pretty sure yes to all three, at least eventually.\n\nThank you!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Would this also support Dusty Plasma Sails?\n\nNot yet, but I\u0027d like to make it work for any low thrust propulsion system."},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T19:40:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - Could you post a link to Atomic rocket\u0027s engine list?
