However, when I import them separately into blender, the import as drastically different sizes (picture 4 and 5). I\u0027ve combed the forums and found several issues with earlier version of SU, but no mention of a scaling problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue is with attachment nodes. I\u0027ve had no problems with Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Front or Back (I just use Blender to find the coords), but I can\u0027t seem to figure out FrontRight, FrontLeft, BackRight, or BackLeft. The problem is with the angle. I can get it working with the angx, angy, angz, but it is a time consuming process. Change it by 0.01, reload from debug, VAB, check, rinse and repeat.

JARFR was the mod name. Semni made Jafra THSS, Jafra HOSS, and Jafra CRSS. So I don\u0027t believe there would a license conflict. Regardless, if that is the case, I haven\u0027t actually named my mod yet. I\u0027d probably go with something silly like NOSTech.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the derivatives refer to the different THSS (THST (Truss instead of Strut)) being created by You, Biotronic, and I. Semantics either way and easily changeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as sizing them to be compatible with FUSTEK, my opinion is to make the sizing as \u0022stock\u0022 as possible and not overly favor one mod or another. If I favor FUSTEK, it wouldn\u0027t work well with KSO or KOSMOS. I think the best I could do while keeping with this paradigm is making a FUSTEK \u0022adapter\u0022 (an odd sized part to match the stock-sized to FUSTEK). However, I haven\u0027t really measured FUSTEK... for all I know my plans are already compliant, haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModeling Update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per suggested, I\u0027ve simplified the parts somewhat, with hopes of duplicating the complexity with texture.

I\u0027ll definitely be making a lot of resource storage parts for the Hex Trusses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T15:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eu have to check the license for the old thss parts. but if u send hit to him in a pm and dont share it publicly shouldnt cause any problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T19:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rabidninjawombat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rabidninjawombat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooking very nice!!
