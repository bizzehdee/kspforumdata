The aerodynamics in particular for the whole thing seem really off. It bleeds speed way, way too much (to the point where I don\u0027t even need S-turns to slow down. Just divebomb KSC and pull up) and it has some very silly behavior whenever I throw curveballs at it. Basically whenever its not flying under its intended flight path, it behaves like a spaceship without any gyroscopic controls. Floats up and down, spins around and around.\n\nThe shuttle is also virtually indestructible, as I was able to crash it into every building in KSC and only lost an engine.\n\nI\u0027m sure some of this may be intentional atm, but even so."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:32:58Z","Content":"It is pretty strong yeah... ive had complaints that it fell appart in the past.

Without its belly up against prograde, it shouldn\u0027t be able to slow down near as efficiently. So when combined with the lifting surfaces it creates some wacky effects.

You never got back to me about that collision issue with the css...\n\nand yeah it seems so fragile the modelling system. Forget one step and you gotta go back again.\n\nblender can sometimes export to ksp but its best to put it through unity. Retexture it add the correct types of collision and orientation. Trick its alternative x y z layout if you skip it its all messed up on ksp. Also use the wrong import type then say goodbye to animations. Also things like ladders and airlocks need re rotating. Then reimporting to blender changes again. Loose scale and orientation depending on the origional model\n\nAlso adding the names and triggers to line 21 ect\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T22:08:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mike-NZ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:01:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thats what i did right after you posted them.

The Shuttle however is more spacecraft than plane, hence it behaves better in it\u0027s designed environment. I\u0027m usually tempted to just use hyperedit to land it, as I can be lazy sometimes (there is a difference between sometimes and always mom!!!!), but that takes the fun out of it (especially for Jeb and Val) which is why I *usually[i/] land it the conventional way. I\u0027m trying to make a kOS script based off of the actual reentry program the shuttle\u0027s computer executed; with the help of google and the user\u0027s manual (I think it is funny how a* *spacecraft* has a user manual like a car, all it needs are a set of keys that make the \u0022beep beep\u0022 sound when you lock it.

Or Deadly Reentry is a required mod for the Soyuz so the thermal blankets color change wont work. The soyuz just needs a proper 1.02 overhaul. I am not saying it doesn\u0027t work but functioning and working properly are two different things. \n\u003E In other news I took the most recent update for a spin. \n\u003E \n\u003E Bad News: The aerodynamics are ehhh. Takeing off is much harder than it was in past iterations. It gets into space but it seems like I was fighting it the whole time. In space I can\u0027t imagine controlling it well enough to perform a rendevous and docking. It doesn\u0027t fly very well in space either. Maybe stronger reaction wheels I imagine that could help for take off and landing as well. Reentry was actually ok it was flying in the atmosphere that really I had a lot of trouble. I tried both my way of landing and followed the instructions on the first page. It was extremely difficult both ways. I still experience quite a lot of \u0022feathering\u0022. This is all probably just me because I watched the videos on the front page and it seems like someone knows how to fly this shuttle so maybe it will jus take alot of practice. \n\u003E \n\u003E Good News: Everything looks good. I have no more complaints about the look of the shuttle. I just miss the proper texture switches but you are fixing that so that should be all good soon. Overall well done. This mod is really rising like a phoenix.\n\nI understand the tricky atmosphere flight but can we go into more detail on space maneuverability? Does rcs tilt off axis or too weak/strong?"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:49:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I understand the tricky atmosphere flight but can we go into more detail on space maneuverability? Does rcs tilt off axis or too weak/strong?\n\nDuring take off the stack constantly wants to roll over. The ship flys sideways during take off so much so I went into a semi polar orbit. During reentry it just want to go nose down. No matter what I do the nose wont come up. Then once Im in the atmosphere It flys like a brick but also floats like a feather. It bleeds speed really quickly and just really doesn\u0027t want to glide at all. I know that sounds interesting especially when I say that when I go to flare it just shoots back up. It doesn\u0027t flare it just picks up and keeps going. It just needs to fly more like a plane I guess. I am very much aware that its not supposed to but it needs some more gliding capability. In space it just doesn\u0027t move like I feel it should. Its very sluggish and then you overshoot the target markers. Its not a smooth slow its like its very rough maneuvering in space. Maybe stronger SAS? The OMS tend to drift up and off the mark and I am constantly readjusting. The RCS should be stronger along with maybe a stonger reaction wheel. A balance between the two would be good. It just seems wobbly in space. I feel like I am constantly adjusting to keep it flying straight in space. I hope this all helps."}]}
