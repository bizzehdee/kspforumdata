B9 is just plain art but there are some overall issues with the pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It was originally conceived for people that wanted to build BIGGER space planes. Most of the staple parts, like the cockpits, landing gear, and wings are way over-sized for everyday use and stand apart from the stock parts. (One of my goals)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The styling is so good it severely clashes with the stock parts (and other popular mods that logically go together, such as FS or R3/4 boat parts) in cases where the sizes are compatible. (Another goal)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There are some key \u0022staple parts\u0022 still missing from the pack and they\u0027re difficult to style match with anything else - parachutes, retractable ladders, basic rocket parts, etc. (and another goal)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Catalog bloat is extreme for things you end up rarely using. There have been a lot of advances since the pack was released that can reduce that even more. Bac9 did a pass at it once or twice at the then current tech level and made a lot of improvements, but thanks to Mr. Snjo, there\u0027s now a lot more to be done to whittle it down. (above my pay grade except where there is low hanging fruit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Originally it was a resource hog, and this may still stick in people\u0027s minds. Currently its footprint is relatively small but there\u0027s still room to eek out a little more efficiency. (not really an issue now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn trying to address some of these, I may end up making things worse...there\u0027s just so many fun original toys you can come up with when you start seeing the parts as \u0022modeling clay\u0022 instead of mere building blocks. Its so damned hard to focus on one thing because just staring at a single part you get a million more ideas. For example, I got side-tracked last night and spent an hour turning the HL-MK4 adapter into a full set of cargo bays and loading ramps (CargoTech pack later?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther issues can\u0027t really be addressed in the scope of an expansion pack, the original creator can address them at his leisure.

What mesh switching does is to take parts of roughly the same shape (and that could use the same collider and other .cfg stats), and let them be toggled between each other. Each of these alternate meshes can have their own texture/UV map/shaders applied. So you could do something as simple as vary it between shiny and dark, or as wild as having a completely different looking part that does the same thing (so long as nodes and colliders still make sense in the game). You can also have multiple sub-pieces on the same part able to be toggled, so a top and bottom can each vary. This is purely cosmetic for now until Snjo lets you toggle child parts with the main transform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this means basically come up with a wing design and if it matches the rough shape of one already there, I can throw it in the pack without bloating the catalog. Anything that fits the bottom and right side of a right triangle will work for delta wing variants, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/6a5iy88rt/wingvariants.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wingvariants.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese will have 3 toggles...one for the main wing shape, one for the choice between beveled edges or not, and one for the choice between normal or shielded bottom. A fourth toggle will let you change the texture/color scheme between 2 - 4 choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind you aren\u0027t restricted to a UV map or even a texture, and texture switching still works on all parts that use that texture. You can even add cosmetic accessories to the part and have those on a separate toggle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside is that the collider will still be there for the original delta wing, so placing anything on the leading edge of wierdly shaped variants could get wonky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive me even a rough sketch and I can slip it into most existing wing parts - this goes for anyone that wants to contribute.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-11T03:27:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2014 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SystemGlitch","CreatedById":98026,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T04:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was talking mainly about other parts being B9-ified, like Rover Wheels, Docking ports, etc. Since you mentioned that you were just going through the Stock Part Categories and B9-ifying them.

Spent three hours trying to get flaps to actually articulate and rotate down instead of just flapping...finally said screw it, but went with plan B. Now we have one aileron that can work as a leading edge, flap, dead lift surface, or aileron/rudder...or a combination! Yay us!
