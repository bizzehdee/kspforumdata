Repulsors work great for landing, and a reconfig\u0027d APU allowed me to have power without that horrible and heavy oxidizer, but other than that, I\u0027ve been flying, which means tracks and repulsors and rover bodies don\u0027t get used as much. Sure, I\u0027ve made a DSR fly. Impressive though that may be, it\u0027s not really a great airplane body. Reasonable visibility, sure, but there\u0027s no matching tail boom, no place to put a nice set of propellers. It does, however, carry a lot of very brave Kerbals on expeditions to the north pole of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the truck version, I have a good bit of fun with that one, but I\u0027ve found the best use for it in my space program is to strap the biggest nuclear reactor to it that I can, drive/fly it out somewhere, and leave it there to beam power into space for my thermal probes. Of course, that doesn\u0027t stop Jeb from strapping RT-10\u0027s and repulsors to one and firing it across the hillsides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully the DSR\u0027s are all very heavy duty. DSR2 doesn\u0027t get used as much (yes, I still have it, even though it\u0027s not as refined as DSR3) as DSR3 and 3C managed to be more versatile, but there may still be one or two of them hiding somewhere on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, back to making a sport of gliding across Kerbin\u0027s skies.

And things I\u0027ve had to config bash. I mean, the Stock Expansion Pack from Lack Luster Labs is nice (contains a pleasant little probe-sized cockpit), but there\u0027s just not enough visibility from the pilot seat, and I\u0027d like to be able to cruise in a glider that gives me the ability to have an awesome view, and also allows me to land without fear of \u0022Where\u0027s the runway?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do take up the challenge, don\u0027t worry too much about propulsion.
