I think I\u0027d much rather have a single inflatable than a single solid torus part, but if there was a solid torus space station that existed, then something like the above would make more sense to me than having to create the whole thing all at once.\n\u003E \n\nI would love to see this kind of Torus construction in space.   I don\u0027t think it would be TOO complicated either.   The biggest issue is that you can only use X size Torrus for Y Part... unless you make less than a perfect wheel.  \n\nEach piece could have either a 3 way Docking node (one inside the torus, one on each end of the Torus piece.  Or a Torus piece with a one time 180 degree rotation and two docking ports.   The Rocket would need an angled docking port as well to interface with the part and keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E in line with the base Rocket.  \n\nAlternatively.  The Part could launch as a \u0022Scrunched\u0022 cylinder and then when activated expand/inflate to a curved structure.   Just like a Zeppelin of the 1910s, the structure would be both inflated and rigid allowing it to withstand rotational and gravitational forces..   One side of the \u0022Scrunched\u0022 and \u0022Activated\u0022 Torus part would need to be painted a different color to make it easy to dock with the correct orientation...

The new module takes the place of the animation interface module, providing its own GUI buttons with backing code to update resource capacity, crew capacity, and consume construction resources.  It uses the stock IMassModifier interface to decrease part mass while deflated, so all other settings for the part can remain unchanged.  This all means that it will be very easy to patch out this functionality if it is desired; simply replace the inflatable module with an animation module and the old/simple functionality will be restored.\n\nOne semi-major problem so far:\n\nCrew capacity does not update in the editor.  Whatever is specified on the prefab part will be what is shown for the crew slots for the in-editor crew assignment tab.  However it is respected while in flight, and properly toggles depending upon inflation/construction state.  If crew are added in the editor while in the \u0027deflated\u0027 state and the craft is launched, those crew will be removed when the craft appears on the pad (in sandbox at least, they are still in the Astro-complex; might be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E on career mode).\n\nThis presents a choice:  Do as others\u0027 have done and zero out the capacity on the prefab part (I believe PJ\u0027s habs, and RD\u0027s inflatables both do it this way).  This prevents any crew from being added in the editor, but also prevents any potential for crew being deleted when launching the craft; crew must be transferred to the part in flight, and only after it has been inflated.  The other option is to leave it as-is...which I would be fine with as long as it doesn\u0027t \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E crew in career mode; this allows it to be launched manned if it is inflated, but will merely kick the crew out if not inflated.  Will do some career testing and see how it goes.\n\nI -might- be able to find a way to force re-building of the in-editor crew-assignment GUI, but no guarantees.\n\nCouple other points:\n\nI will be using RocketParts as the construction resource for a base install, switching to MaterialKits/etc if UKS is installed.\n\nWill be adding RocketParts/etc as resources to all MFT tanks so that they may be shipped/launched to the stations.  In the future I will be making custom container-style parts for \u0027dry\u0027 resources, but for now the tanks should be sufficient.\n\nInitial balance for kit-out mass will be 20%/80% for all parts.  This will be adjusted/updated on a per-part basis in the future.\n\nStill have a bit of work to do on the coding end of things but will likely have a release available in a few hours/later this afternoon.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, thomash said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the reply Sticky but I don\u0027t think it really addressed my problem.

Try using a -new- part from the editor parts list, and see if the problem persists.  I am otherwise unable to duplicate this problem on my end; new parts function fine (even after reloading).
