The shuttle needs to be more dependent and restricted by the fuel cells as currently it can stay in orbit for years, while the longest shuttle mission IRL was almost 18 days long. Also, could you add Enterprise, a Space Bat easter egg on one of the ET textures, and the \u0022Worm\u0022 logos to all orbiters (except Columbia) as separate \u0022skins\u0022, as it seems wierd to have all orbiters except Challenger carry the \u0022Meatball\u0022 logo."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:23:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I got Soyuz working but it spams an error. [Exception]: MissingFieldException: Field \u0027.Part.temperature\u0027 not found.\n\nI guess that has to do with the new 1.0 heating? Or Deadly Reentry is a required mod for the Soyuz so the thermal blankets color change wont work. The soyuz just needs a proper 1.02 overhaul. I am not saying it doesn\u0027t work but functioning and working properly are two different things. \n\nIn other news I took the most recent update for a spin. \n\nBad News: The aerodynamics are ehhh. Takeing off is much harder than it was in past iterations. It gets into space but it seems like I was fighting it the whole time. In space I can\u0027t imagine controlling it well enough to perform a rendevous and docking. It doesn\u0027t fly very well in space either. Maybe stronger reaction wheels I imagine that could help for take off and landing as well. Reentry was actually ok it was flying in the atmosphere that really I had a lot of trouble. I tried both my way of landing and followed the instructions on the first page. It was extremely difficult both ways. I still experience quite a lot of \u0022feathering\u0022. This is all probably just me because I watched the videos on the front page and it seems like someone knows how to fly this shuttle so maybe it will jus take alot of practice. \n\nGood News: Everything looks good. I have no more complaints about the look of the shuttle. I just miss the proper texture switches but you are fixing that so that should be all good soon. Overall well done.
