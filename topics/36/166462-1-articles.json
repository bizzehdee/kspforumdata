After playing KSP yesterday, I realized that an interplanetary mission would require food to feed the kerbals. I like to think of KSP as a relatively ideal version of the space program; the astronauts don\u0027t have to worry about food, electric charge, etc. Moreover, KSP does not cause parts to randomly fail. Does everybody remember the Antares Rocket Explosion that happened about 3 years ago? Since explosions are what make KSP interesting, I think that random part failures will make the game even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some features that will be inserted into the mod:\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Various containers containing snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Various farms that can be operated on Duna or objects with water on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Various parts will now explode randomly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Solar Flares are a common problem.

Where\u0027s the humor in that mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an analogy that you will be familiar with. People make planet mods all the time. Why make new planet mods if all the planets are close in resemblance or type of planet? Why would anybody make an interstellar planet mod if others had done it before? I promise you that there will be differences between existing mods. The reason I am making this mod is so that I have a shot at adding something that BARIS lacks (maybe a cosmic ray striking your ship destroy your science number).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163802-the-doctor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163802\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163802-the-doctor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@The-Doctor\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no humor in Kerbalism.

Apparently, Kerbalism does not work properly in interstellar planet packs. The objective(s) for this mod have now been changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, humor is no longer allowed here. KSS, which desperately needs Kerbalism or some mod like Kerbalism, is highly realistic. Therefore, this mod should match the level of realism in KSS. If any of you wanted the food containers to be shaped as radially attached vending machines, I\u0027m sorry. The people who play KSS really want stock-alike parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, engine failures in stock engines and fuel tanks will not be included. Since I\u0027ve got a lot to work on (and two other mods to make as well), the random failing of parts, which is already included in BARIS, will not be added into this mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, the mod will be adjusted to whatever settings you may desire. Note that these will not appear as in game settings; they must be changed in a .cfg file. This became a priority because KSS would need to use the mod in a similar way that any Kopernicus modder would use e.v.e to make clouds for their planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, radiation belts and CME\u0027s will be the top priority for this mod. This is Kerbalism\u0027s weak point is solar storms coming from other stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any comments, post your two cents below. Chances are that it might be worth something. As stated in my recent status update, I\u0027ve got a lot on my plate. I\u0027m open to people who want to help make models and textures for parts (this is what graduate students are for). Those who do make such contributions will be given proper credit for their work. I\u0027ve got the C# part covered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are developing a planet pack or already have an interstellar planet pack and want your ideas heard, send me a message, and I will do the best I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
