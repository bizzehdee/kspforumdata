Currently I\u0027m modeling from the bottom to top starting with the RS-25 of the core stage of the SLS. Ill post images of what I have here. I have never modeled anything for a video game so any help would be appreciated. I know many probably won\u0027t be interested in this mod, because many off these have already been modeled and textured already. But I think the asteroid capture portion might be something new, but I dont know how to make it work other than modeling part!

Most of the detail you have there for instance, could be in a normal map. You could even use the geometry you have right there as the high poly, to bake out the normal map and ambient occlusion. The nozzels should be like 12-18 sides at most really, with a few horizontal slices on the way up, to model the bell curve. Basically, use a little geometry as possible, to get the shape you want. Any small details can usually be added in via a normal map.
