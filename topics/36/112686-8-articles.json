For the centrifuge, it should start out initially compact and 12m in diameter, expanding out to over a hundred feet in diameter, capable of housing 20 kerbals, 10 for each of the two sections of the centrifuge. I imagine the centrifuge to look like the centrifuge from the space station from the trailer for the Infernal Robotics Rework, \u0022Sampling Duna,\u0022 but Kerbodyne-esque, more streamined and with toggle-able lights: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxh9En_Rd6E/mqdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxh9En_Rd6E/mqdefault.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As for the fusion drive, I\u0027ll let you decide on the design. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027 think a circular or inflatable centrifuge will fit this pack, because it doesn\u0027t fit the rougher edge design of the parts of this pack"},{"CreatedByName":"cy4n","CreatedById":185531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T14:21:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Table said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry if I\u0027m bothering you Bonus, but I suggest you make a centrifuge with a design similar to the one on the Hermes (The Martian), same structure, but like different design, and also it\u0027s larger ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Quote\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E This looks absolutely incredible, Eventus!
