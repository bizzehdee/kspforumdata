(i suppose it could also act as an SAS reaction wheel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe main problem I\u0027ve come across is deceleration; ie, NOT tearing the ship to shreds when the anchor is activated at high velocity. I\u0027m thinking it would have to work with translation physics (like many warp drive mods)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main use for this is expedient deceleration of large ships and bases, also keeping beacons or stations anchored in a certain place: excellent if you use some form of jump beacon mod. I suppose you could use it on a planet and simply let the planet fall away as a method of launch as well... that would be good for space stations...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone please implement this, or help me to?
