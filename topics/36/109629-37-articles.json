It might just be worth using those again. The shuttle itself is a hard aircraft to fly even in real life it was a flying brick with no atmospheric engines for a 2nd try. Also the shuttle had many landing zones just in-case there where mistakes made. In KSP we have 2 divided by water so you only get one chance. The only areo (if this counts) i saw that needed some love was the SRB separation which looks to be improved in this version. As the old saying goes \u0022If it aint broke don\u0027t fix it\u0022.\n\nDue to some google drive updates and dropbox keeping the version numbers in line is a bit rough im not sure what version i have (before today\u0027s) that had the good areo model but ill be glad to provide in a PM if needed. It might be worth setting up a github for this so we can better keep track of the version and changes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T06:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by daedaelus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T07:14:48Z","Content":"Mike, please let me do some organization on the mod.

Use 1.6 as a basis and add stuff gradually from there. Keeping track of versions using my mini-AVC implement so that we know everyone is on the same version.\n\nFor the record as a tester im glad to provide feedback. I keep backups of working versions and use a isolated install with only a few necessary mods. If it does not work then the feedback is posted and in no way would i even consider it pressure or an obligation. As a tester i understand exactly what im being given the mod for. To test and report issues. I cant speak for others but lets also not forget that sometimes mods can have unforeseen issues on other peoples setups or conflict with other mods that one single person (with a single set of hardware and game config). This cant be discovered without a defined testing team with diverse setups.\n\nI do not see anyone that needs to feel pressured. This is a development thread not a release thread. Nobody should have any expectations of this mod until it hits the \u0022release\u0022 phase. The front page still has 1.6 so im not seeing anything being rushed to the public. AVC puts everyone on the next version when this is a dev release. I understand this for a public release but at this point either a github with changes could record progress or simply limit it to people wanting to test and report and know this could include possible broken versions. One of the biggest issues i have testing the mod is not knowing what was changed so i can try and replicate issues or push new changes to the limit and report back.\n\nIf people need a 100% stable finished shuttle right now, there are plenty of stocklike versions, 1.6 works well and of course lets not forget KSO. They also should not be on the development forums looking for stable finished releases.\n\nKSP was in early access for along time and i think people had the same understanding that things may not work properly the first time. But most of the die hard KSP fans knew it was early access so we understood it, reported it to the devs and progress was made each version."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T08:22:09Z","Content":"It is a dev thread but that doesnt mean to not be organized. If you go gradually and make sure everything that is done already keeps on working, so version control is a must, saves you a lot of time and frustration and keeps everything clear. Dont forget we are working on this with multiple people at the same time. There must be some kind of organization to get things managed right. The way it is going now only works on projects where only one person is working on. For example If I post something and someone else posts something other 5 minutes later not including the change I made or rendering my change invalid, thats counter productive. Even when you look at this as early acces, compare it to Steam early acces. You can only download one version so only test one version so the input you give is clearly based on that one version and all the devs are clearly working on that same one version. I cannot understand how one can argue against this.\n\nMike, let me setup a Github. Are you okay with that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T08:28:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeast**"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T08:44:02Z","Content":"While I agree with Jeast on the whole organization bit, I don\u0027t necessarily think its a bad thing to continually add on to the mod at the rate it is. \n\nI do however question the necessity of combining the wings and control surfaces into one solid model, as opposed to keeping them separate or perhaps going with something that made a bit more sense.

KSO for example still is officially at .90 but they are github developing and not putting a public release outside of github until they are finished.\n\nAs for merging parts im not sure why we need to do this. Some people change the shuttle to their specs. For example on my \u0022fun\u0022 1.6 gaming version i have added jet engines (like the buran) so i can have a easier time landing. I also add scansat stuff and whatever else my mind creates. This game is like having unlimited access to a hobby shop model plane isle. People are going to mix and match and do what they want to do. As im not sure the control surface would be the best example of this but engines for example. Maybe someone decides to change them? The mod is not complicated to build so going back to my earlier post. If it aint broke don\u0027t fix it.\n\nTo be fair Mike has not posted yet so i would imagine hes at work or not around at the moment. When he sees this thread im sure hes going to feel a bit blasted but i think this (test release) is getting a little blown out of proportion it was a test release through those who specifically asked for it. A few changes where made that dident work out. Im sure it will be corrected but hes yet to respond. He also should not need to defend himself as this is ultimately his project right now. Hes been given a suggestion now its up to him if he wants to roll with it.\n\n This mod has came along way in a very short time under his supervision so he deserves some credit. Im sure hes got a lot on his plate not including real life and work.
