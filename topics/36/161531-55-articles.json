For instance, today, I did a basic test run with the microwave receivers and I immediately made 2 observations. A: line of sight, doesn\u0027t work for planets (like Kerbin) and B: Transmitters/Relays in the atmosphere do not suffer any amount of penalty. This means there is no point of building a energy station in orbit and no point of building a relay network. Problem A might be a result of the KSP 1.0 changes but problem B is strange as the KSPI Wiki mentions it specifically. Has no one ever noticed this? Anyway, I fixed both issues. Transmitterers in the atmosphere are now also effected by the same penalty you receive when the microwave-receiver is in the atmosphere.
