This prevents parts being attached to the animated doors and being left behind because KSP creates joints between the root gameobject of parts, rather than the colliders they are placed on in surface attachment mode. A useful little bit of info I thought I should share in an easily googleable fashion. I suspect this is new in .25, and I\u0027m sure will prove useful to many people, myself included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT to clarify: set the tag on the GamebOject that contains the collider you don\u0027t want parts to be surfaced attached to. This may, or may not be the mesh; it could also be a child GO with a collider component added. Either way, set the tag on the GO with the collider applied. It won\u0027t just apply to bay doors, it could just as easily be a heat shield, wheel, turret etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECode for a little plugin to print layer numbers and tag names for specific game objects is in the thread linked above, licensed CC0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with your cargo bay creation!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T20:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by lo-fi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T20:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease clarify your OP here with what you said about meshes, empties and colliders, in that other thread, for the sake of completion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
