The this and the ALCOR/ERS have been my favorite mods by far, I design every mission I do to be completely IVA and these are the first fully functional IVA\u0027s I have seen for KSP.

I get it going off at really dumb times sometimes while i\u0027m still in a stable orbit and i have to turn game sound off cause it is so loud ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) (idea) maybe there could be a switch IVA to turn the sound off and just have the light flash?\n\n2. I always play with RSS/RO. Is it possible to edit the config files so that the fuel displays work with whatever fuel you are using with RealFuels? If so which config file so I can try that out. (idea: when selecting the type of fuel for the craft\u0027s RCS to use in VAB that could switch the fuel monitors to that fuel)\n\n3. What program did you make these with? I really want to get into modding now after seeing this work and design IVA\u0027s of my own. I doubt I would still play KSP if it were not for your advanced IVA remakes I think it makes it such a cooler game! I would love to be able to make IVA\u0027s for a lot of the other parts that don\u0027t have detailed ones yet.\n\n4. One of the things I would love to do once i learn how to mod IVA\u0027s for example be able to add a monitor that showed engine status with RSS/RO RealFuels (used to be engine igniter and there was a Raster\u0027s screen for it) but now it is part of RealFuels and there\u0027s no longer any way to monitor if your engines are unstable, stable ect, or how many ignitions you have left from IVA.\n\n5. With RealFuels you can change the fuel type of the RCS on the ALCOR pod, to match the fuel of your craft. But on your Mk1-2 Redesign you have to use MMH/NTO which can be a pain if your craft uses a different fuel. I assume this is because you designed the ALCOR from the ground up, as opposed to just redesigning the interior of the default pod. Not sure how hard it would be to add that feature to the pod, but it would definitely be really helpful! \n\nAnyway thanks for the awesome mods man! Top quality work."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T02:45:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Amazing mods man!
