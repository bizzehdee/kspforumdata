I\u0027ve installed it, and the parts appear in Sandbox but not in my career save.\n\nThe mod works with the tech tree and has the parts placed at (what i think) fitting nodes. When you are using a savegame where the nodes in the tech tree are already unlocked before adding this mod you have to unlock the parts manually in each node. This is the standard behaviour of KSP for parts that are added after the tech tree node is unlocked. All parts in nodes that aren\u0027t unlocked yet will be unlocked normally.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:15:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nils277**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T12:46:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can\u0027t wait for TAC-LS support!\n\nIf you don\u0027t mind my rough stab at it have the Containers but still playing around with the Recyclers \n\n![TAC.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/test%20parts/ScreenShots/TAC.png) Can get them here just unzip to your KSP/GameData/ [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Test%20Parts/LifeSupport_Containers.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Test%20Parts/LifeSupport_Containers.zip) \n\nYou can put them anywhere in the GameData folder or even in PlanetaryBaseInc folder.\n\nModels by Nils277 [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nTextures by TaranisElsu [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taraniselsu/TacLifeSupport/master/LICENSE.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taraniselsu/TacLifeSupport/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:51:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2**"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:15:32Z","Content":"awesum ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:41:53Z","Content":"Would be nice if we could see some pressure tanks inside O2 container, water tanks (railway-cistern shape) inside water container, etc. Universal Storage-style.

I realize that most people use TAC, heck I was one of them for the longest time, but recently I decided to simplify my life and I went with RoverDude\u0027s USI-LS. Since Rover\u0027s on the dev team, I figure 2 things. 1 I\u0027m reducing the complexity in my game time, and 2, if they do go with a \u0022stock\u0022 life support ever, RD is most likely to be working on it, better to get used to it now IMHO.
