It seems I will need to wait on that, but I am CERTAIN that this will show itself in my series at the section of time in which it appeared irl! Also, waitng on the guys making Real KSC mod to release a download for it! Once that is done, I will begin the filming of the series!"},{"CreatedByName":"olivertk","CreatedById":124146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T16:34:42Z","Content":"how is it going?"},{"CreatedByName":"DECQ","CreatedById":113001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T17:02:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E how is it going?\n\nHi, I check lags, and wait for the aerodynamics of the Dragon)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T17:37:45Z","Content":"Hey DECQ, just to answer an open question, if you want to make buran compatabile with SSP payloads, i will not argue, but it will be on your own perogative.

Sometimes I modify the Saturn V, I have recently worked to improve S-II is also not pleased with the textures, in any case, I will working it, although I think that it will not be popular, have a lot of good work on the Apollo program.\n\nPS Incidentally, at the aero approach will improve flight in the atmosphere.\n\n[![9968932_m.png](http://images.vfl.ru/ii/1443003307/6b71e532/9968932_m.png)](http://vfl.ru/fotos/6b71e5329968932.html)\n\n[![9968937_m.png](http://images.vfl.ru/ii/1443003373/f2cc3103/9968937_m.png)](http://vfl.ru/fotos/f2cc31039968937.html)\n\n[![9968957_m.png](http://images.vfl.ru/ii/1443003407/c251dc63/9968957_m.png)](http://vfl.ru/fotos/c251dc639968957.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T10:17:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 10:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DECQ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T14:15:13Z","Content":"I see jet engines!"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T12:42:09Z","Content":"Yup, those are AL-31, non-afterburning version of the AL-31F engine used on Su-27."},{"CreatedByName":"MarrouxIsBack","CreatedById":38726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T20:29:14Z","Content":"many beautiful pictures.\n\nno alpha version.\n\nno trial version.\n\njust a fake ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T21:07:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E many beautiful pictures.\n\u003E no alpha version.\n\u003E \n\u003E no trial version.\n\u003E \n\u003E just a fake ?\n\nHe\u0027s working on it.
