This is compounded by the 1.25m diameter, which limits the amount of internal space available for both Kerbals and load-bearing structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrast this with the Kupola from my station parts pack, which is loosely based on the ISS Cupola - larger overall size and relatively smaller windows resulting in a more structurally-sound design, while potentially offering more impressive views.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T03:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just the base model.
