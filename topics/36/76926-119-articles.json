I have a version of the Challenger II model with Theatre Entry Standard armour (extra armour blocks bolted onto the sides and turret). I could possibly set up a node on the chassis so you can slip parts of the armour straight on. Unfortunately it wouldn\u0027t work so well with other tank... But I can probably whip up some universal armour plates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
