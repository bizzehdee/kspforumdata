Hopefully this is the right place to post this... if not feel free to move it wherever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been wanting to get into modding KSP for quite some time, but I haven\u0027t actually sat down and done anything about it until now. Basically, I\u0027m either looking for a mod group to join up with, or some pointers on where to go next or what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I made this thing last night:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EiD4Bly.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022EiD4Bly.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KyfjmuU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KyfjmuU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8EhmmVn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228EhmmVn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very rough looking since I only spent a few hours on it, but hopefully it shows that I know what I\u0027m doing to a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten to where I know how to get everything imported and \u0022working\u0022, but I have no clue how to make it actually do anything useful like collect science or whatever. I\u0027d like to be able to do it, but with work and everything, I just don\u0027t see how I\u0027m going to have time to pick up even more knowledge by myself. I\u0027d much rather make the art and let someone else make it work to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bit about me is in order I suppose. I\u0027m a professional game artist. I\u0027ve been working as a freelancer for various studios for the past few years. I\u0027m fluent in 3ds Max, Blender and Maya, but I prefer 3ds Max. I can model, texture, rig and animate, and I have a little bit of experience in Unity... which helped me get this far with the above model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyways, if there\u0027s anyone out there that would like to team up, or a mod group that\u0027s looking for an artist, hit me up.
