And my second question is, if someone can do longer version of smaller rocket bay, big enought for AIM-120 AMRAAM, because it\u0027s bit useless if any of all rockets can\u0027t get out when firing. (And I use mostly all of mods for BDA...) F-35 or F-22 which have this type of bays use AMRAAM or ASRAAM rockets, and both can\u0027t get out...(I know other planes at other nations use this type of bays too, but there isn\u0027t many rockets of other nations.)"},{"CreatedByName":"XOC2008","CreatedById":151259,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T02:50:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On January 1, 2016 at 1:59 PM, V8jester said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Scoundrel, when you return. Would you please open up the inside of the bomb bay? With its shallow dimensions it really limits its capacity. I built a bomb rotisserie that holds 6 JDAMs or 6 cruise missiles. It will \u0022fit\u0022 but clips through the inner structure. If you opened it up to be the same vertical size as the standard mk2 bays that would really help a ton.\n\u003E \n\nI will second this. If the fuel section was omitted, this would partly solve my need for flat bottomed mk2 parts.\n\nOpen ended versions to build double length bays would be sweet, too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-23T02:53:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2016 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by XOC2008**"},{"CreatedByName":"andreasblom","CreatedById":133693,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T01:54:33Z","Content":"any update?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T23:48:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, andreasblom said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E any update?\n\u003E \n\nHe\u0027s generally going to busy with government contracting work, so I wouldn\u0027t expect anything anytime soon"},{"CreatedByName":"dholedays","CreatedById":68618,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T07:29:13Z","Content":"So I guess I can expect that this mod hasn\u0027t been updated for 1.1 then."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T21:06:33Z","Content":"I played around with this mod last weekend - my main peeve was that the small weapons bay was too short to hold any of the original BD Armory AMRAAM and Sidewinder missiles, while the large weapons bay would make fighters far too long.\n\nPerhaps a medium weapons bay around 1.5x the length of the small one would be nice."},{"CreatedByName":"XOC2008","CreatedById":151259,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T23:13:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, sumghai said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I played around with this mod last weekend - my main peeve was that the small weapons bay was too short to hold any of the original BD Armory AMRAAM and Sidewinder missiles, while the large weapons bay would make fighters far too long.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps a medium weapons bay around 1.5x the length of the small one would be nice.\n\u003E \n\nI mentioned this a while ago.
