Theres probably some generic atmosphere type at work giving it resources. I don\u0027t presume to know how this stuff is coded ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) The cutoff buttons change nothing, and even after I did an orbital scan it told me to... do an orbital scan ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Anyway if you\u0027re sure you can manually add them in that\u0027s great!\n\nHere\u0027s the atmospheric tab of Ganag on the right:\n\n![9t79kcu.png](http://i.imgur.com/9t79kcu.png)\n\naaaaand the surface results... sort of empty:\n\n![wuVW7O3.png](http://i.imgur.com/wuVW7O3.png)\n\nI also agree about Potatus. Especially with it spewing all that material out of the volcano it\u0027s bound to have some sort of light atmosphere.\n\nAn Eve update will come. For now I\u0027m glad it even runs on 1.0 for the vanilla planets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T08:02:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Immashift**"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:44:56Z","Content":"Hehe...
