However, I don\u0027t recall the behavior of OnLevelWasLoaded(int i) in a behavior which is spawned instantly on the loading of the DLL. If it starts before Kopenicus rewrites the prefab, the mod would have an outdated copy of the prefab. If executed after, then StarSystems would use the updated prefab generated by Kopernicus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarSystems only moves the standard planets (hardcoded in at the beginning of StarSystems.cs) to the new sun, so any generated by Kopernicus would be left adrift around the central black hole (star systems uses the original sun as the blackhole). If OvenProofMars is interested, we could merge the star setup code and the star light fixer into Kopernicus (with attribution of course, no one is here to steal or take credit for anyone\u0027s work). The star systems introduced configuration could be written as a config file for Kopernicus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis path seems to make the most sense (to me at least) because at present, Star Systems is at the mercy of some of the issues that plagued PF (live system modification). If Star Systems operated like Kopernicus and did prefab modification, the two mods would be completely incompatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve have not got a hold of ovenproofmars yet, but he did comment in this thread saying he wanted to talk.

Also in reference to Hodor, your math is a little wonky I believe. You doubled the radius, which according to the formula v = 4/3pi*r^3 means that the volume is approximately 8 times as much. Assuming uniform density, which you did, the mass is 8 times. However, the radius doubles so according to the law of universal gravitation, it is 2^3/2^2 or twice.
