I\u0027m trying to convert the LV-909 from being a LFO engine to a Mono-propellant engine from I the CFG file. I removed the second propellant requirement and changed the first requirement to MP, updated the ratio and removed the line to enable the fuel bar. I even compared what I did with the MP engine from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmos-tks-spacecraft/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKosmos Space Station Parts\u003C/a\u003E. Every time I try to test it, the engine flames out and claims it is out of liquid fuel. Am I missing something? Is there another file I need to modify to get it to burn Mono-propellant? My goal is to create an OMS system that is throttle-able and independent of RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T10:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can convert a LF engine into a monopropellant engine just by editing the cfg file... :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dethsturm","CreatedById":59338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T12:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Awaras\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Awaras\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think you can convert a LF engine into a monopropellant engine just by editing the cfg file... :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E That\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking based on the results I had.
