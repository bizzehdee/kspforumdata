Also I need to find a source of spray masking... hmmm\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as a response for how I\u0027ve so far planned to print\u00A0of the ball, I was thinking a subassembly like the eggbot, but all manual. With a few gear reduction ratios for the ball to rotate very slowly, I\u0027ll be able to get a pretty accurate positioning on when the paint pen would lift or go down. The pen arm would be on the \u00A0axis as the rotation of the ball, but I\u0027d have\u00A0an height adjustable set of 8 \u0022bumps\u0022 rotation axis where the ball is connected and sitting\u00A0under the pen\u00A0arm. This would set the negative space when I want the pen lifted as the ball is rotated around it\u0027s axis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(It\u0027s at this point I wish I could draw a model of the idea to better communicate what I mean *sigh*) Best I can describe is to take a big dinner plate and stick a small saucer on that plate at the edge so large place circle has\u00A0a saucer sized \u0022bump\u0022 protruding over the edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA\u00A0little bit of trig maths will get the the angles needed for the paint stick to be at a correct angle to the balls surface for the higher latitude lines. The length of each line would just be\u00A0a function of which latitude I\u0027m at. Thankfully in KSP all the longitude line are mostly solid with 8 gaps for the numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the hard bit.

I didn\u0027t want to be resetting the ball every time I load d up KSP so I figured out that something as simple as a magnet and a Hall effect sensor does the trick. Glue the magnet to the inside of the ball and the sensor mounted on the plate, that\u0027s the pitch done... then a magnet on the edge of the plate with the sensor on a mount on the cage did the yaw... and finally a disk on the roll axle with a magnet attatched and a sensor on the case sorted out the roll.

When I have finalised and tested the mechanics of the system I will be going onto the ball itself... and yeah, the extrusion at the right hand side is actually to make the dedicated ball engraver.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding the ball outer sphere I have designed a mount that attaches to the shaft and then used keyways and three screws to hold them in place. You don\u0027t want magnets in there because it will mess up the hall effect sensors as the ball spins and the zeroing system would malfunction... and yeah, I originally designed it with magnets holding the ball in place too... good idea, but not with the overall plan with the sphere rotating in all directions. The hall effect sensor would pick it up and then think it was at the zero point and lock the ball in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see in the picture, the majority of the CNC is done. All the electronics work great. The computer can even control the speed of the router and turn the vacuum on and off. Talking about the vac, you can see a cyclone extractor so that no dust reaches the filters and blocks them. The dust and bits get dropped through the top board and go into a sealed box inside the lower unit. When the box is half full I will empty it by just disconnecting the lower flexy pipe from the box and pulling the whole box out. Simples. The routing of the upper pipe was screwed up because I didn\u0027t leave myself enough of an overhead so I had to use knicker elastic to create a way to force it to retract and not get tangled up. Works fine so far with the test cuts I have made but will have to keep an eye out. I did have to add those extra pieces of extrusion under the spoil board because it was warping with only two supports underneath. Now I have 5 and it\u0027s rock solid when I do up the bolts. I can also remove it to fit a vice directl to the support bars. Oh and as everything is bolted down securely, it\u0027s as solid as a rock. The CNC machine doesnt move, the whole darn structure moves (which is why I am going to be adding extra feet and sand bags.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo finish the unit I need to make the front frame carcass and put in the doors. Don\u0027t know yet if I am going to use sliding or not... but I am leaning towards sliding on the top unit main door and normal hinges for the rest. The lower left opening will have drawers that I have got to make (got the parts at least) that will hold all my router bits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately this will do the job that I want nicely... and let me make stuff even when I am feeling crappy. I do want to ditch the SuperPID eventually though as I think a Spindle would be better and allow me to do tapping. I MIGHT be able to do it with the router but being able to reverse and run at much lower speeds is a big bonus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I manage to actually make a real working Nav-Ball I will be really happy because this build was a poodle because I have had to do a whole load of custom stuff due to making sure it is safe (ie no static and you can see the earth lead that connects to the copper wire in the extractor lol... before I did that the dust was lining the pipe due to static).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBit of an info dump but I hate winter (or precisely my body hates winter). I\u0027ve mainly been doing 3D training in Fusion 360 when I can and when I can think clearly I do some coding. Just finished part of the remote control board code today that will let me run it like a larger machine (as in Manual Pulse Generator to jog the head precisely). Ironically it was done in a game utility (autohotkey rocks for how simple it is). Just add a Leo Bodnar Universal USB Joystick Interface Controller and you are rocking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill probably finish this when there is some warmer weather and my shoulder doesn\u0027t keep falling out of its damned socket. Sides and roof pieces just need to be screwed on (after adding the foam soundproofing) and then the doors... Oh and the temperature control system (basically fans that kick in when the temp rises too much and feed them through serpentine tunnels lined with foam to reduce noise getting out) and then I will start cutting the Nav Ball framework. There are loads of differnt layers to get the data across on the front of the unit that you don\u0027t realise just how many bits of data are actually being linked in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really should type up the system specification and put it on here and maybe someone will be able to beat me. That would be okay as I am going to be giving the plans away for free anyway... I would get a kick out of seeing someone build a Nav Ball that fully works. Building the hardware is only one stage of the problem. Then comes the coding to receive and interpret the data from the systems and then align the ball... the needles will be the feedback from the navigation system and the rate of change (as in if the craft is spinning) means there are 9 channels of basic data to work with. Then there are sensitivity settings so you can fine tune your course, systems needed to zero and then align the ball to a fixed angle. And finally adding in random failures... including that red pop out flag that says the unit has lost power.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFun times ahead for this year... because I also want to make a cockpit for Elite Dangerous... can you tell I love space games heh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-04T03:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223285046\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162666\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517695238\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258200\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeoMorph\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, NeoMorph said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the ball outer sphere I have designed a mount that attaches to the shaft and then used keyways and three screws to hold them in place.

The red cap has a pin in the centre on the inside which fits into the end of the axle with a keyway to hold it aligned. Little bit of locktite blue would hold it in place nicely and when you need to access the screws (also held in place with loctite blue) would still allow access to the internals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was one of the big reasons I went ahead and got the CNC. Making parts like these manually would need more expensive tools and more skill than I have to build to fit to a tolerance that would hold together and not rub against the inside of the frame. With a CNC built sturdy enough I can make slightly domed axle mounts with perfectly centred mounting points that would be a right pain to do on a lathe. Ideally it would be done on a small CNC lathe (and yeah, I would love to get one of those as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has been a lot of thought gone into this build over the years and to think that they built the original by hand by expert machinists to a tolerance so small is mind blowing. Mind you, when I first started doing the CNC research I needed I was regularly bouncing my jaw off the floor at how fast and accurate the machines are. I\u0027ve had to go without painkillers just so my brain could learn loads of different things that will all come together to make this final machine. I think I might even get a bit depressed when I complete it finally as this has been so many years in the making, from the early research to just figuring out how to make one, to the design of the multiple failed prototypes I made. But with each one I learned something new which led to the next one. It\u0027s hard to realise the above picture is showing NINE axes of movement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
