When looking in the editor and in game though, there\u0027s no change in performance. I\u0027ve incrementally changed all the (gameplay-affecting) things currently shown as changed via MM: mass, semi-deployed drag, fully-deployed drag, and the drag modifiers. Additionally, I ran a quick test just in case it was a problem with StageRecovery\u0027s calculations:\n\n![unbalancedchutes.PNG](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22571912/Pics/Spaceflight/KSP%20Screens/unbalancedchutes.PNG)\n\nOn the left, a pair of the 5x \u0027chutes with one cut. I used two just so I could (roughly) balance out the mass. On the right, a single one of the 10x chutes. If I had an imbalance between the drag on the two \u0027chutes, I\u0027d expect the capsule to be tilting like the following picture:\n\n![unbalancedchutes2.PNG](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22571912/Pics/Spaceflight/KSP%20Screens/unbalancedchutes2.PNG)\n\nOn the left is a drogue \u0027chute, and on the right is a stock radial \u0027chute. The masses match, so no extra trickery needed. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:10:43Z","Content":"Look at the section near the end.

If you notice the MM example I gave, the semideployed/deployed drag values for the 10x \u0027chute are exactly double that of the 5x \u0027chute. I should expect similar behavior to the second screenshot in the first one:\n\n    [I][/I]@MODULE[ModuleDragModifier],0{    @dragCubeName = SEMIDEPLOYED    @dragModifier = [COLOR=#008000][B]5[/B][/COLOR]}@MODULE[ModuleDragModifier],1{    @dragCubeName = DEPLOYED    @dragModifier = [COLOR=#ffa500][B]290[/B][/COLOR]} [I][/I]@MODULE[ModuleDragModifier],0{    @dragCubeName = SEMIDEPLOYED    @dragModifier = [COLOR=#008000][B]10[/B][/COLOR]}@MODULE[ModuleDragModifier],1{    @dragCubeName = DEPLOYED    @dragModifier = [COLOR=#ffa500][B]580[/B][/COLOR]}\n\nEdit: By the way, I\u0027m not saying that my config changes *should* change the size of the \u0027chutes. I was using the pictures to illustrate that the drag is unbalanced if the \u0027chutes are different, and I\u0027d expect a similar imbalance from my edited \u0027chutes if they were working as specced out. My \u0027chutes are exactly 1:2, while the difference between the open drogue \u0027chute and an open Mk2 Radial \u0027chute is approximately 1:2 (13.8:30.8, if I remember right.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T22:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by etmoonshade**\n  \nClarity."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:16:52Z","Content":"If you change those values you have to delete PartDatabase.cfg (in your root KSP folder) and launch KSP to force KSP to recreate it.

Is there more to the underlying config file for parachutes that I am not seeing/understanding?
