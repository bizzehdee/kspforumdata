The main effort is the fuel pump, which I\u0027ve had the model for for months. The plane is, when you get close, you have the option to fill up a selected tank with an amount, hopefully draining your cash reserves once that\u0027s in (I think I\u0027ll find the Kerbal wallet or make my own for testing purposes). I don\u0027t want to fill all tanks up automatically, cause that means my bomber with default 500 out of 1500 fuel filled won\u0027t take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, oil rigs, kethane integration, solar farms that fill your batteries, all things are possible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T03:19:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Snjo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T03:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to change the maximum draw distance?
