Could this be the cause of some kind of... I don\u0027t even know what to call it, a hang-issue when trying to install this from CKAN? I\u0027m troubleshooting some other mods and only uninstalled this one incidentally as a part of my troubleshooting (I was looking for mod conflicts and whatnot.)

I\u0027ve tried exiting and restarting CKAN as well as rebooting my entire system. Any thoughts?\n\nPS -- Yes, I\u0027ve thought to post this question on the CKAN thread, but I have no fewer than three other unanswered questions over there from the last two weeks, so I\u0027m beginning to suspect that they\u0027re just busy or otherwise in some period where no one is following the thread very closely. My alternative, of course, is to just download and install these mods manually (as I\u0027ve already resigned to do with 4 or 5 other mods) but running it from CKAN would allow me to keep better track of updates and whatnot.\n\n--Update--\n\nI think I might have isolated the problem. I reverted to a modless install of KSP and attempted to install \u0022Sigma OPM Expansion\u0022 only, through CKAN. It indicates three dependencies (ModuleManager, Kopernicus, and OPM) so I cancelled and ordered those three mods to install first. After installing those three (deselecting all the \u0022suggested\u0022 mods in the process) I confirmed that KSP does in fact start. Then I opened CKAN and went to install this mod mentioned above. Same symptom as before.\n\nOn a lark, I delved into the CKAN/Download folder inside the KSP directory (alongside GameData, not INSIDE GameData) and found that the zipfile had indeed downloaded, as well as those for the other three dependencies that I just mentioned. The zipfiles for the three dependencies work fine, but manually attempting to enter the zipfile for this mod causes an Archive Manager error.\n\nMy preliminary conclusion is that the zipfile is corrupted. My next step is to manually download the mod and see if that works. I\u0027ll report back here when I\u0027m done.\n\n--Update2--\n\nYes!! I can categorically confirm that the zipfile originally obtained by CKAN was corrupted, and that this caused my symptom. My solution: I returned to this OP and downloaded all three Sigma OPM modules (Urlum Tilt, Gas Giant Recolor, and Pluron / Khato.) I extracted all three of those individual zipfiles, and consolidated them into a single standalone GameData folder. After that, I compressed it into a zipfile with an identical name to the one originally downloaded by CKAN (I\u0027m guessing that some sort of metadata information is encoded into the filename itself, possibly in hexadecimal notation.) I then placed this new \u0022artificial\u0022 zipfile into the KSP/CKAN/downloads folder and re-ran CKAN. CKAN has a logic-check that allows it to verify a previous download before installing, rather than re-downloading for each installation attempt. Since CKAN detected my artificial file, it simply installed from that. (Indeed, I misspelled \u0022GameData\u0022 originally, and CKAN errored out due to a metadata mismatch; correcting that mistake on my own part resulted in a successful install, confirmed with a successful load into KSP with Urlum and its moons properly tilted, and a proper barycenter between Pluron and Khato.) The Sigma RT Extension download has similar corruption to the zipfile, and a similar workaround managed to get me moving again on that front as well.\n\nMy kitbashed solution here WILL BREAK if / when you update the CKAN metadata, but if the new update is properly entered (with a replacement of the defective zipfile) then I suspect that such breakage will not be noticeable to me. I hope this helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T06:05:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MisterFister**\n  \nKitbashed success!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T08:42:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hey there.
