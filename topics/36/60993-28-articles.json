I\u0027ll try to include more of the in-game company names for parts, however expect the pods and 1.875m parts to remain HGR since those have always been the primary focus of the mod and I see the manufacturer as a kind of artist\u0027s signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got the Escape tower in game and I think I\u0027ve found a color scheme for the boosters that I\u0027m happy with.
