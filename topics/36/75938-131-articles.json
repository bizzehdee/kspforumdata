If we want an impact sound effect, we should really dedicate a different module to it. DustFX should be related to the effect, and not the noise.

Considering the errors we\u0027ve dealt with over the many iterations of DustFX since I merged it with KF, I think it\u0027s a bit more trouble than it\u0027s worth right now. i might be interested in tackling that as a new module, or simply extending the already established methods of playing sounds when running the wheels/repulsors with an impact effect after the Dust and GUI stuff is more or less settled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, this morning/afternoon I started trying to fix up the last thing I want for the GUI: a \u0022save and close\u0022 button at the bottom.
