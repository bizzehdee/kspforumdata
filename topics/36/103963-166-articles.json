I got to say that they pretty much look different every time. As for why sunrises look different than sunsets I could image that it is due to the change in temperatures:\n\nIn the evening the air is much warmer than in the morning which leeds to different air density and therefore different light diffraction/scattering. Depending on the temperature there will also be different humidity levels which affects the scattering aswell.\n\nBut the main reason for every sunset looking unique is definitively the interaction of the sunlight with the current cloud formations. Though I am not sure if it would be necessary to include all this into this mod, as your sunsets/sunrises already look quite astonishing!  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-16T11:09:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2016 11:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mysteriosmind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghosty141","CreatedById":142498,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T12:54:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Soon (TM)\n\u003E \n\nBut waiting is so haardd ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) You keep teasing us with those amazing screenshots."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T17:48:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Ghosty141 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But waiting is so haardd ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) You keep teasing us with those amazing screenshots.\n\u003E \n\nIs it as hard as the work he is doing?
