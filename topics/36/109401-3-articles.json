The legs fold flush into the hull when retracted, hinging at either the apex of the bottom or at the sides depending on how you want to orient them. The feet swing around from where they\u0027re locked into place to adjust for landing, and a spreader/shock adsorber section extends to stabilize the craft. You could also use this design for hull-integrated wheels. \n\nOther things that might help would be to potentially include a compact form-factor Mk2 VTOL rocket for the theoretical landngs on airless bodies that would use them, and a retro-rocket nosecone (could probably already be designed with existing parts, but would be easier with an aerodynamic part that could expose retro-rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T01:53:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 01:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CptRichardson**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:14:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Spamjet\n\nDear god, that ***needs*** to name for this series of parts.\n\nAlso, that hypersonic nose could do well to be turned into a single seat cockpit part, it could easily use the Mk1 IVA."},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:10:12Z","Content":"\u003E Also, that hypersonic nose could do well to be turned into a single seat cockpit part, it could easily use the Mk1 IVA.\n\nActually, I\u0027d say to turn it into a \u0027High Acceleration Cockpit\u0027 where the pilot is strapped in standing up to better withstand the G-force of being strapped to the front of a super-powerful engine, with lots of windows and a fancy IVA.
