Is there a way that every player plays his own career? Then we all have collect\u00A0the sciencepoint togehter. Not for each person. And when one person starts a contract few are finished (failed) BEFORE we could build any vessel for the specified contact. And then we had lost a lot of reputationpoints. And there are few errors we find. First is the \u0022Safetybubble\u0022 not safe. One person has put his vessel at launchpad and I also done it but both were spawn at same place and exploding right on pad. There was no msg that pad or runway is in use.

It was a bit annoying to check in Tracking station where the vessel is and see that they despawned and u get an window showed that the first vessel is recovered. Its a bit funny when u wanna build an satelite-network and all the time the first Satelite despawn. Maybe we all doing something wrong or it is a missing option we dont choose. Would be nice when anybody could help me with this problems or tell me what I have to set in the options that could fix some of the problems.\u00A0Aahh i forget.

It doesn\u0027t occur when the universe is new and there\u0027s hardly any ongoing flights, but after deploying 24 satellites around Kerbin for comm relays, there\u0027s no way I can fly out of Kerbin without hitting the problem. It doesn\u0027t occur while I\u0027m under 70km, but as soon as I\u0027m over 70km then I keep having to smash that z button. It gets worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the sync happens, my position jumps, and I suppose some of the delta V I gained disappeared, presumably because the server thinks my throttle was down parts of the time. Previously I was running LMP version 0.9.6, the issue was there but not as severe. I can get into orbit, then setup maneuver node, point my ship to the right direction, turn off the node and just set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and burn until I hit the desired orbit/encounter, because every time it syncs and throttle resets, the timer on the node moves, even though my position in orbit doesn\u0027t seem to change. At times I get \u002Bt for the node even though clearly I haven\u0027t passed the node in the orbit map view, that\u0027s why I ignore the node\u0027s pointer and just burn in the general direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot the case with 0.10. Updated last night because performance was just terrible. I stopped using the tracking station because it crawls so so slow. I look at the server log and it seems every time I go to space center or tracking station I put a lock on ALL the vessels... I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s why it\u0027s so slow. Anyways, I used to just get to one craft, use the map and switch to another craft instead of using the tracking station. The update to 0.10 didn\u0027t help much with performance but made the throttle issue way worse. Now I can hardly get into orbit. The fuel appears to be spent but I didn\u0027t get the delta V needed, and it messes up my whole orbit too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should point out that I play KSP with quite a few\u00A0mods, mainly interstellar extended, B9, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, RemoteTech, KerbalEngineer, InfernalRobotics, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, kOS, near future mods, and some of RoverDude\u0027s mods, that\u0027s about it. I can probably drop the near future mods but otherwise I don\u0027t think I\u0027d play KSP vanilla, the other mods add the realism and overkill dream that I desire. The problem doesn\u0027t happen if I simply play local, but then I wouldn\u0027t be looking to add multiplayer to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... I know troubleshooting modded KSP isn\u0027t ideal, but I consider myself tech savy enough to tell you what you need to diagnose... help a brother out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-01T12:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223408246\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530430590\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103269\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022x_men\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, x_men said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWondering if anyone else have the same problem as I have and whether someone knows the cause or fix for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened with DMP as well, and since LMP is a fork of DMP, they may be the same thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe server is hosted on my ubuntu VM, connection is through local LAN so speed shouldn\u0027t be an issue.
