This would be a smaller selection than the current offering (got 5 ideas so far), hence me not making the current ones support that size. If you want to add such sizes you can easily do so by modifying Rework_Tweakscale.cfg within the parts directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat plane is from Fallout New Vegas.
