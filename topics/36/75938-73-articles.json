On top of that, with my tendency to \u0022fix\u0022 some of the configurations in mods that I install, which could cause buggy stuff to happen, could cause such managers to report that the mod is no longer installed correctly, or that I have an outdated version of the mod.

It reminds me of my days modding Oblivion (and Skyrim after that) where we had a few different mod installers out in the world. The nice thing about that was that a mod could be distributed with the specific file type used by those mod managers but, since it was only a zip file with a different extension, it could be opened by any of the current mod installers and managers without issue. the only issue was if the install had scripting for things that had options, such as texture resolution or optional features. One nice feature of those managers was that the scripting and settings for each mod were read from a simple xml or txt file within the archive, so releasing a mod as a simple archived file meant for manual installation could simply package a little extra file in the root of the archive and all of a sudden it was fully compatible with all the other managers while still maintaining the ease of installation for the experienced power user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure eventually this community will set some form of standard for making the different mod managers compatible with each other, but until that happens it\u0027s better to just wait and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T22:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELo-fi, I\u0027ve been considering buying a plane ticket to the UK, and then scouring the countryside in search of your hard drive, so I can get the goods sooner. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T00:02:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to find my secret villain base deep in the English countryside first!
