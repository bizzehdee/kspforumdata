It takes a bit of getting used to, but after a few experimental bits of fiddling around, I managed to make it work. It\u0027s a good, simple way to make 3D stuff when 3D is needed for showing a thought. And yes, the hexagonal design to the canopy glass was done on purpose.

The issue someone (might have been you, Madrias?) had with the suspension not working right is caused by my recent changes in the way the suspension is handled. Previous, it was done by moving the suspensionTraverse object using transform.localposition. This is all well and good, but counter intuitive because it moves in the local axis of the \u003Cem\u003Eparent\u003C/em\u003E, not the object itself. It\u0027s also affected by the scale of the parent object. Ah-ha, you might be thinking! Ideal for TweakScale. Yes, but also made it a nightmare to get things exported, into Unity and out as a part, all with scale 1, and without breaking the prefab model connection while rigging in Unity. Also limited suspension movement somewhat, so I\u0027ve changed to using transform.translate which \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E work on the local axis of the named suspensionTraverse object, \u003Cem\u003Ebut it not affected by scale\u003C/em\u003E. TS will be broken for all wheels and tracks until further notice as I need make a little code change and configure TS to change a value in my module to make it work. This is why the wheels were stuck in the ground when scaled down. the suspension travel of the collider has been scaled, but the movement of the susTrav object in local space is not, and this is what needs to be addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T14:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecided to try something different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Ur9OtS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220Ur9OtS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics powers the front steering by two hinges, set with a fixed angle.
