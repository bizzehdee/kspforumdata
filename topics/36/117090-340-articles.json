Requires quite a bit more information in the model-definitions, but in the end it will allow for the cargo bays to use the same part-module as everything else.\n\nIn the upcoming release, rather than there being a single part-module used for specific parts, nearly all \u0027modular parts\u0027 will use the same part-module (\u0027SSTUModularPart\u0027).  MFT\u0027s, MUS, StationCore, MSRBs, Cargo Bays, ModularServiceModule, ModularSatteliteCore -- will all be using the same PartModule.  As such, this module needs to support the various setups and features used by all of those parts.\n\nThe list of \u0027broken\u0027 parts now consists of mainly those parts that would use the new module, needing one or more functions implemented.  Once the attach node (and fairing) support is working I should be able to cross-off the MFT and MCB parts as working again, with next up likely being the MUS or StationCore parts.\n\nStill at least a few weeks out from a release, but certainly getting closer."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-08T17:14:29Z","Content":"![almost-there-meme.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.expresswriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03043152/almost-there-meme.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-08T18:35:03Z","Content":"Question regarding upcoming releases:\n\nDoes anyone still use the legacy shader setup with SSTU (i.e. without the SSTU-PBR pack installed)?\n\nWould like to unify the configs, textures, and releases; with the aim of switching everything over to the PBR setup.
