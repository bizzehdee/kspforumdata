The seat acts as a control module and below that theres a decoupler, that detaches the seat from rest of the airplane. Two small rockets can be attached to the seat as well. The problem is that it is quite hard to attach the seat and the decoupler to the cockpit, If you know how to make it better I would appreciate it, I would also like to use the kerbal models as a part of the seat if that is possible. Its somewhat usable at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the parts: Dropbox: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2988574/Red...ction%200.2.7z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/2988574/Red...ction%200.2.7z\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoogle Drive: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/open?id=0By0...3U0SEtZQ1JnN0E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/open?id=0By0...3U0SEtZQ1JnN0E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-18T10:15:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2012 10:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by vvaris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed old link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
