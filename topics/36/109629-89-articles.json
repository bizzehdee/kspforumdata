This may have to do with the tape I\u0027m using, or the fact that Squad changed the aerodynamic elasticity of a Kerbal, but I\u0027d expect to gain something! But I did find out you can use the solid boosters as an effective alarm clock. I\u0027m currently banned from living in cities.\n\nWow. Gotta be the post of the week!
