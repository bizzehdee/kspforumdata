I\u0027m using that mod that allows you to send science data to any existing mobile processing lab, and I sent a bunch of science data to the DOS LAB, and a bunch went to my Mun Pathfinder base where I have a Doc Science lab. In the latter case, it worked fine, turn on research and they\u0027re churning away on turning that science data into more science data.\n\nHowever when I checked the DOS LAB, even though research was turned on, the UI said that the lab had 0 data and 0 science, but when I hit the Transmit Data button, all that science I had sent to the station was sent to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. So it received the data and some part of it knew it had data, but the science lab didn\u0027t see that data and didn\u0027t do any research on it. Can you check to see if there is a problem there?"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-09T19:09:35Z","Content":"Back again, this problem is a real problem for me at the moment ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) What happens is the LAB intercepts all data sent to the station, and some part of it knows it has data because that data can be retransmitted to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the science part of the lab thinks there is no data. Further, the WBI workshops that have a \u0022grab data\u0022 function say that the LAB has no data even though it does- I was hoping that by adding a Bigby workshop I could just have it grab the data from the LAB but no go.\n\nThe problem is that I made the LAB the core of the station, with a 1.25 hub on one end and a 2.5m hub on the other. To fix this myself, my only option is to detach 8 modules that are attached to the LAB and then reattach them all to say a HAB unit with the proper hubs on each end. It\u0027s technically feasible, but detaching 8 modules, three of which weigh 30t\u002B, getting them to stop at relative rest to each other, and then redocking all of them to a new central hub is probably not going to be fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-09T19:34:57Z","Content":"[@vossiewulf](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179033-vossiewulf/) Sounds like your problems are with whatever \u0027science moving\u0027 mod you are using.\n\nOr rather, if the DOS-LAB part functions poperly by itself (e.g. generates science, stores science, can transmit), then whatever the problem is *must* be with your \u0027science moving mod\u0027.

It seems required to me if you\u0027re going to have orbital/Mun-Minmus-other planets bases with mobile processing labs, they need data to work and this is the only method I know of being able to choose whether you transmit data to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or to a lab for processing into much more science.\n\nYou could be right. But the reason I think it\u0027s the LAB is that none of the science functions are working. I have plenty of researchkits on hand, and turned on research as soon as it was in orbit, and it\u0027s produced exactly zero science, there has been no science to transmit at all.\n\nIt\u0027s WBI that hard codes a valid parts list, if you ever decide to try to integrate with his science APIs, be aware that your stuff won\u0027t work unless he modifies his configs to accept your parts as valid WBI workshops. I found this out when I sent up BDB\u0027s Holukani-OWS Orbital Workshop only to find that nothing worked and when I looked in WBI\u0027s configs I found this hard-coded list and that part wasn\u0027t listed.
