My KER window shows correct results until I bring up the tweakable window for an engine. After this it behaves as you say, the stage with that engine in and all stages below it in the rocket stop displaying mass, deltaV and TWR values. This appears to be because the tweakable window shows NaN/0.0 for the electric charge. If you drag the slider it changes to 0.0/0.0 and the KER window starts working again.

It is currently only using one of the modules for calculating the thrust and isp of the engine so the isp, thrust, TWR and deltaV values come out wrong. I will work on this over the next few days but to fix it \u0022properly\u0022 will require that the simulation keeps track of the individual modules independently in case they actually use different fuels (this could cause them to burn out at different times, changing the effective isp of the engine part way through a stage).
