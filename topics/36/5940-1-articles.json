Could we, for example, have a part that planted a flag on the far side of kerbin? (for example, for a targeted reentry challenge), or a part that hovered over the terrain of Kerbin and marked the nations like a map, or even an orbital slolom racetrack that extended all across the planet? Or even placed a (no-clip) city somewhere far away?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect there is a limit somewhere--that something somewhere along the pipeline will prevent such ridiculous parts.

If so, is this limit linked to the \u0027origin\u0027 point of the part, or what? Or will the mip-mapping algorithms pixelate it to oblivion? or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JellyCubes","CreatedById":11002,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-24T02:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile making that slalom course, I found that all the parts have to fit inside a 2,000 m cube with the centre at the origin.
