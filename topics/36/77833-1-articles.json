First though, I want to start off with a poll to see if anyone is interested in having MC style parts in KSP. Please ask questions and give input as to what style you would want these parts to be, and what specific parts you would like to see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobotengineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T18:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you perhaps go into a bit more detail than that? What do you mean by minecraft style blocks? What advantage over mods such as KAS does this have?

With KAS compatibility as well as other mods. I\u0027ve made some progress on the textures, but not much else. Possibly a bit like space engineers, by building stations and ships on EVA, if thats what you mean. I was also planning on using tweak scale, so that people could use whatever size they want. The main reason I went ahead and started the thread was I wanted to test the waters so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thesonicgalaxy","CreatedById":71406,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T19:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would I want that?
