With the success (and great feedback) of my Phoenix Industries CRS mod, I\u0027ve been brainstorming on what to do next.\n\nLast night, I watched a low-budget(ish) thriller flick called \u0022The Last Days on Mars\u0022 and thought the rover designs were really cool. So I\u0027m going to try to make a 2-person manned rover cockpit with KIS storage space. \n\nThe design I like most is in [this picture](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/344/f/7/f71937d24c6b30c1722c4d5adc8975d2-d89cyxs.jpg) (I think someone painted it based on Andy Weir\u0027s \u0022The Martian.\u0022)\n\nAnyway, this is what I have so far. I\u0027m not much of an experienced modeler, but I think it\u0027s a fair start. I also have no idea how to do the IVA for it, but I guess I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I get to it.\n\n![wip1.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/wip1.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:43:50Z","Content":"Based on your image, the side windows should be bigger I think. Also, the \u0027frame\u0027 around the windows looks a bit thick, both in width and in how deep in the windows are. Are you going to include the greebles on top of the cab, or let those be off the shelf stock lights?"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:00:27Z","Content":"I may make the frame a bit thinner.

Pressurised right? Looked out of a plane window?\n\nKeep it simple. Don\u0027t make lights. Some people will be unhappy about where you put them. Want lights? make \u0027em individual and placeable. Then people can use them for other stuff too.\n\nConcentrate on the cockpit. Making the texture for windows look good is harder than the rest of the cockpit. If they look naff your cockpit looks naff.\n\nBigger front window, smaller side/rear windows. No one really looks at the front of the rover while driving.\n\nmy two penn\u0027orth."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:23:56Z","Content":"Yes, pressurized.

As adding the power source to my rovers always makes them less pretty. And, could this *be stored inside the Phoenix* for landing on Duna? If so, it would be really cool.

Good point about the lights\n\nAww shucks now I feel all warm and fuzzy.\n\nMany modders start with a simple but really useful mod but make too many small changes to it and it becomes a monster.\n\nSome really good mods have extra functionallity added to them, that they really don\u0027t need and often this requires installing another mod to access that functionality. \n\nWhy hasn\u0027t anyone made a simple interstage cage for the parachute that goes on top of a capsule? It wouldn\u0027t look flashy. people wouldn\u0027t be saying Ooooh! that cage looks aaaawsome!\n\nBut they would download it and use it and people would be asking, why isn\u0027t this in vanilla?\n\nOh my.. listen to me ramble.."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:58:24Z","Content":"Haha, I don\u0027t know about it fitting inside the Phoenix CRS system but I do plan to make the KIS storage space big enough to hold the wheels...

The body will have a bunch of battery and KIS storage inside it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to include a generator inside, though.\n\n![previewrover.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/previewrover.jpg)\n\nSome resizing work to make sure everything is to scale, also simplified the rover body model.\n\n![wip2.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/wip2.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m having a bit of trouble trying to figure out where to put the hatch, though.

That would solve your hatch headache and make a quite modular rover with possibility to extend the body parts like a processing lab with many bays to place science instruments inside, an integrated mining system, a cargo container, an ISRU, some ressource container (LFO, ore or whatever ).\n\nThe hull just need to have both ends similar so we\u0027ll be able to place cokpit or hatch or another trunk section."}]}
