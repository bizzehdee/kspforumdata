The IVA, combined with the transparent 1.1 look, make them very sweet.\n\n Question: are you going to support Kerbalism, or can I add entertainment values to the sleeping habs and gym modules? I am not sure how to go about adding properties to those blocks. Also, is it possible to add some station specific experiments to the labs? I find the parts very pretty looking, but hard to justify using them if they dont provide additional experiments and happiness to kerbals.\n\ncheers"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T21:00:36Z","Content":"I do have plans on expanding the support for other life support and station science mods with these parts via Module Manager configs.\n\nKerbalism is on my list, though I\u0027m holding off on these MM configs for post v1.0 release."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T20:59:08Z","Content":"Hey [@curtquarquesso](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/42872-curtquarquesso/), what do you think?\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uYuVb/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T21:03:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, cxg2827 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey [@curtquarquesso](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/42872-curtquarquesso/), what do you think?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uYuVb/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\nI mean, I can\u0027t speak for Curt, but I think it\u0027s absolutely glorious.

Been away from KSP and the forums for a while. \n\nGlad to see these types of docking ports really catching on.\n\nAfter messing around with them in the editor:\n\n\u2022 The model is modeled such that it\u0027s 11.25\u00BA offset (or whatever the angle is) from parts that follow stock convention. This causes nasty vertex alignment issues. Obviously not fixable without major remodeling, so do what this information what you will. (Also, some parts have 24 sides, and some have 32. This also causes graphical ugliness in many cases.)  \n\n\u2022 The docking process is terrific. Great configurations for roll snap, magnetism, etc. I like that the magnetism isn\u0027t as OP as stock. Very nice.   \n\n\u2022 The base on the passive side isn\u0027t working for me. It\u0027s not 1.25m, and it\u0027s not 0.9375m, so what is it supposed to be compatible with then?   \n\n\u2022 Animation of the docking ring is great. Nice work on the telescopic control arms.   \n\n\u2022 Guide fins and other metallic bits could use more specularity. They\u0027re a bit dull. (insert gripe over pbr shader support)\n\nKeep it up!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T17:06:15Z","Content":"Very nice!!"},{"CreatedByName":"DurzoLRZ","CreatedById":160379,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T21:24:43Z","Content":"trying to add this mod through CKAN, running into it throwing up an error during install:\n\n     Failed to download \u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/64/CxAerospace: Station Parts Pack/download/0.16\u0022 - error: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.\n\nlink seems to take me to the proper place to download it manually, but I decided long ago that I have too many mods to manually handle any of them. if CKAN cant grab it properly, I will have to live without until the problem can be addressed."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T02:25:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, DurzoLRZ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E but I decided long ago that I have too many mods to manually handle any of them. if CKAN cant grab it properly, I will have to live without until the problem can be addressed.\n\u003E \n\n![2lHZ1.gif](http://i.imgur.com/2lHZ1.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T02:40:34Z","Content":"Closed at OP request."}]}
