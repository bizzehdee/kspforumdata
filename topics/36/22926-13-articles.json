My recommendation would be to cut down the amount of parts by picking those you want to keep and scrapping those you don\u0027t. Other than that, get a image editor and change some of the texture sizes down to 256x256 or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore about it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33694-Updated-to-0-20-2-from-0-20-0-noticed-mods-w-png-has-KSP-RAM-usage-get-excessive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33694-Updated-to-0-20-2-from-0-20-0-noticed-mods-w-png-has-KSP-RAM-usage-get-excessive\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-07T16:03:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2013 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
