As such, I promptly created a device with a similar design.\n\n![AsGvFmG.png](http://i.imgur.com/AsGvFmG.png)\n![unqvUm9.png](http://i.imgur.com/unqvUm9.png)\n\nIt consists of three parts: Kinetic Penetrator, Monopropellant Tank, and Engine. The main device is .3125m in diameter, with the tank swelling to slightly over .625m, the engine being .3125 as well. I went with monopropellant due to the small size. The penetrator device itself is a fully self-contained unit, the only external component necessary being airbrakes for atmospheric use (I added a scaled down version of the airbrakes for this purpose). The device currently contains stock Accelerometer/Seismometer and Thermometer devices, a micro-RTG (which of course you can\u0027t see. It\u0027s behind one of those panels there. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), a built in probe core with reaction wheels and batteries, and a deployable antenna built in. \n\n![r7bmtaZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/r7bmtaZ.png)\n\nIt has a dependency on [KAS (Kerbal Attachment System)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514) for it\u0027s harpoon module, allowing the device to bury it\u0027s nose in the dirt. I wanted to shoot for ~200-300 m/s impacts as described in the above document, but that unfortunately seems to be an impossibility with current collision mechanics. At speeds over 100 m/s, the device invariably bounces first, which looks silly considering that rather sharp lawn-dart point on the front. This has necessarily limited the impact speed to avoid excessive ridiculousness. Still, 90 m/s is darn fast to smack into the ground. I\u0027m going with the explanation that it\u0027s constructed from the same Miraculum alloy as Kerbal space helmets. \n\n\u003E ![n3pb9gB.png](http://i.imgur.com/n3pb9gB.png)\n\u003E ![glEb3X9.png](http://i.imgur.com/glEb3X9.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![By2pXEb.png](http://i.imgur.com/By2pXEb.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzzou","CreatedById":100703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T09:59:52Z","Content":"That kinetic penetrator is awesome!!! although i don\u0027t really like that round monopropellant tank, i think it would look much better if it was a cylinder the same diameter as the penetrator.\n\nCan we get a download link?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T13:17:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That kinetic penetrator is awesome!!! although i don\u0027t really like that round monopropellant tank, i think it would look much better if it was a cylinder the same diameter as the penetrator.\n\u003E Can we get a download link?\n\nThe tank it carries will out of necessity be larger than the rest of the assembly, or it would be half the diameter of the Oscar-B, and wouldn\u0027t be able to carry enough fuel to arrest it\u0027s descent velocity sufficiently before impact.\n\nAnd soon... it\u0027s terribly inconsistent at the moment.

The NRE is fixed now.\n\nI\u0027ve adjusted the colliders to allow the device to sink farther into the ground, and it seems fairly reliable so far up to around 110 m/s. Occasionally the collision detection will miss the KAS harpoon point and the initial collider will fall through the terrain. There is a second collider near the rear end of the device that should catch it if this happens, and by all appearances it just looks as if the device sunk farther than usual. It will not actually be attached, but it shouldn\u0027t fall over either (not without considerable help). In the event this does happen, the log will spam KAS warnings about negative terrain elevation, but otherwise it doesn\u0027t appear to have any negative effects.\n\nAdditionally, I\u0027ve twice ended up unable to recover the vessel or leave the scene while the device was ground attached as it was registering as still in flight. Both times were at low impact velocities.

There are no shortage of engines available through many excellent mods, but to download them all and have an engine for every situation would require a significant portion of memory, which we all know is at a premium in KSP. With this pack I hope to make available the ability to create engines precisely suited to the needs of any situation with a relatively small number of parts (ten, maybe twelve). \n\nAdapter Parts\n\n![O6BHqh1.png](http://i.imgur.com/O6BHqh1.png)\n\n![UebL0NI.png](http://i.imgur.com/UebL0NI.png)\n\nAvailable in two variations: Standard diameter and Expanded diameter.
