There are two problems.\n\nFirst, light seems to be spilling out from the inside:\n\n[![U5bDfJC.png](http://i.imgur.com/U5bDfJC.png)](http://imgur.com/U5bDfJC)\n\n[![vDbSNqC.png](http://i.imgur.com/vDbSNqC.png)](http://imgur.com/vDbSNqC)\n\nSecond, I can\u0027t make props appear when I load it in game. \n\nWhen I press the save to config button, I get this error:\n\n[![uGgioFJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/uGgioFJ.png)](http://imgur.com/uGgioFJ)\n\nI managed to get it to write a config by loading spawning in another IVA, stripping out its props, overwriting that config, but copying those details into the config for this IVA doesn\u0027t seem to have worked.\n\nHere\u0027s what that version of the config looks like:\n\n    INTERNAL{  name = LabSpaceUPGRADE  MODULE  {    name = InternalSeat    seatTransformName = Seat1    allowCrewHelmet = false  }
