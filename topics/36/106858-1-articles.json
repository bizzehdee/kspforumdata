The original moon he developed, had huge crystals that causd bugs that rendered the moon as unplayable. Currently, me and KillAshley plan on adding those crystals on our new revived Faz, after Kopernicus, the API K\u002B uses, will be updated to allow custom ground scatter models. \n\n**Harvest -** This asteroid was also a forgotten body Nova Silisko created back in the old days, but it was never implemented, like Faz, because of bugs, that, however came in the form of terrain glitches. It was rich in hilly terrain and had extensive canyons that exist in K\u002B\u0027s Remade version. Harvest\u0027s terrain was later updated and used as base terrain for Tylo. \n\n**Vix -** This is the new moon of Duna, deformed by a huge crater, added because we felt like the Dunian system was too barren. In order to fix the \u0022Ike Encounter\u0022 sindrom when plotting Duna intercept courses, Ike was also moved outwards. \n\n**Sarvin -** The legendary ringed Gas Planet 2 also originally developed by Nova Silisko that never got released. Our Sarvin has 4 moons and 4 captured asteroids. Potatus, Daphy and Fonso are original names of the GP2 created by Nova Silisko. After extensive searching, me and KillAshley have found posts where Nova talked about how the three moons should have looked, thought he didn\u0027t release any picture. And so, Potatus, the oblate moon, Daphy, the moon with deep canyons crossing ice plains made of fluff, and Fonso, the moon with mountains that extend beyond it\u0027s thin atmosphere were born. \n\n**Potatus -** Moon of Sarvin, it has an oblate shape caused by tidal forces generated by the relation between Sarvin\u0027s huge gravitational pull and Potatus\u0027 esscentric orbit, as well as a huge cryovolcano spewing ice particles and blue unknown cool gas (pun intended) that is thought to form Sarvin\u0027s rings.  **** \n\n**Fonso -** The legendary moon of extreme Kerbal sports, it is covered in extreme mountains that extend above it\u0027s thin atmosphere. You can practically climb a mountain to the top and reach orbit with no DeltaV! \n\n**Daphy -** In it\u0027s past, this moon was covered in fluff, but recently, it\u0027s surface started to crack due to unknown gravitational anomalies probably generated by the same tidal forces that made Potatus oblate. \n\n**Shayle -** This moon was actually not an official moon of the Gas Planet 2 designed by Nova Silisko, but one we felt it needed to be added. And so, Shayle, the cratery moon damaged in the early \u0022Great Bombardment\u0022 period was born. \n\n**S-1, S-2, S-3 and S-4** are all cloned asteroid moonlets captured by Sarvin\u0027s gravity and the only things different between them, are the orbital characteristics and color. \n\n**Keelon -** This huge planet was referred by Nova Silisko as Gas Planet 3, but later repuposed as a a giant rocky dessert planet with a gravity and atmospheric pressure that makes it even harder to land on than Eve. It is circled by 4 moons. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Compatible mods:**\n\nEnvironmental Visual Enhancements - [Download WIP cloud config](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rtjyvv9rpttsgj0/KP%20EVE.zip?dl=0)\n\nDistant Object Enhancement\n\nPlanet Shyne \n\nKarbonite / USI mods\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Crew:**\n\n![Amarius1-configs%20and%20fun%20implementations-red.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amarius1-configs%20and%20fun%20implementations-red.svg)\n\n![Olympic1-cool%20things%20and%20science%20intergration-red.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/Olympic1-cool%20things%20and%20science%20intergration-red.svg)\n\n![The White Guardian-Environmental%20Visual%20Enhancements%20Intergration-red.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/The%20White%20Guardian-Environmental%20Visual%20Enhancements%20Intergration-red.svg)\n\n![ProjectPluto-chief%20tester-red.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/ProjectPluto-chief%20tester-red.svg)\n\n**Thank you to former developer KillAshley for textures and config fixes!

Here they are:\n\n1. Got rid of a few dwarf planets and tiny moons to save RAM, also because they\u0027re boring and look ugly\n\n2. Converted Sarvin\u0027s texture to DDS\n\n3. Moved some dwarf planets around and made them into KBO\u0027s\n\n4. Moved Eeloo to orbit Sarvin\n\nPics soon, haven\u0027t actually done a mission yet."},{"CreatedByName":"coldblade2000","CreatedById":104385,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:08:38Z","Content":"Dropbox closed the download"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:10:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The comet trail orientates properly!\n\nextra props!

Can you upload your ksp\u003Elogs folder for us to look at?\n\n@thomas\n\nwe were making this pack back in an old version where the particles could only be set to target stock bodies. After upgrading versions we just forgot to remove it...i\u0027ll get around to it at some point.\n\n@medikohl\n\nnot so much of a tutorial, it\u0027s more trial and error. Browse through our configs and see if you can work it out, and if you have any questions feel free to pm me. kittopiatech is not required for kopernicus packs, kopernicus can do everything kittopia can do and more. theres a tutorial for kopernicustech (but not stand alone kopernicus) somewhere on the developement forums which might help. but then again the configs for planetfactory wasn\u0027t too different to the ones now, theres just way more configurable options with kopernicus."}]}
