It can be used at a high efficiency, low thrust mode, or a lower efficiency, higher thrust mode. However, it requires huge amounts of electricity to function.\n\n![8xOzlJW.png?3](http://i.imgur.com/8xOzlJW.png?3)![yHCS7YY.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/yHCS7YY.png?2)![Ssjmb1V.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/Ssjmb1V.png?2)![DwWq7pK.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/DwWq7pK.png?2)\n\nLiquid argon has a boiling point of -185\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1C, compared to oxygen at -183\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1C and hydrogen at -252\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1C.\n\nIt\u0027s density is 1.39g/cm^3, close to liquid oxygen\u0027s 1.141g/cm^3.\n\n**Fuel tanks**\n\nI made some custom tanks, but the parts made by Porkjet that I was using for inspiration were unused and far superior to anything I could make in the near future. They had no license, so I was free to use them. I have sent Porkjet a PM asking for permission to put my VASIMR and these tanks in a download together, and have not gotten a response yet. **We\u0027re good to go!**\n\n![mmomFnA.png](http://i.imgur.com/mmomFnA.png)\n\n![CHX0vTD.gif](http://i.imgur.com/CHX0vTD.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fgfycat.com%2FSmallHighlevelCatfish\u0022 style=\u0022height:885px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This tank would inflate using argon from full tanks on your ship. it would allow you to save space and pack your ship into a smaller fairing for launch\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n![xzyrVj3.jpg?2](http://i.imgur.com/xzyrVj3.jpg?2)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\n**Nuclear Reactor\u002BRadiators**\n\nWill happen eventually.\n\n**How this is different from NFT**\n\nReally, it isn\u0027t.
