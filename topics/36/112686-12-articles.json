It\u0027s physicless so it transfers mass to the part its surface attached to like the cubic octagonal strut).\n- Changed the texture for T404 inner walls from orange to black, because in some cases, the t404 b struts were turning orange when zoomed out do to mipmapping.  I\u0027ll probably remap the texture to prevent this in the future.\n- Changed the size and placement of the particle effects for Behemoth engines.\n- Added the new T404 B-2 and B-3 trusses.\n- Added new T202 B-2 integrated truss.\n- Added T202 BA-64 Battery Array - 6000 ec\n- Added 3 new structural Tank Couplers each with 10 attachment points but different configurations. These new orange structural parts will make up a third tier of construction for the purpose of making even bigger superstructures.\n- Added S6 radial decoupler part of the behemoth launch system.\n- Added T404 H-3 which replaces the older T404 B-3 (naming was weird before, the size was 2 and it\u0027s configuration and purpose are fundamentally different).\n- Added Kerbodyne S6-7890 X4 Tank Cluster (4x 7.5m tanks, t404 center) and Kerbodyne S6-7890 Tank Cluster (5x 7.5m tanks, no t404 center).\n- Added R-D HLRX4 (behemoth class rcs)\n- Changed the Kerbodyne S3 Smart Cone SAS torque from 75 to 300 for 1.1 stability\n- Rebuilt the cfg file for XL-6 Landing Strut using 1.1 wheel modules (thanks to [@NecroBones](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105424-necrobones/) [@sarbian](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57146-sarbian/) for their help with this).\n- Remodeled all T404 parts adding struts to sidewalls (now they really look like trusses!).\n- Remodeled Leviathan Solar Wing increasing total length by 20M. Remade panel animations. Replaced the central mast truss from alpha texture to real geometry. (Each panel has its own collider, making for a part with hundreds of colliders. This causes lag.

Let me explain. So, in my mind the 1st tier is a slow but efficient class of interplanetary engine. It\u0027s not as slow as stock ion engines. It gets faster with power. The more ec/sec it\u0027s given the faster you can go. As for tier 2 that\u0027s the fast engine.\n\nThe research I\u0027ve done, which is quite a lot, and from talking to [@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/)  it appears that, MPD\u0027s won\u0027t benefit from having multiple nozzles, it\u0027s not the same as chemical combustion engines. Essentially, the more power--\u003Ethe more thrust. The problem is whether or not structures that make up the engine can survive the heat and propellant corrosion. To get around this, many current MPD designs are using lithium as a propellant, like the team at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab. Most likely you wouldn\u0027t bother with gimbaling, since this is a purely interplanetary engine. You\u0027ll mostly be doing burns towards one direction, with lots of time for corrective burns, so you\u0027ll be able to rotate your craft and burn again. This is similar to how in Star Trek, the Enterprise doesn\u0027t do U-turns in hyperspace. There\u0027s no need for fast response, because the distances are vast.   \n\nI agree that the design you posted was clearly the winner from the poll I conducted. The problem is it\u0027s wildly inaccurate. So, my idea is to take from that design and emulate it as much as possible for the new single nozzle design. I imagine having a fairly large housing for capacitors at the connection end, which leads to several rings of magnets similar to the structural rings in the design you like (there will just be more of them and they\u0027ll probably need to be thicker. The single nozzle will pass through these rings. Here\u0027s an image of an ELFA to demonstrate some of the key components.\n\n![DiwFCH7.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/DiwFCH7.jpg?1)\n\n![srKfBGa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/srKfBGa.jpg)\n\n![KBBmgNB.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/KBBmgNB.jpg?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T19:14:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Bonus Eventus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was lazy with the release notes and left out a bunch of updates:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Yes, I deleted the T202 to T404 adapter.

In fact here\u0027s a quick lesson:\n\nOpen up the cfg file in the Fuel folder you want to change, for example lets use \u0022behemothTank.cfg\u0022 :\n\n1. Look for the modules at the end of the file marked, \u0022RESOURCE\u0022\n2. Comment out the existing \u0022RESOURCE\u0022 definitions by adding \u0022//\u0022 to the begining of each, like so:\n\n        //RESOURCE//{ //name = LiquidFuel //amount = 42640// maxAmount = 42640//}\n        //RESOURCE//{// name = Oxidizer// amount = 52000// maxAmount = 52000//}\n3. Add a new \u0022RESOURCE\u0022 block for the type of resource you\u0027re looking for. If you\u0027re using CryoEngines, look at any hydrogen tanks in the CryoTanks/Parts/HydrogenTanks folder .   \n\n        //RESOURCE//{ //name = LiquidFuel //amount = 42640// maxAmount = 42640//}\n        //RESOURCE//{// name = Oxidizer// amount = 52000// maxAmount = 52000//}\n            \n            RESOURCE{\tname = LqdHydrogen\tamount = 1152000\tmaxAmount = 1152000}\n4. CryoEngines uses Community Resource Pack mod for its resource definitions. In the CommunityResourcePack folder you\u0027ll find a file called CommonResource.cfg. Listed in the file we find the resource for LqdHydrogen. It looks like this:  \n\n        RESOURCE_DEFINITION\n        {name = Hydrogendensity = 0.00000008990unitCost = 0.000055836flowMode = ALL_VESSELtransfer = PUMPisTweakable = true\n           \tisVisible = true\n        }\n5. For comparison here\u0027s the entry for stock LiquidFuel in Squad/Resources/ResourcesGeneric.cfg  \n\n        RESOURCE_DEFINITION\n        {\n          name = LiquidFuel\n          density = 0.005\n          unitCost = 0.8\n          hsp = 2010\n          flowMode = STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH\n          transfer = PUMP\n          isTweakable = true\n        }\n6. Almost exactly the same, the differences are in terms of density and cost. going back to the original behemoth tank, lets add the amount of fuel and oxidizer together. That comes to 94640 units. We do this because the density for LiquidFuel and Oxidizer are the same, 0.005.\n7. Now divide the density of LiquidFuel (0.005) by the density of LqdHydrogen (0.00000008990). The quotient then is 55617.35261401557286\n8. Multiply the quotient of the LiquidFuel and LqdHydrogen by the total of Oxidizer and LiquidFuel of the behemothTank. That comes to 5263626251.3904338154704 lets call it 5263626252.\n9. The the new resource definition should look like this:  \n\n        //RESOURCE//{ //name = LiquidFuel //amount = 42640// maxAmount = 42640//}\n        //RESOURCE//{// name = Oxidizer// amount = 52000// maxAmount = 52000//}\n            \n            RESOURCE{\tname = LqdHydrogen\tamount = 5263626252\tmaxAmount = 5263626252}\n10. Lastly, at the top of the CFG file there is line which reads \u0022name=behemothTank\u0022. Change \u0022behemothTank\u0022 to whatever you want and then save the file to whatever\\_name\\_you\\_desere.cfg. If you want could also change the title and description properties in the cfg to something relevant for your own convenience.\n\nKeep in mind that you can also use module manager mod to achieve the same result. Look through the extensive module manager docs to find out how. Module Manager basically gives you the ability to overwrite cfg files.\n\n**PS: Anyone have any Kerbodyne Plus craft screens they wish to share? I\u0027ll credit those I add to the imgur gallery.

I think you could model the capacitor bay after **this** one from the WIP ion engine model collection: ![4ZY6Wpm.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/4ZY6Wpm.png?1)\n\nOh, and I suggest its diameter to be 2.5m for easy clustering for a much higher DV - but you\u0027d need more electrical storage and more solar panels, and lastly the engine\u0027s purple glowing part and exhaust could change color from gray to blue to blue-purple to purple depending on how much power it\u0027s given - with a longer exhaust trail - and keep my idea in mind - and inevitably use it! \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T01:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AJTheMighty**"}]}
