Having said that, in the Kerbal universe, the price of various items has no effect, so who cares? It is true that the smaller bombs have significantly smaller mass, but when you are dealing with such an over-powered propulsion system this is not a major concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my standpoint, it will be far easier to code a thrust level in the plugin by varying the detonation distance instead of trying to vary the detonation frequency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuick skim of Footfall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think from the part I read that they did NOT detonate the bombs off-center in order to do thrust vectoring.
