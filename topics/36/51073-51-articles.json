You say you didn\u0027t change anything, but SCANsat keeps a local enum representing all of the possible orbit icons. So I suspect it needs to be changed to include the new types. And it may need a re-ordering to pick out the correct section of the texture for icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured out on my own that the addition of SpaceObject is probably responsible for some bugs (Flags not appearing). I don\u0027t know if Unknown is new or not (I don\u0027t think it is?). Either way, I don\u0027t understand how to get the enumeration from MapView and/or the OrbitIcons, and I don\u0027t quite understand how to know which icons are in what places in the appropriate texture. I asked a question about that in the plug-in development forum, and accidentally posted \u0027decompiled code\u0027 -- which got me an \u0027infraction.\u0027 Evidently the fact that MonoDevelop provides this (useless, honestly) information to me without me asking for it is not justification enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll include the toolbar changes and whatever else you have working into my first release. I also plan on SCANsat showing a specified number of future/past orbits on the Big Map, so ideally you can see \u0027at a glance\u0027 if your current orbit/inclination will cover the map or not. I may also try to include the optimum orbit calculator (which is currently written in Octave/Matlab code) directly into the SCANsat library.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T20:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe source is included in my toolbar version download. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/u5egmogu8nisctq/SCANsat_Toolbar_V0_2.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/u5egmogu8nisctq/SCANsat_Toolbar_V0_2.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded the SCAN-master.zip from Github, added my own class then repackaged everything for the download, so it should be identical to the Github version aside from my changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually looked at that OrbitIcons enum in SCANui and I couldn\u0027t quite figure it out either. It\u0027s clear that MapView has a method for retrieving those textures (MapView.OrbitIconsMap), but I\u0027m not clear on how the SCANsat code takes an input from the OrbitIcons enum and translates it into something the MapView can use. I can see how it gets from a VesselType to an OrbitIcon, but there is some step after that that isn\u0027t clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s not only the addition of a new VesselType that screwed up the orbit icons, but that those new types were added to the front of the enum, instead of the end. If it were the other way around (which to me makes more sense) I\u0027m not sure that this would have caused problems in the first place. And yes, I think it\u0027s just SpaceObject that\u0027s new, since there is a reference to VesselType.Unknown in the existing SCANsat code (it just might not have ever been used).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing that you don\u0027t have to worry about re-ordering the OrbitIcon enum to add in SpaceObject, since it is already a jumbled list of VesselTypes and other icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the toolbar code. Adding a hard dependency on Toolbar is really simple, but since some people seem dead-set on not using Toolbar you\u0027ll probably need to allow for the default behavior to work too. I commented out the code necessary for generating the minimized probe icon, and made the UI ask whether the small map has been closed or not before drawing the window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe texture code probably doesn\u0027t need to be commented out regardless of what you change (I did that before changing the window drawing behavior), but you probably will need to make some changes to allow for the default minimized icon to be used instead of the toolbar icon. The only other changes I made were to some access modifiers (from private to internal) and I changed the \u0027minimode\u0027 int to -2 instead of 2 when launching (maybe that\u0027s a bit of a personal thing, but I think windows should never start out opened by default).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just had a minor epiphany. What if MapView.OrbitIconsMap doesn\u0027t get individual textures for every icon, but instead generates one big texture with each individual icon located on a grid within that texture?

I am currently using the same code pathway as the (current/next) orbit to draw an arbitrary number of future orbits. I am just doing this so I can see (at a glance) if my code to *predict* the number of orbits needed to cover is correct or not (it\u0027s not totally correct \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ). But this should really be a separate thing: there should be one button for the last/next orbit, and another button for orbit coverage prediction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, if possible, that both icons should be sized according to the FOV of the current smallest scanner. But one should only show the previous/next orbit (as before) and be attached to one button (ie, the current Orbit button). The other should be attached some other button (say, an Orbit Predictions button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code is not correct yet either. First, the future orbits should be blue, not orange. And actually, I want the future orbits to be a rainbow of colors. I have already input the colors from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESolarized\u003C/a\u003E. There are some clever ways to combine elements of that color palette. In reality, the code is currently backward-projecting all of the orbits in orange -- and blue just shows the one next orbit, no matter how many you ask it to produce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the farther backward or forward you go, the more the opacity of the button should be diminished (perhaps in addition to having multiple colors). You can see some of the opacity reduction working here, but it\u0027s clearly not working correctly yet. I am just getting my feet wet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
