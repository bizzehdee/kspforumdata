wheels full of built in make-work designed to force you to drag an engineer along on anything with wheels because you will get a flat tire, either because you drive like you\u0027re handling a Tron light-cycle, or because you decided to jump that mun crater like the General Lee in space, or because your mobile mining platform is 1 ton below the limit when loaded with ore and fuel, so any driving overloads the wheels and makes using wheeled vehicles not fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand what they were going for, to improve the usefulness of engineers in Career mode, but it breaks the fun in Sandbox when every flight I have to drag engineers along to fix flat tires.\u00A0 That, and the handling of the new stock wheels is... awful.\u00A0 They lose grip whenever they feel like it, gain grip whenever they feel like it, accelerate violently in random directions when you drive like a jerk, and while most of that can be wrestled down to similar levels to the original stock wheels by locking friction and overriding traction control, you\u0027re left with \u0022I\u0027ve got a flat because I hit an anthill\u0022 wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I get it, they needed to go to Unity 5, and everyone kept pushing and begging for U5 and 64 bit, even when they heard \u0027It\u0027ll break the wheel mods\u0027 because mod developers usually were able to bounce back from version-by-version \u0027mod breaking\u0027.\u00A0 The masses thought \u0022it\u0027ll just be a week or two to get our wheels and tracks back\u0022 not realizing that no, it\u0027d need just about a total rewrite and rebuild.\u00A0 I have to stop myself from hitting these people with a \u0022You got what you wished for.\u00A0 This is KSP in Unity 5 64-bit.\u00A0 They told you

addition of more wheelPart-\u0026gt;parentPart joints (or just use the KSP auto-strut feature for them?).\u00A0 If this works though, it would leave us back at looking for a bump stop and sticky
