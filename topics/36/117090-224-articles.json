The Soviet crew parts might be along a branch, so that if you invest in those, you might not get the Apollo/COS stuff until you get loads of points to spend...\n\nReally it requires that you think of career play specifically in the SSTU world.

I would have no problems collaborating on a customized tech tree, though I think that CTT/ETT might be a good place to start from.  I think that ETT is probably closer to what I\u0027m looking for (focused development branches), and seems to be what I\u0027ll be investigating this weekend.\n\nDid a bit of early career playtesting the past few nights, comparing stock-only progression to progression including SSTU parts.  It seems that, for me, regardless of the parts available, the launches generally go (on stock \u0027normal\u0027 difficulty settings):  \n\n1.) First launch, grab science from on the pad and low atmo with a basic flea\u002Bpod\u002Bchute\u002Bgoos.  Completes some contracts and world firsts.  Unlock tier1 nodes, possibly one of the tier2 as well.  This gets 1-2 more science experiments.  \n\n2.) Sub-orbital launch.  Grab science from high-atmo and low-space.  Pod\u002Bchute\u002Bgoos\u002Bsrbs\u002Bdecouplers; can be done with 2x hammer and 1x flea.  Unlock tier2 nodes (~20s).  \n\n3.) Orbital launch.  Whether limited to stock parts or allowing use of SSTU parts, can make orbit with the third launch.  \n\n4.)  Herein lies the problem.  This **should** be a mun-flyby, but stock locks the maneuver nodes and conics behind some building upgrade.  Should have enough funds for them.  But also, even with science from launch#3, the best you will get here are some batteries; no chance of solar, fuel cell, etc, which I consider requisite for anything beyond very basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E missions.  Can be done with batteries alone, but it shouldn\u0027t need to be done that way, at least not with 100EC batteries (perhaps a 500 or 1k would be more suitable).  Ohh, good luck getting both the reaction wheel **and** batteries unlocked that you\u0027ll need...  (might be easier to just do it manned; no antenna needed, fewer batteries)  \n\n5.)  If you get #4 to work out (likely by using a toss-away probe transmitting a bit of science as it flies past the Mun), you -should- have enough tech and facilities at launch #5 to do a Mun orbit and return.  Barely.  Might need to upgrade the launch-pad.  Minmus is still out of the question due to lack of power generation (and it would require dozens of batteries for a minmus probe).  This mission should net you tons of science and funds, paving the way for unlocking the parts needed for mun landings and to get to minmus.  Somewhere in there you\u0027ll need the funds to upgrade the R\u0026D; but worlds-first contracts seem to pay well, so might not be too much of a problem, especially if a few other contracts were done with the previous launches.\n\n# 4 / 5 -- might be better than I remember due to the new \u0027hibernate\u0027 feature on probe cores.  Maybe it doesn\u0027t take a dozen small batteries to go to Minmus anymore  \n\nWith SSTU the #2 launch could potentially be an orbital launch.  The MFTs and MSRBs are a bit overpowered being unlocked at tier1.   Thinking of moving the MFT up to \u0027advanced rocketry\u0027 (tier 3) along with the initial LR-81, and moving the MSRB up to at least general rocketry.  This would enforce the use of stock parts for at least the first two launches, while still letting the initial SSTU parts unlock at about the time where you start needing them.  (A few other things would likely move up a node or two, need to do a bit more early-mid-career testing to see how it all feels).  Going to do a bit more testing/playing/work on it, I think there are a few small changes that could clean up most of the early-career SSTU-being-overpowered problems."},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T19:53:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 47 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like there might be something like that already available.

But also, even with science from launch#3, the best you will get here are some batteries; no chance of solar, fuel cell, etc, which I consider requisite for anything beyond very basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E missions.  Can be done with batteries alone, but it shouldn\u0027t need to be done that way, at least not with 100EC batteries (perhaps a 500 or 1k would be more suitable).  Ohh, good luck getting both the reaction wheel **and** batteries unlocked that you\u0027ll need...  (might be easier to just do it manned; no antenna needed, fewer batteries)  \n\u003E \n\u003E 5.)  If you get #4 to work out (likely by using a toss-away probe transmitting a bit of science as it flies past the Mun), you -should- have enough tech and facilities at launch #5 to do a Mun orbit and return.  Barely.  Might need to upgrade the launch-pad.  Minmus is still out of the question due to lack of power generation (and it would require dozens of batteries for a minmus probe).  This mission should net you tons of science and funds, paving the way for unlocking the parts needed for mun landings and to get to minmus.  Somewhere in there you\u0027ll need the funds to upgrade the R\u0026D; but worlds-first contracts seem to pay well, so might not be too much of a problem, especially if a few other contracts were done with the previous launches.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E # 4 / 5 -- might be better than I remember due to the new \u0027hibernate\u0027 feature on probe cores.  Maybe it doesn\u0027t take a dozen small batteries to go to Minmus anymore  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E With SSTU the #2 launch could potentially be an orbital launch.  The MFTs and MSRBs are a bit overpowered being unlocked at tier1.   Thinking of moving the MFT up to \u0027advanced rocketry\u0027 (tier 3) along with the initial LR-81, and moving the MSRB up to at least general rocketry.  This would enforce the use of stock parts for at least the first two launches, while still letting the initial SSTU parts unlock at about the time where you start needing them.  (A few other things would likely move up a node or two, need to do a bit more early-mid-career testing to see how it all feels).  Going to do a bit more testing/playing/work on it, I think there are a few small changes that could clean up most of the early-career SSTU-being-overpowered problems.\n\u003E \n\nthat\u0027s why I mentioned RP-0, even though it is meant to be an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E tech tree, they changed everything to start with probes, and moved many science parts out of the start, so the first launches are pretty much sub-orbital if you even manage to do that much\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-16T13:33:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2016 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T18:31:57Z","Content":"So I am testing out the new Communication feature in 1.2.2  I equipped a satellite with the BKT-A Solar panels to act as a relay anchor for my probes on other planets.   and am in direct line of site to Kerbol at a circular altitude of 20000km above Kerbin.\n\nThe BKT-A panels are deployed but not generating any electricity.  my probe died of no ECs right after attaining my circular orbit.

The larger panels generally have 2 or more raycasts at even intervals along their length (every 1/3 of the panel, so that a small occlusion doesn\u0027t completely stop EC generation).  These really only matter for part-to-part based occlusion though (see below).\n\nPlanetary occlusion -- I use stock code for that, the bits that determine if a vessel is in sunlight or not (vessel.solarFlux \u003E 0).  So if there are any oddities going on there, they are much deeper rooted than the SSTU solar panel module, and are bugs that need to be fixed in stock code.  To be fair, I have seen a few cases where panels think they are occluded by planets when they really should not be, notably right on the transitions from light-to-dark, and strangely it doesn\u0027t happen in time-warp.  Mostly they appeared as edge cases though that had negligible effect in actual use (e.g. occluded for an extra 3 seconds at dawn/dusk, not a big deal), and regardless, they are problems with the stock code that I can do nothing about.\n\nIf you do manage to narrow down the cause, or have a particular setup that duplicates the problem reliably, please let me know and post it up as an issue on GitHub.  If nothing else it could give me enough information to file a stock bug report regarding their planetary occlusion code.\n\nGeneral development news:\n\nDid quite a bit of work on CTT integration, and general tech-tree cleanup, over the weekend.  While CTT doesn\u0027t fix the problems that I have with the stock tech tree, it does allow for a decent career experience.  The CTT balance that I\u0027ve put in is suited to a much longer game than the stock career balance -- many engines are moved into later nodes, and all of the station-core stuff comes later in the habitation node lines.  The next few days will be spent going over the HAB and LS balancing on the StationCore parts and updating the patches for the rest of the ShipCore/LanderCore parts.\n\nThat was the other bit that I did this weekend, career playtesting, focused on balance (using CTT\u002B\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, among various NF/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E part mods).   Removed all standard stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks and all of the standard stock engines to see how viable SSTU is as a \u0027stock conversion\u0027.  Very usable, though lacking the stock upper stage engines was notable (although, it is notable merely because those engines are very unrealistically overpowered in their size, not because of their raw performance stats).  Things generally went well.  Didn\u0027t run into any new bugs, found and squashed a couple old ones, everything else pretty much worked as expected and intended.\n\nHave also started work on an \u0027SSTU-OptionalPatches\u0027 addon.  Will basically be my \u0027personal\u0027 patch set.  Will be optional as many of the patches are destructive (remove or change parts from stock or other mods).  This will contain things like part-overhauls for other mods (converting things to MEC, MFTs or MSCs), part cleanup for stock and other mods (many parts are redundant / not needed when using SSTU, and can be removed to clean up the editor parts list), and part rebalancing for stock or other mods (mass/cost/tech; not many get rebalanced).  Will be highly recommended, entirely optional, and *completely unsupported* -- use at your own risk, modify as needed/desired.\n\nWill hopefully have an updated release with the recent balance changes available later this week; still a bit more work to do on balancing of the StationCore parts, both stock and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS balance."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceBadger007","CreatedById":150547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T01:32:15Z","Content":"Hey I made this mission, and it used a lot of your parts, so I might as well show it!\n\n [http://imgur.com/gallery/UXbks](http://imgur.com/gallery/UXbks)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-21T01:33:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2016 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceBadger007**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T16:31:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, SpaceBadger007 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey I made this mission, and it used a lot of your parts, so I might as well show it!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [http://imgur.com/gallery/UXbks](http://imgur.com/gallery/UXbks)\n\u003E \n\nVery nice station ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Puts my early career one to absolute shame.\n\nLast couple days were spent doing config work.  And bugfixing.  And more config work.  Also some work on configs.\n\nAll of the outstanding placeholder values in parts have been set appropriately (cost, mass, tech placement).  All of StationCore has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS integration.

Squashed several small bugs relating to model use and ease-of-config setup, and made it so that modular heat shields actually have a cost.  Added mass and costs to the MCB-A parts.  CTT integration is ongoing and nearing completion -- couple minor tweaks to some station part placements are in order, but good aside from that.\n\nHeads up -- the next release is going to have quite substantial changes as far as career balancing is concerned.  Shouldn\u0027t be game breaking, but can certainly be game-impacting (some things will have mass changed, lots of tech-requirements moved around).\n\nPlaying with trusses -- all of them use the MFT module to enable resizing and variant changing, octo trusses include resource-holding variants:\n\n![EkXRQdJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/EkXRQdJ.png)\n\nPlaytesting is still going well.  Fixing things up as I run into them, but not running into much.  Have not managed to duplicate the docking-port-stuck bug, nor have I had any problems with crew capacities/crew transfer.
