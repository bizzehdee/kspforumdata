Since radiators are a hot topic, I thought I\u0027d start a thread where we can share what we\u0027ve learned about heat management.

It takes more heat to raise the temperature of a part by a given amount if it has a higher thermal mass. So parts with higher thermal mass change temperature more slowly than those with a lower thermal mass, both upwards and downwards.\n\u003E \n\u003E Radiative area is the theoretical area that emits or absorbs radiated heat. Parts emit heat when in shadow and absorb it when in sunlight (at least I think this is modelled). Parts with a larger radiative area gain or lose heat faster than those with smaller radiative areas. \n\u003E \n\u003E As I understand it:\n\u003E \n\u003E - All parts has a default specific heat of 800 kJ/tonne-Kelvin defined in Physics.cfg in the root folder (standardSpecificHeatCapacity)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Parts can have that modified in their cfgs by a multiplier (thermalMassModifier, setting this to 2 would double specific heat)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Resources also have their own specific heats defined in ResourcesGeneric.cfg in Gamedata/Squad/Resources (hsp)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Part thermal mass thus should be (dryMass \\* standardSpecificHeatCapacity \\*thermalMassModifier) \u002B (resourceMass \\* hsp) \u003C- Repeat last section for each resource within the part.

Or will the sinks and radiators have to be placed in the immediate vicinity of the heat products in part?\n\nCurrently from what I\u0027ve seen, KSP uses thermodynamics to transfer heat around a vessel: a hotter part transfers heat to the cooler part until the two reach thermal equilibrium. For DSEV, I actively pull heat out of a part and put it into the radiator. I made the assumption that a vessel has a circulatory system built-in, and the radiator circulates coolant through the vessel. That way you don\u0027t need dedicated heat pipes and you keep your part count low.\n\nSome of the feedback I got tonight was that radiators might benefit from a heat transfer rate. Right now I assume that the coolant heats up quickly, gets circulated to the radiator where it \u0022drops off\u0022 the heat, cools down, and is ready for the next part. I could account for heat difference between a part and the coolant but I decided that would take a lot of calculations and slow the game down.

Does KSP\u0027s code have an integrated pipe system, like crossfeeding for heat? This is something the Star Citizen has, where all resources have paths in the shop to their respective targets. For example, heat from weapons engines and shields all get dumped into a cooling system. If the heat output is higher than the cooling system can handle, the parts start failing or being destroyed.

What is the boiling point and the critical temperature of Ablator in KSP? Why heating of the shield never stops at a certain temperature until Ablator runs out?\n\nAlso I don\u0027t understand why Squad gave to heatshields 3400 maxTemp. I\u0027ve not been able to burn them off under any dire circumstances (like 10km/s Jool reentry). And even if we don\u0027t burn them off, the ModuleAblator gotta increase conductivity of heat shields when they run out of the resource. There\u0027s currently no punishment for having a shield with zero Ablator.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T14:49:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:49:51Z","Content":"I updated WildBlueTools this morning in preparation to my next release of DSEV, and made some changes to the heat management. You can [find the GitHub repro here](https://github.com/Angel-125/WildBlueTools).\n\n- Radiators can now use multiple coolants, specified by INPUT\\_RESOURCE nodes.\n\n- Radiators can now suffer coolant loss over time if desired.\n\n- Radiators can now suffer coolant loss while the vessel is under acceleration if desired.\n\n- Radiators can consume ElectricCharge if desired.\n\n- Physics-less parts are now ignored.\n\n- Parts with crew capacity have a target temperature of 293K (room temperature).\n\n- Default target temperature is 49% of the part\u0027s maximum temperature (configurable through the config file), which is just under the stock heat warning indicator\u0027s threshold.\n\n- Radiators now correctly cap their heat transfer once they reach their maximum working temperature.\n\n- Game performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\nTODO:\n\n- Add ModuleTargetTemp to specify a part\u0027s target temperature. This will override the default target of 49% of the part\u0027s max temp.\n\nOnce I get the next updates done I\u0027ll break out the code into a separate dll."}]}
