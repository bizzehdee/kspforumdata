Sean and I had talked at one point about making it so things can be killed off in certain circumstances like that, but we haven\u0027t implemented it yet that i recall. The mod is made so that it can be used by itself, so the usage of waste created by TAC is optional. If it\u0027s there, it consumes it. If it\u0027s not, it runs anyway. My thought behind this was that there is always some kind of waste...Food scraps from kerbals meals and their bathroom breaks...etc. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also talked about venting as well, so that will probably become a thing soon enough. When balancing, I tried to make it as self sustaining as possible. Some modules when activated consume resources in a way that tries to balance out the production and consumption rates so it won\u0027t run out of any one resource if used properly. But it\u0027s not perfect. Usually if something runs dry it\u0027s the CO2, but with kerbals on board that should replenish as well. Really it comes down to balance of parts vs kerbals. If you find something out of whack, you can add or remove a part or add or remove crew to help balance the system. at least, that\u0027s how it\u0027s supposed to work...it\u0027s not perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find anything about the mechanics of this that can be tweaked to balance better, let us know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roboto","CreatedById":79154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T16:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck it out!

I suspect it\u0027s something to do with the amount of light fluctuating between maximum and another smaller value under time compression. As the time compression increases the lower value that it fluctuates to gets even lower. Perhaps increase the amount of light storage to buffer against this effect?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T13:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting mod, as other I also have issues with seed production also some issues with oxygen production and time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it only me or does the fuel production sounds kind of unnecessarily, we have kethane and its required for this mod anyway, simpler to mine for fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar more interesting to generate water, CO2 and oxygen from fuel\u002Boxidizer or kethane, we can already do oxidizer\u002Bpower-\u0026gt;O2, fuel\u002Boxidizer-\u0026gt;water\u002B CO2\u002B power had made a lot of sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso water\u002Bwaste-\u0026gt;waste water for plants.

I originally was running the space port version but it wasn\u0027t working so I came to this forum from the spaceport link only to find this is apperently different from what is on spaceport. So I abandoned that and downloaded the version mentioned in this thread, or at least I think I did because I didn\u0027t see a link for it so I just searched github and what I found seems to match this forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have a bioreactor hooked up to a large greenhouse along with each tank/compressor and all the batteries and solar panels to keep it at full power. When I try to run it sometimes it consumes CO2, sometimes it produces it. Once I got it producing CO2 and oxygen all while duplicating biomass but I can\u0027t seem to replicate that. I can\u0027t interact with the bioreactor, clicking it just list the storage with no options but in the SPH I can set up action groups for it. Sometimes toggling it via the action group consumes biocake but other times it doesn\u0027t.While building all the infoboxes have dozens of generators listed as kethane generators but I don\u0027t really understand which are active when. Half of them will say things like produces x 0/sec or they produce the exact same thing they consume in equal quantities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea behind this but there is just so much going on between all the parts with very little explanation. I\u0027m sure I\u0027m probably hit requirement barriers on the various resources but my resource page now covers the entire screen and sometimes resources don\u0027t seem to transfer between modules.
