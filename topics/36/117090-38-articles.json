I am in the process of writing a custom parachute module which will be responsible for jettisoning the cap when parachutes are deployed.\n\nThe parachute module that I\u0027m writing is a modular-part/model setup, similar to my more recent parts.  It allows for specifying the parachute setup completely in the part.cfg file -- no messing around with Unity animations or all the pain that they bring.  Simply specify the parachute model to be used, and the scaling/rotation offset to use for each deployment status (retracted/semi/full/cut). It includes capability for separately deployed drogue \u002B main chutes, and supports multiple parachute canopies with physical separation of canopies (unlike stock where they all clip into each-other).  Oh, and it actually does the drag-cubes properly for multiple parachute types (again, unlike the stock parachute module.. which cannot support complex drag-cube setups).  Hoping to have this wrapped up in the next day or two, still leaving time to finish off the models\u002Btextures needed for these parts (but as you can see, I\u0027m already poking around at the models a bit when I have time...)."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T18:27:05Z","Content":"^^  \n\nHmmm...

No, it won\u0027t have a big station butt attached to it, but it will have a special purpose built (1.875m) service module.  Will investigate station uses when I get there (though, will consider it a bit during pod design, as it might influence a few things).  It likely won\u0027t have a big reto-motor thing stuck on the front either; that is one of the bits of Gemini/etc that I dislike; so whatever  pod I do, it will -not- have that sort of setup -- it will terminate at a standard docking port, and will likely include a LAS/BPC shaped specifically for it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, BrutalRIP said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E just wondering what the mod is in this pic?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![4yTmG31.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/4yTmG31.jpg?1)\n\u003E \n\nPrototype/concept development of the upcoming GUI reworks for 1.1.
