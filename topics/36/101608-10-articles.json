When it gets to those engines in the loading bar, it just freezes. Nothing happens for 30 minutes. ( After that, I just give up. ) I think it has something to do with the version of the computer, as mine was bought back in 2010. Also, *if,* I take out both of the RN something engines, I have the giant boosters and fuel tanks. None of them are displaying any fuel readings and they don\u0027t seen to give any thrust information either. The boosters also seem to never run out of fuel. MI have seen your SLS Launch One video and they seem to run out of PBAN after 02:02 minutes. Mine, run for... well, however long I want the launch, or should I say, ground booster test to go for. \n\nThe liquid hydrogen tanks show no signs of how much fuel are in those bad boys as well. Or did I already say that? I don\u0027t know. Another problem is that there are two parts of the huge round fuel tank. You select the fuel tank and then drag out another piece of engineering equipment which I am guessing is a structural adapter that hold the RS-25 engines. ( Which I can\u0027t download for some reason. ) When I look at the huge orange fuel tank that is probably somewhat 20 meters tall, I don\u0027t see a little ( Or huge ) Green dot on the bottom. Meaning I need to attach a cubic, octagonal strut on the bottom, and **THEN,** only then, can I attach that huge price of structure that holds the RS-25 engines. Is that what you\u0027re supposed to do?\n\nAlso, which one is the fairing base, and if you do find a photo, can you tell me why it is not working? I went through every single part and put those every single parts on a 2.5 meter part. None of them showed little or big green dots on the side which is where I would probably attach the fairing cones.\n\nSo I also don\u0027t know why this mod turns out bad. [@maccollo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/72759-maccollo/), don\u0027t panic. This won\u0027t mean I don\u0027t like your YouTube videos. I never will not like them. This will not affect your reputation. ( Hopefully )\n\nSo I would like a copy of the code. I have gone through all the things. KSP 1.0.5. It all matches up.\n\nThe same thing happens with RPM. I got a huge post about how to download it. ( I\u0027m guessing the person who made RPM is cind of a coding genius. ) When I download RPM, none of the monsters are there.\n\nSame with KW Rocketry.\n\nAfter a lot of times I have tried to download a couple of mods and none of them have stemmed to like my folders, I am starting to believe it is the computer that is the problem. After all, it **is** 6 years old. So yeah. I also hope this doesn\u0027t mean you spend 5 hours trying to help **me.**  Just at least try to do this in your spare time. \n\nSo, in a shorter ( Much **MUCH** shorter ) story, I would like to know...\n\n1.) What computer version is best for this mod.\n\n2.) A full copy of the code.\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S.
