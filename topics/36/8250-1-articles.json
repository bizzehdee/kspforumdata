On the real shuttle its in the OMS engine, which also provides actual thrust for orbiting maneuvers. It would require an actual plugin to replicate this dual-use module (and it won\\\u0027t be easy, you\\\u0027d need to re-code either an entire RCS or liquid thruster class) - I just made the engine mount the RCS thrusterblock, but it wouldn\\\u0027t be authentic.

There is a .craft file edit you can make to attach the controlsurfaces in 2x symmetry to allow roll (Since the wings are non-symmetrical, it doesn\\\u0027t work by default)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are no engines, so you might want to model an authentic main engine. For mine, I had to make a static cluster of three as one part, and then add a thrustvector, otherwise the shuttle tries to flip when the external tank is attached.
