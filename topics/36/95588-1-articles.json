They are identical to parts that I have modded and still work, except for the resource amounts and type of resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked the resource config files, and everything checks out there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only Add-on I\u0027m using is mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reloaded KSP and the problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: also, the parts operate completely normally in flight, The problem is in the VAB (Didn\u0027t check the SPH because they arnt space plane parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is some additional Information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the unit cost of the resources, who\u0027s containers were causing the problem, to 1 and the VAB returned to normal. I then bumped them up to 4(because I noticed that Xenon has a unit cost of 4) and the problem returned. Logically, that does\u0027t make any sense. I triple checked the part config files and the resource config file and EVERYTHING checks out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyone out there who can help me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T08:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some *unfathomable* reason, Squad decided that the cost of a part as specified in a cfg is the cost \u0027wet\u0027 rather than dry. Which means every time a resource has less than its maxAmount, the amount less than maxAmount is *subtracted* from the part\u0027s cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to set cost (in the cfg) to be the cost dry PLUS the cost of all resources added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T21:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I read the title, I was just thinking that it had to be something like \u0022cost for resources\u0022 is greater than \u0022cost of part\u0022 which results in \u0022I\u0027m sending up an empty tank, and being payed to do it!\u0022 Either way, sounds awesome.
