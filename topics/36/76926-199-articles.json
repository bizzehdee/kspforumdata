I\u0027m also not sure whether max effective range has any effect on lasers, I recall some notes saying lasers now always go to max physics range and scale down over distance based on a realistic calculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my own specific purposes it would be nice if max effective range was also applicable to lasers in one way or another (eg, even if the beam continues out to the edge of the bubble, damage drops to zero beyond the specified range). But that\u0027s only because I\u0027m using them to make replica battletech technology, where the lasers have different ranges. I doubt most people will be worried.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T10:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s a video showing some improvements I\u0027m working on for AI Pilot steering when using fixed guns.\u003Cp\u003ENormal flying involves steering until the velocity vector is pointing in the desired direction. Since there is usually some amount of AoA required for this, aiming the velocity vector at an enemy often means that the vessel was not directly pointing at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when trying to use a gun, the AI will directly point the nose of the plane to the desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will also now use rudder to help aim the gun.
