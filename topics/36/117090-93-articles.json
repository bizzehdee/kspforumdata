It has a liftoff mass of 2,900 Kilograms, is 2.26 meters in length and 2.72 meters in diameter.**\n\n**A pressurized container includes systems for thermal control, electric power supply, communications, telemetry and navigation. The unpressurized portion of the Instrumentation Modules contains the Main Engine and the liquid-fueled propulsion system. The Propulsion System is used for attitude control maneuvers, Rendezvous and Orbit Adjustments as well as the deorbit burn.**\n\n**SKD, the Soyuz Main Engine, provides a thrust of 2,942 Newtons. The entire Soyuz Attitude Control System is comprised of 28 DPO Thrusters. Two clusters of 14 DPO Thruster are mounted on the spacecraft with 12 of these jets providing 26.5 Newtons of Thrust and the remaining 16 providing 130 Newtons. The Propulsion System uses Nitrogen Tetroxide as Oxidizer and Unsymmetrical Dimethylydrazine as Fuel. A total of 800 Kilograms of propellants are carried aboard the SM Tanks. Tank Pressurization is accomplished with high-pressure helium.**\n\n**The Service Module also includes the power generation system consisting of two deployable solar arrays and batteries. The instrumentation module is outfitted with the main flight computer that is in charge of all aspects of the Soyuz Mission up the point of Module Separation when the KSO 20M Computer of the Entry Module takes over.**\n\nHope this helps"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T13:11:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *Someone* wlll probably like this one:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![5nxsAxT.png](http://i.imgur.com/5nxsAxT.png)](http://i.imgur.com/5nxsAxT.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n![Lenin-Cat-Approved.jpg](http://catplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenin-Cat-Approved.jpg)  \n  \n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\nbtw, about the thing we talked on PM yesterday... a communist nine finger bearded frog was forced to testify to the brazilian federal police this morning, so...

Covering all your lifter needs and SOI transport ops. I found myself deleting redundant engine/fuel tank packs, because this mod covers them all. I would make a test copy of your game and with just stock parts, this mod and it\u0027s dependencies (also KJR for good measure) and check your performance. As far as ram is concerned, running just this mod with it\u0027s dependencies, opengl and perhaps a few other mods to add into the mix will cause hardly, if any, crashes and performs beautifully. I use Linux, so mod count isn\u0027t an issue with me. \n\nShadowmage has made this mod exactly for the reason to save ram and increase performance. But, a few workarounds and tips though.\\* \n\n- While this mod does support Modular Fuel Tanks, but doesn\u0027t support LH2 through Modular Fuel Tanks (LH2 support with MFT only works with RealFuels). SSTU has it\u0027s own LH2 configuration, so MFT really isn\u0027t required. But, if you want to use MFT with a stock configuration, you will need Nertea\u0027s Cryogenic Engine Pack for the functionality of LH2 (or write you own config, but it\u0027s not supported if something goes wrong).\n- Remember, this is a developing mod. While you -can- make craft files, It\u0027s urged that you don\u0027t rely on them in the future since Shadowmage updates this mod frequently. I find that each time I update my craft with the new features, it helps me streamline rocket designs. Which is something I like to better myself at. I see a lot of \u0022This is going to break my craft files\u0022 all the time. While you -can- make craft files, they will need to be updated. Shadowmage will give you plenty of warning to change your saved craft to the new updates.\n- If you run into a bug or something funky, make sure it\u0027s not an issue that\u0027s already been addressed on GitHub. Since we are actually testing the game for Shadowmage, this will help him greatly.\n\n\\*  This is my experience, while I am wrong sometimes and do make mistakes on how things operate in this mod, this is what works for me. \n\nCheck the forums and the issue tracker regularly. Shadowmage documents everything he does to not only let us know what\u0027s going on, but I think it helps him set a time frame and keeps track of progress he\u0027s made. \n\nHappy Flying!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T19:07:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hope this helps\n\u003E \n\nYes; Noted, and thrust has been updated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T19:56:48Z","Content":"2kN now? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T21:07:32Z","Content":"Stand-alone landing-gear parts, using shuttle landing-gear geometry.\n\nNose gear:\n\n![v8PA4fi.png](http://i.imgur.com/v8PA4fi.png)\n\nMain gear:\n\n![D9FytBC.png](http://i.imgur.com/D9FytBC.png)\n\nBoth are intended to be clipped inside a fuselage, or could be used as extruded pods; up to the user.

Basically they perform the RV burn, and the deorbit burn.  And yes, their thrust is anemic, and those burns can take a few *minutes* (also realistic). (fuel qty is not yet balanced; it -should- have ~400m/s total dV from the OMS engines if -all- monoprop is used, though some would normally be reserved for docking manuevers, with the shuttle OMS left with around ~350m/s)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T22:24:50Z","Content":"Did I overlook how to activate them then, or is there no fx animation?
