As you can see in the album I\u0027ve posted, there are all manner of burn marks from re-entry. While we have the effects of re-entry in the game, we don\u0027t see its result. I would love to see tall boosters coming back all grey at the bottom and white where the legs are and such or to see how much damage was taken during hard or softer re-entries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Dev note from last year talked about the ablative shader for the heat shields. But I am not sure how that is actually done. I\u0027m in no way a coder and this would take more coding and know how than I have.
