Recycled crafts are turned into ScrapMetal and a small amount of Metal. The Furnaces and the ChemicalReactor can turn ScrapMetal into Metal.\n\nAlso there is a new EVA item (requires \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E) called RecyclingSite that must be attached to the ground.

The Site must be connected to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E connector port to store recycled resources.\n\nThe tank-configs are completly overhauled and support 9 different resource setups at the moment. New 1.25 m sized tanks and one adapter to 2.5 m are available.\n\nThe Station Tanks are now separated into the customisation folder. The series now ranges from 1.25 m to 3.75 m with all sorts of adapters.\n\nA variaty of 1.25 m sized parts like Furnace, Fabrication Container and Recycler for smaller crafts.\n\nThe Planetary Assembly Management (PAM) acts as a Survey Station with integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage for Launchsites, Tools and other stuff. Available in 2.5 and 1.25 m.\n\nFor more info see the changelog. Have fun with the update!\n\n**Future plans:**  \n\nMaking some new screenshots to replace the outdated stuff. Working on a deployable launchpad.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n\\*\\*2017.01.21 - Recycling Everything - v0.8.2\\*\\*\n\n\\* Moved parts to customisation: KD-STXXXXFS. New Adapters included.  \n\n\\* New part: KD-FurnaceSmall.  \n\n\\* New part: KD-FabricationContainer (Metal --\u003E Rocketparts; needs an engineer).  \n\n\\* New part: KD-PAM (Planetary Assembly Management aka SurveyStation); has no IVA currently.  \n\n\\* New part: KD-PAMSmall.  \n\n\\* New part: KD-RecyclerSmall.  \n\n\\* New part: KD-RecycleSite (Needs \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E).  \n\n\\* New parts: KD-T125XFS (X=variant) 1.25 m Storage Tanks in 3 sizes(1, 2, 4 m)).  \n\n\\* New part: KD-T2001FS (1.25 to 2.5 m storage adapter).  \n\n\\* Re-exported most of the models with improved shading and materials.  \n\n\\* Re-worked most of the animations. Except the tanks all parts use ModuleColorChange for glow animations (can be changed in cfg).  \n\n\\* Overhauled resource storage and mass for ALL tanks.  \n\n\\* Added ScrapMetal setup.  \n\n\\* Added \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E setup (temporary, for balancing. Will be replaced in the future).  \n\n\\* Added surface attach to some parts (Launchpads for example).  \n\n\\* Fixed Furnaces MetalOre extraction ratio. Now really 70% (was 100 before).  \n\n\\* Recycling produces ScrapMetal and small amounts of Metal.  \n\n\\* Added ScrapMetal--\u003EMetal converters (Furnaces,ChemicalReactor).  \n\n\\* Changed SpecialistBonus for KD-Furnace.  \n\n\\* Changed SpecialistBonus for KD-3D-Printer.  \n\n\\* ChemicalReactor can now extract RareMetals and ExoticMinerals from Dirt (if OSE Workshop is installed).  \n\n\\* Changed dependency for Metal,Ore--\u003ESpecializedParts converter to require UmbraSpaceIndustries.  \n\n\\* Changed SimpleConstruction support: If SC is installed the following changes are applied:  \n\n1. No MetalOre Harvester.  \n\n2. No MetalOre--\u003EMetal converters.  \n\n3. Ore--\u003EMetal converters give 70 times more Metal.  \n\n4. Metal tanks storage-capacity is increased by factor 5 (ingame units, not mass!).  \n\n\\* Changed FS/IFS priority. If both are installed IFS module will be used.  \n\n\\* Added optional config to use RocketParts with OSE Workshop instead of MaterialKits, RareMetals \u0026 ExoticMinerals (KeridianDynamics-OSE-RP.cfg).\n\nThanks to [@wasml](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120438-wasml/) for the feedback on the tanks.
