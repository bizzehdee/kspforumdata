These strategies can\u0027t be turned on/off at a whim - once you choose one, you either have to complete it (and get a reward), or let the timer run out (and get a \u003Cem\u003Estiff\u003C/em\u003E penalty). They have some pretty big upsides (vastly increased milestone rewards for the chosen body, cheaper research, big reward at the end) compared to the downsides (modest setup fee, vastly decreased milestone rewards for other bodies, giant penalty for failure). But we\u0027ll see how it looks with other strategies I come up with - I\u0027m willing to call it balanced if a player isn\u0027t automatically choosing these over other strategies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and these are dynamic, of course.

The strategies that I happened to work on first are ones that don\u0026#39;t fit in that mold.

The benefit to the \u0022program\u0022 strategies will be cash up front (to kick-start the endeavor), with small cash and large rep awards on completion (and keeping the modifiers to milestones as is). There also be a large cash and massive rep penalties for failure. So these strategies will serve as a source of up-front funding for the player\u0026#39;s desired goal, allowing them to not have to do contracts.
