Anyhoo... when you said \u0022shoot it back to my space station...\u0022 it reminded me of something I\u0027d seen in Anarchy Online. They have these HUGE planet-based cannons that shoot cans of ore to orbiting refineries. Maybe reaching escape velocity on a planet with an atmosphere would be asking too much from a cannon, but from a moon - maybe not. There\u0027d be a lot of math involved depending on each moon\u0027s escape velocity if you were going to launch it into an orbit. Hmm... it would have to not be considered \u0022space debris\u0022 either, or the game could delete it.\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe not a cannon/launcher. Maybe you attach a couple of SRB\u0027s to the side of a can, and a miniature control pod with integrated docking port. Food for thought. Mining and refining fuel on a planetary body is always going to be problematic if you don\u0027t have a fairly easy way to get the fuel into space. Is it worth the hassle, or is it easier to simply ferry fuel from Kerbin\u0027s space port? If you\u0027re taking a ship halfway across the solar system, chances are it won\u0027t have the ability to land on a moon, refuel, and take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@RoverDude: No hurry, but please let me know the results of changing \u0022sphere\u0022 to \u0022cube\u0022 when you get around to it.

TAC, in that sense, can \u0027use\u0027 ORS because its Water is named the same as ORS\u0027s Water.
