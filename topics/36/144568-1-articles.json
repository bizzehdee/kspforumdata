But many things I still have to do with my left hand. \u00A0The reason is, my left eye is dominant. \u00A0For most right handed people, their right eye is dominant, making them left brained. \u00A0Most left handed people are left eye dominant, making them right brained. \u00A0Yes, it\u0027s strange, each side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. \u00A0Right brained people are considered to be analytical, logical. \u00A0They make good coders. \u00A0Left brained people are considered to be more creative and artistic. \u00A0They make good modellers.

Players know these things. \u00A0Though they may have never seen one in person, they know what they are and how they work... and they want them. \u00A0As a modder it\u0027s a constant struggle to provide the reality everyone expects and be creative.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy left brain revolts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022georgia, serif\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;line-height:25.6px;\u0022\u003EBack to my brain.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022georgia, serif\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;line-height:25.6px;\u0022\u003EOne of the advantages of having both hemispheres of my brain struggling for complete control is that I\u0027m dual purpose. \u00A0Roughly a year ago I started modding. \u00A0Before then, I\u0027d never even looked at CAD software or game engines. \u00A0Now, I\u0027m getting proficient at creating models.\u00A0Instead of taking days, I finish them in hours, sometimes in minutes. \u00A0I\u0027m beginning to understand the KSP API, I have at least a working\u00A0knowledge\u00A0of Unity, I\u0027m a hack at coding in C#, a language I never used before, and I\u0027m getting better at texturing. \u00A0So, I can write code. It\u0027s not elegant but it works.\u00A0And I can be artistic enough to make acceptable mods. \u00A0Instead of being a coder begging for a modder\u0027s help or a modder begging for a coder\u0027s help..

\u00A0I know my artistic skills. \u00A0While I\u0027m acceptable, attempting to recreate reality is not something I\u0027m capable of. \u00A0The finite details of texturing for realism escapes me. \u00A0Remember, I\u0027m half an artist. \u00A0But, that doesn\u0027t stop my left brain from desiring more creativity.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022georgia, serif\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;line-height:25.6px;\u0022\u003ENow don\u0027t get the idea that I\u0027m giving up the Maritime Pack (not that I could if I wanted to it seems). \u00A0I\u0027ll still be maintaining and working on that. \u00A0But, my left brain has had enough of trying to mimic things and recreating things that already exist. \u00A0It wants more room to express itself.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EKerb-fu\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:georgia, serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;line-height:25.6px;\u0022\u003EJust before I stared modding, I downloaded \u0027the\u0027 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/67611-102-vertical-propulsion-emporium-v022b-10th-may-2015/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKSP steampunk pack\u003C/a\u003E made by Kerb-fu. \u00A0One of the things I was able to do with that pack was make a sailing ship. \u00A0Not a little row boat, an actual ship. \u00A0While it didn\u0027t work quite as I had hoped, the inspiration was enough to help get me started in modding. \u00A0While \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70533-beale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002270533\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70533-beale/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Beale\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is responsible for me \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126101-beginners-part-modding-tutorial/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elearning the modelling software Wings 3D\u003C/a\u003E and you can blame him for this, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105259-kerb-fu/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105259\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105259-kerb-fu/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerb-fu\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003Eis the inspiration behind the Maritime Pack. \u00A0I found many of his parts to be intriguing to the point of absurdity. \u00A0Gunpowder \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s?

mod that I can. \u00A0Therefore, it\u0027s still going to be a while before I package this up, I want to make sure it\u0027s something I\u0027m pleased with. \u00A0In the meantime, it seems this planet revolves around hype these days instead of mind altering drugs (not that that\u0027s a bad thing mind you.). \u00A0So, I\u0027m here to generate hype. \u00A0Over the next few weeks, as I add on more parts and features, I\u0027m going to be slowly releasing updates to my work. \u00A0Consider this a mini-blog until release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan

If you don\u0027t want wooden barrels for fuel tanks, don\u0027t use them. \u00A0Another BIG difference between his mod and mine will definitely be appearance. \u00A0Not everyone has a fantastic computer. \u00A0For a LONG time, on 32 bit KSP and 8 gigs of ram I had to be VERY selective about the mods I chose. \u00A0His are low polygon count and low res textures. \u00A0And for someone who wants to put hundreds of parts on a vessel, his mod allows you to do that without lagging the crap out of your machine. \u00A0That, and his creative mind has come up with the most bizarre and, IMHO, fantastic contraptions. \u00A0I even had one of his airships flying around the other day, puttering about with biplane prop engines. \u00A0And his ingenuity in creating solar sails still has me wanting to steal his idea. So, his mod definitely has a place. \u00A0It will be a long time before I come even close to either the ingenuity he has or the part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy approach will be MUCH different. \u00A0I\u0027ve explained to my alpha testers that I\u0027m not holding back on polygon count. \u00A0I\u0027m not using tiny images for my textures either. \u00A0This mod is my opportunity to be artistic AND logical. \u00A0But, that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m being wasteful. \u00A0I\u0027m not going overboard with 4k graphics. \u00A0If you take a look at the 3D\u0027s on Sketchfab, you\u0027ll see some parts have some sizable poly counts, into the thousands. And thus far, I\u0027m limiting myself to 1024k images and those will be .dds compressed. \u00A0While they do look good from a distance, if you zoom in on these parts, yes, they will look pixelated. Somewhere there has to be a trade-off between ram usage and appearance.\u00A0When I can, I reuse textures to save ram. But if I want something to have a special texture, I\u0027m NOT going to spend hours cobbling\u00A0it together from several others, I\u0027ll make a new one.\u00A0Mine will spew sparks, jets of steam, whirling lights on goofy gizmos,\u00A0just any animation or particle effect that suits my fancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... this means that with my mod, you\u0027re going to hit graphics lag a lot sooner with high part counts than you will with Kerb-fu\u0027s work. \u00A0Knowing this is why I\u0027ve been I\u0027ve been trying to get him to revive his work (I think it\u0027s working). \u00A0Each\u00A0of us will fill a different steampunk niche. \u00A0But I\u0027m also trying to make my parts look close enough to his in color selections so that it won\u0027t be a huge stretch to use his parts and mine on the same vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, and Kerb-fu has warned me about this, not everyone has the same mental image of what steampunk is or how it should look. \u00A0One browse through Google images and you\u0027ll see a VAST variety of styles. \u00A0I know of at least 3 distinct varieties of Captain Nemo\u0027s Nautilus, from Jules Verne\u0027s drawing up to the latest movie version of it. \u00A0Each of them, vastly different. \u00A0I am going to create what I see in my mind. \u00A0Not what everyone else sees. \u00A0I like Kerb-fu\u0027s \u0022Brass and Class\u0022 approach and that\u0027s what I\u0027m striving for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKenneth Branagh\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u002219807886_l.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://c.myspace.com/Groups/00019/68/87/19807886_l.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:250px;height:325px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If someone\u00A0wants\u00A0dirty, grimy steampunk, I can direct them\u00A0to some nice modelling and paint programs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, on to your ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo things you had in your list that immediately appeal to me are peroxide and ice. The vast majority of \u0027devices\u0027 I\u0027m going to create will be based on burning ore (and soon water) to create steam. \u00A0Today I\u0027m working on turning solar power into steam and drills for ore. \u00A0Getting the power consumption correct so that it\u0027s balanced is a chore. \u00A0Being able to use my parts on other orbital bodies will soon become necessary. \u00A0For the moment, you\u0027ll be limited to oxygenated bodies (Kerbin, Laythe). \u00A0Ice drilling would solve a problem of not having intake air on other planets. \u00A0And peroxide is just hydrogen and oxygen. \u00A0So those make good logical sense. \u00A0I don\u0027t want to do what many mods do and get into dozens of fuels that can\u0027t be \u0027gathered\u0027 \u00A0I want to stick to the basics of Steam (and water derivatives), Ore, Air, and Electricity for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral of the parts you envision are already in place and others are planned. \u00A0One in particular I hadn\u0027t thought of that will get implemented is a steam gyroscope/reaction wheel (rather than electric).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, thanks,\u00A0\u00A0I have bookmarked your ideas and feel free to pass along any more you have!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-27T19:10:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2016 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T02:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings folks. \u00A0I\u0027m back with more cargo for the hype train.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, today\u0027s screenshots:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AJnEYI7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AJnEYI7.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zf6r6dl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zf6r6dl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday we continue our steampunk submarine build with three new parts. \u00A0That\u0027s the good news. The bad news, if you\u0027re familiar with my Maritime Pack, these parts shouldn\u0027t be anything new to you in function... well, not much, but some.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway. The first thing you\u0027ve probably noticed are the two stacks sticking out the side of the submarine. Those.. are engines. \u00A0While putting a boiler inside one of the hull parts is I supposed doable, it might be a bit\u00A0much in\u00A0the polygon department. So,\u00A0I had to kinda trust your imagination on this one. \u00A0Just like any other engine, you can right click to activate. \u00A0Unlike most other engines, it\u0027s thrust is nearly zero. \u00A0It\u0027s sole purpose is to convert the resource Ore into steam. \u00A0I also consumes a small amount of Compressed Water in the process and requires some oxygen to burn the ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompressed Water is another resource that will be in this mod. \u00A0It\u0027s primary use will be ballast, both to help\u00A0vessels on the water keep an even keel and to submerge vessels. \u00A0Added to the front of the submarine is the newly, or is that old-ly, redesigned water compressor/decompressor. \u00A0Two convenient pieces in one, it does both. \u00A0Parts designed to fit on the bow and stern have compressed water compartments. \u00A0And, by doing the alt-right click on both parts, you can transfer this ballast between parts. \u00A0This makes it pretty easy to balance your vessel out both for riding above the waves and beneath them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, as I mentioned the stacks need intake air. \u00A0And what better way to do that steampunk style is with a good old-fashioned ship\u0027s ventilator. \u00A0Those of you who know the MP, know this part already. \u00A0I just brassed and classed it up a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stack you see here is one of two available. \u00A0The other is almost identical except it\u0027s a straight stack. \u00A0The one here has a 90 degree elbow at the bottom.. which makes it look a lot better when mounted on the sides of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, here\u0027s something that is different but, it should be expected. \u00A0If you dive below the surface of the water. \u00A0The stacks become flooded and shut down, almost instantly. \u00A0And you can\u0027t restart them till you surface. \u00A0So make sure you have plenty of steam built up before diving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, the compressor assumes you can pull water out of thin air (and I believe in reality you can). In the future, that\u0027s going to change. Pulling it out of air will give much less desirable results than if\u00A0you were sitting in the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, now that I\u0027ve got the three major resources on this iron-clad monster, it\u0027s time to make some steam!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dnf2Nf7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dnf2Nf7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I\u0027m not up to my usual par with\u00A0humorous anecdotes today.
