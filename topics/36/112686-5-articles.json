I returned to code this weekend. The interpreter is much better after a slight redesign. Above, is the PHP print of a PART array from the Squad externalCommandSeat.cfg. Basically what I lacked before was well formed data. The data I got from the interpreter was sent to javascript with duplicate keys. Now that\u0027s been corrected and each node in the cfg has a unique index. What\u0027s really cool about that is, in es6 we have a ton of useful javascript object methods. As a result I can now search for a key (like the unique index) , no matter the arbitrary depth,  and change that objects properties. That means that the html ui (you can see a preview a few posts back) can be assigned click events through jquery and the database representing the Part that came from the interpreter will be immediately validated then updated. This is the theory anyways.\n\nThe cfg.js is a javascript framework I\u0027m creating which allows for validation of part.cfg node data, as well as the creation of formatted nodes and modules. It works like this:\n\n    cfg.get(obj_name.children).append({type : \u0027MODULE\u0027,children : {\tname : \u0027ModuleAnimateGeneric\u0027,\tanimationName : \u0027myAnimation\u0027,\tisOneShot : false,\tstartEventGUIName : \u0027extend\u0027,\tendEventGUIName : \u0027retract\u0027,\tactionGUIName : \u0027toggle\u0027\t},\n      \treturn : false}, callback());\n    \n    // Obj_name.children is the parent you wish this module to be a child of. Children are always appended to the children array of the parent\n    // object. Cfg.js has an internal library of cfg data formats (like vector3 or attachRules) which tell it how to validate the datatype of a \n    // node. Essentially all that cfg.js does is add valid part data objects to a Part object. \n\nit\u0027s not an accident that the notation above looks a lot like jQuery. I felt that traversing part.cfg data was very similar to traversing the DOM in html. Cfg.js, much like jQuery, adds and deletes nodes as well as iterates over collections and change attributes.  Also, I\u0027m making sure to keep it vanilla javascript, so you can use it\u0027s ability to read and modify cfg data for whatever your purposes might be. \n\nFor CFGKit the program logic is handled by cfgKit.js and kit.js. Both files work together to handle the data binding and adjusting data views as well as importing and exporting cfg projects and saving a project\u0027s metadata as json. \n\nI know it won\u0027t be very exciting to some, but I feel that having an automation tool like this will help me make less mistakes that often happen when hand coding each cfg file. It may be interesting to some of you to know that modeling for me is the fastest and easiest part of creating a new part for Kerbodyne Plus. Importing into Unity comes in second, then texturing, then cfg editing last. Why? Because cfg\u0027s are very brittle. They are case sensitive and repetitive. I\u0027ve struggled getting a part to load correctly for an entire week, just to find out I had an extra comma somewhere. \n\nAnyways, the hard parts are over now, I just have to craft a massive json file to serve as a module encyclopedia and finish the javascript ui scripting. Keep an eye out, 1.1 is coming soon!\n\nEDIT: Made a ton of progress today! However, I underestimated the amount of digging I\u0027d have to do in the c# assemblies to get at the data I needed, sigh. I drilled down in found everything I needed in spite of it being like finding a needle in a haystack. Since this is the first time I\u0027ve ever poked around in the C# files, it was um, interesting (read really hard). Along the way I updated the wiki\u0027s entries for ModuleTestSubject. I have some other useful data to add (concerning the ModuleResourceScanner and ModuleScienceExperiment), but that will have to wait. I\u0027m pooped.\n\nI leave you good people with this, a massive list that this picture does not do justice (around 300 entries). This is all the cfg properties I could find.

I feel like the texture is close to giving the impression of scale I\u0027m going for. This kind of texture is always a bit difficult to make. I try to keep my textures to 1024 at the largest ( who am I kidding. All these parts are huge!). So, to make a large part like this new tank (which is stretching the meaning of large, seeing as it\u0027s 30m high :0 ), the texture has to repeat. But, if the texture is too repetitive then believability is broken. I\u0027m not suggesting that the texture has to look real. If the model is supposed to look toy-ish, than the user should believe that it\u0027s toy-ish, and not a bad attempt at a realistism that ended up looking toy-ish. It\u0027s a subtle but important difference that\u0027s fundamental to visual design. And it\u0027s darn hard to achieve at times, honestly. Anyways, for this new tank texture, I tried to be extra clever, by tactically splitting up the geometry so that uvs would repeat. That geometry was also mirrored or rotated in places to break up the repetitive patterns. Some repetition is ok though because steel welded tanks like these are made of modular steel panels which are similar and repeat. If you look closely at the first stage of the falcon 9, you can sometimes make out the seams where the panels meet under the paint. If I wanted to recreate that effect here I would just use normal maps. But, I\u0027ve noticed performance his in KSP from using large normal maps, so I tend to avoid it. So far I think this choice has been a good one. I think the textures look more unified and cleaner because of it. \n\nThroughout the process of making Kerbodyne Plus, I\u0027ve changed my approach multiple times as I learned more about this kind of stylization. Most of the model making I\u0027ve done up to this point has been for extremely realistic applications. This is the first time I\u0027ve really done anything approaching stylization in a 3d model. It was a bit of a learning curve coming from texture painting at 8k\u002B resolution, and near infinite polycounts. However, I\u0027ve learned a lot through several experiments, and failed attempts. The style guide of Kerbodyne Plus is finally beginning to emerge. I think (hope) that style changes won\u0027t be happening as much any more, rendering these redesigns unnecessary. My rule of thumb is, if it\u0027s not right, it\u0027s not right, so change it. Which is why I\u0027ll completely abandon designs that seemingly have nothing wrong with them. If you stand back and take a look at that \u0022cool\u0022 part, like the old NRAX converter for instance, within the context of all the other parts and the parts yet to be made you\u0027ll see the problems and inconsistencies.  In the case of the old NRAX converter, it was kind of plain looking for one, it had a large polycount at 10k\u002B but also it was a little to realistic and or complicated. When I placed other complex parts next to it, those complex parts started to look simple by comparison.  With my second attempt, NRAX v2, I had the opposite problem, I whent to simple.

So, I can see how a mod like mine, that claims to be for end-game parts and focuses on near future technology (as well as large scale design) would seemingly be a good fit for a centrifuge system. However, the only reason why NASA and other space related organizations need or want a centrifuge is for human health concerns as well as ease of mobility while in space. However, KSP does not have mechanisms which degrade skeletons over time or ways for Kerbals to even move in IVA. It makes more sense for life support mods to address this or incorporate them.\n\nMy position from the start has been to be mod agnostic. I don\u0027t want to support mods, it\u0027s too much work and it can cause installation conflicts. B9 for example, had like 4 or 5 dependencies which often broke whenever KSP was updated. As a user that\u0027s annoying. As a mod maker it\u0027s also annoying to have to wait on other mods to update. Adding a centrifuge would be setting a weird precedence where people might wrongfully expect that KP is a life support mod. It\u0027s not. I expect I\u0027d get a lot of people nagging me to make KP TAC compatible. I can just imagine people asking for greenhouses ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) \n\nAlso, plugin development is something I\u0027m trying actively to avoid, so in the case of a centrifuge with a spinning IVA, I\u0027m suspicious as to whether or not that could ever be done stock. As I understand it, the internal space for [@Badsector](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118465-badsector/) \u0027s centrifuge are located in the center column and not in the spinning hub portion. I would think it would be the hardest part about making a centrifuge, so it\u0027s no surprise to me that he hasn\u0027t finished yet. However I don\u0027t know this for a fact so maybe @Badsector can enlighten me. \n\nI honestly don\u0027t see anyway around these issues. I envision that other mods will make parts that fill these gaps in gameplay, and then users pick and choose what mods they want to depend on for that gameplay. The responsible thing to do as a mod maker, I feel, is to facilitate that so as to not make it hard for other mods to be installed with theirs and not force dependencies on users. Kerbodyne Plus is focused on station parts and motherships.\n\nI do appreciate the feedback though peeps! I\u0027m glad you guys care about and support KP ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
