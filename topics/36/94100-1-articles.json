I\u0027m trying to make it radially attach but also have a node on top and bottom to put an engine and nose cone cant figure out how to do that. Also when I do attach it it attaches somewhere in the middle of the part rather than on the support legs. And lastly after I attach the part or click off the part I can\u0027t grab my part again and I don\u0027t know how to fix that.
