Issue had some updates to it today.. so hopefully will be sorted out this week.\n\nFound new bug in gimbal module that breaks all multi-engine engine-cluster setups.  Bug report submitted ([http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8345](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8345)).  Awaiting fix; as with the drag-cubes, I cannot work around this one... it completely breaks the mod in functional use.\n\nWorked around the IMassModifier bug by defaulting to a non-zero \u0027modified mass\u0027 in the module, caching the calculated mass, and returning either the default or cached calculation as appropriate (is the same field... just starts with default and is updated to cached value when it is calced/recalced).  Stock also \u0027improved\u0027 this functionality by polling for mass for all parts on-tick rather than only on-editor-changes; displayed mass for parts should now be much more consistent across various mods, screens, and scenes.\n\nGot all but ModularFuelTanks converted over to use the new UI controls; went alot faster (and cleaner, eaiser) after they added in the UI callback setups.  In general the editor UI will be much more responsive while using SSTU parts, as I\u0027ve eliminated all of the uneccessary OnEditorShipModified events being fired (now they only get fired when cost/mass/geometry are actually updated).  Also cleaned up drag cube recalculation code to only update a drag cube for a part at most once per tick, which eliminates 70% of the drag-cube recalculation (previously the engine cluster would cause recalculation, and so would the node-fairing; often also triggering a third or fourth recalc from the event cycles).\n\nSo... -if- the above bugs get fixed... SSTU should have even better performance in general ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAside from those two bugs most everything appears to be working properly.  Still quite a large list of things on my \u00271.1. update TODO\u0027 list, but many of those can be done in short order after the initial updating is finished.\n\nWill start publishing 1.1 test releases as soon as those two stock bugs listed above are solved.  Both of those render the mod functionally unusable (can\u0027t use map mode with many parts as root; can\u0027t use engine clusters in actual clusters...), and would be pointless to post releases as long as they exist."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T20:01:43Z","Content":"If anyone could do some testing and confirm the bug report regarding the gimbal modules, it will greatly increase its chance of being fixed in a timely manner:\n\n[http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8345](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8345)\n\nBasically to confirm the bug you\u0027ll need to edit one of the stock engine part config files;  remove the mesh=XXX, replace that with a properly setup MODEL node (e.g model=URL to model), and add a rotation to that model node (rotation = 0, 90, 0) for that model; use the patched engine in a craft; launch it, examine gimbal response to various inputs (notably, check that it responds to roll input improperly, and/or does not respond to pitch/yaw inputs properly).\n\nHere is an example of how to edit/update the stock mammoth engine to test the bug:  \n\nComment out the mesh= line, and add the MODEL node to the config file.

Still left to do is re-export all of the ShipCore engine-containing parts (service modules, shuttle fuselage) to fix up their gimbal orientations.  Still more on the 1.1. TODO list, but finally the list is growing shorter rather than longer.\n\nGot the A\u002BB tank type swapped around yesterday, and re-exported all their models minus the top and bottom cap;  this is so that I can introduce an inset mount type (or two/three) for use as inset-engine mounts for landers/etc (those will be coming later...).\n\nStarted working last night on enabling -optional- colliders for node-fairings, petal adapters, isdc, and pdc parts.  This will end up with a toggle in the editor that determines if colliders are enabled or disabled;  for isdc this will enable surface attach, for the rest though I will be disabling surface attach for those colliders (as they either move, or get attached to other parts.... anything surfaced attached would look strange after activation or jettison as it would be floating in its previous position and/or destroyed by collision upon detach/jettison).  So far I have these setup to create 1 collider-per-face, but will have an option to adjust the # of faces per collider when it is all done (not sure if it will be config or UI based).\n\nOn the stock issues front; NathanKell has kindly begun looking into the gimbal problems, so hopefully a resolution will be found and available soon.

Have not decided which one, or at what ratio... but will likely get that all sorted out in the next day or two.  This is so that there is a separate pool of fuel for RCS and engines, and so that the fuel obeys stack-flow rules.  The few exceptions to this might be those specialty parts that are intended to burn the same fuel in their RCS and service engines... where I will likely just make the RCS use the bi-propellant fuel as well.  Still a bit to figure out on it... but as my mod is mostly a \u0027realism-light\u0027 type setup, I think this fits a bit better than just slapping MonoProp on everything."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T17:24:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the support guys ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Its nothing life-threatening, or even that serious; just enough to keep me distracted for a few days.

Trust me. I been drinking whiskey for medicinal purposes since I was a little boy and was common practice when your parents come from a generation when there was no such thing as a doctor visit. I\u0027m not an alcoholic by a long shot, I haven\u0027t touched alcohol in years, but I will when I get sick/down and out and it fixes me right up. Not to mention, you see donkeys for a little while, which is a nice side effect."}]}
