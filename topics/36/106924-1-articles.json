For KEES you have to analyse the exposed samples in a lab, so perhaps a suggestion to Nehemia is to be able to process them in a lab module (for partial science, say 80%) instead of having to return them to Kerbin.\n\nI\u0027m limiting myself here with just making it work for 1.0x, and not making any functional/design changes until/unless Nehemia abandons these mods (he hasn\u0027t; he\u0027s just away temporarily).\n\nYou should be able to return the samples though if you perform an easy re-entry and have a heatshield. Perhaps the KEES Payload Carrier will need to have its temperature raised slightly if people are having trouble with this.\n\nThe other thing is if the KIS definition for the experiments is changed, they could be stored in a capsule seat instead; I\u0027m undecided about this as they are quite large, and in KAS you could only carry one at a time, but you can easily make this change yourself.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Micha,\n\u003E When KIS was first released, I modded this mod for my personal use to use KIS.\n\nCool! Do you have your version on Github? I\u0027d like to see how you fixed it and how you decided to configure everything.\n\nAlso, I did initially think about limiting the KEES Payload Carrier KIS definition to match the original KAS definition, but then I thought that:\n\n1) it would make it a very large KIS container with very limited storage compared the others. Until/unless a KIS container can be limited to a type of item, that didn\u0027t make sense to me from a KIS perspective.\n\n2) It makes the point of needing a carrier and separate experiments a bit pointless, if you can only carry a single experiment anyway. But again, this is a balance issue and I\u0027m certainly happy to consider improvement suggestions. Eventually Nehemia will decide anyway.\n\nOne other way it might work better is by overriding the size of the KEES items and make them larger than what KIS calculates. That way the KIS container can stay large, but still only fit 2 KEES items."},{"CreatedByName":"rockowwc","CreatedById":138930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:41:00Z","Content":"Thanks for the help, I managed to get the carrier attached and mount and run the experiment (teaches me to RTFM next time).\n\nLoaded a quicksave and it worked this tme... sigh..\n\nRocko\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T10:52:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rockowwc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:21:58Z","Content":"Is anyone else having problems with contracts?
