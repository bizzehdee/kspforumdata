They\u0027re not in any particular order but are sorted into categories for parts I think are most important to add, parts that maybe aren\u0027t so essential but that I at least would find nice, and additions specific to the DLC packages. Many of these parts are already provided via one mod or another, but to obtain all of them would require downloading many different mods, creating issues with compatibility, game balance, and having tons of extra parts that change the game beyond the scope of filling in gaps in the stock parts. Having extra new parts isn\u0027t something I\u0027m saying is bad - it\u0027s just not the goal \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d like to discuss in this thread includes others nominating parts that the game really seems like it was supposed to have, but more importantly whether I should try to assemble a pack out of existing mod parts (and navigate redistribution permissions) or recreate those that exist (and create afresh the few that don\u0027t) and who else is interested in helping, largely as I\u0027m vaguely okay but not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E good at 3D modeling or texturing (evidence: my old Jump Drive mod) - certainly not up to par with those who made the game\u0027s newer part models. \u003Cstrong\u003EI essentially see this as a collaborative community project\u003C/strong\u003E, though if it turns out I\u0027m the only one who wants these or can\u0027t find useful common ground, I accept the risk of having to try to do it all myself or give up on the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the curators of mods that contain these parts are interested, feel free to nominate your own parts for inclusion in this hypothetical pack. This is not a vanity opportunity and in all likelihood parts that don\u0027t closely match the stock look, scale, and functionality won\u0027t be included as-is, if at all, but if you do have a good fit, perhaps we can combine our work into a holistic one-stop package.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELinear Aerospike:\u003C/strong\u003E There is a toroidal aerospike, but nothing good for making VentureStar and X-33 replicas.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESize 2 LV-N:\u003C/strong\u003E The LV-N is wonderful, but propelling a large interplanetary mothership with it requires either an abysmal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or an unholy part count. A double-sized LV-N with quadruple the thrust would be very useful and as I recall is often requested, provided by stand-alone mods, or a motivation to download the Interstellar or Near-Future mod packs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESize 2 Liquid Fuel tank:\u003C/strong\u003E For some reason, liquid fuel tanks come in Size 0, Size 1, Mk2, and Mk3, but Size 2 only provides liquid fuel and oxidizer combinations. Mk3 is very similar to Size 3 in cross-section, but Mk2 is not a good substitute for Size 2, particularly as its capacity is on par with Size 1. The increased collision tolerance is nice for aircraft but irrelevant for nuclear motherships.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELong Size 0 Tanks:\u003C/strong\u003E Size 1 and larger fuel tanks come in short and long varieties and some in between, but in Size 0 the only cylindrical tank is the Oscar-B, meaning that providing large amounts of fuel in narrow cross-sections requires unnecessarily large part counts. I find Tylo landers a recurring victim of this problem. This and the previous item usually seem to be addressed via TweakScale, Procedural Parts, or a fuel switch mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETiny Probe Core:\u003C/strong\u003E The \u0022Ant\u0022 engine seems intended for propelling very small objects similar to a CubeSat, but there is no probe core appropriate for constructing such a thing. The closest matches are the Probodobodyne OKTO2 and QBE, but both are much larger than the \u0022Ant\u0022 engine. The game seems like it could use either a rescale of the QBE or an even smaller core, no larger than the Not-Rockomax Micronode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy Strut:\u003C/strong\u003E The strut connector is a very useful part but has intentional limits on its maximum length and a specific breaking strength and visible size. It seems as though there were supposed to be other sizes of strut at some point. A smaller strut would only have niche uses, but a thicker, stronger strut able to reach further would be useful in launch towers, large payload assemblies, motherships, etc. This could even have a fancier visual model with a truss; I prototyped one a while back but I haven\u0027t opened it in a while to see if it still works in the game and my modeling skills have never been great.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFalcon Leg:\u003C/strong\u003E The SpaceX Falcon 9 features a very large landing leg, and I often see people replicating it or landing ships of a similar scale and having to make do with much smaller legs or constructing larger legs using DLC parts or ...abominations. The game provides pretty much everything else (see next item) to replicate a Falcon 9 replica and the community is in general very invested in SpaceX\u0027s exploits, making the absence of such a part seem strange.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGrid Fin:\u003C/strong\u003E The one other thing missing from the Falcon 9 is the grid fin used for attitude control on return. Replicas, as in the previous bullet, have had to make do with mod parts or the very small (for this purpose) air brake parts. A larger air brake might fulfill this purpose, but the grid fin\u0027s ability to manage roll in addition to pitch and yaw would remain unaddressed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETiny Rover Wheel:\u003C/strong\u003E The smallest rover wheel remains too large for very small craft such as the Sojourner rover. Kerbals should be able to build something reminiscent of a shopping cart.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETiny Leg:\u003C/strong\u003E The smallest useful landers, i.e. probes or single-Kerbal lander can shuttles, can easily pack into Mk2 cargo bays but have a lot of trouble fitting unless either the legs are clipped (and clipping moving parts seems silly and is very unrealistic) or they use weird substitute legs such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports or antennae (or go without entirely and are forced to land very carefully).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBig Truss:\u003C/strong\u003E The modular girder segment is good for medium-sized truss assemblies, and the octagonal and cubic strut pieces are useful for very small ones, but to replicate something like the ISS is made more difficult for lack of a wide, heavy-duty truss segment. Ideally this would come in both square and octagonal cross sections.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EXXL Solar Panel:\u003C/strong\u003E The Gigantor XL solar panel seems like it was intended for ISS replicas, but next to the other station parts, it\u0027s too small. It remains useful for various probe and satellite replicas with large but not huge panels, but there is no panel large enough to match those on the ISS and replicas have to use mod parts or large sets of Gigantors that only match vaguely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeployable Relay Antennae:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022Standard\u0022 antennae can be toggled on and off, and packed up to stow for launch or re-entry, but the existing relay antenna parts don\u0027t replicate this functionality. The ability to shut off a relay would also have its uses, at least for testing antenna ranges and verifying relay coverage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBig Klaw:\u003C/strong\u003E The addition of a small Advanced Grabbing Unit is very nice, but there should also be a large version useful for actually grappling and moving large asteroids and comets. Surely the developers knew we\u0027d start trying to do comet redirect missions...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETiny Winglet:\u003C/strong\u003E Creating very small aircraft (such as drones) is difficult without having to clip moving winglets (ew). Even the smallest winglet in the game completely dwarfs small components such as the Size 0 nose cone and the small probe cores and fuel tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESize 2 RAPIER:\u003C/strong\u003E The Skylon spaceplane uses large engines that, relative to the crew cabin and other parts, strike me as a better match for Size 2 than Size 1. Add to that the number of very large spaceplanes people build that use arrays of dozens of RAPIERs. Alternately the RAPIER could simply be re-worked to have a single engine bell such that Skylon replicas could use an array of four to recreate the real ship\u0027s four bells.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmall Lab:\u003C/strong\u003E The Mobile Lab is configured as if meant to work alongside various other possible sizes of labs with varying science return ratios, data capacities, and crew capacities. The most salient that seems to be missing is a single-Kerbal lab, perhaps with a Size 1 cross section, though the case could be made for a Mk2 lab as well. A lab that isn\u0027t tall relative to its width would also be conducive to surface bases or mobile lab rovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESize 1 and 3 Multi-Couplers:\u003C/strong\u003E The Size 2 multi-couplers are useful for making engine clusters with engines that don\u0027t allow surface attachment, but no such part is available to attach Size 0 engines to a Size 1 ship or Size 2 engines to a Size 3 ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESingle Crew Cabin:\u003C/strong\u003E There isn\u0027t a compact module to serve the purpose of providing an extra (internal) seat for a Kerbal. The seeming best match is the lander can, but it can\u0027t fit inside a Mk2 cargo bay, and the Mk1 Pod is needlessly heavy for this purpose, not to mention pretty cramped inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShort / Fighter Cockpit, or perhaps Surface-attachable Cockpit:\u003C/strong\u003E The Mk1 Cockpit is nice for \u0022civilian\u0022 aircraft, but many of us (I believe, anyway) miss the old fighter-style cockpit and lack an option to recreate it without a mod, plus the existing cockpit is very long, making compact stowable aircraft difficult. Alternately one or more cockpits could be made that can stick onto the sides of other parts, something I imagine would be popular in place of clipping cockpits into fuel tanks on large rovers, motherships, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETiny MonoPropellant Tank:\u003C/strong\u003E The DLC does provide a small roundified tank, but there is neither a cylindrical counterpart nor an even smaller tank for tiny probes that don\u0027t need a full 20 units and are hampered by the weight of the larger tanks. The command pods provide small amounts, often between 7.5 and 15 units, but there is no stand-alone tank able to do this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurface Hatch:\u003C/strong\u003E Sometimes making a good spaceship happens to involve covering up hatches, or it involves putting a crew cabin at one end of the ship and then wanting to disembark on the other end. People also like to replicate buildings or other structures that have doors and use a Mk1 lander can clipped into a wall as a substitute. More elegant would be a stand-alone airlock part that can be attached to the surface of another part to provide an extra EVA hatch. In the interest of consistent game mechanics, this might require the part to have capacity for one Kerbal and thus it might be better off serving as the single-occupancy cabin mentioned above.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELarge Surface Parachute:\u003C/strong\u003E Surface-mount parachutes are very useful for recovering spent booster stages, but their small size means that often a LOT of them need to be used. There is a large stack-mounted parachute and drogue chute. On this topic, perhaps a small stack-mounted drogue chute would be useful too, but it\u0027s a lower priority due to the already small size and mass of the surface-mounted drogue chute.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDragon / Starship Leg:\u003C/strong\u003E SpaceX\u0027s Crew Dragon and Starship crew stage use linear extending landing legs, but the stock game includes no linear leg of any kind. The DLC provide pistons, but these are only a very rough match for this purpose. Honestly I\u0027d like a rework of all of the landing legs, standardizing them and allowing each to come in at least a linear and hinge variant if not also a linear/hinge mix as we have now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptional:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENuclear reactor:\u003C/strong\u003E Something to provide power far from the Sun, or at night, like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, but which is much more powerful, would be very nice, mainly for long-range ion probes but also on large motherships that go through a lot of energy with their reaction wheels and take forever to recharge via existing methods. This could be very heavy and expensive, and naturally come very late in the tech tree, to preserve game balance. RTGs would remain the system of choice for small craft such as New Horizons or even Cassini-Huygens replicas.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERosetta harpoon:\u003C/strong\u003E The Rosetta mission\u0027s Philae lander didn\u0027t use a klaw but rather a set of harpoons to snag the asteroid and reel itself in. Not only would such a part add fidelity to replica missions, but it might be useful for rescuing Kerbals or assisting in docking unwieldy (or fuel-deprived) objects.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmall/surface cupola:\u003C/strong\u003E The cupola module is very nice, and the weight reduction in newer editions of the game is helpful, but it is quite large and heavy for what it is. On the ISS, cupola modules are relatively small and are attached to the sides of \u0022main\u0022 modules to serve as fancier windows. Since there is, nevertheless, an existing cupola module, this is a low priority.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERound fuel tanks:\u003C/strong\u003E spacecraft, or at least concepts, for example the Daedalus, feature fuel tanks shaped like geodesic spheres. Since interstellar exploration isn\u0027t addressed in the stock game and there are no other parts appropriate to the Daedalus or similar ships, this might not be that essential. Naturally the actual in-game part would be much, much smaller, but I don\u0027t know any small-scale missions that feature these off-hand, even though it seems like a thing they would have. There is a small gold tank, but I\u0027m talking about larger tanks similar in scale to the FL-T, Rockomax, and Kerbodyne series.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVernor cluster:\u003C/strong\u003E MonoPropellant \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports come in linear and block versions, so the lack of a block version for Vernor engines seems weird, but it can be substituted easily enough with groups of Vernor engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERound solar panel:\u003C/strong\u003E Several modern spacecraft concepts feature circular solar panels, so the emphasis in recent years on collaborating with real space agencies to help players replicate their missions suggests this should be a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC-specific:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOrange skin for size 4 tanks:\u003C/strong\u003E fairly self-explanatory.

People also like to replicate buildings or other structures that have doors and use a Mk1 lander can clipped into a wall as a substitute. More elegant would be a stand-alone airlock part that can be attached to the surface of another part to provide an extra EVA hatch.
