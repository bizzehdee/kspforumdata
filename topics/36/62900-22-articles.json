It doesn\u0027t actually do anything with kerbals (except checking if the recovered vessel is a kerbal), it just goes through the part list and adds the parts to the inventory. If you can get me a log of it happening when you get the chance, preferably with as few steps as possible to make it easier to sort through (loading a game, going to the trackingstation and recovering a vessel, then exiting the game).

Have a means of selling outdated parts from your inventory to get some funds back from it ( even at 25-50% rate anything would be nice).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a reasonable suggestion, except there are problems. The issue I can see with getting funds for the parts is that you get funds back from recovery of parts already, so if you, for example, build a 1 part ship for X funds, then recover it from the launchpad then you will get X funds back and the part added to the inventory, where you could then sell the part for y*X funds, meaning you would get y*X funds for free. I could avoid this by making it so once you buy a part for a build, you don\u0027t get funds back until you sell the part (meaning you don\u0027t have to pay for that part in a build, so a reusable craft would be completely free to launch, minus fuel costs). That\u0027s non-trivial to do though, as I would have to take back the funds that KSP gives you for recovery of parts (but not fuel), and also any given by mods such as StageRecovery or DebRefund (and disable KCT\u0027s own funds recovery). I will consider it, because otherwise there\u0027s basically no reason to remove parts from the inventory. The cost listed in the editor would also be wrong, since inventory parts wouldn\u0027t cost anything. Also, the distance to KSC thing (on recovery) would likely be reworked so that you would pay money to recover things that are far from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely doable, but it doesn\u0027t fit in with stock KSP well at all. All the GUIs would be wrong (cost in editor, recovery window). It feels like it\u0027s too much of a change to me :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to think of a way to implement similar behavior without completely redoing how Stock does funds, and that also wouldn\u0027t allow you to get free money, but no promises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to remove parts from the inventory, you can go into the persistence and remove them.
