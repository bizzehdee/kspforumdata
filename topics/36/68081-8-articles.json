I have Burn Together on two rovers on Duna. When the leader first starts moving, the follower follows for a about 15 seconds, then suddenly wants to start driving in reverse, in circles. Sometimes it will follow the lead vehicle from a distance, sometimes backwards, then decides to stop. It does exactly the same thing every time. I thought it might be the fact that the rovers have probes for remote control, which are installed vertically, but I clicked activated \u0022control from here\u0022 on the kerbal and still the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA Followers just doesn\u0027t work at all.

But you have to be careful. The mod does not switch engines on and off. So either all of them have to be running - as in these shots - or only one set of engines - VTOL or main thrusters - can be running. Once I established apoapsis and had enough time to switch back and forth between the ships to turn off the VTOL thrusters and make sure the main engines were still engaged, then set up the mod with the leader/follower tags again, orbital maneuvering would work just fine. But my normal method of getting up past the first atmosphere band, then turning off VTOLs and leaving main engines on and pitching the Eagle up into a more normal rocket-like ascent angle wouldn\u0027t work with two Eagles where I didn\u0027t have the time to switch back and forth like I just described. So I had to leave the VTOLs on. It\u0027s certainly not fuel efficient for getting to orbit, but it did give me some fantastic screenshots! Almost looks like the original effects shots from Space 1999! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T07:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t this mod have action group mimic?
