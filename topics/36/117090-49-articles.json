Deployment altitudes are configurable in flight. The chute safety indicator seems to be working as intended. The engine bell warmed up to a nice red glow when hot, a little less red than most of the engines you have (then again i was in the sunlight), but it was real enough to know it was hot, so tuning it down isn\u0027t really necessary, at least not on my computer. The only real issue is the staging of the parachute. It -says- it\u0027s staged, but it doesn\u0027t show it\u0027s staged on the stage list icons.

I know you were going for a one piece system on this, but couldn\u0027t you put a difference in control, like \u0022control from command module\u0022 and \u0022control from docking port\u0022 to tell the difference? It may of been a silly request, but that\u0027s all I seen. But, as far as the parachutes, they work great and nice coloring on the pod chute. that red/olive drab is awesome!

It will receive its rebalance when the pod is redone (so, possibly this next update; 0.3.25).  With the default settings it is probably burning off ablator too fast to begin with (staying too cool), which results in a much higher temp delta and higher incoming flux, thus continued higher ablator usage for less overall heat dissipation (basically less efficiency)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T01:10:50Z","Content":"Thanks for the x-mas present Mage!!!!
