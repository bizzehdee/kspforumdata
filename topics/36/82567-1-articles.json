I made that crane in the pic using Lack Luster Labs, Infernal Robotics, and Kerbal Attachment System. The turntable was the weakest point on it, so I ended up just posting it for show. The rover base functioned beautifully, although it would drag the rear end while trying to climb hills, so I put hinges on the wheel mounts so I could raise the body, sort of like hydraulic lift, but Kerbal style...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T15:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I built my crane to haul MKS modules (18-23 tonnes each) i had to use 2 booms in a U shaped structure.
