Drop pod placed on top of the rocket made it behave like a rover - flying was almost impossible. I got to about 11 km and separated, after that it was leisure floating down on a parachute. Rovers behaved better, but i\u0027m still fiddling with wheel placement. Too high, and they flip on any bump. Too low, and wheels sink in the ground and refuse to move. More testing is needed.
