All the information necessary to make parts for KSP are covered in good detail by the video tutorials. It takes a few hours to sit through all of them, and yes they can be kinda boring, but everything you need to start is there, emphasis on \u0022start\u0022. There is not really a lack of information, but knowing where to look and what questions to ask; and beyond that, experience that can only be gained after making many many different parts.

It did take me a while to ferret out enough info to get get going, and was eventually Tiberion\u0027s YouTube that sent me on the way. An extended version that covers part tools install, a few more Unity basics and runs through the process in a similar fashion, along with a text version ought to be valuable, I think.

I\u0027ve tried to find tutorials, and easily half of them are .18 or earlier (at least it seemed that way), and at least half the remaining tutorials were targeting Blender as the game engine, and I was unsure how much of the information they provided would even make the .blend-\u0026gt;.mu export, much less be functional in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Unity tutorials were even worse (as far as being presented as tutorials for creating Unity games, vs. using Unity as middle-ware [i.e., not trying to leverage every standard package Unity ships with]). Even if the tutorial was some basic information and a link or two to more in-depth treatments, that would be helpful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr perhaps an \u0022upgrade guide\u0022 or \u0022trail guide\u0022 for the other tutorials, so I know that if I\u0027m watching Unity videos, I can ignore X, Y, and Z, and be aware that T, V and Q need a slightly different treatment when prepping for KSP export, etc., etc. It\u0027s not unique to this community, but there\u0027s often a feeling that \u0022it\u0027s obvious\u0022 what needs to be ignored/translated/reconfigured between older tutorials and the current state of affairs.
