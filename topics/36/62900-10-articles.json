Also, I use Editor Extensions, allowing me to use the Tab key to switch between VAB / SPH mode (radial vs. mirror symmetry, mostly, though it allows me to launch from runway at the VAB and vice versa -- saves me the hassle of moving files around if I want to make a subassembly in the VAB for launch in an SSTO on the runway.)

However, if it fully switches from VAB to SPH and vice versa, then it should (probably) put things in the build list corresponding to the building you are currently in.

You can kind of exploit it with subassemblies (in fact, that is the point), but it takes time to build things (including subassemblies, since you effectively build them as full ships and then scrap them for parts) during which you CAN\u0027T build anything else. So your trade time NOW for reduced times LATER. Just making a bunch of ship files with a bunch of parts has 0 effect and the reduction in times doesn\u0027t come into play until AFTER the construction is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am actually doing this in my game, I have a lab module that I want to send up on a rocket later and had some free build time, so I just built the payload and am going to scrap it when I\u0027m done so that I only have to build the launcher later. It reduces my future build time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ratio isn\u0027t quite 4 builds = 1/2 time. It is exactly that for two identical ships, but when you mix parts it gets weird. The formula is square root of total effective cost of all parts, sqt(effective cost 1 \u002B effective cost 2 \u002B...), where effective cost is EITHER part.cost / (number of times used in a ship, including the current one) or part.cost / 100 for inventory parts. If you use a part multiple times in a single ship, it only counts as one use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weirdness happens when you mix parts, as a brand new part of 1000 cost plus an inventory part of normally 1000 cost has a total effective cost of 1010 = 1000 \u002B 1000/100, then you take the square root. Essentially, inventory parts have negligible effect on the total time. The same holds true for parts that have been used a lot. If all the parts are the same and are from the inventory, then those two 1000 cost parts have an effective cost of 20 = 2000 / 100, meaning the time is sqt(2000)/sqt(100), or 1/10 of the original time (now you see why 4 identical builds is 1/2 the time)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-30T22:42:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2014 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T22:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MartGonzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MartGonzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat idea, would it be possible to add in a downtime requirement for kerbals so that after a mission individual crewmembers can\u0027t be used for a certain amount of time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible?

Oddly, this opens up the possible exploit of using one (for example, the Runway) for making lifters and other vehicles (there is no in-game penalty for launching vertically from launch clamps placed on the runway) whereas the Launchpad can be used to generate assemblies for scrap, payload modules, and the like. Or vice versa, using the Launchpad for launches and the runway for catchup / secondary production work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is my preliminary opinion right now that this is not a \u0022cheat,\u0022 or at least is not a cheat enough to warrant any changes to the mod logic as I understand it. I like the idea of having two \u0022shops\u0022 actively pumping out hardware, as Cape Canaveral had the capacity to send shuttles up within days of each other as emergency contingency plans post-\u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E-disaster, even though any individual shuttle would need about 15-20 months for turnaround. This meant that a minimum of two shuttles could be conditioned concurrently. Given that I intend to launch multi-science platforms to Munar and Minmar orbit once I advance far enough into the tech tree to get docking nodes and other whatnots, being able to stockpile the actual science payloads now for individual landings later is something I\u0027d care to incorporate into my workflow now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does occur to me that I could, conceivably, use my \u0022secondary shop\u0022 to just spam engines, tanks, docking nodes, and other flotsam in non-flyable configurations, just to scrap them. I could do so with a reasonable chance at efficiency by spamming, say, a hundred docking nodes attached in series from the bottom of a Mk-1 pod, just to have them for future orbital construction projects. I could do the same for solar panels, batteries, life support modules for TAC-LS, fuel lines, and other somesuch obvious high-demand parts. Not sure if \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E qualifies as cheating, though. I\u0027ll have to report back with further experience as I spelunk into my new career save.

I think your mod shines in proportion to the number of mods in play, since it emphasizes streamlines priorities. With a greater selection of parts and a greater breadth of mission parameters and considerations beyond stock such as with FAR-related builds or RT2, spamming scrap parts becomes a riskier proposition -- no guarantee that any one part would be needed in high quantities enough to justify delegating it to spam.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MechJeb in-flight delta-V displays do seem to be buggy, however.

I figure if someone really wants to cheatingly avoid build times then they\u0027ve installed the wrong mod (as that is literally the only purpose of this mod) but I do also want to provide a balanced experience. The future updates to the build list mechanics will help this balance, as (the current idea I have) allows you to upgrade the SPH and VAB separately to have faster build times or to build multiple things at once, but you are limited in the total number of upgrades you can perform (so inevitably one building will fall behind or both will have moderate build times). I\u0027m thinking that you\u0027ll get one upgrade every time you unlock a tech node and a single upgrade will either increase the build rate of one building by 5% or increase a second build rate by 10% (with the second rate limited to less than or equal to the primary rate and starting at 0%). You could keep the SPH and VAB at the same rate and split your builds between them, but if you needed to build something fast you\u0027d be out of luck (as your rates would be low for a single build).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, to build up a stockpile of parts takes time that you could have spent building a rocket/plane. And you can recover a lot (or all) of the parts from a rocket (and all of the ones from a plane). It does reduce future builds if you have a huge inventory, but you\u0027d have minimal build times if you use the same reusable launcher and build your payloads in advance and then scrap them. Also, since it\u0027s the number of builds using a part that matters for subsequent builds, not the number of times the part is used in a build, if you build payloads often they will be much faster to build. (So, there is a bit of a cheat here. If you build a payload, then scrap it, then build it, then scrap, build, scrap, ... then the number of subsequent builds will increase but the build time will be fixed at 1/10 of original, then if you use those parts in anything else (when they\u0027re not in the inventory anymore) they will have a high subsequent build counter and will be fast to build from brand new).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, all of the \u0022cheats\u0022 still take time and build slots and micromanagement.

I was merely responded to your prior request for me to report to you on how the two mods interact, and I was simply attempting to describe that they do so flawlessly. Editor Extensions allows VAB / SPH seamless switching, which essentially means that a player can use one or the other (with a single consolidated list of subassembly .craft files as well as finished .craft files) while in no way sacrificing use of both launch points. I\u0027d initially wondered in my previous statements (I was accessing the forum from school and was not at my home computer, which meant that I was asking questions here instead of actually installing the mod and trying it out) if Editor Extensions\u0027s mechanism of switching between build modes within the same editor building (in my case, I prefer the VAB) would in some way negatively affect how your mod intercepts .craft build orders and forces downtime prior to launch. I can say that the two mods work together brilliantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows me to simply double-order without actually having to back out and move to the SPH. I order a build, then I hit the Tab key, then I design my second order if applicable (such as my subassemblies for future use) and send that second one, and it automatically goes to the proper launch point. Or I can double launch the same rocket (for example, for high- and low-altitude flybys of Mun / Minmus) in consecutive launches, thereby halving build time. Without Editor Extensions, I\u0027d be forced to save a .craft file, order the build, back out of the VAB, alt-tab to my Windows desktop, physically copy the .craft file from my VAB to my SPH, alt-tab back into KSP, enter the SPH, and order the build that way. Here, I use the Tab key once to accomplish literally all of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T22:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@MisterFister\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense. Good to know they work well together! I\u0027m not a huge fan of launching rockets from the runway, so hopefully my future plans will deter that notion, but I don\u0027t want to prevent it entirely. In fact, I have a vessel that is a folding plane (the wings fold up to be parallel to the body of the ship) that launches like a typical rocket from the runway but lands like a plane (unfold the wings in space, then glide to a landing). My personal preference is that if it lands on the runway, it\u0027s ok to launch from the runway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But I won\u0027t be enforcing my personal preferences that strongly on anyone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (though it is inevitable that some of them will, since I develop this myself and implement things generally how I want them, with consideration of the users\u0027 opinions of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed I tend to talk a lot when a simple \u0022Sounds good!
