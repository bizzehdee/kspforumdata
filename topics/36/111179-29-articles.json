I won\u0027t really be stopping you unless it interferes with some of the stuff already in place (For example, textures and positions of planets/moons don\u0027t really need modification).\n\nThere is a need for corona textures for the exoplanet portion of the mod, but I currently don\u0027t have that installed (again, star bugs).\n\nI will try to update the pack so that the bugs I\u0027ve fixed won\u0027t register for you.
