An example craft (or two in the case of docking) using only stock\u002BSSTU parts, and a list of the exact steps needed to trigger the problem with those craft.  (if the craft are simple enough that screenshots will suffice, those will do as well; either way I still need to know the exact steps that trigger the problem)  \n\nWithout that information the best I can do is guess... and I would -guess- there is some other mod interfering with things... but cannot know for certain without being able to duplicate the problem.\n\nAlso note if you are using HyperEdit for testing of docking port related functionality -- STOP NOW.  HyperEdit causes all sorts of docking related problems.\n\nEdit: No, the parachutes nor rename function will have any impact on docking.  They are handled through separate modules with zero cross-module interaction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-29T18:46:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2016 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T22:07:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried investigating this yesterday and could not duplicate the problems you are having; the docking ports worked fine regardless of what port was used, where it was placed, or how it was attached.\n\u003E \n\nSorry for the work then.  I had hoped that someone else was having problems, hence posting.   I am downloading the latest update and have cleaned out MOST of the mods I have in my build.\n\nI WAS using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E for the first time ever with this iteration of the game.   I found a bunch of crap that was never deleted by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E out of my GameData folder.   It is all gone.  I went down from 57 mods to 9 not counting SSTU.  I will post after further testing.   If it is any of these mods it should show up quickly in sandbox."}]}
