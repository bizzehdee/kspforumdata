This was a big source of issues, low depth-precision, no anti-aliasing support, depth artifacts etc\u2026 Let me just jog your memory with this one image:\n\n![lbYmqLu.png](https://i.imgur.com/lbYmqLu.png)\n\nA few versions back I switched to using a \u201Cprojector\u201D and got rid of the depth buffer. It\u2019s essentially just a way to re-render all opaque objects in the scene with a different shader, in this case, the scattering shader. This fixes aliasing and depth related issues, but it is wasteful of CPU and GPU power (re-rendering opaque objects is expensive, this was one of the things I fixed in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux that boost performance) and couldn\u2019t handle special cases, like terrain scatters/trees and Parallax displaced terrain causing them to not have scattering on them or only partly:\n\n![khEYeUG.png](https://i.imgur.com/khEYeUG.png)  \n  \n![gCfY7h8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gCfY7h8.jpg)\n\nWhile trying to fix these issues, I decided to re-visit the depth buffer approach as it doesn\u0027t have those issues and could help improve performance.\n\nFirst attempt using the depth buffer came out as broken as expected:  \n  \n![iqERR40.png](https://i.imgur.com/iqERR40.png)\n\nI won\u2019t get too deep into the technical details but there is two main methods to reconstruct the world position from the depth buffer and both have issues with large distances.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen this issue in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux:  \n![NLmFigA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NLmFigA.jpg)\n\nThis is the same issue. I work around it in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux by fading out shadows in the distance, but this can\u2019t really be done here.  \n\nAt first I thought it must be the depth buffer precision that just sucks, as it always has. But how could this be? Unity switched to reverse-Z buffer recently which is renowned for good precision, and used in pretty much every large open-world or planetary rendering engine.  \n\nI decided to take a closer look at the depth buffer, and it looked completely fine, precision looked good, so the position reconstruction methods must be flawed somehow. Initially I came up with two over-engineered reconstruction methods, one involving an iterative search, and the other involving emulated double precision in the lossy operations. One of these worked very well (I\u2019ll let you guess which one). However I later thought of just combining the two original methods from above, simply using one to get the direction and the second for the distance. This ended up working perfectly and being very simple and cheap.  \n\nSo now we have precise positions reconstructed from depth, this means that the main scattering shader will get much cheaper, and won\u2019t have to re-render god knows how many objects, reducing both CPU and GPU usage. Added bonus is it now works with Parallax and the terrain scatters so they get correct scattering as long as they write correctly to depth:\n\n![hTna0rT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hTna0rT.jpg)\n\n![58mXdIy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/58mXdIy.jpg)\n\nIt also gets rid of these z-fighting artifacts which sometimes appear in the distance with the current method:\n\n![Hq5W8IV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Hq5W8IV.jpg)  \n\nTested it with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rescale and it seems to hold up as well.  \n\nFor long-distance shadows also there is the partial depth buffer which I was rendering to cover the areas where depth reconstruction precision of the old method degraded for shadows, though in practice that was relatively fast, we can get rid of it now as well. This method can also be used in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux as well so cloud shadows can cover the whole scene and not just ~5 km around the camera.  \n\nAnother advantage is that we can now use the same method as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux\u2019s volumetrics: Render the scattering effect at \u00BC the screen resolution for performance.\n\nOn the left is is how it is really rendered at low resolution, on the right is the final result after doing depth-aware upsampling and compositing with the rest of the effects:\n\n![YfrjXJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/YfrjXJO.png)\n\nThis approach (1/4 resolution scattering) is however incompatible with godrays (at least for now), so it will auto-disable when using godrays, I\u2019d also argue that if you can afford godrays you probably won\u2019t need this.\n\nNow there remains the issue that the depth buffer can\u2019t be anti-aliased, while the main scene does, resulting in these lines around the scattering effect if AA is used:  \n![aTuPnlf.png](https://i.imgur.com/aTuPnlf.png)\n\nUnity doesn\u2019t expose a multi-sampled depth buffer, and while I managed to find a way to force it to render to one, and to resolve it manually in my shader, this pretty much broke other mods that use depth effects or image effects. The only other solution available was to disable hardware MSAA and use a post-processing AA. If you care about MSAA though don\u2019t worry, depth-buffer mode can be disabled and you can keep the old MSAA-friendly mode, though that means giving up on the performance and compatibility improvements.  \n\nSo, my first choice was to go with temporal Anti-aliasing. TAA is pretty good these days, in some cases better than MSAA because it offers temporal stability which MSAA does not. I got it working pretty well and was happy with how it looked, however due to a bug in unity when setting custom projection matrices (which TAA needs for slightly offsetting temporal samples) with a high far/near ratio such as in KSP, shadows flicker from some angles:\n\n![ShockingGreedyDarwinsfox-size_restricted](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ShockingGreedyDarwinsfox-size_restricted.gif)\n\nSo that makes TAA not really usable, until Unity fixes this at least, though I will keep the option available for those who want to try it anyway.  \n\nMy second choice was Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing (SMAA). It is quite good and has different quality levels, in some regards it is better than TAA, and in every regard better than FXAA as it never blurs over details or textures. Overall I feel it looks very similar to 2x MSAA, which is mostly sufficient if you play at high resolution.  \n\nHere are two screens, one using the new method with SMAA, and one using the old method with 2xMSAA, can you tell which is which?\n\n![yodloiE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yodloiE.jpg)\n\n![VYak2Mu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VYak2Mu.jpg)  \n\nThe second one is SMAA, and in this particular instance the SMAA image looks cleaner:\n\n![NYPhgnK.png](https://i.imgur.com/NYPhgnK.png)\n\nMay be it would be better compared with 4xMSAA, though it varies a bit in motion.  \n\nAn added bonus is that it also fixes the aliasing that the volumetrics of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux introduce around crafts (if you\u2019ve ever noticed that).\n\nSo now we can put it all together and see how it runs.\n\nLet\u2019s test something really low-end, here we have a weakly i3-3217U @1.8 Ghz and and its integrated HD graphics 4000, this is an old laptop, and it struggles just loading up KSP. Though it has a gt 740m (which is a bit faster but still slow) I\u0027m going to test it on the integrated graphics.  \n\nTesting with just the scattering shader \u002B sunlight extinction (which isn\u2019t expensive), everything else disabled. Stock terrain at low. Running at 720p with no AA (because let\u2019s be honest here we can\u2019t afford much with integrated), running with these settings (hard shadows and all):\n\n![JEsMy46.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JEsMy46.jpg)  \n\nStock gets ~30 fps with these settings, so we\u2019re off to a bad start.\n\n![dUXY6W5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dUXY6W5.jpg)\n\nPrevious release of scatterer gets 23 fps\n\n![6xVvvbM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6xVvvbM.jpg)\n\nNew version gets ~24 fps (though I forgot SMAA enabled here but it barely removes 0.5-1 fps)\n\n![VrsgpGt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VrsgpGt.jpg)\n\nThat\u0027s barely an improvement over last version. However now we can enable 1/4 res scattering and get 27 fps, that\u0027s already much closer to stock\u0027s 30 fps, and a 17% improvement over last version.\n\n![ZIsCeXX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZIsCeXX.jpg)\n\nSo there you have it, much closer performance to stock on the low-end settings.\n\nAlright now something faster\n\nOn a GTX 1080 at 1440p and everything enabled, we go from 85 fps to 108 fps on the ocean surface with no AA, a 27% improvement\n\n![s26GBEy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s26GBEy.jpg)\n\n84 fps to 102 fps when zoomed out, a 21% improvement\n\n![R8CvSBe.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/R8CvSBe.jpg)\n\nAnd although it\u2019s not a completely fair comparison, let\u2019s look at 2x MSAA on the old version, and SMAA on the new one: 75 fps to 106 fps, a 41% improvement. MSAA is expensive ![:o](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png \u0022:o\u0022)\n\n![n72VKi0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/n72VKi0.jpg)\n\nOh and also, I tested with OpenGL on my main PC and it went from 35 fps to 64 fps (makes sense since this frees up some CPU overhead as well and OpenGL KSP is running on a single core for some reason), but I didn\u0027t take screens so the two guys playing on OpenGL will just have to try it for themselves :p\n\nNow with all these new settings, it can become complicated to pick and tune your settings, so I\u2019ve added the ability to load quality presets from config files:  \n![9UJ8Tlk.png](https://i.imgur.com/9UJ8Tlk.png)  \n\nI defined a few logical presets, each one tries to aim for the best quality/performance ratio, in increasing quality. The mod will default to \u201CLow\u201D from now on, which is just the ocean (with transparency and foam), the scattering at 1/4 res, and the non-expensive effects. Feel free to pick the preset that suits you best from the UI, you can go lower or higher, and a restart is no longer needed when changing some settings like ocean or terrain shadows. A few effects like long-distance shadows might be completely fine with stock but scale badly with with other mods, so keep that in mind.\n\nThank you for everyone who read this wall of text, I still have a few things to fix/test but I will be posting a build on Patreon soon, and making a public release as soon as this is all polished and ready ![:)](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, klancy1o said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E how i can make my own config? for atmosphere\n\u003E \n\nCheck the links in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I had the exact same card (in fact I still have it, but a friend lent me his old 1080 which I\u0027m using for now) and it ran much better. What resolution are you running? Can you test scatterer alone with no other mods?\n\u003E \n\nHello im here with numbers for you that i tested. \n\nSpace center: 35fps with Scatterer and 55fos WO\n\nLaunch pad: 25fps with 40fps wo\n\nLaunch same craft: 26fps with and 32fps wo\n\nHigh altitude/in clouds: 26fps with 34fps wo\n\nMap screen: 33fps with and 47fps wo\n\nSo now i have tested Scatterer in my main game with all the other mods that i mention before (i forgot you told me to test only Scatterer).
