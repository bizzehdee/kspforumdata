Only to loose connection to KSC and have all your valuable science dumped into the ocean? \n\nThis mod is a small add-on for RemoteTech that attempts to deploy the chute automatically, in the event that a connection to KSC is lost. \n\nHow to use\n\nJust drop the \u0027RTEmergencyChute\u0027 directory into your GameData directory.\n\nOnce installed, continue to launch your craft as usual. Stock parachutes are all supported including drogues.\n\nIn the event a probe is disconnected, then the mod will attempt to automatically deploy parachutes attached to a craft once it is safe.\n\nRequired Dependencies\n\n- ModuleManager\n- RemoteTech\n\nLinks\n\n[Download](https://github.com/rickyhewitt/RTEmergencyChute/releases)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/rickyhewitt/RTEmergencyChute)\n\nOther notes\n\nI haven\u0027t tested this mod with RealChutes yet, so I have no idea how compatible it will be.\n\nIf you notice a bug (of which I am sure there are many!), or wish to provide constructive criticism then feel free to do so! My knowledge of C# is not that great -- so I\u0027m sure the code could do with improving!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T11:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rickyhewitt**\n  \ndevelopment ended"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCMOKOT","CreatedById":146129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T20:00:07Z","Content":"thx god , and thx u good man"}]}
