I told you way way way back in the beginning that people were going to have polarizing opinions about the direction this thread goes. I wish I could find it but I did say it.

CHEECH I am beginning to think that you are Dragon under a new account! You are doing exactly what pushed raidernick off this project and ultimately and eventually off the forums. Here is what I humbly recommend Mike. Put up a stable release with the caveat that its highly a WIP. Then find 5-10 people who you trust and who give good feed back. Send them your builds as they come and they will test the hell out of each one. When you feel a public release is ready then you release it to the whole forum. I am not saying I told you so but when you first started I said that you were going to burn yourself out. Just relax take a few days off, don\u0027t come on these forums. Mod for yourself or make something for KSP. Make the shuttle that you want, fly it around, build a space station, paint it pink and purple. I don\u0027t care but try and find what made the forums, modding, and ksp, fun for you in the first place. If you can\u0027t, then I am sorry you will end up remembered and yearned for with some the great ksp modders of the past. But if you find what made it fun in the first place I think you will come back rejuvenated and better prepared for the best and worst this community has to offer. I hope that you find it because what you have done has the most potential I have seen thus far, and i have been here a while. I think I am gonna start calling this thread the Jumanji thread. Its been around forever through many iterations of KSP but its constantly being poisoned, broken, lost, found, shot at, stampeded and transformed into something else.

The situation with this mod is not near as bad as you guys may think.\n\nAnd in fact, I think going forward (presuming the mod hasn\u0027t died completely again) management discussion should be behind closed doors. IE, PM each other you fools! It appears to me that things here are getting too muddled up over whose working on what, how to coordinate changes and releases, etc etc and its mixing in with us testers, who in reality should only be providing constructive feedback on whats being introduced. Testers, while its nice to have a working version of the mod, our job isn\u0027t to just get in on the early releases. As much as I want to be playing with the mod, I only load it up when I\u0027m specifically testing it. None of us have a right to be upset because one iteration of the mod is broken compared to the last. Constructive feedback is telling the dev\u0027s that the new aero isn\u0027t working properly just as much as it is telling them HOW it isn\u0027t working properly. It is also constructive to discuss the purpose of the new aero, which Mike has already touched on is an effort to support less parts for the Orbiter with the eventual point of a one part orbiter.\n\nDeconstructive feedback is telling the dev\u0027s you\u0027re not going to test the mod anymore because you can\u0027t play with it with the current iteration. Its also deconstructive to insert yourselves into the management of the mod, but considering the situation I don\u0027t think any of us can or could have helped that (I fully admit that I may have been responsible for starting this mess with my over-eagerness to test the new version). What\u0027s being developed here is my opinion fairly unprecedented. What\u0027s available right now and what could come in the future if you guys stay on track is lightyears ahead of what this mod originally was.\n\nBut back to Mike and Jeast, as I said earlier, you guys need to talk to each other. I suggest getting together before working on anything else and just hammering out the issues. Get coordinated, and get a road map set up. Releases should be a coordinated effort between the two of you. Any release beyond a coordinated one shouldn\u0027t be considered a release, be it unofficial or otherwise. 1.7 is in essence WIP of a release rather than a release outright. As far as I\u0027m concerned, and as several us have pointed out, 1.6 is the last release that should be considered ready for gameplay use. 1.7 is pure tester fodder, and nothing else.\n\nAnother thing to consider is to split development, with each of your guys\u0027 contributions not affecting the other\u0027s. Anything that will overlap should be worked on together. So, as far as this aero mess goes, finish it. There\u0027s no reason to revert to the old one going forward, as consolidated Orbiter parts are in fact something that would be useful to have for the eventual Official release. Having the orbiter be less split up will keep FPS up, will behave more realistically, and most importantly will look much better. If there\u0027s one thing about this mod that\u0027s persisted since the very beginning, its those seams on the orbiter\u0027s belly. You guys should get together and hammer out the aero under the new system. From there, any larger overhauls of any part of the mod should be a coordinated effort.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T23:17:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0027th**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:26:27Z","Content":"I will not further butt in into your oeganisation, i guess we all had our big time.
