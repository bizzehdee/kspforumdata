All I\u0027m saying is that they\u0027re fairly insubstantial, and something with more meat would go well with this piece. There\u0027s a few ways to do it, I\u0027d recommend making your own ring part; but you could also straight replace the model of the ISM part, which would replace it for existing ships too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Percebob","CreatedById":65578,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T00:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is really great, not only does it change from the traditional capsule shaped CM but it also looks really neat and functional at the same time.
