I Would love to get more feedback on the name of the engines you like or dislike the sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparatron sound still doesnt have a custum engage/disengage/flameout sound finished, probably thats why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem i have with this release is tha game pitching the sounds and basically messing up the streght of the original sample. Take for example the SRB they sound over pitched ingame but the real sound has more rumble in the bass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm working on releasing the mod with Module Manager to centralize the installation and control the pitch to more of my liking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost rocket flameouts were inspired by the sounds of the SRB detaching from the Space Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll check the shutdown sounds and see how to fix it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMan the turbojet engine is one of my favorite sounds too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E i just need to fix the startup for it so that it has a smoother transition from off to on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E keep bringing the feedback im taking note for making the fixes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am glad you are liking the mod and enjoying it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe startup sounds simulate the gasy sound in the start of a engine ( videos from space launches inspired these) well they might be a bit longer that can be fixed or released 2 versions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E more choices the better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boberts314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boberts314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBeyond the need for modmanager (for the sake of compatability and easy removal) the only feedback I have so far is that it seems like the startup and shutdown sounds are exceptionally long for some of the engines. I\u0027m thinking of the separatrons specifically here. The shutdown noise they make lasts longer than their fuel supply did and it makes a horrible racket.\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had time lately to do anything but add a turbojet to a tank and launch it into the stratosphere, unfortunately. Love the turbojet sound, more feedback later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
