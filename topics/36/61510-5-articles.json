I recall a wry comment to the effect that players don\u0027t care about \u0022you\u0027re cold and uncomfortable,\u0022 but start knocking off hit points and suddenly they\u0027ll do anything for a parka.

Of course, if your mod did have a \u0022fitness\u0022 rating for each Kerbal, then other modders could use that any way they wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Right, I gathered that - just wondering if the nomenclature might be confusing. \u0022What do you mean you can\u0027t Exercise in microgravity?
