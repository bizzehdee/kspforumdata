Especially when you are using different part mods (think of Nova Punch or KW Rocketry). When those things add a tonn of engines and fuel tanks and other stuff the task of finding something you need can be simply daunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, in some way this can be solved by the Part Filter mod I was pointed to in the Steam forums. But then again, it only works if you know what to look for, which is not tha case for me, and maybe a lot of other new palyers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured out the way the game sorts parts and then sat down and threw together a little mod, for personal use mostly, but maybe it will be usefull to anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring you - \u0022The Part Sorter\u0022. Rofl. I need to think of a cool name, but seriously though. It\u0027s just a small program I build using AutoIT. What it does is, it parses all the parts that you have installed in your parts folder. Saves their initial information and then renames the folders and part names in the part.cfg files. The process is fast and totally reversible. This is how it looks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P5OfZFN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P5OfZFN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch the program, press [Create INI]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0BMEYkF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220BMEYkF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a very short while (well, depending on how many parts you have installed) it will create an INI file with all settings saved and new names generated for all installed parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can take from as little as 1-2 seconds if you have only the stock parts, to as much as 10-15 seconds when I tested it with over 500 parts inside the game folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you just press the [sort] button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it looks before and after:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/THTRIlu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022THTRIlu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hyybhm3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hyybhm3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the parts are a lot more readable now. This also helps a lot, if you want to remove some part that you don\u0027t want, but cannot bother to search through all the folders for it if you don\u0027t know exactly where it is at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now just use the in-game part name to search for its folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this isn\u0027t all. The names you get after sorting aren\u0027t just for the lulz. My script analyzes parts for what they are and generates specific names for specific parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, on the left you can see the stock Mark1Cockpit, Mk1-2Pod, mk2LanderCabin and probeCoreOcto. If you look on the right, you will see that they are now called Pods_Cockpit_Mk1, Pods_Pod_mk1-2, Pods_Lander_Mk2 and Pods_Probe_OKTO respectively. So it also differs parts in the same category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I have more or less finished this functionality for the Pods and Propulsion categories. In propulsion it sorts ALL engines by fuel-type and then thrust, and fuel tanks by fuel-type and tank capacity. I tested this with Nova Punch and KW Roketry mods - all stuff is sorted correctly, and that is over 200 new parts in the game, easy to access and intuitive to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when you want to add new mods, just press the [Restore] button, and everything is back to the way it was. You can now add new parts, create a new INI and sort them all again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QiNBzhE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QiNBzhE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be very gratefull if someone could try this out and comment on it. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s usefull not only for me. I will be working on finetuning the Propulsion category and adding other part categories too. I might even make t able to sort parts by diameter, just need to figure some things out first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, give it a go and let me know if you like it. It works good in tandem with the Part Filter too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/yLK2z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropBOX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/19-1-part-sorter-v0-1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpacePort\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-21T18:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2013 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Atanvaryar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated download link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atanvaryar","CreatedById":57488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T11:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAaaand good day people! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got 52 views on this topic and still no comments.

Specifically, the part of code that renames the folders is actually moving the folders to the same location but with a new name. Could you possibly test it out and narrow down the extra parts? They could be something with special symbols in the folder or part name. I can give you a version of my sorter with some extra debug calls which can help you narrow down the issue, if you are willing to lend me a hand here too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T17:34:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Atanvaryar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hocki","CreatedById":33039,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T17:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running .19.5 on Windows 8.
