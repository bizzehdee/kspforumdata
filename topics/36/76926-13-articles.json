Anyway, this aiming point is depicting where your bullets will strike if the gun is fired. Obviously the gun has to be pointed at an object for this to have any meaning, if you\u0027re pointed at the sky, the reticle would just show the boresight axis of the barrel, or not show at all, up to you. That\u0027s mode 1. Mode 2 is for when one has a target selected. You still have your aim point, where the bullets will strike, but now there\u0027s an additional targeting reticle, showing where you need to place your aiming point in order to strike the target. For the GAU-8, all you need to do is maneuver your plane so that the aim point coincides with the target point, and let \u0027er rip! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Which of course isn\u0027t nearly as easy as it sounds, lol. However, this would also work for the Vulcan 20mm gun and the M1A1 turret, too. The only difference is that you\u0027re aiming with your mouse cursor instead of steering your entire vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, if such an aiming system as described above could be implemented with this mod, it would be just really awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Again, don\u0027t know if it can be done easily or at all, I\u0027m just putting the idea out there for BahamutoD to ponder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I still look forward to the ongoing development of this most excellent mod.
