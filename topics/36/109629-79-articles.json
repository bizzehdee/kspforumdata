How are you attaching it to the shuttle?\n\nI actually figured it out. It was because I was attaching it to the FSS base to have it rotate up. Now, having it attached to the CSS Crew Compartment, it works without clipping. I only wish the Canadarm actually worked right so I could maneuver the module out of the cargo bay without RCS."},{"CreatedByName":"LMRaptor","CreatedById":147731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T00:39:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any requests for any of these vehicles wanted in KSP:\n\u003E [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:NASA_vehicles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:NASA_vehicles)\n\u003E \n\u003E Worth a look anyway.

Now, they are still used and NASA uses them to fairy astronauts to and from Cape Canaveral (Well, used to when we still flew from Cape with people and hopefully will again with the Commercial Crew Service). In response to Felbourn tackling that problem, that\u0027d be awesome. It is a cfg issue, not a model issue. The models look great and work great, used to at least.
