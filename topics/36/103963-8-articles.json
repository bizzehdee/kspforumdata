I boot up KSP, limit framerate to 5 fps and... it still runs behind by one single frame, so no matter where I put it, it still gets called before it\u0027s parameters are updated.\n\u003E \n\u003E I tried making a specific lateUpdate() function that would only have the drawmesh() call in it, I tried using a classic meshrenderer, I tried using drawMeshNow() in a script attached to the camera but nothing helps. If anyone have any ideas I\u0027d really appreciate it.\n\nRead up on the different update passes here: [http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html)\n\nSpecifically OnPreRender and OnRenderImage (this last one is mentioned specifically for post processing but you may also want to look to moving some code to OnPreRender.

I have to mention though, the postprocessing runs fine (I did set it up with a camera\u0027s script using OnRenderImage since it\u0027s the only way it\u0027d work). It\u0027s the sky that lags behind, I will try setting up the sky so that it runs this way, but, should the shader parameters be also updated inside OnRenderImage? I\u0027m guessing they should.\n\nEdited: Wow, such a simple fix, and it worked so well.
