View full album](//imgur.com/a/E8s5g)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks promising!\n\u003E My main concern is with how you\u0027re handling internal collisions. Your present approach would definitely work for most stock parts, but some mod crew cabins (such as FusTek):\n\u003E \n\u003E  - are made up of multiple intersecting colliders, which are needed for concave areas\n\u003E \n\u003E  - the internal may be shaped very differently from the exterior colliders (e.g. FusTek modules are round on the outside, but rectangular on the inside with chamfered edges plus some oddly-shaped circular segments for breakout areas)\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to suggest some sort of override feature, where mod authors can specify their own custom internal colliders for their pods.\n\nIt\u0027s very difficult to find a solution that covers every use case, so I\u0027ll be making things configurable as often as possible for IVA designers to tweak.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In terms of collision, you could just brute force it and add a mesh collider the the internal model. This is far from ideal, but It would work with most, if not all internals.\n\nThat\u0027ll be an option to keep in reserve if the current one fails, or to use for more complicated IVAs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T14:19:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead**"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T17:40:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Progress for this mod will be quite slow due to free time constraints and its experimental nature.
