I agree with you that if it it\u0027s self contained (and it is) then there should be no reason why it would interfere, but I haven\u0027t (and can\u0027t) test the interaction between WarpShip and every other mod so I am not 100% sure. If it installs and runs just fine, though, that seems like a good enough reason to change what it says on CKAN.

Assuming its approved, KSIE and WarpShip will be able to be installed together. If you ever need any of that stuff with CKAN, let me know, I\u0027ve learned a ton about their engine and file grammar, and I am happy to take that stuff off your plate so you can concentrate on making an awesome mod instead of the \u0022paperwork\u0022 for distribution.
