I\\\u0027ve tried saving an alpha channel, but it does not seem to work. I can see the chutes have transparency, so wondering if I can get it in other parts too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the wiki says it cannot be partial transparency anyhow, so I\\\u0027ll skip for now.

Just set your alphaCutoff parameter at a value. For transparent texture, you put your alpha channel above the relative value (alphaCutoff goes from 0 to 1, and if I recall the alpha channel from 0 to 255. So with alphaCutOff at 0.5, an alpha value of 126 would be transparent, but not a 129.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-31T21:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, that\\\u0027s totally over my head.
