As long as the mods include a price for their parts there isn\u0027t an issue (and any parts with zero cost just don\u0027t have an effect on the build time). As far as I can tell, most mods have somewhat reasonable costs for their parts compared to stock, so build times should be reasonable. Mods that don\u0027t add parts shouldn\u0027t have any effect on this and this shouldn\u0027t have an effect on them, after the build list is complete at least (see above for issues with Interstellar, also some life support mods may have issue). There may be times when incompatibilities arise, however, as there is with any mod. Kerbal Alarm Clock is one mod that I wish to maintain compatibility with, and perhaps include functionality for (adding timers for currently constructing vessels automatically), along with the toolbar plugin in future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somewhere Simulated","CreatedById":88550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T06:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove this mod and the addition of adding time to VAB and SH.

The biggest change: The build list! It\u0027s still super beta, and if there were a release that would break everything it would be this one. If you\u0027re going to try it with an existing save, I\u0027d suggest letting any building ships finish and then making a backup. It seems to be working fine with new saves though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use the build list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the editor of your choice (VAB or SPH), start building a new craft. Click the Launch! button, then Add to Build List. The window will close, and you\u0027re done. It\u0027s in the list now. Go back to the Space Center and click the KCT button, the GUI will pop up with the next craft to finish being listed (name, location, time left, and a time jump button). Press the VAB List or SPH List button, you should see your craft there with a percentage, a time left, and two buttons. TOP puts that ship at the top of the list (only the top one progresses) and X cancels construction of the ship. When the ship is finished, it goes into the respective Storage. Open that, then press Launch to launch the ship or Scrap to scrap it for parts. That\u0027s basically it. I added a few pictures at the end of the embeded album on the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime Jump: Time Jump is available in the Space Center scene only. It requires that all vessels be either landed or in circular orbits (to prevent SOI changes, which break things). Circular is defined as the periapsis being within 10% of the apoapsis (so a 250km apoapsis must have a periapsis of 225km or higher). Unfortunately, I can only get SOI change predictions for the active vessel, and not all vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime Warp: Available in the flight mode version of the build list GUI. This warps just like the old versions, and is safer. Plant a flag at KSC and use it to warp. You can\u0027t warp in the space center scene, otherwise I would have implemented that instead of time jump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: Why does my ship have messed up crew assignments? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: I had to take the default crew assignments, which means that we\u0027re back to pre-0.21 times.

In a new game (what I test with) there is no way that would get called before flight. In a saved game it can get called before flight, which KSP then flips it\u0027s *** about and has all sorts of weird (seemingly unrelated to the actual cause) bugs. KSP has the weirdest crashes...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T16:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you tried setting FlightDriver.CanRevertToPostInit and FlightDriver.CanRevertToPrelaunch to false after loading?

MCE bypasses the whole Data Points and just gives you a direct Supplement to your science points in the persistent file.
