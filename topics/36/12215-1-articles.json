I\\\u0027ve scoured the wiki and searched the forum, so if I\\\u0027ve missed something, it\\\u0027s totally my fault and you should make fun of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short version is that I\\\u0027m looking for some insight into how the breakingForce parameter works, so I can tune my custom parts so they handle reasonable amounts of force but will break under excessive acceleration. Like for instance, I want a payload decoupler that can support say ten tons (mass = 10.0) at up to 3g, but will break at higher accelerations than that. This seems like a job for breakingForce, but I haven\\\u0027t been able to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve done test after test, and I\\\u0027m stumped. There doesn\\\u0027t seem to be any consistent relationship, that I can see, between a part\\\u0027s breakingForce, how much mass is on top of that part, and how much that part (and the stacked mass) can be accelerated before the part breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a while, after doing some empirical experiments, I was thinking there was a straight scaling factor involved: a breakingForce of 1.0 meant the part would break when 50 kiloNewtons of force were applied to it (or whatever; I\\\u0027m calling a mass of 1.0 accelerated at 1 length unit per in-game second a \u0027kiloNewton\u0027). I crunched the numbers and figured that a part with a breakingForce of 1.0 with 1 ton (i.e., mass = 1.0) stacked on it would fail at 5.098 g\\\u0027s of acceleration. I built a test rocket with that part, and sure enough, it failed at what the game reported was a max acceleration of 5.1 g\\\u0027s. Sweet! Putting an extra 100 kg on top meant \u00E2\u20AC\u201D according to my spreadsheet \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthat the part should fail at 4.635 g\\\u0027s, and the game said it failed at a max acceleration of 4.7 g\\\u0027s. Awesome! Then I put another 100 kg on top (total of 1.2 mass units), which my spreadsheet predicted would cause it to fail at 4.249 g\\\u0027s \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6and the game reported that it failed at 4.3 g\\\u0027s! Everything\\\u0027s coming up Milhouse!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I put another 100 kg on top, for a total of 1.3 mass units, and prepared myself to see it fail at around 3.922 g\\\u0027s \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6and the sucker blew up on the launch pad for no reason I could figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\\\u0027s the deal? Does anybody know how to relate the breakingForce parameter to the mass parameter and to acceleration so I can make my parts fail in a way that\\\u0027s, if not realistic, at least consistent from part to part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"requimrar","CreatedById":8069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-07T08:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know the specifics, but do you notice some lag when you launch the craft?

I\\\u0027ve done more science this morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a test rig, mostly out of trusses. It looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FWrbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FWrbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule is connected to the part above it by a small coupler which you can probably barely see. That coupler is my test part. I varied its breakingForce parameter and subjected the rig to acceleration (courtesy of the modded stock engines; each one puts out 1,750 kN of thrust). When the part breaks, the capsule will immediately stop accelerating, meaning I can then end the flight and see what the maximum acceleration was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I crunched the data I collected, I discovered two things. First, there appears to be a straight scaling factor between breakingForce and kiloNewtons: 50. A part with a breakingForce of 1.0 will fail when it\\\u0027s subjected to 50 kiloNewtons of force. What I mean by \u0027kiloNewton\u0027 here is the force that results from accelerating one mass unit by one length unit per second per second. We\\\u0027re calling length units meters; that\\\u0027s all but canonical as near as I can tell. And if the mass unit is the kilogram, then the stock parts that ship with the game are about 30% less dense than \u003Cem\u003Eair!\u003C/em\u003E But if we equate the mass unit to the metric ton, then the densities of stock parts make a kind of sense (modulo a factor of two), so that makes the force unit the kiloNewton \u00E2\u20AC\u201Done metric ton accelerated at one meter per second per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I put in that fudge-factor of 50:1 kiloNewtons to \u0027breakingForce units\u0027, I started seeing margins of error between the predicted and reported failure g-loads on the order of 0.4% \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6then I realized the game is probably just \u003Cem\u003Erounding off\u003C/em\u003E the max g-load to one decimal place, and when I took that into account my margins of error all but vanished. (I\\\u0027ve got one anomalous result here, where the predicted failure was 4.2 g\\\u0027s but the game reported failure at 4.3 g\\\u0027s.

In my test rig, a coupler that should have held the capsule up under 2.788 g\\\u0027s of acceleration failed as soon as I moved it to the pad, while a coupler that should\\\u0027ve held the capsule up under 2.815 g\\\u0027s of acceleration made it \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dand consequently failed just after liftoff when I pushed the rig through what the game reported was 2.8 g\\\u0027s of acceleration.

But for now at least, my guideline is to build parts that are always able to support the mass they need to support at a \u003Cem\u003Eminimum\u003C/em\u003E of 3 g\\\u0027s of acceleration. Unless I miss my guess, that ought to result in parts that make it off the pad okay, then fail \u0027realistically\u0027 (kind of) in flight. If you push the throttle to the stops during your transfer-orbit injection burn and push your vehicle to 6 or 8 or 10 g\\\u0027s, your expensive satellite payload is gonna drop right off. At least, that\\\u0027s the hope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
