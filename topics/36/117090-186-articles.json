I think it would be nice to have them as a stand alone or mesh switch, is it possible to have this without causing too much trouble for you?\n\u003E \n\nHmm... I could possibly make them as secondary variants for the MCB-A (as the bays just use the fuel-tank module behind the scenes, they also support the tank-variant setup).  The models don\u0027t actually exist by themselves; so I\u0027ll have to setup the models for them, model definitions, texture sets, and add them to the MCB-A part.  However they won\u0027t be any longer than the existing ones;  so will be 20m x 5m, 10x2.5, 5x1.25 etc... same as the existing bays (longest will still be a 4-0 length).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E RE Tank Variants,   By Variants I assume differing textures based on tank selected, we can then choose to swap out say KLox for NTO?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [...snip...]\n\u003E \n\nTank variants are... the equivalent of B9 PartSwitch parts, but wrapped up into a single module including length and diameter switching.  Basically the new MFT-A can now switch between the **models** for MFT-A, MFT-B, or two new sets of models.  The old MFT-B part no longer exists.  ^^That is what I mean by tank variants.  Different visual variants of the same length of fuel tank.  I will not be tying fuel type to the mesh variants in any fashion; the modules for each work entirely independently aside from communications about volume changes, and I like it that way.\n\nEngines -- not really.  I\u0027m referring to simple one-time upgrades for the engines, more akin to the F-1 / F-1A upgrade, or how the SSME was upgraded and uprated throughout its lifetime.  What you are referring to are actual variants (and different engine model #s), which I represent with different parts, and I would agree that those are poor candidates for the PartUpgrade system (they would need a PartVariant system).  No, I will not be doing engine variants such as those; they belong in more in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nEngine clusters --  No I\u0027m not going to lock the # of engines behind upgrades, that is just forcing people to build the clusters with multiple parts, which goes against the entire purpose of the mod (part-count reduction).  Note how I\u0027m also not locking fuel tank -length- behind upgrades -- I believe forced tank stacking is wrong, and only serves to artificially increase part-count.\n\nInteresting bit of info from the pre-release patch notes today:\n\n\u0022Support non-bendy joints on parts via a 9th value in attach node declarations. Apply it to the 3.75m decoupler so it can be no longer physicsless.\u0022\n\nWondering how they set this up on the code/physics end of things..... does it to an actual hierarchy-parenting of the model transforms (removing the joint entirely), or is it a special configuration of the joint (as existing joints, but stronger)?\n\nI was under the impression that \u0027non-bendy\u0027 joints simply wasn\u0027t a thing in Unity/PhysX -- if it had a joint it could wobble, bend, be displaced, only the amount of wobble/bend/displacement could be somewhat limited (but never eliminated or even close).\n\nHowever if they have set this up as direct hierarchy-parenting... that could have pretty large performance implications as well, especially if applied to an entire vessel (almost a form of part-welding; afaik the joints were one of the major CPU limiting bits of the physics calculations).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T15:52:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T22:13:43Z","Content":"Just wanted to double check something.
