Without a guidance system to make it unique it seems unnessesary with two stock AGMs and another 4 of my own. If there is a specific need for this weapon such as a YouTube series or other project I can put one together but for now I want to finish my project then add to it later. This isn\u0027t a no Just a hold on for a bit.\n\nProgress update\n\nYesterday I finished the textures and unity packages for the AIM-27 R-37 GBU-57A and I rebuilt the BLU-82\n\nToday I will attempt to get them all working properly and try to get a release out in the next few days once my armor pieces are also working."},{"CreatedByName":"SubjectX07","CreatedById":142948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:55:12Z","Content":"Can\u0027t wait to put a GBU-57 or BLU-82 into my heaviest scariest bomber.
