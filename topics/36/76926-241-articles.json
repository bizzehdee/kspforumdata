For one thing, you can convert the BLU-109 bunker buster bomb into an air-to-ground bunker busting MISSILE, AKA the AGM-130, just by swapping their butts. And the highly maneuverable (so much so that it\u0026#39;s used as an anti-missile missile) RIM-162 ESSM surface-to-air missile? Yeah, that was developed from the old Sea Sparrow, which itself was developed from the AIM-4 Sparrow air-to-air missile. I\u0026#39;d really like if the modular weapons system were updated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA few thoughts on usability, do with these what you will:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 2 diameters, 0.325m and 0.625m, possibly controlled with a tweakable to reduce parts count on load.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Have the root part of any missile be the center of it that includes the \u0022Flight Logic Controller\u0022, which controls the missile tweakables previously controlled by the Modular Missile computer thing, as well as making the BDA Guard AI code able to recognize and fire it as a missile. Maybe a \u0022missile designation\u0022 switch that kind of changes the name of the missile, maybe through 4 different possibilities having nothing to do with any type of missile, but sounding awesome, like \u0022Cheetah\u0022, \u0022Lynx\u0022, \u0022Tiger\u0022, and \u0022Lion\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 6 different seeker heads: Active Radar (radar lock, long distance, Fire-and-Forget, rather heavy, maybe available in 0.625 only?), Passive Radar (requires the firing aircraft to keep a radar lock on the target at all times, but simple and light), Heat-Seeker (lightish, does what you think it does), Laser, Radar-Seeking (toggleable between and GPS (the lightest of the five). You can feel free to drop Passive radar, but I personally feel that the jump to miniaturized active radar guided missiles happened too recently. Also, it would make a pretty good balancing feature for a super long-range SAM or AAM.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- All seeker heads are usable in all modes (e. g., AGM, Cruise, SAM/AAM, Vac AVM), but if you use the GPS head on a Vac AVM or SAM/AAM, it acts like it would IRL and just fires at the co-ordinates specified because, to be honest, that was a really dumb idea you, the player, just had to make a GPS-guided AAM and you should be slapped for this idea by getting your ship almost exploded.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 2 different rocket motors for both diameters, both with high gimbal: Long Range and Short Range. Both carry their own (largely aesthetic) fin sets so the player doesn\u0026#39;t have to triple their parts count by mirroring an entire new set of wings for their thirty-odd missiles. Short Range has more gimbal. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Lots of different warhead types. Just two types for 0.35m (Traditional, Bunker Buster (really more like anti-armor)) but a long, long list of different warhead types for 0.625m: *takes breath*:BIG Bunker Busting, BIGGEST BUNKER BUSTING, Incendiary (?), Cluster (8x bomblets per warhead, gloriously OP for AAM/SAM work), FAB (large blast radius), fragmenting (or is frag a stupid idea that would just be hard to implement), and I\u0026#39;m sure many other users can come up with many obscure yet undoubtedly awesome other variants. Basically, this would open up yet another avenue for modders to go nuts with. To reduce parts count on load, I\u0026#39;d suggest having only two models of 0.625m warhead (Large, Medium) and then keeping the more powerful stuff to the Large model, which is of course much heavier, via tweakables.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth .625 warhead models would function as adapters between 0.325 and 0.625 in a suitably bomb-like manner, eliminating the need to double parts count on load by having .625 variants of every seeker head. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Maybe have toggleable aesthetic fins on every missile/bomb part? This would increase the amount of possibilities for aesthetic choices by players lots, but not cause too much work for you, the modder. Especially if it was just a 2D plane that you pasted the same transparent texture on and repeated around the part 4 times in radial symmetry. (e. g., only having to make 1 fin in the texture file)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The tweakable warheads would work really well with the ability to switch textures. Would certainly make things easier on the (fictional) ground crews... =P\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlright, now I need to finish up my homework... \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStop press: Oh, and a modular turret (AKA, just a base turret ring with RotSpeedHorz, RotSpeedVert, Yaw Limit, Vert Limit tweakables that you can attach bits to to armor it up, as well as a main attachment point for the gun) would be AWESOME.
