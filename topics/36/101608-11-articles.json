Is a 20 min burn time for the upper stage normal?\n\u003E \n\nYeah, that\u0027s efficiency for ya. \n\nThe upper stage is only for pushing stuff out to the Moon or further. If you want to put stuff in LEO just slap the payload straight on top of the core. \n\nWhen using the upper stage you have to use the core stage to push your apoapsis some 3 minutes away just before burnout. Don\u0027t worry if you end up in a high orbit, that\u0027s normal. \n\nAs for payload capacity you\u0027d have to ask NASA, or better yet, [@maccollo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/72759-maccollo/). \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-05T13:29:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2016 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerbonautInTraining**"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T00:22:39Z","Content":"[@delta wee](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162060-delta-wee/)\n\nYes, that TWR is correct. When it comes to payload capacity, the EUS will have a very hard time launching fully fueled with more payload that it can take to TLI. So that\u0027s about 42 tons with 1B. Without the EUS the core can throw about 90 or so tons to LEO. With the EUS partially fueled you can squeeze out about 100 tons.\n\nTo launch the SLS efficiently you want to hit about 45 degrees just after you pass 20 km. After this you want to lock into a cruise pitch which you will not drop until the very end, when you notice that the EUS will kill the vertical velocity before you reach orbit. The pitch for TLI payload is something like 27-28 degrees for 1B. If you perform the ascent correctly the core will almost flatten out at around 110 km when.  \n\nThe TWR then catches up and the core should give you a big vertical kick, enough for 2.5-3 minute of lead time. Just keep holding roughly 25-27 degrees and the EUS should pass the apoapsis, and catch itself on the way down. It\u0027s sort of like a double-lofted trajectory. If you did it all correctly you should end up in a circular orbit at about 160-200 km.\n\nThis is the correct way to fly the SLS.\n\n\\*  \n\nAlso do apologize that I this mod hasn\u0027t gone anywhere in a while. It\u0027s been hard to balance work and my education at the same time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T01:23:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T02:41:14Z","Content":"Where do you guys get realism overhaul?
