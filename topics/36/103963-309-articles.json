One of two things will happen, either you eventually get all your mods installed, or you run into the crash bug again. The first one means that you must have borked your install somehow the first time you were adding mods, and the second means that you just found your mod conflict, now remove the last few mods you put in one at a time until you find the exact mod that is causing the issues. Then provide logs of that case, if you find it.\n\u003E \n\nit\u0027s not my first time modding ksp, also, i hope you know that crash to black screen with vga\u0027s fan going crazy, is most likely a shader crash on the mod itself. it\u0027s not a normal ksp game crash. the vga driver itself crashes and there is no other way but to restart the pc manually. these simptoms can be one of the very few things :\n\n1- temperature (checked, it\u0027s not the reason)\n\n2- over clock (checked even down clocked slightly, so it\u0027s not power nor hardware)\n\n3- driver version (triple checked, it\u0027s not that)\n\n4- shader crash on the vga, causing a null pointer error on the vga side of things that repeats itself constantly, causing overflow and vga crash (most likely)\n\nknowing all this, do you still think having scatterer alone would be different? i tell you from experience, it did the same but a little bit later in the game, for example, opens to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E, go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E, come back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E ==\u003E crash ! and that in on vanilla \u002B scatterer.\n\nThe reason i gave the log file above, it that the mod developer himself will be the best to judge if there is a solo issue or if there is a conflict between two graphical mods. having this log may show something regarding a conflict that a solo install won\u0027t.
