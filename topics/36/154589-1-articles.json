I know there are a few car mods that have been made but, wanted to do my own.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently, It\u0027s only four parts: Two passenger \u0027pod\u0027, wheel module, nose adapter and, a dual car to .625 adapter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe resembalance to a old Caddilac was completely accidental. lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YbxcvFc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YbxcvFc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221YCMPKo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1YCMPKo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJet engines are definitely not required. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy textures mapping is a bit lazy, and i need to fix shading.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ll probably add a truck box part, and i might even expand this to stock-textured boat parts.

Two fit nicely in a 2.5m fairing. There hasn\u0027t been much interest in my mods really. Might still do a few boat parts. Meh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
