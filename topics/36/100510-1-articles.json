Why? This is why:\n\n[![asteroid_asteroid.png](https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/68/asteroid_asteroid.png)](https://what-if.xkcd.com/68/)\n\n![asteroid_orbit.png](https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/68/asteroid_orbit.png)\n\nI was tempted to call my little project B612, and this may become the project\u0027s name if I ever have more than one object of tiny size.\n\nIt\u0027s a small chunk of Minmus in a Medium-Kerbin-Orbit. It\u0027ll be a nice challenge for some early-career science, or an easy rendezvous for your final Kerbin SOI science. Right now, it has no custom science, but this will change.\n\nBut not only do I want you to have fun with it, I want you to help me with it. Like any alpha release, I need bugfinders and even bugfixers. Some bugs are inherent to what happens when you make a planet so extremely tiny.\n\nFor now, this adds no textures at all, but I might add some eventually when the need to differentiate between different planets becomes apparent. The \u0022terrain\u0022 is also exactly identical to Minmus\u0027, but this may change as well! So many changes!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/4DVu8)\n\nRight now, here are its celestial body stats.\n\nGravityASL: 0.3 Gees\n\nRadius: 125 meters\n\nRotationPeriod: 2 Hours\n\nOrbital paramters:\n\n ReferenceBody = Kerbin\n\n Inclination = 17.15 degrees (Pretty darn angled)\n\n Eccentricity = 0.25 (Pretty darn elliptical)\n\n SemiMajorAxis = 180000 (from Kerbin\u0027s core, not surface)\n\nSome bugs seem to be part of how Kittopia and Kopernicus fight eachother, but I think I\u0027ve got much of that sorted out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThere\u0027s also a Monolith on the surface, and many people forget that Minmus itself does indeed have a floating monolith. I visited it once, but I\u0027ve never seen anyone do a easter-egg hunt to that monolith before. Anyway, there\u0027s one on Sprinkle as well.\n\nSource: [**KopernicusTech**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109122-WIP-KopernicusTech-An-integration-attempt-between-Kopernicus-and-KittopiaTech-%280-121-02-13-15%29)\n\n[**Download**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1rvelb4w80grzc/SprinkleMoon.zip?dl=0)\n\nInstall: unzip into Gamedata\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.1: Initial release.\n\n0.1.1: Included missing KopernicusTech stuff. KopernicusTech is now included in the download.\n\nThings I have tried:\n\n-Landing\n\n-Takeoff\n\n-Rendezvous to orbit\n\n-EVA walking and moving around\n\n-Planting a flag\n\n-Circumnavigating on foot\n\n-Jumping up\n\n-EVA-jetpacking into orbit\n\nThings I have not tried:\n\n-Intentionally crashing\n\n-Roverjumps!\n\n-Covering it with structural panels. (The first person to do/try this gets \u002BRep)\n\nBeware of Pudding-Krakens. They seem to thrive in Sprinkle. They like to eat ships that go too far away from Kerbals, or even just go too fast.\n\nSo go crazy! It\u0027s really fun to play with! You\u0027re always well withing 2.5km, not even the SOI is far enough away! Though that does beg the question of what happens when you\u0027re outside the SOI and another ship is 2.5km away...\n\nEDIT: Found this image by GhostGriffin on deviantart, meant to apply to normal Minmus, but still.

Anyway, here\u0027s a list of bugs I found.\n\n-Crafts clip through the terrain and explode at high speed.\n\n-Other crafts clip through the terrain and explode if gone beyond a certain distance from the ship focusing on.\n\n-Switching crafts may cause other crafts on the surface to clip through and orbit the center of the planet. Very very glitchy stuff of course. Black hole glitchy.\n\n-Sometimes switching from a surface craft to an orbit craft will make the surface craft float above the surface, some kind of exception (not a nullref thugh)\n\nI think some of these bugs are caused by the fact that in addition to the 2.5km limit, there\u0027s also a closer limit that removes all but very basic physics from an object. Also, I think the terrain might literally despawn at that distance. I suspect the problem is simple enough that a plugin could fix it.
