If ripple fire is on then it will fire missiles at the set RPM, and unlike mashing an AG (Action Group) fire button, it will not fire another missile type. Guns don\u0027t have an AG fire option because all AG are toggle except the Brake AG. Guns can fire without the system being armed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assumed so, but that just doesn\u0027t work, the fire key never fires missiles for me, regardless of the timer.
