Maybe it\u0027s part of the adjustement, but I share: The biomes are from laythe (for now who cares?), from Prbit the planets is really good looking, but there is something weird with the atmosphere, you start from vacuum to Full Atmospheric Pressure in just a moment. It gives some weird data to KER too. When you try to land on Tyrok, the terrain disappear from 7/5 km from ground. Here\u0027s some screenshot for everyone:\n\n![noD66lH.png](http://i.imgur.com/noD66lH.png)\n\n![rzYUxap.png](http://i.imgur.com/rzYUxap.png)\n\n![BHTAObK.png](http://i.imgur.com/BHTAObK.png)\n\n![i1zznZE.png](http://i.imgur.com/i1zznZE.png)\n\nBTW, from orbit Tyrok is really beautiful. With some clouds, it will be one of the most awesome planets on the Kerbol System, challenging Tekto.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T20:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nansuchao**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hammersamatom","CreatedById":102101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T21:00:05Z","Content":"Yea, as for the problems with the surface and everything, I\u0027ll have to leave that to Amarius.

Good thing that I\u0027m Hypergood (is that even a word?) at geometry, physics, chemestry and i\u0027m learning very fast programming. Heh... I guess Industrial Design it is, at least for now... Oh god and the worst thing is our Country\u0027s learning system. We learn in 7th grade what occidentals learn in 10th grade! Outagious! Anyway, wish me luck, and I\u0027m preety sure that I\u0027ll still be playing KSP for at least one year before HEAVY LEARNING PHASE starts before entering the Bucharest Industrial Design University. \n\nOn the other hand, I\u0027ve started to remake and beautify mod textures!"},{"CreatedByName":"Hammersamatom","CreatedById":102101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:53:04Z","Content":"Sweet, the education system here is lacking.
