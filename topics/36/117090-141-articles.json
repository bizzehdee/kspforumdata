Suspension would be nice, but generally not \u0027needed\u0027 given how softly I do my landings (\u003C3 m/s, often \u003C1 m/s).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wheels though... there is no simple alternative.  They just have to work.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t get too concerned right now;  I\u0027ve got a bit of patience left... but is not infinite.  If I still can\u0027t get it figured out in a month or two... that might be cause for concern.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll likely just go with whatever I have done and working as far as wheels are concerned.  The component that I\u0027ve been writing / working on is... mostly functional, but not perfect.  It might be \u0027functional enough\u0027 for general use, with some caveats.  I really won\u0027t know until I can start integrating it into the in-game partmodules (which I intend on working on a bit this weekend... to try and get the shuttle parts working again).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What is really frustrating me about this all... is that this is not a problem I should even need to solve, nor am I by any means actually qualified to be solving it.  Its a bit like being tasked with doing a full engine rebuild on a car... with only a crescent wrench and no assembly diagrams and no knowledge of the specific engine.  Unity should not have released such an incompatible and limited use wheel system (compared to their previous implementation), period.\n\u003E \n\nLanding skids like those on Dyna-Soar would be awesome in this mod."}]}
