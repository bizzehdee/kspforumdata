Keep unique textures with the part, all the shared on in one folder (=take it or leave it). Don\u0027t make more work unless it;s really necessary. I can see landers being a seperate package, unless it will share engines etc with Shipcore.\n\u003E \n\nLanderCore will eventually be sharing engine, RCS, and \u0027general\u0027 models/textures (landing gear, modular swappable part stuff) with the rest of the part packs.  Even the fuel tanks will be redone to be a more generic setup (more on that below).  About the only unique parts that it will have would be the pods.\n\nThe eventual plan for that set of parts is to rework the lander-core fuel tanks into a single-part modular tank setup (similar to the MFTs), with some additional support for the module/model swapping that it currently uses (and will likely be adding some module swap to the other tanks as well... so that you could add landing legs, retro rockets, parachutes, etc to the MFTs as needed).  Those are long-term plans though, still have a few things to figure out regarding the module swapping (plan on working on that as soon as the 1.1 update is finished and the mod starts to have \u0027stable\u0027 releases).\n\nThings will becoming even more interlinked and integrated in the future.  So, considering the extra work-load that would be required, and 1.1 coming (hopefully) with 64-bit support -- probably not the best idea to split the mod up (and certainly not easy to manage it even if I did).\n\nWhat I can do though, is provide a list of what each model/texture is for (documentation) -- which would make it easier for people to decide what they needed to keep when they were trimming things out.  Would likely just be an excel file (or just plain text...) with a list of model/texture names, and what parts they are used in."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T22:43:44Z","Content":"so... is there any good reason to split the pack at all? from what you describe it seems that there is no good in splitting it other than reducing part list..."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T22:46:54Z","Content":"Yeah, do what is easiest for you to deal with, but if it is possible to have a shared textures folder, then people can simply delete the SC-e folder if they don\u0027t want Shuttle, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T23:20:21Z","Content":"Textures aren\u0027t loaded unless a cfg calls them, isn\u0027t that right?

The part then still defaults to your stock-balanced version, and should anyone bump up the value in the VAB, they do pay a mass penalty. This makes the mode friendly to the sub-RSS rescales.\n\u003E \n\nEach pods\u0027 integrated heat-shield has been carefully balanced for its intended purpose regarding heat load and ablator use.  The SC-C should explode if re-entering from Mun/Minmus; the SC-A should be -just- enough for Mun/Minmus but not quite enough for interplanetary. Just upping the ablator amount should -not- make them any more capable of re-entering at larger scale systems -- if it does, then I have failed in my balance of the heat-shield module, and will need to go back over it again.  The lighter pods\u0027 shields just can\u0027t take the higher heat-load of higher-speed re-entries (they **should** overheat and explode even though they still have ablator left; simulating burn-through or boundary separation).  Rescale systems will -need- patches to the heat statistics of the heat shield.  The ablator amount should not change unless you are rescaling the enitre pod, where it should maintain a constant mass fraction with the pods new mass.\n\nIn short: Upping the ablator resource should do you absolutely no good as far as countering higher heat-loads; all it should do is add more mass to the pod and enable it to take the -same- heat load for a longer period of time (which does no good).  You will need to patch the heatCurve and ablationEfficiency in order to balance those parts for rescaled systems.\n\nHowever, this might be changing a bit in the near future if I can get this modular heat-shield stuff working well; this is the module that will drive the customizable/modular heat-shield parts, but might also be usable on other heat-shield equipped parts.  One of its neat little \u0027functions\u0027 is the ability to change the heat shield type from \u0027Light\u0027 (LKO), to \u0027Medium\u0027 (HKO), to Heavy (kerbin SOI), to \u0027ExtraHeavy\u0027 (Interplanetary) types;  these types all have their own ablation/heat/mass/resource curves so there can be quite a bit of variance between the different types as far as statistics are concerned.  They all use the same visible model (for now)\n\nI\u0027m debating whether or not to add this onto the pods themselves to allow for swapping of the heat-shield types.
