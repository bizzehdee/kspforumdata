They still don\u0027t work amazingly if placed sideways but they will at least rise rather than stick out. There is also now proper support for multiple balloons and I fixed a reference error that occurred in the editor (not really noticeable but it flooded the debug log). The lift force is also applied to the centre of the balloon now rather than the centre of the whole part, including the base and rope - this makes the balloon orient itself when tipped.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T20:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoePatrick1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Riverey","CreatedById":104594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:21:14Z","Content":"Very cool mod!\n\nAlthough, some replacement for the HooliganLabs baloons (which has terrible texture=( ) would be cool too!"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:40:24Z","Content":"I request a \u0022neunundneunzig kerbaloons\u0022 joke somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T19:01:00Z","Content":"Why are they so expensive?

It can lift any part but it can\u0027t lift anything heaver than about 0.005t (read the part description) as it is just a balloon - it can actually lift 5-10 times the weight of a balloon on Earth. I am making some lighter weight parts (such as science parts) so the balloons can lift more than a single experiment.
