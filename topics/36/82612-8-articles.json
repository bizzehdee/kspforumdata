Need lotsa EC, many tens of thousands for LB-100 at baseline gravitational tolerance limit. Engineers lower EC cost. From a gameplay mechanic, being able to harvest K\u002B from Eve/Eeloo in stock sorta means hauling a few extra Z-4Ks (3 Z-4Ks = 12k EC) with the beacon isn\u0027t that big a deal.

Hauling a big space station docked with a fully equipped beacon, initiating then undocking the beacon and transferring the space station is still Kerbal-crazy do-able but the IB-1 becomes much more attractive as a goal/option.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUsing the GMU doesn\u0027t make much difference in minimum orbital height that can\u0027t be overcome with at most a few hundred m/s delta-V in planetary SOI and a bit more travel time. 25% gravitational tolerance looks big but the inverse square law means that\u0027s just a ~10% change in orbital SMA/~11-14% altitude reduction. Based on the charts, there are clear roles in mind for each beacon. Perhaps rescaling gravitational tolerances of beacons to in-SOI location/travel time can reinforce these roles?

Around Kerbol, that translates to unaugmented-just under Kerbin orbit (access to outer planets only and big ships still have to planet-hop around to get to the other side of Kerbol) and \u002BGMU gives a radius that\u0027s within Moho\u0027s orbit most of the time (inner planets \u002B trans-Kerbol access).

Maybe an added benefit could be a reduction in EC for initiation \u0026amp; standby (\u002B/- transfer EC)? Based on the gravity \u0022logic\u0022 an asteroided beacon would use less EC than an un-asteroided beacon at the same altitude.

The major discrepancy is that there is no EC draw on vessel transfer, which is a choice I made based on the fact that the beacon is invariably unloaded and put on rails immediately following activation. Since the vessel cannot generate or spend EC while on rails, the practical result of on-transfer costs would be that the user would be stuck waiting for a beacon to recharge every time they approached it for transit, which is undesirable from a gameplay perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther discrepancies include that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve based the activation charge on, among other things, the amount of Karborundum on the vessel. I wanted to scale the cost with the planned use, so if the player has decided to transfer a small probe the beacon transferring it should be appropriately scaled. If the player is building a transit hub for ferrying massive freighters of mined goods, then they will need more fuel and therefore more EC to maintain the beacon. Clever engineering and logistics can be used to keep the onboard fuel supply at a minimum and reduce the costs for both activation and constant operation, which I view as a positive \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 problems should be solvable with clever engineering. However, large transfers necessitate incurring that cost for some period of time because the entire used amount of fuel has to be aboard at some point for the reaction to occur. The capacitors from NF Electric would be a good fit, I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have to do some balance testing as you suggested, given the increased output of solar panels near the sun. However, I\u0027ve also heard indications that solar power does not work well when the panels heat up, so there may be a hard limit on how well that works. The high end of the exponential increase in energy draw is VERY high, so I\u0027m not too worried about it being \u0022too easy\u0022 to grab constant power. Decreasing the gravitational tolerance as you\u0027ve suggested is also worth considering, as it would have the effect of dramatically increasing EC costs within a gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure how much you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve played with the GMU and high-mass stations, but the gist of it is that the GMU is generally not worth using unless you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using it along with a significant mass to operate inside of a gravity well. The cost of running a beacon at any given gravitational field strength is always more with a GMU than without, although the difference is proportional so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s unlikely to be backbreaking at far-reaching orbits. Where the GMU really starts to dial up the difficulty is if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using it very, very close to a large gravity source like Eve or Jool. In my testing, having a GMU-enabled LB-10 very close to Eve resulted in five-digit activation costs and three-digits of EC consumption per second with modest fuel on board. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not unachievable, but it does require planning to ensure the operational costs are taken care of. Granted, considering you need at least a Class-E asteroid to get that close and asteroids don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t spawn naturally in any of the systems that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be likely to use them in, the engineering challenge involved is not particularly difficult relative to moving the station there in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour theoretical Kerbol free-transfer beacon is interesting, but there are some technical challenges you may not have considered. First, the LB-10 is the easiest to get online in that situation but LB-10s are basically useless in solar orbit due to their effective 1Gm transfer limit. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d need at least an LB-15, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll use that as my example. The GMU mass offset increases the operational range less effectively for the larger beacons proportional to their decreased gravitational tolerance \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the LB-10 has a base limit of 1m/s^2, the LB-15 is at 0.5m/s^2 and the LB-100/IB-1 at 0.1m/s^2. This means that you need (roughly, not exactly) twice the mass to achieve the same operational altitude for an LB-15 vs an LB-10, and 10x the mass for the large beacons. The formula for gravitational acceleration at a given radius is g = GM/r^2, where g is the acceleration, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the main body and r is the radius from the center of the body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal solar operating limit for a LB-15 occurs at around 4.6Gm, right outside the closest approach Moho makes. By contrast, the acceleration from gravity at 150Mm is a crushing 6.92m/s^2. To counteract this using the GMU, you would need to have a total vessel mass of around 3700 tons (1 particularly large class-E asteroid or two small ones) and your per-second electrical charge usage would be a little north of 275 EC for 100 K\u002B on board, increasing by ~3 EC per additional unit of K\u002B present. Onlining the beacon would take a whopping 20,757 units of EC at 100 fuel, or ~207 per unit of fuel. None of these challenges are insurmountable with clever engineering, but considering the fact that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d have to get those class-E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s into low solar orbit using traditional methods and the challenge of heat management at those altitudes, I think you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll agree that the logistics of keeping such a harvesting station running are decidedly nontrivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good compromise solution would be to have the periapsis of the orbit be as close to the sun as the harvester could survive, but have the apoapsis be within a less strenuous gravity region. The station would then have windows during which it harvested followed by a window where transfer away from the station would be more economical. The collection rate would be a fraction of what it otherwise would be, but fuel would accrue nevertheless. Heat management would also be simplified due to the breaks in between close approaches allowing for a return to relatively normal values rather than having to deal with the close-in heat constantly. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had people tell me that most ships are pretty much eventually going to explode if they stay under 190Mm, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just a matter of when.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to explore sort of the worst case scenario for logistics transport for the \u0022highest throughput\u0022 harvester setup. Let us say you manage to resolve all of the aforementioned problems of heat, electricity and asteroid relocation. Your pictured 80-ton harvester manages to fill up with 4000 K\u002B from its turn around Kerbol and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to top up your Jool beacons. Your solar orbit will allow you to easily pick the shortest distance to Jool, which assuming you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re at around 200Mm would be (best case) 65.13Gm disregarding the minimal inclination of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll use 65 on the nose for easier math. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first debit you face is the base transfer cost. Assuming an 80-ton wet weight (including your shiny new K\u002B) your transfer cost would be a rather economical 80.19 K\u002B using the IB-1, but since we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re deep in the gravity well any operating beacon has to be hooked into a massive asteroid. This forces you to use a separate ship with a beacon like the LB-100 Longbow (cost: 114.14 K\u002B), but the Longbow can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t realistically be onlined that close to the sun. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not going to do napkin math for it, but you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking at a total required vessel weight of something like 15000 tons and 1500 EC being consumed every second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we back off to the LB-15 that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve already established can be made to work at those altitudes. Unfortunately, the LB-15 cannot handle high vessel weights very well and the cost for transfer will be a rather steep 1071.2 units. Fortunately this is debited from the beacon vessel rather than the transferring vessel, so we may safely disregard it except to note that it will increase the processing time before the next trip is ready. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also taking advantage of the AMU\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s velocity matching ability, so you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also going to have to shell out for that. Now, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s consider your orbital speed. In the unlikely event you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re entering into a circular orbit at 150Mm, you will have somehow achieved an orbital velocity of around 95830m/s. That seems high to me, but I checked it a few different ways and the same math returns correct orbital velocities for the planets, so I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s accurate. Not only that, you will have dragged about 3700 tons of asteroid with you. So, accepting this unlikely premise, you will have to have the AMU cancel out around 91km/s of that speed to match Jool at its fastest, a service for which it will charge somewhere in the neighborhood of 775 K\u002B for an 80 ton vessel. This is quite the bargain, as the energy matching is roughly equivalent to suddenly stopping a fleet of 75 Airbus A380s at cruising speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we must consider the Heisenkerb Compensator. This is the handy widget that keeps everything from exploding during transit, including your hard-won Karborundum, crew, and any other less-than-stable resources you may have on board including (but not limited to) nuclear fuel. The HCU takes a toll of 0.1M/0.0058 units of K\u002B for M = mass of protected resources. Assuming the only protected resource on board is your still-untouched 4000 units of Karborundum, this works out to an entirely non-coincidental 10%, or 400 units. This is again debited from the transferring beacon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETallying up, we arrive at a total cost of 2246.2 K\u002B in total. This poses two rather significant problems \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 first, you have to consider the return trip. Even with the cheaper return due to offloading the KBD (ship mass = 56.8T) and therefore obviating the need for a compensator, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still forced to use a similarly massive LB-15 rig and AMU to make the return with an approximate cost of 184 base \u002B 570 AMU = 754. The vast discrepancy in base cost is mostly due to the fact that the LB-15 cutoff for weight kicks in around 40 tons, so the closer you are to that the better the cost gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe far more serious problem, however, is that it is likely flat-out impossible to run an LB-15 at that altitude (acc due to gravity = 6.92 m/s^2) around Kerbol with 2246.2K\u002B on board due to the electrical charge requirement of approximately 466,190 EC to turn on the beacon and, even with clever fuel transfer circumventing that cost, 6216 EC per second to keep it active. Even if you were to transfer the vessel without the AMU online, the required fuel would still have you pulling 4072 EC/s for beacon operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we abandon the plan of a direct transfer and instead decide to do it in stages \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 an LB-10 at the harvester, a Longbow in a wider resonant orbit so that it comes within 1Gm of the LB-10 every n orbits, and suddenly the extreme numbers calm down a bit. However, this does pose a problem of efficiency, since now the meatier of the two transfers (that being the hop out to Jool and back) must be paid for out of your 4000 units of cargo, drastically decreasing your payload delivered per trip. The Heisenkerb toll doubles, and the AMU is forced to cancel out some slight additional incurred velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen include the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen remember that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just talking about Jool, not the OPM planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would estimate that the most efficient configuration for a Joolian transfer is probably a compromise sundiver orbit like I proposed a few paragraphs back, with an orbital period resonant with Jool and timed such that once every n orbits, the station is at aphelion when Jool is closest to it in orbit. This allows for a direct LB-100 transfer with no asteroid GMU trickery. The only truly difficult part is that higher apoapses mean shorter times spent in the harvest belt, so you have to find the equilibrium where you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in the harvest belt for enough time to grab sufficient KBD but at aphelion at a sufficient distance that beacon orbital speed and gravitational acceleration allow an efficient Joolian transfer. The word of the day is, once again, nontrivial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t continue to explore the permutations of this, but I hope I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve succeeded in conveying some of the additional complexity involved in the idea of a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 transfer from a low-orbit harvester station. There are certainly workable, efficient ways to export K\u002B from low Kerbol orbit, but they require thought, careful planning and a heck of a lot of infrastructure investment before they become workable \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 which is sort of the point.
