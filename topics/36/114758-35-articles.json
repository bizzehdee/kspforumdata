I might try putting RPM back myself, and see if it is better now.\n\nIf you download the latest version of RPM the latest version of RPM allows you to change the transparency setting via the part right click menu per part.\n\nSo you can switch them on or off, or set them to Auto (when in auto mode the windows become transparent when you mouse over the part).\n\nThe performance hit is to be expected when you have multiple parts all loaded (in range) with the transparency on, as this causes the Internal model to be loaded and rendered as well as the external models. Rendering costs GPU/CPU.\n\nBut the new toggle option in RPM allows you to switch them on and off to handle the performance issue. Remembering that RPM JSITransparentPod was actually built to make transparent command pods. Mods like this one which have lots of parts all connected and in range of each other using transparency will cause a performance hit. The best thing to do is to set them all to Auto in the Editor (or in flight) and mouse over them if you want to see inside...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T05:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T05:29:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The performance hit is to be expected when you have multiple parts all loaded (in range) with the transparency on...\n\nFair enough.
