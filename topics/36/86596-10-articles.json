The winds are slower at the surface because of surface friction for one, another factor is the density of the air, the higher the density, the lesser the winds because the air is better at transferring heat.

The effect is huge. Because oceans has much more thermal capacity than the atmosphere and their produce its own weather.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not matter if a planet is tidal locked to its star in cases there is a big ocean there, which is enoght to carry heat to other side to keep a temperature almost warm, at high altitude you will have similar super rotation as we see in venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo resume, you said to me that your model produce always super winds, even at low height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my understanding, that might be related to the case that oceans in the model are not moving heat, so these try to compensate the job that needs to do the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you distribute the different absortions coeficients over kerbin? I imagine that you use the different biomes to set different values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe climate is very complex, the clouds reflectivity has also a huge effect on local weather.
