Problem on my end?\n\nI don\u0027t know about landing gear, but I was doing some testing some weeks ago. As I recall, the prebuilt rockets (or maybe it was my own rockets i built) didn\u0027t have much of a problem, other than the last part wouldn\u0027t load but it had an empty(sounds like maybe the same issue you are having with the fixed landing gear, is it the last part added in your craft file?), and the 2nd to last part loaded but had no texture. It may have been related to struts some how if i remember correctly, as it seemed some struts would import and others wouldn\u0027t.\n\nAlso I tried importing some things made in the SPH, and it seems as if when I tried to import something with intakes on it, only the first few parts would load, then the craft import script would crash. Using the same plane with out intakes seemed to work fine. Don\u0027t remember if I had landing gear on it or not though.\n\nOh, also what I did, in my tests (haven\u0027t done a serious render in a while...too busy unfortunately to work on something, plus not sure if it\u0027d work as planned anyway), with the rockets, usually as an engine was added last it wouldnt show up, so I just added a decoupler as the last part and the engine would show up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T02:27:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"xandre shifted","CreatedById":145425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:04:57Z","Content":"Definitely a must have, but I can\u0027t .craft to load.
