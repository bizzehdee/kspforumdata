He\u0027s moved on, more or less. Considering all the work he\u0027s put forth to reinvent the wheel, quite literally, I believe he has more than earned a long vacation. I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s gone for good, but we may not actually hear a lot from him. However, I share in his vision and still have a lot of interest in this simulation (I prefer not to call KSP a \u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E since it is \u003Cem\u003Eso much more.\u003C/em\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew: (10/27/2015)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForum user \u0022run1235\u0022 has done some work on getting some of the KF parts into appropriate CTT (Community Tech Tree) nodes, and I have compiled those configs into an easy MM (Module Manager) patch. Once decompressed, the GameData folder within is ready to be simply dropped on top of your existing one. Nothing will be replaced... at least I don\u0027t think it will. The file is using a new directory structure that will be used when I update this mod next, but should be fully compatible with whatever you all have installed right now. Of course, it goes without saying that you\u0027ll need Module Manager and CTT installed to see any effect from this patch. (Yeah, I just said it... so I guess it goes \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E saying, eh?)

The problem exists within the tool/utility and it is the job of those authors to fix the problem with how they handle such things if it is worth their time to do so. The only supported way of installing this mod is the way everyone installed mods before CKAN came along, and that is to drag the folder into GameData directly from the zip. It isn\u0027t too difficult to track new versions of the mod on your own, or through the KerbalStuff subscription system. If/When KSP releases an official mod managing application, I will do everything possible to make sure everything works as intended.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIt is not my intention to be the rear end of a mule to anyone by saying this, but the fact remains that I am only the new maintainer of this mod and for the last year or so I have only been contributing to it with no access to the KerbalStuff release page. KerbalStuff does not allow me to change the version numbers for past releases, so the best I can do is remove the errant releases from the site to fix any issues people might be having with a 3rd party mod manager. that I have done, and that is all that I can do at this time. This has nothing to do with willingness to work on a solution, but rather has to do with my limited time and energy to worry about it. The only true reason I am taking the lead with KF right now is because I do not want to see it simply disappear with the disappearance of lo-fi from the modding scene. This is not to say that new and exciting things are not being worked on, but I cannot spend as much time on it as I used to. Unfortunately this also means I won\u0027t be able to re-publish to KerbalStuff, or work on moving everything over to my github repository for the continued work at this time.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESo \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Eplease\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E take this into consideration before you send me a private message with some new idea about how I can fix CKAN or how I should be taking better care of version numbering for releases that were published before I took over the mod.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOld News: (pre-10/27/2015)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ENow, on to some newer stuff. I\u0027m working on writing a set of modules that \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Emight\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E make it easier to convert old wheels to the KF modules. I make no promises, but there are some parameters that can be brought it automatically from the existing ModuleWheel information about the wheel itself such as the transform names and collider names. Other values can be initialized at their defaults and work with most wheels that have been created for KSP. Ideally, one would still write their configs specifically for the KF modules, but I might be able to make it easier to do quick and dirty conversions by simply adding a new module to the config and letting the plugin do the work at run time.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m also dabbling in making DustFX into something that will work on KF wheels, stock wheels, landing gear, etc. without requiring separate plugins to be loaded. In that same line of development is an attempt to make the KF functionality more modular allowing for wheels that have no suspension to speak of, but could still use the more efficient steering mechanisms. The opposite is also desired, having a wheel that has no steering at all but still could use the suspension system.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EFinally, I am working on a way to re-use the WaterSlider module to make tracks/wheels/screws usable in water. The plan is to basically place the water slider slightly under the water, but high enough that the craft can still be considered not-splashed. The wheels/tracks/whatever would then have a solid surface to roll over. There would, of course, be code written to maintain a higher drag on the craft due to having to displace water instead of atmosphere like a rover does on land. I\u0027m also going to try and make the depth of the slider panel respond to the scale of the wheels on the craft but, with multiple wheels capable of having different scales, keeping track of what depth should be used could be tricky. All of this is being done, however, to circumvent the issues with buoyancy, annoying splash effects, and stability in water. The inspiration is to imitate an over-filled, monster-sized tire on a small vehicle allowing the vehicle to float and/or maintain enough speed on the water to hydroplane across the surface in a semi-controlled manner.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESo, that\u0027s my news so far.

If you don\u0027t mind \u0022no texture found\u0022 errors in your log for this model, then you can stick with just that first texture and it should work okay.

I\u0027m not necessarily bashing CKAN, nor saying that CKAN is a fault program, I am simply saying that my experience has been poor and I do not have the time to keep track of any problems with it managing this mod. if you install KF the way it was meant to be installed, then you won\u0027t have any trouble with it being installed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I could not edit the version number for that errant item, so I\u0027m deleting it from the change logs on KerbalStuff in the hopes that that will fix things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, CKAN is great for mods with frequent updates, and dependencies/conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere used to be a Beta_19.b(typo) on KS, which set the major version to 19, so ckan was ignoring the latter versions like 1.9defg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, you deleted that release version off KS altogether, after which I asked for the epoch (invisible thing before major version) to be bumped in CKAN, so everyone who had the 19.b installed would still receive the auto-update to now objectively latest 1.9g (and whatever else you next plan to release in the same schema).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T22:49:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by qm3ster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T21:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe header links \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E correct for that version of the mod.

As I have stated in my last update to the OP, I have no interest in fixing something so that people can feel good about CKAN again. The only installation method I will support, and diagnose any problems with, is the standard installation that has been done for the last year or more (I forget how long KSP has been amongst the public) which is to drag the folder over (copy/paste, use of a custom batch file, whatever floats your boat).

I really don\u0027t think I\u0027m out of line here.

I\u0027m bad with names sometimes) ability. That ability really stinks right now, but I\u0027m not gonna quit just yet. As for the wheels, I have no clue. I can\u0027t make sense of most of what lo-fi wrote into this code, so I\u0027m less likely to even be able to adapt very well. I\u0027m waiting to see how the stock wheels will interact with the world, and how they overcome the Unity 5 issues. My hope is that they overcome the issues in a way that allows the same information to be sent out from the stock code. If that is the case, we may not have to adjust much of anything. If, however, they have to rewrite everything and the output is in a completely different format, then KF will be pretty much screwed. Even if that turns out to be the case, I\u0027ll be seeing what I can do to make the wheel models work in stock (worst case scenario here). The repulsors would likely be history though, at least in their current format. In theory the repulsor could just be a wheel without a wheel model, but we\u0027d loose out on the sideways friction-less action that we have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to simply wait and see what happens, and hope for the best.
