The linked config that started this discussion \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E is the MM patch that I\u0027ve been updating in the wheel config repository. The MM patch has been a thing for a long time, just not officially released. I even recently updated it to include the DustFX module, which will be functional once we release 1.9 of KF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, we never actually implemented a damage and repair system into the KF modules so, for the time being, this effectively makes the wheels indestructible (as far as the functionality that is, not the whole part).

There\u0027s another mod being developed out there, though I forget the name of it, which is attempting to create a system for being able to swap out the modules that are active on a part in conjunction with a texture/mesh/fuel-capacity swap that we\u0027ve already seen done in several ways. I\u0027m waiting for that development to make a working appearance before I start to brainstorm ways to use it for our purposes. In theory, we could then \u003Cem\u003Ekeep\u003C/em\u003E the stock modules on the part and simply add our modules at the end of the config, then set up a module that would reference the different modules much the same way that the mirror modules in KF can reference the mesh objects by name, and then swap them. Alternatively, if this development never sees daylight, we might be able to mimic stock wheel functionality and put a swapper module to swap out the config variables between KF behavior and pseudo-stock behavior. Or, maybe simply set up another switch in the settings GUI that would simply, upon being created in the editor/flight, just remove all the KF modules from the part and leave the stock ones alone. In this same way we could have it simply remove offending modules from the stock wheels during the running of the game much like we can add DustFX to a part if the wheel collides with something and doesn\u0027t find the DustFX module present.

Those help me when I\u0027m editing the code. SharpDevelop analyses the source for places where something could be converted to a simpler form. As I\u0027ve discovered while simplifying some of Aqua\u0027s stuff, the simple form often doesn\u0027t work quite the same. So, for cases where I either cannot read the simplified form, or the simplified form has changed the function in an unexpected way, I add a suppression into the code. I try to turn them into class-wide suppressions when I can, but I often forget to do that, and sometimes a global suppression doesn\u0027t fully take for things like suggestions for static methods and such. I\u0027ll try to go through and clean some of that up. All that means is that the suppressions will loose the \u0022once\u0022 in them and I\u0027ll move them to the top of the class where they can suppress every case of that suggestion all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first... fix that stuff you broke.

Most rovers created with KSP use the standard WASD key setup for control. With the exception of \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E repulsors (where sometimes you need to use WQSE instead) we try to keep things as simple as possible. The \u003Cem\u003Etoggle-option\u003C/em\u003E to swap that for a throttle control would be interesting I\u0027ll admit, like a cruise control system, with an emergency override key that would disable the throttle on the wheels and return to standard controls. it would be a bit like the auto-run in some MMORPGs out there, where if you don\u0027t touch the forward/backward buttons it will continue running, otherwise it will cancel it. In this case we\u0027ll have the added ability to modify the speed of the auto-run. In the end, however, making this mod usable right out of the box for a new user is a must. Any alternate control schemes need to be optional add-ons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I hereby dub you \u0022Captain Obvious\u0022 along with all the responsibilities that come with the title.

Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news... lo-fi... I did some testing last night and it seems the auto update for the repulsor height is broken. I\u0027m going to take a look at the action group settings if I get a chance later. The repulsor lights seem to be a very intermittent thing, not at all reliable in any way. I have a feeling it might be due to the point light limits though, and I\u0027m thinking a test with vertex lighting might be a good idea, which I\u0027ve prepared a test DLL to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Okay, so I did a test and vertex lighting seems pretty nice, other than the fact that it doesn\u0027t seem to play nice with being a directional light and it would ened the intensity turned up. My new toggle for the lights did not function at all, and the DustFX toggle also has no effect on the repulsors. The only toggle which works on the repulsors is the camera enable/disable. Also, I\u0027ve noticed that the camera toggle changes not only the colors, but some other things about the particles as well. They appear thicker, and possibly larger. I\u0027m investigating, but unsure where the problem is. Also, I got the repulsors to auto-update with each action group hit, but instead of each repulsor updating on its own like the wheels do, it updates all repulsors by the same interval resulting in, for instance on a craft with 6 repulsors, a change of 30 instead of a change of 5. I think maybe an overhaul of that part of the code needs to happen to fix this once and for all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T17:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard coding alternate keys is a really bad idea.
