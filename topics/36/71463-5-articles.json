I had the latest 6.4:1 Kerbin, but had an older version of RSS, updating it and reinstalling your mod seems to have fixed the discontinuity between the two views, Minmus is flattish still, but at least in both views, and frankly this is a much more realistic, if less challenging moon to explore now. Now I only have to figure out why Kerbin has a cloud layer about 2150km above the surface in map view... but that will be something in EVE.
