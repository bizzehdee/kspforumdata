Even that Jupiter V wouldn\u0027t be enough to do it in one launch.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m currently doing just that. I\u0027m working with a Chaka 6.5m ejection stage with 9km/s Dv. Then a 7.5 FASA Nova sustainer stage and 6x Chaka SLS SRBs to put that in orbit. \n\u003E \n\u003E And that\u0027s just for the surface habitation module the kerbals need to stay in until the return window.

I\u0027m going to upgrade to 1.0.4.\n\nEDIT\n\nI just remembered I made a Jupiter III analog (Inspired by AndyMC\u0027s Orbiter versions, which is inspired by TeamVisions Jupiter III design)\n\nwith dtobi Space Shuttle Parts External Tank and stock SLS parts for a dual-moon jump. \n\nThe plan is to send a jumbo to Munar Orbit, then the Mun-Minmus lander, then the Roluos CSM (Orion analog with Aerojet Kerbodyne) and an Exploration Upper Stage into Munar orbit. After the whole stack is in Munar orbit, the lander lands, and flies back 2 days before Mun-Minmus transfer window. Then, the lander docks with the Jumbo-64, then the Roluos replenishes, then the EUS refuels the remaining fuel on the jumbo tank. Then, transfer burn as usual, lander lands on Minmus, flies back, discards EUS, then Roluos powers the stack home. \n\nSadly,all of those dreams have failed to be realized, as the rocket undergone Rapid Unplanned Disassembly, while flying the Big Three to space. Greatly, the Aerojet Kerbodyne escape tower did it\u0027s job greatly.\n\nPS. I suggest Roluos as a name for one part, either the Rocket or the Capsule\n\nCheers, SpaceEagle/flamerboy67664\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T13:59:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by flamerboy67664**"},{"CreatedByName":"flamerboy67664","CreatedById":118380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T23:33:11Z","Content":"Any updates? \\*bummmp\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T00:03:30Z","Content":"Sorry I\u0027m pretty busy at the moment with getting everything ready for uni as well as creating 3D models to put up for sale to get some income in (which is basically my day job now), so you can understand that finishing several hours every day of 3D modelling and texturing I\u0027m not particularly in the mood to do more of it for this :\u0027) But don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll get some stuff done soon.\n\nEDIT: With the incoming stock SSME in 1.1 it looks like all I\u0027ll need is a MM config to make that run on liquid hydrogen.
