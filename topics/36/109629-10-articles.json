Please have a try with the new but not quite yet finished boosters and decoupler pack. There is a booster and clamp that attach straight to attach nodes so its 100% fit everytime. Removing that airlock is easy by clicking on it and remiving it in the VAB. Also for now use the SAS system to make an orbit.\n\nPress d to orbit? Did I miss the memo?\n\nAnyway downloads are on the first page of this forum post\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n@jeast thank you for all the time and effort it helps alot.\n\nCant wait to test it.\n\ndid you convert the wings from control to lifttlift surface. \n\nAlso with the drogue chute I did use it in 0.9 but it requires realchutes mod style oof physics so the parachute doesnt dissapear before landing or stopping like the stock one\n\nI shal have it in my next update along with something special too. You will all love it trust me. If I can finish it in time.

The wheel breaks were a supplementary breaking force as with the tail. \n\nWith the featherdynamics, it is hard, but I managed to test the wheels, deceleration is way too high, went from 83 to 0 about half a second, nearly flipped the shuttle over, however, the sounds and animation are accurate. I did see a slight gap between the front attachment fitting, however the shuttle works fine, re-entry is still pointless. \n\nI am coming up with cost values of the parts, I am aiming around 250,000 to 435,000 kredits per launch.
