I suggest making a part called the \u0022Interstellar compensator\u0022 which would scale the fuel requirement between stellar sphere\u0027s of influence to that of an interplanetary jump. In order to do so, however, you would need to attach the part to\u00A0beacons located in\u00A0the outskirts of both the target star system and the origin star system.
