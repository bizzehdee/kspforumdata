I was amused for a while, but now I\u0027d like it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need this part to have very rigid joints with the two parts it connects. I\u0027m a very experienced programmer, so I was thinking it was time to get into Kerbal mod development. I\u0027d like to develop a new part that not only rotates, but is rigid, and allows you to order it to rotate to predefined presets. For example, I want mine to toggle between 0 and 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould anybody be kind enough to give me a clue on where I\u0027d need to start in order to change the rigidity of a joint?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-07T04:21:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2013 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Drachs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T04:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the Unity Script Reference for all your Unity needs! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, most of them anyway.
