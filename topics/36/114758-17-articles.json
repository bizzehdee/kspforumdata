If you have any LS mod, then the next logical progression from that is to extend it to in-situ replenishment. Currently, the only mod with in-situ / self sustaining setups is MKS/OKS. RoverDude included all the code needed to setup these life support cycles.\n\nThen there are those of us who do things like running Deep Freeze instead of closing the LS loop but continue using TACLS forcing resource and time management. There\u0027s also the method of using the S.E.T.I. Greenhouse/Munar Greenhouse or Soylent to acquire closed loop without using MKS. Additionally while using Civilian Population you can overproduce the LS needs for the colony to cover crew needs as well in order to close the loop. The point is, there\u0027s multiple other ways you left out to acquire either a closed loop or prolonged delay for LS needs that do not include MKS at all. To try covering all available methods is pointless anyway.\n\nThe easiest way to accomplish the needs for all LS mods is the simple way - an MM patch using the NEEDS: qualifier to determine which parts to load. Does this mean that people will end up with extra parts in the directory - unfortunately yes. But if you are ever going to expand to cover things like EPL that\u0027s going to happen anyway and can\u0027t be prevented since you can\u0027t avoid doubling up parts if you replace any of the EPL modules.\n\nThe only other possibility I could see to truly avoid extra parts would be to inquire with the CKAN guys about using a selected load feature based on the Depends/Supports metadata. TACLS already has to do this based on RO/Stock setups for it\u0027s configuration and if you really want to obsess over a few extra parts being loaded that would be the way to go - the extra CKAN configuration choice based on your installed mods. This has the side benefit of creating separate packages for LS setups that manual downloaders can select according to their needs.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E OHHHHH Nils what do you think about a rocket parts converter module?\n\nIf you want Rocket Part production the easiest way to do it is another addition to your MM configs for the existing ISRU since Rocket Parts are already defined in the CRP.

In other words you launch the greenhouse and place it where-ever, provide it electric charge and you\u0027re all set to go, right?\n\nThe following is what I wrote before I realized that RoverDude made some major changes to UKI (mks/oks). YOu can either skip the quoted section or read it to gain an understanding of what I was saying before and why.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So what I was saying about MKS is that it\u0027s the only one that I know of that forces you to find and acquire a consumable (substrate) in order to keep your greenhouse going. There\u0027s no \u0022magic\u0022. Does that make more sense as to what I was getting at?\n\u003E Even in USI-LS Rover included two greenhouse parts to make peoples lives easier. They convert electric charge mulch (optional fert) to make supplies. \n\u003E \n\u003E However look at the TAC-LS loop in MKS. If you want to self sustain a colony for example, you have to collect substrate and water. In turn that get\u0027s converted in the hydroponics module to food and waste and greywater. Lemme dig up the charts so we can have something to reference, edit this post soon!\n\nEDIT: found it [https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Life-Support](https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Life-Support)\n\nThat link explains the two \u0022loops\u0022. one for USI-LS and one for TAC-LS They explain things much better than I can....\n\nAnother thing I noted, I\u0027m talking about the way I learned how to do things with UKI a version or two back. Looks like Rover has made some major changes to things since the last time I played Kerbal this much...\n\nSo if you look at the USI-LS flow chart, if have a surface base with a water and substrate drill, it\u0027s possible to turn that into organics and in turn that into Supplies. The idea being you can make a \u0022farm\u0022 and over produce supplies to re-supply missions and stations. Think in terms of a farming colony.\n\nSo in that vien, would it not be nice to not simply recycle, but to over-produce resources to stock up your ships and other missions whithout the cost of launching off kerbin??\n\nMaybe we need to find some time to jump on Teamspeak or something. I have a server if you wanna talk it out\n\nSo getting back to the root (two pages back the picture of the new tanks with the \u0022ore -\u003E Fert\u0022 line in it)... I\u0027m going to remove my objection to this cycle. I\u0027ve though it through and as long as you don\u0027t set the gains very high, then I think this does make sense after all. Just look at a backyard swimming pool, toss in some dirt, your\u0027re going to get algae to bloom ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) (yea oversimplified but whatever)\n\nSo I amend my proposal to the following:\n\nIf USI-LS installed - greenhouse should take in mulch (optionally fert) and electric and produce supplies, the Algae tank should take in ore and make fert\n\nIf USI-LS AND MKS - same as above except the algae tank should have another converter installed that takes water \u002B Substrate and output organics, your hab module should have a converter for organics to supplies\n\nIf TAC-LS installed - I\u0027m not sure here... I could see the Algae taking in waste and waste water to make Food , I can see the greenhouse taking in those same things to make food and clean water and O2.... So I\u0027m not sure how to proceed there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T03:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 03:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rottielover**"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T07:16:49Z","Content":"First thing for me to note is that I do not use USILS so all of my input is coming from the TACLS perspective since that\u0027s the only one I ever use anymore...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E All good points, and I\u0027m glad we stirred up this conversation ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E First let me clarify something, All the greenhouse mods mentioned above, (at least to my knowlage please correct me here if I\u0027m wrong) don\u0027t require you to find and aquire any resources in-situ in order to \u0022close the loop\u0022.

The greenhouse mods are magic in that they are lifted, started and use the existing waste products to recycle the LS needs as does the Civilian Population cycle. These methods can be arranged to overproduce by transferring waste by-products every time you dock with a base. Soylent requires the addition of an extremely long lived additive that cannot be harvested/produced. If you manage it exactly right you will literally get years out of a single supply and if you manage it perfectly it will close the loop provided you can maintain constant sunlight exposure.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So I amend my proposal to the following:\n\u003E If TAC-LS installed - I\u0027m not sure here...

So I\u0027m not sure how to proceed there.\n\nI\u0027ve got no input for USILS but my 2 cents on the TACLS loop...\n\nForemost, I don\u0027t think the TACLS method, whatever is chosen, should be simplistic in nature or make managing the TACLS resources easy. It\u0027s more complicated for a reason. That said, I\u0027d like to see some method introduced to allow the KPBS greenhouse to reprocess Waste into food. TACLS already provides various modules to recycle CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and Waste Water which could be duplicated for the KPBS form factor. However, using either Waste Water or CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E as part of food production will break the TACLS balance for O\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C/sub\u003Eand water. Instead, using the Waste resource itself as a basis for pushing the cycle forward adds a use for the only thing you end up dumping since it does nothing for you. Additionally, this provides additional functionality for the use of the Sabatier Recycler and Water Splitter, both of which produce excess waste while giving O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and water. \n\nSome possibilities I can think of right now with all stages processed using the greenhouse:\n\n**1) Waste to Algae to Food method**\n\n**[-]** *Waste\u002BOre\u002BElectricity = Algae* \n\n**[-]** *Algae\u002BElectricty = Food*\n\nA simple two stage process for producing the food that not only takes time and power but requires harvesting to achieve the end result of closing the loop.\n\n**2) Ore Growth Medium method**\n\n**[-]** *Ore\u002BElectricity = \u0022growth medium\u0022* aka soil (mulch?) or fertilizer, whatever \n\n**[-]** *Waste\u002BElectricity\u002B\u0022growth medium\u0022 = Food*\n\nAnother 2 stage process that is basically the same as the first but with the added benefit that you could use existing CRP resources to achieve the ends by using USILS Mulch as the resulting growth medium but with a different production chain. I don\u0027t see a conflict with USILS because if you were to try exploiting it by running USILS and TACLS you\u0027d be forced into providing both Supplies and the TACLS chain for crew support.\n\n**3) The hardest, most expensive method requiring Substrate and Ore**\n\n**[-]** *Substrate\u002BElectricity = Organics*\n\n**[-]** *Organics\u002BWaste\u002BElectricity = Algae*\n\n**[-]** *Algae\u002BOre\u002BElectricity = Food*\n\nThis chain is in the spirit of the MKS support for TACLS by requiring the use of Substrate as part of the process to generate food. This obviously makes the acquisition of Substrate a critical part of the chain which in turn makes closing the loop considerably harder. The ore part of this equation is the growth medium which could have the mulch process from USILS substituted for it to further amp the challenge. Obviously, this method would be far more difficult to achieve the end result of closing the loop.\n\n**4) The simplified, not as expensive method**\n\n**[-]** *Ore\u002BElectricity\u002BWaste = Food*\n\nThis is a solution that does meet the needs of closing the chain and doesn\u0027t require additional resources while still requiring harvesting to achieve the ends. That said, it seems too easy in relation to TACLS. This system is more complex and demanding and a simplified chain like this doesn\u0027t really fit the over all idea of TACLS.\n\nAll of these ideas (except #4) are coming from the perspective that TACLS is a harder system to use than USILS. It doesn\u0027t provide a means to close the loop within the mod itself intentionally because it is supposed to be harder to use and represents a more realistic way of having to deal with life support. With that in mind, I\u0027d recommend going with something more difficult (like #3) since it should be complicated to close the TACLS loop to stay in the spirit of that mod."},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T08:14:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Using \u0027ore\u0027 doesn\u0027t make sense anyway because it doesn\u0027t imply anything organic...\n\nThen how, pray tell, does it turn into the superdense carbohydrates in Liquid Fuel?

Also you still would need a way to gather water.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo gather water i found an interesting article from the NASA:\n\n[NASA Looking to Mine Water on the Moon and Mars](http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/nasa-looking-to-mine-water-on-the-moon-and-mars)\n\nBasically they are microwaving the regolith the extract oxigen from regolith to convert this in a reduction enviroment with hydrogen to create water.\n\nIn KSP (simplified ways) it would be something like Ore \u002B Liquid Fuel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122**Reduction Enviroment** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Water. \n\nFrom which you could again extract Oxigen. I think that direct Ore \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Oxigen conversion would be waaaay to easy.

Yes the water is kinda filtered when it goes through the soil in the greenhouse, but not to a point where i think it would be edible again. Also the plants need water to grow\n\nVery true, the water/CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E needs for the greenhouse is thoroughly valid. Using them as part of the process will make it more difficult to balance out for the purpose of closing the system but TACLS is meant to be tough to use anyway.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the greenhouse will, like in USI-LS, have two modes: \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - One without the organics but with a conversion efficiency of maybe 50%- to 80% (still considering)...\n\u003E - And another mode with organics which will close the loop because *[Out] Food \u003E= [in] Waste*, but needs a more complex \u0022production line\u0022 to get organics. Also you still would need a way to gather water.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT:\n\u003E \n\u003E To gather water i found an interesting article from the NASA:\n\u003E \n\u003E In KSP (simplified ways) it would be something like Ore \u002B Liquid Fuel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122**Reduction Enviroment** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Water. \n\u003E \n\u003E From which you could again extract Oxigen.

Substrate, water and organics are all defined CRP resources which could partner with the oxygen/water extraction methods to create something very fun and flexible. Maybe something along the lines of:\n\nOre\u002BLiquid Fuel\u002BElectricity = Water (the NASA baking process you mentioned)\n\nWater\u002BElectricity = Oxygen/Waste (TACLS Sabatier process)\n\nWasteWater\u002BWaste\u002BElectricity = Organics (maybe add in a harvested resource or oxygen to help balance the process)\n\nOrganics\u002BCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u002BWater\u002BElectricity = Food (50-75% effective to give a production system that doesn\u0027t close the loop but extends supplies)\n\nOrganics\u002BCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u002BWater\u002BSubstrate\u002BElectricity = Food (100% effective and closes the loop)\n\nThis type chain is more complex to manage and would be able to provide all three needed pieces of support while also utilizing all 3 pieces of waste. It also adds in the need to harvest ore and substrate both in order to close the loop. At the same time this gives the option to simply extend the life of supplies by not utilizing substrate if it is difficult to harvest allowing longer lived supplies that would still need to be replenished occasionally. This would be a lot more complicated to balance out for you though so I don\u0027t know if you want to go that far or not.
