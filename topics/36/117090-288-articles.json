At the same time I doubt think the difference is a big enough improvement to consider redoing previous models.\n\nBesides appearance improvements, going HP/LP also makes your models much more efficient, allowing you to use very few polygons in places to really cut down the overall poly count. Like if you\u0027re doing an engine that has all sorts of small lines routing the fuel and oxidizer around, your HP should use 32-sided cylinders, the LP can easily use just 6 sides or in many cases just 4 sides, and yet from anything but very close distances and certain angles, you can\u0027t tell the difference in game- both the environment and standard specular reflections on the LP will act as if the underlying geometry is a very smooth 32-sided cylinder.\n\nThe process shouldn\u0027t be creating a very high poly base model and then spending three days welding vertices on a copy to generate the LP. You\u0027ll have to experiment a bit and I suggest you look for an article or two on HP/LP modeling strategies, but as with SP, once you get it, it goes very quickly; HP/LP done correctly can be very nearly as quick as modeling just one LoD. Most concise explanation is you have to build your full model in your head first and look for places where you might get stuck welding- with a bit of thought, many of those can be eliminated or made easier. Don\u0027t get me wrong you do end up welding vertices to make the LP versions of certain elements, but you want to avoid it as much as possible as it\u0027s so slow.\n\nAlso, besides the benefits to overall rendered appearance due to everything being calculated based on HP smooth curves and lines, there\u0027s another thing I do where I really like the effect. As you know, one of the subtle features of CG that makes people go \u0022oh that\u0027s CG\u0022 without knowing exactly why is the infinitely-sharp edges everywhere. Neither nature nor humans like sharp edges, they don\u0027t exist without specific work to make them sharp and even then they\u0027re never as sharp as a modeler makes them. Your brain notices immediately when edge reflections are missing as it relies heavily on rounded reflective edges to establish the 3d shape of things it sees. That\u0027s always bugged me, but just recently you see real attempts to address it, both SP and Mental Ray have some parameters for edge rounding now but (IMO) neither work really well yet.\n\nWhat I do is after I have my HP/LP pair, I copy the HP and hide one to maintain as the original HP. Then I take my HP copy and spin through the elements and chamfer as many edges as possible, this is one place where MAX still has bugs that I remember being in their 1994 release. Hopefully that\u0027s one thing Blender does better. As long as I\u0027m not hitting MAX bugs, this only takes maybe 15-30min on models of the complexity you\u0027re dealing with.\n\nThen I use the chamfered-edge version as the HP when I bake the normal and other maps in SP. All of those now nicely and subtly-rounded edges will be captured correctly in the baked maps and when you render your model and see it you\u0027ll definitely make some sort of happy sound, you will notice the effect immediately.\n\n(I just know I\u0027ll check back in three days and he\u0027ll have invented his own Blender scriptlet macro thingy, redone all his models, and will be adding that to his shader distro)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-04T07:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2017 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-10a","CreatedById":176203,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T08:12:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ~snip~\n\u003E \n\nEither that, or he\u0027ll somehow work out how to git push realtime changes in his models w/ said blender addon. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T21:55:26Z","Content":"Quick bug (maybe) report, recoloring UI doesn\u0027t seem to work for the SSTU - SC-GEN - PDC - Custom Decoupler.

Anyway, at least I can\u0027t get recolor to change anything on that decoupler, ditto the probe core. And it seems that certain texture choices disable recoloring, like when I have the magic fuel tank set to have a gold round dome nose, I can no longer recolor that section. Not exactly a critical issue but if at some point you find yourself looking at it, a pass through all the cases looking for ones where either the recolor button shouldn\u0027t be available on the UI, or available but with some options grayed out, would probably be a useful UI consistency activity."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-05T15:42:38Z","Content":"![V4WlpeP.png](https://i.imgur.com/V4WlpeP.png)\n\nSpent a bit of time yesterday playing  with Substance Designer, created a (crude) radial heat-shield material and a \u0027space tape\u0027 material for the Apollo CM.  Bit more cleanup to do, finishing off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, adding some slight dust/noise to the entire thing, and doing the details on the inside of the parachute cap.  Not fully satisfied with the heat shield texture, but it is about as close as I can get it without crazy texture resolutions.\n\nUnfortunately looks like I won\u0027t have the PBR texture testing pack until next weekend; still quite a bit of work to do to finish up the rest of the Apollo/Saturn parts.  I was going to do just some quick conversions on them, but figured that if I\u0027m going to spend time working on them I had better do them properly or at least make sure what I do can contribute to the finished textures.\n\nAlso realized that there is a fairly easy way for me to convert the existing \u0027recolorable\u0027 textures to use the PBR setup by simply adding in some metallic maps (and/or metallic slider to the GUI).

All that I\u0027ve done on these examples was to add a metallic-map to the existing specular textures, and do pretty much a direct port of the recoloring shader to use the Standard shader lighting functions.\n\nNot much difference in the painted textures.  The fuel line is marked metallic, everything else as non-metallic.\n\n![puxzd46.png](https://i.imgur.com/puxzd46.png)\n\n(not shown are the orange foam, but there will be little/no difference on those)\n\nIt is the silver and gold (metallic) textures where the largest differences will be seen.

All it takes is a adding a metallic mask to the alpha channel in the existing specular textures, and a small patch to switch to the new shader.  The textures will likely be changed in-place (so the default-shipping textures will include the metallic masks), while the shaders will be swapped over with the rest of the SSTU-PBR expansion pack.  These would be separate from any additional new PBR/more realistic textures that I create for parts, which will likely not be recolorable.\n\nEdit:  \n\nComparison vs. existing recoloring shaders.  PBR are on the outside, current shaders on the inside.\n\n![EwuOlBQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/EwuOlBQ.png)\n\nOverall I\u0027m quite pleased with the quick conversions.  Some noticeable differences in the painted/foam textures that I was not expecting but still very usable (and easily fixed through a patch adjusting the colors).  Really want to find a way to expose the metallic value as a slider in the recoloring GUI... but that might go into the \u0027long term plans\u0027 as it would would be very difficult to adapt the current setup for it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-05T18:06:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2017 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-05T17:33:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also realized that there is a fairly easy way for me to convert the existing \u0027recolorable\u0027 textures to use the PBR setup by simply adding in some metallic maps (and/or metallic slider to the GUI).

Seriously, they couldn\u0027t take an oversize/overthickness piece of the metal mesh and completely embed it in the resin with zero voids and then machine the whole thing to shape/size? Or use fiberglass layers between thick layers of resin stretched over a form, make it over-thick, bake it, then machine down the outside.

But I\u0027ve been doing paying graphics work off and on since the early 90s so I\u0027ve been calibrating for a while. The point wasn\u0027t that the color in the video is exactly right, but that the color was clearly not the honey-milk chocolate color he tried, which is much closer to Orion\u0027s. To me it looks like it started out as a red-orange and has faded over time in most of the samples I saw to a more yellow color except for the one I posted above.\n\nAnd I\u0027ve been involved in aviation history and military history in general forever (but for the life of me I can\u0027t figure out the purpose of the KSP weapons mods) and can\u0027t begin to count the pitched duels I\u0027ve fought over colors of things over the years ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) In the end though I think it\u0027s irrelevant here and I\u0027ve told him twice he\u0027s done already, but since he is going to extreme lengths - tape, metal mesh (you don\u0027t want to know how tricky that was), etc., it seems he\u0027s fairly serious about getting as close as he can with the showcase for his new spiffy PBR shader.

Ok, it\u0027s just slightly possible this naming convention was created by an engineer, I especially like the dashes with or without spaces to indicate group or specific object variant. Anyway, at least I can\u0027t get recolor to change anything on that decoupler, ditto the probe core. And it seems that certain texture choices disable recoloring, like when I have the magic fuel tank set to have a gold round dome nose, I can no longer recolor that section. Not exactly a critical issue but if at some point you find yourself looking at it, a pass through all the cases looking for ones where either the recolor button shouldn\u0027t be available on the UI, or available but with some options grayed out, would probably be a useful UI consistency activity.\n\u003E \n\nHmm...  I\u0027ll have to take a look at the decoupler / probe cores.  Certainly remember being able to recolor them just fine.  Probably going to be getting all new textures here before too long (procedural substance).\n\nAs to the GUI -- would be very time consuming to setup.  Currently the GUI has no knowledge of what a texture set is, or what texture set is on a part, or if the texture set supports recoloring/# of channels.  Texture sets have no knowledge of what shader they use, and thus cannot be aware of what recolor channels they support (or if they even support recoloring).  It was about the only way to structure things to allow for the entire system to be used with arbitrary shaders.  If I start making the GUI\u0027s /etc shader-aware... then they will only ever work with the specific shaders that they are hard-coded to work with (or perhaps a config-defined list).  Would also require additions/changes to every texture-set definition in order to track if it supports recoloring, and what channels it supports.  Certainly could be done, but is many hours of code-side work, and even more on the config end of things. \n\nI suppose the (*best/better)* time to address all of this would be -before- I release it all as a stand alone mod.  A few other UI\u002Bshader level feature improvements that I\u0027d like to make as well, such as including the MET channel as user-configurable.  My hesitance so far would be that it would (most likely) be be craft/vessel/save game breaking if I make the changes -- will require that additional data be stored for each recolorable segment.  Currently a single Vector4 / Color value is stored per-section; adding in the MET control will require that additional values be stored to represent that data.\n\nI guess I\u0027ll start writing up the development docs on it and start figuring out how bad the breakage will be.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is not a realism mod, I don\u0027t think we should get so uptight as to have calibrated colors etc. Just thinkg recoloring tool for the heatshield ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nWell, the heat-shields won\u0027t be supporting recoloring (don\u0027t currently, no plans to add that in).  The material I created supports easily changing of the color, so its really as simple as specifying a base color value.  But I\u0027m also not that concerned with 100% color accuracy, and think that I like the current color scheme.

The main two that I\u0027m aware of are \u0027subsurface division\u0027 (adds tons of edge loops to meshes, adding smoothing to low-poly meshes), and \u0027simplify\u0027 (which takes a high poly mesh and just makes a terrible mess out of it).  There is certainly nothing that would let me adjust the # of sides on a cylinder or anything like that -- the geometry is whatever you specified when it was initially created.  It does have a few non-mesh based tools that are similar to what you describe (bezier-curve based geometries), but as soon as you convert them to a mesh (e.g. to unwrap, or join with existing mesh), it becomes \u0027static\u0027 and can no longer be adjusted procedurally.\n\nPerhaps this is something that I\u0027ll investigate in the distant future, but I\u0027m in no rush to do it now (unless someone has some accessible docs on how it is all supposed to work in Blender; and even then, it had better be dead simple to implement)."},{"CreatedByName":"atomontage","CreatedById":153524,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-07T19:53:30Z","Content":"Found an easy-to-fix bug.
