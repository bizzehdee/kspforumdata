One of the ideas is a replacement to the stock Part Test contracts. I\u0027d like to throw it out to the community and gather some ideas about what might make for a better experience around part testing contracts.\n\nIf I decide to go ahead with this contract pack it would need to:\n\n1. Offer a different enough experience from the stock Part Test. I\u0027m not looking to write \u0022part testing, but no launch clamps on the Mun\u0022.\n2. Have a progression in the contracts from early/mid-game/late-game. Using my [tourism contract pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113621-0-90-Contract-Pack-Tourism-v1-0-0-2015-03-21) as an example, it starts with a single contract to bring one dude to orbit, moves to bringing multiple Kerbals to orbit, then to the Mun, then building orbital attractions, etc.\n3. Have a specific purpose in mind. I don\u0027t know what this purpose should be, and I\u0027m open to idea. Is it a way to fund you space program. Is in a pre-requisite to unlock parts (ie. the reward of part testing is getting access to more parts). Something else?\n\nA few random ideas that I already have (nothing set in stone though):\n\n1. Multi-part test contracts for one manufacturer. Test a bunch of parts for Kerbodyne.\n2. Multi-situation contracts. Have one vessel go test a part in flight and landed in a certain biome, for example.\n3. (From Invader Myk in [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112300)) Part testing is a *pre-requisite* to unlocking the part for normal use.\n4. Internally track a sort of \u0022reputation\u0022 with specific part manufacturers. Testing more parts for that manufacturers gives a benefit (cheaper parts, maybe?).\n\nRight now this is just a brainstorming session... nothing is off the table. If you have complaints about the stock part testing contracts, feel free to voice those as well - that\u0027ll help me avoid repeating the same mistakes. So what do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T20:21:11Z","Content":"Self-bump, as I had the mods move this to a move appropriate forum for me.
