Any versions located in this thread can be considered incomplete and likely to change, and I personally would advise against using them in any important save you might have. \n\nThe upcoming release (v0.24) now includes a multi-node heatsink which could use some rigorous testing. To get around the inability to properly stack things below a part with multiple mounts, the heatsink has it\u0027s own interstage fairing to which 2.5m parts (or whatever you care to stick on it) can attach. It functions like any engine fairing and will automatically show up when you connect something to the bottom node. The height is fixed and designed for the LV-N.\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 800]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]![KlrGDnU.png](http://i.imgur.com/KlrGDnU.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![7rJAULS.png](http://i.imgur.com/7rJAULS.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![VqVkvWC.png](http://i.imgur.com/VqVkvWC.png)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThis version also contains a fix for the funky radiator panel animation, and should correct the snapping during retracting. \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/49l9gl9by6m11px/HeatManagement024ALPHADEV.zip?dl=0\n\nVersion 0.24 Alpha - DOWNLOAD - Not compatible with previous zip, will break saves.\n\nTo-Do:\n\n1. Create 3.75 multi-node heatsink (4? 6? 8? Would like some input on this) - Done 5/29, 4 nodes was max\n2. Optimize memory load (call up a single texture instead of having multiple copies) - Done 5/29\n\nKnown Issues: ?\n\nGo forth and break things!

I\u0027d like to keep them structurally identical so the new models can be dropped in at some point without causing detonations all throughout the kerbol system as people load their save games. Since most heatsinks I\u0027ve looked at have a fin design as opposed to coils, I\u0027ve come up with this (This render is actually a poor representation):\n\n![7qBWPW8.png](http://i.imgur.com/7qBWPW8.png)\n\nIt looks slightly more impressive in-game. I can\u0027t decide how I feel about the look, but using fins has allowed me to create a much cooler emissive animation. So, what I\u0027m looking for at this point is feedback on the design itself. I know they function (though if you\u0027re feeling brave you can replace one of the heatsinks with the new model with a little .cfg edit and see if your ship blows up.

The Interstage Decouplers are different, however. I imagine these are unlikely to be on any active ships beyond ascent, but if you do have them on an active ship, they may cause destruction. Radiator panels now have an active mode that is not quite as effective as an AHMS unit (or Nertea\u0027s panels, though they function on a slightly different mechanic), meant to provide a compromise solution to heat dissipation without requiring the massive electrical requirements of the AHMS. Using a Heatsink with Radiator panels is heavier but essentially free, whereas using an AHMS is lighter but you must power the unit. AHMS units have had their power draw tweaked as well.\n\nYou will need to delete any existing version of Heat Management to use the beta version: [**DOWNLOAD**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s8em0cwferkcko0/HeatManagement025BETA.zip?dl=0)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please consider adding some simple MK2 parts and some atmosphere-capable radiators.
