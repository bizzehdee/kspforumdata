So, my suggestion is to go for simple at first. If that\u0027s completed and you still want to add more functionality/depth, then, by all means add extra features like specific gear, or specific requirements like HDDs, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"secretformula","CreatedById":97647,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T17:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is currently the plan, I hope to have something minimally usable along with an API posted in the next few days.

That makes it easy for the user to choose whether the plugin is active on any given ship. I can\u0027t really see how splitting it into multiple parts would add to the fun. Perhaps something to revisit when budgets are added to the game, but personally if I\u0027m going to add some scripting to my craft I\u0027d rather not have to deal with artificial limitations like program size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me it will allow for events, instead of just always running in a loop, preferably with a timer event that runs off of game time rather than real time :-) Oh, and a \u0022computer reset\u0022 event for quickloads, unless you go so far as to save the program and state in the quicksave file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d think keep it to a single, potentially upgradeable part. Have the part limits specified in the .cfg file, possibly overridden by tweakables. Keep it simple, because as was said, I don\u0027t see where complicating the installation of the device would add much in this case. It\u0027s about being able to preprogram maneuvers, not computer maintenance. Not sure if CPU speed limitations could be easily enforced, that would probably depend on the interpreter in question. Memory limits could probably be enforced and optionally upgradeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll probably want to implement some sort of loadable modules (preferably with the ability to unload a module, though that gets tricky) so that you don\u0027t need the entire program in a single file, though that would be an acceptable limitation if it isn\u0027t easy to implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it occurs to me I\u0027m giving you suggestions you didn\u0027t ask for, so I\u0027ll shut up for now :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaius","CreatedById":66495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T01:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of doing something like this, but I was overcome by procrastination and excessive laziness.
