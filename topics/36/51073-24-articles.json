What I do is fly a craft in, and drop off several passive probes in various orbits. The probes are simple, I start with a small tr-2v stack decoupler, a small okto2 control pod, stack a battery and a couple of pb-nuk\u0027s on that, then a small girder segment that I can hang the scan antennae onto, as well as some optional science modules and a transmission antenna or two... The transmission antennas and science modules depend on the purpose of the mission, once I have exhausted the science, I start leaving the science gear off. These passive probes are lightweight, and they stack, so I can carry a lot of them. My Jool mission has 8 probe laden rockets, each with three drop-off probes, as well as a full set of science and SCANsat antennae on the main body of the craft. Essentially I carried more craft than I have objects to scan, so that I can have some mishaps without having to start the mission over. The probe craft doubled as final stage boosters, as this is a heavy ship, and I refueled them as I use them from the mothership tanks. My tentative plan is to see if I can take any leftovers from that mission, and see if I can budget the DV\u0027s to visit Eeloo with a probe craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MainSailor","CreatedById":74050,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T04:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022keoki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022keoki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a quick question...
