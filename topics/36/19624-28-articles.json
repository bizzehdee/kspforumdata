You are now fully authorized to make your own mods and trying to simultaneously deal with the people in your own thread yelling at you, making new content for the people yelling at you, finding time to update the mods that you are not working on anymore, and also make a living while doing all of this. Since you obviously have a much stronger constitution towards such people, and have such superior time management to balance absolutely everything in your life perfectly, I would like to be the first to extend my hand to the new modder in the community and look forward to your fabulous work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook, there is no problem with people asking how to do things. Not everyone has had the time and the practice making small changes, understanding code structure, etc. that is necessary to make adjustments themselves. But what is frankly not ok are people that want modding to be a black box package to the point where such a tiny fix is SUCH a hassle to themselves that it becomes something worth complaining about. This is not a major bug that makes it unplayable without major revision, this is a grand total of 13 characters (15 if you count the spaces in scale = 1) that you have to type in to a file you can open in word pad (basically no special software needed). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a black-box experience where everything will be just perfect and the developer is accountable for keeping things up to date and functioning perfectly, play stock. They get paid for this. Bobcat does this in his free time because he wants to. He has absolutely 0 obligation to do anything for anyone. He could totally close Bobcat Ind. as he has in the past, and then we would all be sunk. So just make the changes! In the time it took you to make that post you could have fixed all of the rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to re-iterate, they can all be fixed with the following adjustments to the config file. LITERALLY just open the .cfg in the part\u0027s folder, and type in the following things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Add \u0022PART {\u0022 to the very beginning of the file without the quotation marks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

There is also HOME2 and of course behind the scenes things, such as real life. He said that he needs a rest so we will just have to be patient.
