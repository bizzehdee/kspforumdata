Reducing curvature also reduces the normal-force on the craft as it curves up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Your craft will experience less drag. At 4600 meters, the atmosphere is less than 40% as dense as at sea-level. This will help with your vessels not tearing themselves apart from atmospheric drag during the acceleration, allow them to accelerate more quickly on the ramp, and not lose as much of their hard-earned velocity immediately upon leaving the mass drive if they greatly exceed terminal-velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) If you build a shorter, constant-slope launch ramp, you may be able to fire rocket engines while still on the ramp; to achieve greater velocity by the end of the ramp. At higher altitude, your rocket engines will get better ISP doing this (and eventually when Squad changes atmosphere curves to be variable-thrust as promised, and like in real life- better thrust instead of ISP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) The obvious benefit of having less altitude to climb before you\u0027re out of the atmosphere.
