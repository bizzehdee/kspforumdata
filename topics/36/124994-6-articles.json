I set the waypoint for the island waypoint not to hide on completion though, and haven\u0027t been able to reproduce this. What I was able to reproduce was a new bug I discovered, in that if you have multiple GAP contracts active, since I am using the same vessel definition, landings at KSC runway are not recognized and you can\u0027t finish contracts. I will fix this by ensuring all contracts of unique craft names for vessel definitions going forward. I assume this will fix any residual issues with IslandLanding as well since before today it was not in a vessel parameter group. I will be adding vessel parameter groups to this contract.
