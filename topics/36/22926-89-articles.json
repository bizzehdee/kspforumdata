Again, there could be a part that is just the door, where the top of the 2x1/4x2 section is a standard one-third length, with the rear face angling down towards the \u0027base\u0027 of the hull section, leaving enough length at the bottom for hinges and whatnot. As seen from the side, the part would have an \u0027undercut\u0027 angled rear face, get it? Then as a separate part, there could be a \u0027hangar\u0027 section like you mentioned, all it would need to be is a 2x1/4x2 hollow hull section, a tube with no ends. Like the \u0027engine fairing\u0027 parts, but with all solid walls. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I hope this is making sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your \u0027hangar door\u0027 idea, that is intriguing. Maybe it could be like an \u0027upside down\u0027 version of my idea, with the longer hull face being on the \u0027bottom\u0027, and with a different door design instead of a ramp. So the cargo ramp version is angled like this, /, as seen from the LEFT side of the part, and the hangar door is angled like this, \\. Then the hollow tube \u0027hangar/cargo bay is universal. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Those \u0027angles\u0027 aren\u0027t to scale, btw, it\u0027s just the \u0027slash\u0027 characters I\u0027m using, you understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I figure there could be 2x1 versions of both for small rovers/ships to drive/fly in \u0026amp; out, 4x2 sizes (which is kind of what I really need myself, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) for larger craft, and then maybe even 2x2 and 4x4 versions for the sake of completion.

The first two there is an over hang with a slightly smaller door that fits flush to the inside of the \u0022jamb\u0022 at a 90 degree angle. I think that I like this design quite a bit for a hanger bay, I am envisioning the door to deploy and then the docking lights from the LLL pack to deploy after that from inside the door, to add to the landing lights on the door. This all said, I am going to have to beg Lack to help me with the skins taking his and purposing them for similar designs is easy, this.... not so much... this needs the artist himself.

I have tried to think of exactly how to make this work but I have not figured it out just yet but the part is setup to actually make it happen when I figure it out. I am not done, I want to add locks to it or something... I am not exactly sure what but I feel it could use something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ug63yfn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ug63yfn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis patterned after the reactor containment building from this rather new nuclear reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Clinton_power_station_1.jpg/1920px-Clinton_power_station_1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221920px-Clinton_power_station_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have actually created some parts just using the simple 2x1 hull, but I wanted to be able to differentiate between the reactor, generator, etc... I am thinking the generator will have a sign that warns about high voltage, or electromagnetic fields, or something... what do you guys think? My first idea is to make this two seperate parts that fit together somehow with like a docking port... but I am not sure if that will work because the way KSPI works is the generator has to touch the reactor and if I make the middle piece the reactor then the part around it wont be the generator ... and I think that they HAVE to be connected via stack nodes. NOT surface nodes which makes it even more difficult. I may talk to the guys over at KSPI about it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, added some to the ramp, it still needs a little bit of tweaking BUT its almost perfect, HUGE thanks to spannermonkey who helped me with the animation part and redoing a few of the piston parts. You will see that the ramp double folds on the second one. This will be good for smaller tires, and also for larger landing gear. Unfortunatly if the gear clip through the cargo hold it causes problems but I don\u0027t know a work around for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wFNS4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
