I debated submitting it to the Add-on Releases forum but I decided I\u0027d like to try to get some feedback and make sure it\u0027s really solid before doing an official release. So please give it a try and let me know what you think, thanks!\n\n**Download links:**\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center][**Github**](https://github.com/wpatter6/KerbalFeels)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center][**KerbalStuff**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/672/Kerbal%20Feels)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nTo install, unzip the \u0022KerbalFeels 0.1.0.zip\u0022 file and copy the KerbalFeels folder into the ksp GameData folder.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n- Determines and tracks personal relationships between the kerbals in your space program, based on existing courage/stupidity stats and RNG.\n- Different relationships can affect the stats of the kerbals during missions together.\n- Tracks a kerbal\u0027s sanity as it deteriorates over periods of time.\n- Extreme lack of sanity can result in kerbal suicide, or combined with negative feelings can result in murder.\n- If other kerbals witness the murder, their feelings towards the murderer and the victim will dictate the fate of the killer, whether he is jailed (missing), released (life goes on), or if they exercise capital punishment (c\u0027est la vie)\n- When a kerbal dies for any reason, surviving kerbals will get a loss or boost to courage if they had positive or negative feelings towards the victim.\n- GUI Toolbar icon (heart shaped) for easily seeing the relationships between kerbals in any game screen.\n\n![rouICBk.png](http://i.imgur.com/rouICBk.png)\n\n![vUQ5Me4.png](http://i.imgur.com/vUQ5Me4.png)\n\n![78Is9Pp.png](http://i.imgur.com/78Is9Pp.png)\n\n**Opinions \u0026 Feelings:** When kerbals spend time together on missions, they will gain or lose a value which represents their *opinion* of the other kerbals in the ship. Once this number passes a certain threshold, positive or negative, they will randomly gain one of three *feelings* towards that kerbal. Feelings towards other kerbals on the ship will impact the kerbal\u0027s stats. Positive feelings will give \u002B1 experience level, and negative feelings will get -1 experience level.\n\nThe positive feelings are:\n\n- Playful: *raises stupidity*\n- Inspired: *lowers stupidity*\n- In Love: *raises stupidity \u0026 courage*\n\nand the negative feelings:\n\n- Annoyed: *raises stupidity*\n- Scared: *lowers courage*\n- Hateful: *raises stupidity and courage*\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*\n\n**Sanity** \n\n- During missions, sanity will slowly deteriorate over time. There are ways to control how quickly it goes, based on how the the feelings towards other members of the ship. Also various events (fly by, orbit, landing) will trigger a static restoration of sanity.\n- Lower sanity will cause a kerbal\u0027s feelings towards other crew members to become more erratic. If sanity at any time drops below a certain threshold, they will periodically have a small chance to commit suicide, as well as if there are kerbals they have negative feelings towards on the ship, murder.\n\n**Currently** my testing shows that it takes between 15-30 days together on a ship before kerbals will begin to have non-indifferent feelings towards each other. A pair of kerbals orbiting Kerbin together will lose most of their sanity after about 80-150 days (depending on their feelings towards each other), and at that point you will need to start worrying about suicide/murder. However, doing things like flyby or landing on another planet or moon, or achieving progress nodes will restore a portion of their sanity, which can be a saving grace for a long journey to another planet.\n\n- There are several settings in the GameData\\KerbalFeels\\Plugins\\PluginData\\KerbalFeels\\KF\\_constants.cfg that can be played with if you like, and the data for each kerbal is stored within the \u0022FEELS\u0022 node inside the game save file, if you want to modify directly how specific kerbals feel towards each other.\n\n**To do:**\n\n- Parts  \n\n    - \u0022Brain scan\u0022 science module will be a core part similar to MechJeb, which upgrades as certain science nodes are reached, and causes more useful information and alerts to become available to the user based on how advanced they are. Will also give science points by performing a brain scan on the crew, and possibly give more science the lower the average sanity of the crew is.\n    - Recreational/athletic parts for ships \u0026 space stations will reduce sanity loss and improve sanity recovery.\n\n    [\\*]Feelings towards other kerbals impact how much xp is gained from a mission\n\n    [\\*]Tweaks to constant variables and/or calculations after more testing \u0026 feedback\n\n**License:**\n\nCopyright \u00A9 2015, wpatter6\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0022AS IS\u0022, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Maybe these could be less common than \u0027regular\u0027 kerbals, I can imagine introverted ones would be very useful for long term postings.\n\nThose recreational parts sound like they\u0027ll be important.

At the very least they would have to leave the program 100% of the time. Whatever happens afterwards is not relevant, but a reputation hit could be a thing. Only if you absolutely want Kerbals to murder eachother.\n- I would tone it down quite a lot, and if you can, instead of murder, you could have a scuffle in which one of the kerbals permanently loses a little of their experience or a bit of their stats (instead of temporarily if working with an unlikeable Kerbal) . Death just seems like a big middle finger to the player.\n- Contrary to murder I think suicide absolutely fine because it\u0027s a lot more realistic considering what NASA planned if the Eagle got stuck on the Moon. Prolonged periods of time alone for with little hope of rescue (I don\u0027t know what variables would go into that) could exacerbate low mood.\n- Are you using KerbalStats? I don\u0027t know much about it but it seems like something you could you with this.\n- With all of this in mind I would strongly recommend joining forces with someone who\u0027s already developing any kind of sanity mod. There have been a few ideas and WIPs already like KerbSocial, KSP Sanity and probably other\u0027s I haven\u0027t noticed yet. There\u0027s really no sense reinventing the wheel. I see codepoet already suggested a collaboration. Please seek out all other modders who want to do something similar and just do one big awesome mod.\n\nSome more ideas for later:\n\n- Increase sanity with therapy; Some Kerbals could be psychologists.\n- Some mechanic for resolving social tension or at least decreasing it.\n- If stats are what decide relationships, then have a way of improving stats.\n\nGenerally speaking I think this could be pretty cool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T13:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.

I think you\u0027re right that the rate of murder should be reduced pretty drastically, at the moment it\u0027s a pretty sure guarantee after they lose sanity that someone\u0027s going to get murdered after a little while, but I don\u0027t think I want to scrap that idea entirely. I think it can be entertaining, I mean, lots of books, tv, movies use murder as entertainment... Perhaps I could make it a setting so you can turn off murder, for someone looking for a less dramatic experience. I do plan some enhancements to that piece, I think it\u0027d potentially be fun one kerbal threw the other out of the air lock during a burn or something instead of just dying, and they could then be potentially rescued, though their sanity loss by being alone in space or on another planet until their rescue would make them a ticking time-bomb. \n\nI think you\u0027re also right that the trial system needs to be modified, perhaps the only way someone could get away scott free would be if there were no comms devices on the ship and they were the only two on board. \n\nOnce I\u0027m off of mobile I\u0027ll take a look at the Kerbal Stats mod you mention, and yeah I think the connected living spaces and some of the other ideas code poet and others have put out sound like great additions. \n\nI\u0027m pretty new to this community but I\u0027m fully open to collaboration and connecting to things that people have already put out. I probably should have done more searching than I did before diving into this project to see what was already out there so I wasn\u0027t stepping on anyone\u0027s toes (I apologize to anyone out there if I did), but I kinda just had the idea in the middle of the night and cranked it out in a few days, as is often how I get started on things of this nature.\n\nIn that regard, I could definitely use some help on getting parts modeled if there\u0027s anyone out there interested in assisting me with that. I\u0027m not the most artistic person (more of a code monkey tbh ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)), and have very little experience with modeling and texturing, so it\u0027d probably be a pretty long time before I\u0027d have enough free time to really dive into that side of things instead of just reusing stock parts. My first plan is to implement the \u0022Brain-scan\u0022 part, which would give science data, control how much information you get as well as giving notifications about the kerbal\u0027s sanity. I had a kind of funny idea on what it could look like, but as I said, this may end up being a stock part until I get the time to focus on it for a while or find some other kind soul who could make it for me. Basically it could be a circular dome-shaped dark window looking thing and when you \u0022activate\u0022 it, you would see the top of a Kerbal\u0027s head in there and it would maybe glow or do some kind of scan-like thing.\n\nI may also incorporate other parts in the future for sanity and feeling management, but I kind of wanted the sanity management to be more based on how they felt towards the other kerbals than just adding more weight to the spacecraft.\n\nAn idea I just had for a mechanic you mention for reducing social tension was maybe allowing kerbals feelings to become less negative at some steady rate until they were indifferent when the kerbals spent more time apart from each other. This way, if things were getting volatile, the player could separate the two by doing EVAs or by putting them in separated parts of the ship (I think codepoet\u0027s connected living spaces mod may help with determining that). That could create an interesting game mechanic where you\u0027d have to manage who sits with who, but couldn\u0027t leave certain people alone for risk of losing their sanity and committing suicide.\n\nModifying their stats somehow is an interesting idea, though I feel it may be outside the scope of this mod. I was kind of thinking that the way the kerbals feel towards each other (or at least liking each other) would end up really being mostly out of the players hands, since that\u0027s kind of true in reality. \n\nThanks for the input, you\u0027ve given me much to think about."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T01:14:48Z","Content":"Could you draw that brain scanner for me, and tell me more about what you want it to do, and how it should be attached, how big, etc. If I like the idea I could put something together relatively quickly.\n\nI\u0027m not too sure about the exposed/visible head."},{"CreatedByName":"wpatter6","CreatedById":140000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T01:41:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could you draw that brain scanner for me, and tell me more about what you want it to do, and how it should be attached, how big, etc. If I like the idea I could put something together relatively quickly.\n\u003E I\u0027m not too sure about the exposed/visible head.\n\nSure thing, I\u0027ll do that asap, thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"wpatter6","CreatedById":140000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:41:11Z","Content":"Ok so I was going to put it in a private message, but figured I might as well throw it out for all to see in case anyone else has any ideas for how this thing could look or behave:\n\nHere\u0027s my quick \u0026 crappy MS paint rendition: [http://i.imgur.com/MfxOIxy.png](http://i.imgur.com/MfxOIxy.png)\n\nEssentially this piece would be another science part, and activating it would work similarly to other science parts, where performing scans in different locations in the universe would give different amounts of science.

This is the problem with some of the life support mod stuff - you just need to add more parts to you ship to make the new gameplay feature go away - so all you end up with is a heaver spacecraft and a bigger rocket.\n\nGood luck with this stuff, I will be watching this thread closely. Let me know if there is anything I can help with."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T11:12:36Z","Content":"Interesting stuff. Not sure I\u0027m up for some murder either...in my idea I was toying with the idea of changing the kerbals experience stats.\n\ni\u0027m also curious to look at how your logic works for the moods and the mechanics behind it. \n\nI also had a similar idea/concept as part of my AmpYear mod I developed a KabinKraziness which affects the crew over time. Based on how cramped they were, how far from Kerbin they are and the cabin temperature. All linked into AmpYear. Which also provided KlimateKontrol, radio music, and massage chairs which for the price of electric charge reduces KabinKraziness. If the crew get to certain craziness limits they will do Krazy things like disabled the autopilot for a period of time, or dump science experiments, or resources. Or even just go on random EVA That\u0027s as far as it has got so far.. And right now if you go to AmpYear you will see I have removed it and I\u0027m in the middle of splitting it off into it\u0027s own mod seperate to AmpYear (am actually halfway through drafting an OP) and have the code [here](https://github.com/JPLRepo/KabinKraziness). \n\nI also had some threads going and have discussed with Codepoet before. I have been considering about where to take this game mechanic for a few months without trying to turn KSP, which lets\u0027s not forget is a rocket/space game, into The Sims or somewhere else where I\u0027m not sure it belongs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T11:14:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 11:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"}]}
