This is my first mod, and so be patient, it might take a while for me to get it right.\n\nThere are a lot of mods that add some form of Gas Planet 2, but none really add the original planet that NovaSilisko was planning to make. It sounds like the kind of thing that you try to add in before the game is released, so it seems that Gas Planet 2 will probably not ever happen. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) But that\u0027s okay, because now (or soon at least ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) there\u0027s a mod for it!
