Finding a module by index sounds like a bad design.\n\u003E \n\nIts common with stock modules; notably the science lab is -very- picky about module indexing.  I believe the cargo bays use indexes to mange their animations, and probably a few others that I\u0027m unaware of (I don\u0027t use stock modules much).  It was a concept found to work with stock code and and modules, so I went with it.  It is perfectly stable as long as people don\u0027t re-order modules, which they shouldn\u0027t be doing as stock code often relies on the module index.  I had -thought- that it was common knowledge/good practice to not muck with module ordering for that reason... but apparently not everyone wants to play nicely.\n\nI have a workaround in mind, but it will be a huge number of config edits in order to get it implemented, so it\u0027ll have to wait until I\u0027m back from my camping trip.  Essentially instead of referring to the module by raw-index, refer to it by the index of the module within the list of just that type of module on the part;  e.g. index=0 would refer to the first module of that type regardless of if it was actually in the Part.Modules list at index 5.  Sadly, this will require editing/updating every single part that uses that animation module (and a few other modules), which is... nearly every part at this point.\n\nEdit:\n\nWanted to make you aware that the stock ModuleSurfaceFX also references engine by raw module index;  if re-ordering of modules is necessary for the function of your mod, you may want to consider adding some special handling to the code to also patch the config nodes for any ModuleSurfaceFX to update their \u0027thrustProviderModuleIndex\u0027.  I\u0027m not aware of any other stock modules that rely on engine-module-index, so that may be the only stock module you\u0027d have to worry about.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-02T02:00:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2016 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T00:51:43Z","Content":"Sorry if I\u0027m less than helpful/precise in my reports.

I would suggest that whatever they end up holding, perhaps they start with the volume available after inflation, but, well, empty. This would require supply launches, just as a Bigelow will need a launch to get the thing up there, and more to fit it out. I\u0027m thinking in particular of the tori given the huge volumes that would need fitting out vs the collapsed sizes. Dunno if that\u0027s worthwhile or not, but It seems like there should be a cost/benefit trade between solid and inflatable. The inflatables in general, and the tori in particular are nice late-tech tree items.\n\nI would sort of like to see an ability to stop rotation.

As they are completely unrelated values; that which is listed on the part in the part list is taken from whatever is specified in the part.cfg mass = field.  The actual value used for the mass however is determined by the plugin and has zero relation to whatever is displayed in the parts list.  (On an unrelated note, I wish there were a way to make those values consistent; but the stock mass-modifier method queries for mass prior to the PartModules being initialized and as such they have no internal data and cannot modify it at that point as they should)\n\nEither way, I\u0027ll take a look at it today/tonight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 minutes ago, Domfluff said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, SSTU-ST-DOS-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E shows up fine when it\u0027s launched, and in the right click menu in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E parts list, but the part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E isn\u0027t showing the resources correctly, which is a bit odd.\n\u003E \n\nNote that you need to patch SSTUVolumeContainer module to add the resources to its approved list and to modify its default resource ratio.

I would suggest that whatever they end up holding, perhaps they start with the volume available after inflation, but, well, empty. This would require supply launches, just as a Bigelow will need a launch to get the thing up there, and more to fit it out. I\u0027m thinking in particular of the tori given the huge volumes that would need fitting out vs the collapsed sizes. Dunno if that\u0027s worthwhile or not, but It seems like there should be a cost/benefit trade between solid and inflatable.
