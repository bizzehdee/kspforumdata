Moddeling is not the problem for me, I can use some products from autodesk. But I have no expierience with programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make a set of cubic rooms and connectors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make an UI like the B9 wings have. You can change length in 1 meter steps and wide in 2 meter steps. Select differnt doors and interior layouts. The doors can be opened and closed from inside the ship, so the mod should be ready for advanced IVA solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone can make good interior stations, that fit into the rooms, you are able to make very costume room layouts. Finally this should enable you to make space stations with floors and rooms (not the ISS style). I want to use this for an extreme big shuttle with a lot of inside volume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ask for someone, who can explain me, how to make this procedural. I could make all possible models, that could be choosen with a UI. But maybe this is very ressource consuming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf some of you are interessested in working with me on this mod, contact me. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T01:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to do something similar (the procedural part that is) and am looking at the Tweakscale code. It looks like Scale.cs has the size change stuff using part.transform.Getchild(0).localScale though I haven\u0027t been able to get it to work yet. The node position and size code also appears to be there. I did find the meshes using part.GetComponentsInChildren\u0026lt;MeshFilter\u0026gt; and changing the veritex array does work though I\u0027d rather not have to modify the mesh its self. If your just getting into plugins the most frustrating part is the lack of documentation on where things are hidden - best thing I\u0027ve found is looking at others code. Good luck with this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T02:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Mihara has already solved the coding problem for you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/79715-0242-jsipartutilities-a-mishmash-of-clever-things-to-do-with-parts/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/79715-0242-jsipartutilities-a-mishmash-of-clever-things-to-do-with-parts/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows you to switch components on and off, so you could put all of the different versions of a part into one .mu and use the plugin to enable and disable them by right click in the vab. \u00A0 Mihara\u0027s documentation is very good :\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Mihara/PartUtilities/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Mihara/PartUtilities/wiki\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0Though... the last couple of posts indicate there may be some issues? \u00A0I would download the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/85645-102-exploration-rover-system-by-aset-090515/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/85645-102-exploration-rover-system-by-aset-090515/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0rover, both because it\u0027s awesome, and it will show you A, if the part utilities plugin is working right, and B, if so how to configure it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
