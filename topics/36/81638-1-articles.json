Surface EVA suits would make the kerbonaut heavier, just like Apollo EVAs, to facilitate walking in low-G.

I\u0027d be attaching a backpack that has a built in helmet. Since the helmet mesh is static throughout the animation cycles and can be turned off through TR, it should be a matter of properly scaling the helmet to fit the kerbal once TR takes away the helmet. The backpack would be worn through KAS. It\u0027s looking good so far on Maya, but I still need to find the kerbal model from the game to properly scale the helmet and backpack. I\u0027ll post more pics when I get that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
