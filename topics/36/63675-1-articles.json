I then took it upon myself to start making one. This idea gently formed into a grand design of new command modules and pods, all with full tech tree integration. My idea was to create modules that would, as you gain more advanced technologies, get lighter, more advanced, and maybe with a few extras on the side\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E. I do not know when I will have this project completed. Most likely I will release modules as I make them. Each one should take a while to make. There will be no guarantees on the timings. I do have school and this is just a hobby. Some of the larger and more complex ones will require a fair bit of time, but you should see some nice simple ones coming fairly soon. Pictures will be coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daemoria","CreatedById":103696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T16:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne problem with using the ,5 (unscaled) scale radius for command pods is that they are almost too small to fit Kerbals into. You need to consider instrument panels and power supplies take up some amount of interior space as well, in addition to maintaining a minimum thickness for the walls and bulkheads themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t let me stop you, creating new and interesting craft in KSP is the best part of this game, and anything people add to create more options is always awesome.

An 0.625m cockpit would actually be the perfect and most realistic size for a kerbal, assuming you\u0027re talking about something like an aircraft cockpit with a bubble canopy. Take a look at a human-piloted aircraft sometime, and note that in most small planes, it\u0027s not possible to stand up in the cockpit, you need to be seated to fit inside. They\u0027re not exactly spacious, especially on a fighter or single-seat light sports aircraft. A similar cockpit scaled to kerbal size would come in at under 625mm easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-19T21:03:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2014 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeteTimesSix","CreatedById":84082,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T00:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve been thinking the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0gsw6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
