Example; I throw a 40 part object together and add it to the sub-assembly menu. Now each time I pull the object from the sub-assembly menu I cannot make changes to that object inside the hangars. The game would treat it as a locked set of parts. If i wanted to make changes to the Item I would have to redesign it to the new spec and create another sub-assembly.

They are still all there separate part. Meaning that if you did not strut them, it will most likely wiggle and wobble. The sub-assembly system only saves parts, it doesn\u0027t make them one giant part. There is a plugin that will weld your parts together to make one part. It saves ram and cpu usage, but it has not been worked on since .21 I believe. Don\u0027t quote me on that. I haven\u0027t seen it since .21 so I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s not been worked on.
