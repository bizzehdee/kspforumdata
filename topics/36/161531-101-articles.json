But I believe it is possible to modify our existing orbital antimatter collector arrays. Van Allen belts of planets have anti-protons and anti-electrons. Some studies say there is about 10 micrograms of anti proton trapped in earth magnetic field in any given time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As particles are lost through diffusion processes, new ones aregenerated to maintain a quasi-static supply trapped in the near dipole field of the Earth\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we can collect it but not over a certain limit of efficiency. We also have about 10 miligrams of anti-electrons in the magnetic Van Allen belt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can collect these separately, confine them in magnetic confinement tanks. Another module will be required to decelerate them and prepare for combining. When they have a very low energy they are confined in a trap module. In the same environment they will form anti hydrogen but this material should be kept near 0 degrees Kelvin temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we are only going to use anti protons as we supposedly do in KSPI-e it is not advisable to use real efficiency values. But we can require a large production chain.

Can fractals wiki be updated or does it need to be cloned? The charts on the front page are very useful but could use some additional information as Northstar pointed out. I think if more information is available for the players the mod can remain fairly complex. The complexity is the reason I prefer this mod over NFT for example. It\u0027s the same reason many players go to real fuels and realism overhaul. The hard part is balancing complexity to be a valid game mechanic that feels like it matters and to allow for flexibility. If there is only a single way to assemble the components, then adding additional parts may not add to the experience but if it can be customized to function differently the complexity is a rewarding experience. At least that\u0027s my 2cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ah awesome I see the charts have been updated with the RCS thrusters and the like.
