Here are the results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding using KAS connection pipes: These pipes \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E automatically transfer Karbonite to remotely connected Karbonite fuel tanks. They \u003Cem\u003Ewill not\u003C/em\u003E automatically transfer LF/OX/MP. I suspect that they transfer Karbonite because the game engine wasn\u0027t designed to take Karbonite into account. Normally, the KAS pipes require the player to manually transfer resources via right-click and alt\u002Bright-click, so this is working as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding automatically filling MP tanks: I mounted a MP tank out on the end of a modular girder segment, so it was considered \u0022attached\u0022 to the ship, yet it had no direct connection to the Karbonite Converter, nor was it in any way stacked with the Converter. Like all MP tanks/thrusters, the game considers fuel connections to be \u0022implied\u0022 (none required). I had no issues filling this MP tank by activating the Converter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the Converter not filling LF/OX tanks that are not stacked with the Converter: The Converter has no issues filling tanks that are considered to be part of the propulsion system of a craft. In other words, if you use fuel lines to connect outboard fuel tanks to your main engine tank(s), no matter where the converter is located on the ship, it will fill any fuel tank that the game considers to be providing fuel for your main engines. In this respect end-users need to understand that fuel being consumed by engines flows \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E the arrows on the yellow fuel lines. Refueling however flows \u003Cem\u003Eagainst\u003C/em\u003E the arrows on the fuel lines. Therefore if you wish to make a fuel line connection directly from the Converter to a fuel tank, the arrows should be pointing \u003Cem\u003Etoward\u003C/em\u003E the Converter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Axel","CreatedById":64944,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T18:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterested in what\u0027s happening here. ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this thread grew very quickly into tl;dr territory, just for clarification - is this more or less going to function the way Kethane functions now?
