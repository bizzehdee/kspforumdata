I believe FAR attributes high(er) drag to objects with an unused attach node, so perhaps FAR is not shielding these extra nodes and thus creating extra drag. I did a bit of testing and found that a craft with no cargo bays will still create rather a lot of drag at relatively low AoA, so *something* else is creating drag also. A vessel with a TWR of 0.5 was barely able to crack 110m/s at 2km altitude, for instance.

I believe FAR attributes high(er) drag to objects with an unused attach node, so perhaps FAR is not shielding these extra nodes and thus creating extra drag. I did a bit of testing and found that a craft with no cargo bays will still create rather a lot of drag at relatively low AoA, so *something* else is creating drag also. A vessel with a TWR of 0.5 was barely able to crack 110m/s at 2km altitude, for instance. I don\u0027t know much about creating FAR configs so I can\u0027t really do much to actually \u003Cem\u003Ehelp\u003C/em\u003E at this point, but that behaviour doesn\u0027t feel right. \u003Cp\u003EI remember reading (perhaps mistakenly) that FAR generates drag/lift values for parts without FAR configs from the part mesh - I can\u0027t recall with any authority if it was the visual mesh or collision mesh, though - so perhaps it\u0027s mis-interpreting something in the mesh and generating abnormal drag?

Perhaps, similar to B9\u0027s use of texture switching for each part. In that respect, it would be \u0022closer\u0022 to real life in that most planes carry a significant portion of their fuel in their wings.

Having said that, I\u0027d love to see an air brake part for the MkIV that is curved to match the dorsal fuselage.
