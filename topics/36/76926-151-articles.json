Though my C# knowledge is just limited to simple console programs, so mind me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBDArmory uses raytracing to simulate the bullets (I think). Currently (I think) when the ray hits a part collider (or any collider really) the ray stops and an explosion is spawned at the point where the ray stopped. The tracers you see when you shoot a gun are lines following this ray. Basically what i think that could be done to implement this idea is instead of an explosion being spawned when the ray hits a collider two things will happen. The timer set by user from the turret\u0027s right click menu will start and the plugin will start \u0022penetration tests\u0022 on the ray. If the ray \u0027fails\u0027 the penetration test the ray stops in it\u0027s tracks and no explosion is spawned. If the ray \u0027passes\u0027 the penetration tests the ray will continue forward, with it\u0027s fuse still ticking. The timer or \u0027fuse\u0027 will determine how long the ray will live after it has penetrated an object. Once the timer or fuse is up the ray stops immediately and an explosion is spawned at the point where the ray stopped. Once the fuse or timer is up the ray will be long inside the vehicle, and the explosion would destroy all the internal components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour idea of spawning an explosion in the CoM sounds like how a HESH round should function. Multiple round types would be awesome but would make BDArmory look like Skillful (If you don\u0027t know what Skillful is, it\u0027s the original weapon mod that really made weapon mods popular). I\u0027m not saying that BDArmory looking like Skillfull is bad, it would be quite interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thesnakerox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thesnakerox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should add chaffs to distract radar-guided missiles like mavericks and AMRAAMs. In real life, chaffs are strips of metal that are dropped off the plane to reflect the radar signals in random directions and confuse the missile.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested before actually.
