I\u0027ll try removing the shadows option\n\u003E \n\nIt unified the near and far camera, which is technically a good thing.  See, they used to be seperate, which while slow and ugly (it pretty much tried to draw the screen in two passes, one for \u0022near\u0022 and one for \u0022far\u0022 things), allowed for additional \u0022distance\u0022 before shadowing would glitch.  Now we have effectively half the shadowing precision to play with, but everything else works fine and we have a good performance boost as well.\n\nWas it worth it?  I\u0027d say so but that\u0027s down to personal opinion.\n\nAnyways,\n\nBasically, KSP shadows now exist, and deal with this pretty nicely other than not being visible from orbit.  I\u0027d advise using them and avoiding scatterer shadows for now.\n\nPS:  A new release is incoming with a special \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E mode\u0022 option fior real solar system users.  That option disables scatterer shadows but grants support for extremely huge horizons (Think Jupiter).  It might just be the \u0022unofficial release\u0022 I was talking about.

To install simply extract to your KSP install.\n\n**What was changed / added since Unofficial Release 1.0?**\n\n1.) Some minor performance optimizations. It is unclear whether these will make a visible difference in FPS, but they needed to be done for code cleanup reasons, anyways.\n\n2.) An edge-case bug where covering the front of the Cupola viewing module would result in it still being transparent (a nearclip issue, essentially) has been fixed.  (btw, that\u0027s some insanely thorough bugtesting, my dudes.  Who does that?)\n\nIf you aren\u0027t experiencing any of the above bugs or performance issues, this is a fairly minor release and you can most likely skip it.\n\nThank you all and enjoy!\n\n-RTB\n\n**Links:**\n\n**Github:**\n\n[https://github.com/R-T-B/Scatterer/releases](https://github.com/R-T-B/Scatterer/releases)\n\n**My Server:**\n\n[http://glacialsoftware.net/ScattererBuilds/](http://glacialsoftware.net/ScattererBuilds/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-28T02:02:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2020 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"RagingNerd","CreatedById":203357,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-28T07:42:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Where is the bug?

This was fine once upon a time with dual cameras, aparently, but now results in strange effects as the two drawing ranges collide (ever seen cloud outlines in your smoke plume for example?  It\u0027s not exactly realistic).  In EngineLightRelits case, the engines light up the atmospheres of planets literally up in the hundreds of km range away due to a drawing layer conflict.\n\nI\u0027m working on pull requests for the affected mods but for right now this just serves as a heads up that those aren\u0027t working perfectly with the new scatterer.\n\nEDIT:  Maybe we don\u0027t even need pull requests on the affected mods, maybe I work around this.  We\u0027ll see.\n\nOh, and also there are also mixed reports that an optimization in 1.1 may have broken \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E mode (for real solar system users).

That and its armor really isnt that great anymore since i just 1 shotted one of these in a skirmish between it and a Dimension class cruiser (which fired a single G series torpedo and instakilled it with a direct hit to center of mass).\n\n![a2XRMPK.png](https://imgur.com/a2XRMPK.png)\n\n![PtLeRL5.png](https://imgur.com/PtLeRL5.png)\n\nAnd the Broadsword mark5, completely new ship despite sharing the same name (it does technically serve the same role).  Better range, and like way better with 3500dV on the special ER model which can go to laythe on internal fuel alone without any aerobraking required even if id still do it to save fuel (base model gets ~2000 or so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E).  Better armor layout, less suceptible to 1 shots (albeit it is still possible if i hit it with the G7f or G9 series from a very specific angle, but even then not guaranteed), comparable protection from SRMs which are like the most common weapon used in my universe by any faction/tech level (ibeam\u002Bsepatron missiles) as well as complete immunity to weak crap like macey dean style torps (ant\u002Boscar\u002B2 docking port torpedoes).  Honestly, the only genuine problems with it is its excessive weight (over 120t on ER model, ~80 for the normal 1), and its lack of ammo capacity (6 anti-ship grade weapons, 4 anti-fighter defensive weapons) not to mention the fact that all its weapons are mounted in the nose of the ship making it possible to disable all its weapons with 1 shot (ive never actually pulled this off in testing but it could be done with good aim and the right ordinance).\n\nBut yeah, part count went from 350 to like 220 (not quite half, but its noticeably less laggy when nearby other vessels).  That and the new one looks a bit prettier (old one was more or less a shell with guns strapped ontop of it, new one looks and feels more like a genuine warship and not some half baked structiral brick with guns starpped onto it).\n\nAnd ofc with scatterer, eve (currently using spectra\u0027s pack as my own needs a major overhaul and i just dont have the freetime to spend modding these last few months), and ofc sunflare from another mod (i just really hate the default scatterer sunflare, its not that its that bad, but just doesnt scream sci-fi universe and tries to be way to close to something you might see irl not to mention pure white is meh looking for a sun)."},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-28T16:33:50Z","Content":"**Unofficial Release 1.2 just dropped:**\n\n**This is a minor bugfix update to the 1.0 unofficial 1.9 release series of Scatterer.
