Even today, astronomers hold some resentment towards it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRuk: Generally similar to tylo, but even bigger (1.1 g at the surface). Contains a large amount of ore, minerals, and metals due to asteroid impacts, but if you aren\u0027t ready to deal with such a big planet, you could always stick to its moons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDescription: \u0022A big, rocky planet. After its discovery, several days were spent trying to get a picture of it and tylo in the same room, before the realization that planets would not fit inside of rooms. It seems to eat asteroids.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRuk\u0027s moons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuro: a captured asteroid made mostly from heavy metals, meaning it has a lot of GOLD! Also some lead, and some platinum-group metals, and some uranium, and so on.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Despite its small radius, Auro has a fairly high gravity. Scientists predict that it is made primarily out of heavy metals, some of them extremely shiny\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerro: A captured asteroid based on 16 Psyche: the wandering core of a destroyed protoplanet. 90% nickel-iron. Mineable refined metals. With kerbal health, it has a strong magnetosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022This asteroid is made almost exclusively of nickel-iron, with an extremely strong magnetic field. It was probably once a planetary core.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVolo: A captured carbonaceous chondrite. Has a lot of ore, and with CRP has minerals, dirt, and ExoticMinerals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The lightest of Ruk\u0027s moons, Volo is mostly carbon, with large amounts of the elements most necessary for kerbal life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShelb: Weird bubbly world. Sort of eggshell textured, but with big bumps on the surface caused by gas bubbles that formed while the planet was molten. Some gaseous resources are available by mining.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022This small, smooth world has an extremely low mass for its size, creating speculation on its origin. Leading scientists agree that it solidified from a sort of cosmic bubble bath, but are still looking for the rubber ducks that would supply final confirmation of this theory\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTriinus: Covered in clouds. The surface consists of rocky pillars and plateaus sticking out of a planetwide ocean. The atmosphere is oxygenated, but the hazardous terrain and poor visibility make trying to fly there hazardous.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022An exceptionally mysterious world, Triinus is shrouded in a thick cloud layer. What could be under there? The Kerbal Astronomical Society\u0027s funds are on dinosaurs.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKobol: A world that may once have been kerbin-like, but experienced a catastrophic extinction fairly recently. The surface is a wasteland and with kerbal health the whole planet is a bit radioactive. Atmosphere is oxygenated, though, and there are a lot of resources available on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Named after the mythical Kobolds, Kobol is very Kerbin-like, with an oxygenated atmosphere and a similar gravity. Unfortunately, the surface is covered in a glassy substance, and the atmosphere is full of radiation. Oddly boxy shapes litter the surface.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSmobol: Kobol\u0027s only moon. A pink colored icy moon. Has algae growing within the ice in some biomes, which can be harvested for food or fertilizer.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The small, icy moon of Kobol, Smobol is similar to Minmus, but is expected to have more of a strawberry flavor. It has a tenuous atmosphere of carbon dioxide and oxygen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBaritune: A blue gas giant with some music-note-shaped storms.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Despite its deceptive appearance, scientists have informed us that Baritune is not made of water, nor is it some sort of secret musical message.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBaritune\u0027s moons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGralia: Innermost moon of Baritune, rocky with extensive ice deposits and some tall mountains\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DThe innermost moon of Baritune, Gralia replenishes Baritune\u2019s ring with its cryovolcanic activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalia: Covered in salt, with various small, briny seas. Has a thin atmosphere of oxygen and chlorine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DAlthough its surface is well below the freezing point of water, Halia has multiple seas of concentrated brine. Its atmosphere is thin and caustic, but nonetheless has oxygen due to subsurface chemical reactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNolia: was a fairly standard ice moon until its outer layers were stripped off by a massive collision. Mostly metals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DNolia was once an icy moon like Vall, but experienced a major collision which sent the outer layers flying into space.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRimia: very irregularly shaped moon, with\u00A0thick ice layers on the leading side of the planet, and a thinner more feathery texture on the trailing side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRimia\u2019s unusual shape leads scientists to believe that it formed quite recently when a small, rocky body passed through a cloud of water vapor and ice crystals.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhinolea:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurbin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a good idea of how world configs work, but I\u0027ll have to learn to doing when it comes to height and normal maps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has suggestions they can feel free to post them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-29T12:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2019 12:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by RocketSquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFilling in the moons of Baritune\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-29T02:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations in advance.\u00A0 It is always exciting to see someone new throw their hat into the ring.\u00A0 Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
