One has an emissive, and one has a swinging arm animation. So far, I\u0027ve gotten everything work great. The parts have colliders, they animate, and they work. \n\nFor some reason, I can\u0027t get them to highlight upon mouseover when in flight. In the VAB/SPH, it works fine, and the parts behave as expected, but once launched, they won\u0027t highlight. When you mouseover them, instead, the root part that their attached to highlights. You can right click them, and they do respond and still function. \n\nWhat parameter in Unity have I overlooked? It didn\u0027t always do this. I\u0027ve gotten it working just fine in the past. I don\u0027t know what I did before, or what I did this time that\u0027s got them all borked.\n\n![aIEppfKl.png](http://i.imgur.com/aIEppfKl.png)\n\n![WgY00Yil.png](http://i.imgur.com/WgY00Yil.png)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T20:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by curtquarquesso**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T20:27:12Z","Content":"I can\u0027t see your cursor, is this a joke?"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T20:50:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t see your cursor, is this a joke?\n\nWow. That\u0027s really irritating. I didn\u0027t notice that. I\u0027m sorry. Apparently, when I take a screenshot, the mouse hides. In all the images, the cursor is on top of the desired part. I\u0027m not sure how to demonstrate this now. I\u0027m referring to the two parts, NOT the capsule.

Definitely not. If the colliders were not present, I wouldn\u0027t be able to manipulate them in the VAB. They also interact with other objects in flight as expected. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s a hierarchy thing.\n\nHere\u0027s my hierarchy.

Using that instead of making separate childs in the heirarchy may fix the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T01:36:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gooddog15**"}]}
