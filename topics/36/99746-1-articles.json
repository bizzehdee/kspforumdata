You can tell with a little code diving, if you\u0027re so inclined: If the module uses Animation.Play, you\u0027re out of luck. If it uses Animation.Blend, you might be able to make use of it. Amination.Blend works like the .Play version for playing a single animation, but if you play another clip which animates the same things, it averages the result, rather than snapping explicitly to the keyframes of the second animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all from memory when I was playing around, and I don\u0027t have a ready made module you could use I\u0027m afraid.
