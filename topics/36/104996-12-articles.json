As best as I can tell, ISS crew don\u0027t sleep in shifts and only sleep in different parts of the station because that\u0027s where the sleeping berths could be fit in. Also, [the original plan was to have all of the crew sleep sleep in one module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyFYgeE32f0), but the end result was instead split sleeping areas. All of this is why I think the sleep habs should have a crew cap equal to their number of beds... This would allow everyone to have their personal space when not \u0022on duty\u0022 rather than being forced to float around in the gym or science lab.\n\nOn a side note, I was thinking about keeping the life support rates for the modules at around 2 Kerbals per module and maybe even none in the nodes to encourage variety in station design.\n\nFor the science labs, the 2M is definitely ~3x the size of the Mini:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ZSLkRSY.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZSLkRSY.png)\n\nThat said, for some reason I didn\u0027t see the 3 Kerbal capacity, and I was only going to make it a 4 Kerbal capacity anyway to represent the extra science racks that would be added in there for its size. The addition of the station science research module is not because the current science modules aren\u0027t working, but rather to increase functionality and reduce necessary parts for anyone who is using the station science mod (like me ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)).\n\nEDIT: On a further side note, I\u0027m also thinking about adding OKS functionality into these modules as well, though those will end up being much more complicated and I\u0027ve got no idea what would make a suitable aeroponics / agricultural module.

TaranisElsu put a ton of work into trying to balance them based on real human needs, but you can use his template to scale the reaction appropriately. I was thinking about giving each functional module (Hab, Lab, Gym) converters to support 2 Kerbals, emulating the ISS style of distributed life support systems, and also promoting variety by needing more than a single sleep hab to support its full compliment of Kerbals.\n\nAs for the science lab, I think 3 would probably be just fine as it fits with the size difference between it and the mini.

Functionally, this would end up looking like CxAero\\_SleepHabV4-1 or CxAero\\_LabMini.

Much more detailed than the general \u0022This is what the ISS has for ECLSS systems\u0022 I\u0027ve been able to find. I especially like that systems map as I spent some time looking for equipment locations to be sure that they were actually distributed around the station and not concentrated in one or two places.\n\nAs far as the masses go, if you\u0027ve already added some to account for subsystems, that works just great.\n\nRight now, I\u0027ve got a carbon extractor and a water purifier in all 5 SleepHabs, the GymHab, and both Labs. I figured the node and the airlock probably shouldn\u0027t have them as they\u0027re more secondary modules. I think I will probably leave the life support modules out of the PMM since it is really just for logistics and storage, so it should consist of a big KIS module and a similarly large service module / life support MFT tank. All of the converters are scaled to support 2 Kerbals so at a minimum, two modules will be needed to support the three crew of the NapHab and three modules will be needed to support a full 6 Kerbal crew."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T04:56:17Z","Content":"I\u0027d say only have water purifiers in the labs and gym. you can consider the sleeping modules to instead have temp/humidity controls."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T05:18:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, cxg2827 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d say only have water purifiers in the labs and gym. you can consider the sleeping modules to instead have temp/humidity controls.\n\u003E \n\nI think the water purifiers in the sleeping modules would represent urine reclamation while the ones in the labs and gym would be representative of greywater reclamation. On the ISS, both the service module and tranquility contain water purification systems according to that map, with tranquility being mostly for exercise / storage according to wikipedia (equivalent to the GymHab) and the service module containing 4 of the 6 sleeping berths (equivalent to the SleepHabs)."},{"CreatedByName":"the.fllying.ace","CreatedById":154078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T07:42:33Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking about building a space station using this mod, I\u0027m just worried about the name change break when 1.1 comes out... will you have a guide on how to modify the save file to where it wont break my vessel?
