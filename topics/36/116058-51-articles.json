On that note, when I go into EVEs alt-zero manager and pan to the shadow manager and try and select the sun, it pans to the core even tho visually and functionally, the sun is still working properly. prolly has to do with JadeofMaars mention of how scatterer and eve work in defining what the Sun is. in the galacticcore.cfg it shows the core as \u0027Sun\u0027 and in the StockSun.cfg it shows the Sun as \u0027The Sun\u0027. more specifically, theres this:\n\nstock sun.cfg\n\nblah blah blah lol...\n\n// Custom Settings  \n\n            displayName = The Sun  \n\n            sphereOfInfluence = 2e12\n\nIn Eve, the search is for \u0027Sun\u0027, at least in the GUI(not sure about the code) so for now I can see why it\u0027ll pan to the core  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).

It\u0027s fine on launchpad (normal 6 hours day/night cycle) but as soon as you launch something, the planet and the vessel get gradually darker until both look like it\u0027s pitch black night. Once the vessel leaves the atmosphere (so around 70km above ground) the planet returns back to normal, but not the vessel. It also doesn\u0027t matter if launched at 0:00 or 3:00, the behaviour of the lighting is exactly the same.\n\nThis is on an install with only Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator and GalacticNeighborhood, as i was afraid one of my many other mods would be the reason. Problem doesn\u0027t appear anymore once i delete GN.\n\nOr, probably nevermind: I just read Sigma88\u0027s signature to see what files he needs, and then saw on his discord that he published a new version just an hour ago.
