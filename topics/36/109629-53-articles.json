They sound wonderful however there is a noticeable click or clipping sound from what I assume is at the end of the loop?

I am waiting for a full release. Its still available in the bobcat historical thread with all the other parts. Its probably gonna need quite some work, but just docking ports and node issues. That and the backbone of the ISS pack is the MIR pack. Which would also go nice with the Shuttle. Other than those node issues and the docking ports the ISS pack is just really a parts pack. There are no IVAs but the the MPL and hitchhiker container can be added to the american sides. Bobcat already made IVAs for the Russian sides and they are beautiful so they don\u0027t need to be changed. The only issue even when all of that is fixed, that has plagued the pack for about 6 releases now is the infinite amount of Null exception errors that get thrown with the trusses. The trusses is where you will probably spend most of your time fixing. The rest can probably done in a night. The most recent download of the ISS and MIR Dragon maintained up until .90. Mir needs to be fixed because it has the Zvedea and Zaraya modules. Also the Soyuz needs to be fixed because you wont be able to launch the Pirs and Poisk modules properly. It looks like someone on the thread has got it working. Maybe you could collaborate with him to get things going again. Also a switch to DDS textures will bring everything up to date with 1.04.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81754-Release-BobCat-Ind-Space-Planet-products](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81754-Release-BobCat-Ind-Space-Planet-products)"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:07:09Z","Content":"Well... since i can\u0027t use the ARM parts (for now) i\u0027m now using the RKE Kanadarm for the shuttle and it fits the shuttle well... although that the parts a bit bigger than the Shuttle\u0027s arm:\n\n![7B729E19BBC5B09F293DF2F0EC2C0C5D95D9611E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/628600386307136862/7B729E19BBC5B09F293DF2F0EC2C0C5D95D9611E/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:41:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well... since i can\u0027t use the ARM parts (for now) i\u0027m now using the RKE Kanadarm for the shuttle and it fits the shuttle well... although that the parts a bit bigger than the Shuttle\u0027s arm:\n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/628600386307136862/7B729E19BBC5B09F293DF2F0EC2C0C5D95D9611E/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/628600386307136862/7B729E19BBC5B09F293DF2F0EC2C0C5D95D9611E/)\n\nWill try upload fixed one tonight. \n\nLooks good by the way!
