It is there, but below the surface. If I zoom out, I can see minmus. The moon is gone. Also, after going to them from the tracking station, I cannot change vessels in map view. Odd.\n\nWhen you get problems like that you need to supply log files. output\\_log.txt (for Windows) or player.log (Linux or Mac)\n\nif you can\u0027t change vessels or things are missing then there\u0027s a good probability that those logs have errors.\n\nAnd for base building especially, make sure your terrain detail is on maximum.
