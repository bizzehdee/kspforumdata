They only saved about 10% over building new casings by reusing them in the end, especially after the redesign following Challenger. So much of the segments had to be replaced after every flight that you were only reusing the part which was the most inexpensive to make - the casings themselves.

Sometimes the Centaur has been deorbited with the equivalent of 20% of its usable fuel capacity left (the vehicle wasn\u0027t fully fueled on liftoff because there was not need for that much fuel given the payload and launch profile). SpaceX determined that even with 5% of the fuel left, the F9 (original) first stage and the F9 Upper Stage could return to a powered landing using 1 Merlin 1D and the Upper Stage using a pair of SuperDraco thrusters.
