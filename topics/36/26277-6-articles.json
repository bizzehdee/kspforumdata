You control how many pulses there are, and you control when they happen, but you don\u0027t control how powerful they are.

How is the drum magazine different from an externally or stack mounted magazine? The internal details of the magazine do not matter. The only important thing is how many bombs are left inside.

The baseline USAF Orion design has 60 magazines, in six stacks of ten high.\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing is to give the user the ability to adjust the number of magazines to match the mission. Those things are massive. And there are different sizes of nuclear bombs, the more massive, the more kiloNewtons they put out. I could easily make magazines for each bomb size.

Having the nukes as a resource stored in magazines would mean you could just right-click a magazine to see how many nukes are left in it. If you don\u0027t want them to be able to be transferred like fuel/oxidizer etc. currently can, put transfer = NONE in the resource definition, rather than transfer = PUMP.

It...doesn\u0027t actually bode well for structural stability, to have the spine be made of segments one magazine tall, but it allows for easily changing the ship\u0027s size if someone wanted a smaller or (God help us) larger amount of nukes. Would the word be payload, or is that reserved for what you\u0027re bringing along? Huzzah for words with multiple meanings :V\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually not increasing the payload, instead increasing the propellant fraction (i.e., the mass ratio).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had thought of doing the spine in sections, but that both compromises the structural stability and increases the part count (which has a direct impact on the frames per second). The current spine allows for 60 magazine or 3,600 nukes. Canopus managed to go from Kerbal orbit to Duna with only 250 nukes. I\u0027m not saying you\u0027ll never need more, but you have to make trade-offs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESucking bombs from the most empty magazine...well, it has to figure out which magazine to draw the first blast from. Would something like the way liquid fuel/oxizider flows now be close to what you\u0027re looking for? Obviously there\u0027s need to be something else, because nukes are a discrete unit, unlike liters/whatever. So, it would have to draw one from one side, and then one from the opposite, etc whenever launchBomb() is called. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eohboy, I didn\u0027t even think about that. Bad idea to keep sucking from one magazine until it is empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne magazine has a mass of 4.92 tons (4.74 tons for the 60 bombs, 0.18 for the empty magazine). Using up one magazine then ejecting it will move the ship\u0027s center of gravity by almost 5 tons. That\u0027s got to hurt the ship\u0027s stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill have to try and absorb equally from the top 6 magazines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoh! On that note, I attempted re-entry around Kerbin, and the entire rocket flipped forwards from a pretty high altitude.

I actually did a playtest with just the Orion and found it completely adequate as an SSTO platform, only problem, as several people have mentioned thus far, was that it wasn\u0027t very good at precise orbital maneuvers. So I slapped on a few Fatman NERVA engines, kind of like what mushroomman did, and it DID seem to do the trick.
