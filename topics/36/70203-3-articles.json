If so, that would be a very cool effect. It would lead to a couple of design questions, however:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Attachment method. Would it be a one shot (for example decouples whatever is mounted at the side opposite the hinges when it opens to expose the cargo. I believe this would be closest to the design used for Apollo 7) or reusable (would require a framework inside the fairings similar to the open frames I have now in order to support structure above the top of the fairings. This configuration would also preclude being able to spin the capsule and dock with the payload in the same manner as Apollo 7, due to the hard-mounted framework. It would basically just be a cargo bay that had a very distinctive opening method, which isn\u0027t a bad thing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Length/diameter. Diameter isn\u0027t really too much of an issue. My initial thought would be to have the \u0022hinged fairing\u0022 section be a modified version of the current separator that I have now. Length would be more of an issue, as it would restrict modularity a bit, and I want to avoid the part bloat that could start by adding several different lengths. Perhaps a consensus could be found about the most useful length could be found.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T01:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Talisar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Talisar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/vlsqb79dk94bza2/TalCargoSolutionsV0.2.1.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAnother very minor update\u003C/a\u003E.

The adapters are actually 3 different meshes welded using MODEL[] nodes, so I think I could put together an adapter that would go from the larger 4m (5m actual diameter) size down to 3m (3.75m actual diameter) current size of the largest stock parts using the meshes I currently have.

I tend to think in actual in-game (including the standard 1.25x rescale) sizes and always get confused when people talk about 2m, 3m, etc parts. If so, then a 4m part would actually be 5m in diameter after that standard rescale.\u003Cp\u003E If that is what you are looking for, that is a pretty simple addition. Just another rescale for most of the parts, and I\u0027d have to cobble together an adapter to make it fit to current 3m parts (as there aren\u0027t many parts larger than that at the moment, besides procedurals), but I think that would be doable with the current meshes I have. The adapters are actually 3 different meshes welded using MODEL[] nodes, so I think I could put together an adapter that would go from the larger 4m (5m actual diameter) size down to 3m (3.75m actual diameter) current size of the largest stock parts using the meshes I currently have.

Overall, I\u0027m pretty happy with the current parts as far as their specific functions are concerned. I think I\u0027ve come up against a wall on any new parts that would fit with them (but suggestions are always welcome). I toyed with the idea of some radial cargo bays, but in order to make them large enough to be useful they end up becoming pretty unwieldy. I may revisit that idea if I can come up with some better design ideas for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very happy with the three different truss pieces, as well as the cargo bay. Those are unlikely to be changed with the exception of improvements to textures. The same goes for the command pod now, with the exception that it is much more in need of better texturing and when I start getting really ambitious I plan on making an IVA for it. I did notice a flipped normal on the bottom of one of the cargo bay doors that I need to fix (not a huge deal, as it is probably hidden in most usage scenarios), and I\u0027m considering a version where the doors swing out more conventionally rather than sliding in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big thing that I will be adjusting are the adapters and separators.
