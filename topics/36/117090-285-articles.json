And from my point of view the  standard shader/PBR setup is a bit like the icing on the cake. The full SSTU system, with its the tank content and scaling system, engines, model switch, texture switch... I would like to see all of that used.   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Having messed quite allot with your system (prior to texture switch) once you get how it work its not that hard. Obviously converting existing model to your system might be quite challenging.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E If you would provide a exemple model, reduced to its simplest expression, with annotated config and a brief wiki for the overall architecture. Don\u0027t you think modder could quickly learn how to use its various functionality? Could they use these functionality independently?\n\u003E \n\nWhile I could certainly port the SSTUTextureSwitch module into the PBR shader release (and might, its a decent stand-alone texture switch system), I don\u0027t think it would be wise to include much more than that.  If another mod author really wanted to use all of the SSTU features (model switching/fuel setup gui/etc) -- they can install the full SSTUTools.dll.  The rest of the \u0027modular part\u0027 modules and functions are so deeply integrated into the SSTU code that there really is no way to separate them -- the \u0027modular parts\u0027 -are- the SSTU code.\n\nI would love to see others use the model setup/definition and modular parts system.  I really don\u0027t think that anyone would though (there has been ample opportunity for it over the past 2\u002B years).  It seems that most other modders\u0027 (and players?) embrace and enjoy the stock model setup and part setup (lego rockets with lots of parts).  I\u0027m not going to try and change that.  I cannot decide how others will enjoy the game; all I can do is keep modding the things that help -me- to enjoy the game more.\n\nDo I think that other mods/modders could learn and use the modules?  Absolutely -- both [@JoseEduardo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127759-joseeduardo/) and [@Jimbodiah](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152759-jimbodiah/) have released \u0027mod-of-a-mod\u0027 expansion packs that do as much.  The modules themselves are compatible with a very wide range of modeling styles and workflows, and most entire mods could be converted to use the SSTU modules and part setup through nothing more than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches (lots and lots of patches... but still... just plain-old config/text editor work).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, captinjoehenry said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Great to hear!

It was massively reducing part count.\n\u003E \n\nYep.  I don\u0027t see any potential of the optional/switchable docking ports making a return.  KSP code simply refuses to cooperate with modules that are added (or removed) at run-time.  Given enough time (and patience) I might have been able to get it working...(blah blah, work sucks, meh, etc...).   I\u0027m not happy about having to remove them either, but it was better then continuing to have the buggy parts in the releases (for example in my recent testing, I was using a station-core part with the docking ports removed/disabled in the editor, but the \u0027decouple node\u0027 button from the docking port module was still showing up in flight, and actually decoupled parts of the craft when activated).  (WTB proper use of moduleIsEnabled flag in every stock part-module.... if that was implemented in the stock code none of this would have been a problem)\n\nNow, the main problem isn\u0027t actually with the integrated docking ports themselves -- KSP deals with those decently -- it is with the adding/removing them while in the editor.  Nor is changing the ports\u0027 model or size problematic -- all of that can be dealt with in a fashion that works with the stock code.\n\nOne potential alternative might be to create a 2n\u0027d copy of those parts that has full-time (non-optional) docking ports.  Would require some minor adjustments to the plugin code to handle the docking port model re-positioning with adapter changes, but nothing too complex or time consuming.  The problems with this are related to editor-part-list bloat (I really don\u0027t like duplicate parts for such minor functional differences), and it wouldn\u0027t be able to handle cases of only wanting a docking port on one end of the part (it would be either ports on both ends, or none at all).  Far from an ideal solution.  So far that I\u0027m not even going to think any further about implementing it (until/unless the problems could be solved).\n\nA couple potential... enhancements... I might be able to offer in regards to the part-count increase from stand-alone docking ports are:\n\n- Welding docking port -- if your station is permanent, use these to make it permanent.  No worries about docking ports increasing part count with these, as the docking ports remove and delete themselves when the parent parts are welded together.\n- Docking port toggle -- a mini-mod that I put together that adds a \u0027toggle docking port\u0027 control to stock docking ports.  When toggled to the \u0027disabled\u0027 state all nearly all docking port code is disabled -- the performance hit from using non-docked and non-shielded ports is removed.  The downside is that you have to remember to \u0027activate\u0027 the ports before you can use them for docking.
