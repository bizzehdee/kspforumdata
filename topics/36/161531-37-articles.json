Its more because the energy demand is so high that it would put a strain on the infrastructure. But at the same time if you have enough energy to power the reactor you have enough energy to power the reactor, if you want to raise the bar for initiating fusion that\u0027s fine but artificially creating a way in which you can\u0027t do it is not realistic because I might have a battery bank of 100k or something like that which should easily be able to start a fusion reaction, especially in a large array of fusion reactors it would be easy to have enough electric charge to start 1 then activate the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo what you want but I wouldn\u0027t use realism as the excuse, game play sure that\u0027s a valid reason but realism it is not. Having enough electric charge the reactor for 30 seconds or even 1 minute would effectively have the same effect and is somewhat realistic as although as keep the reaction going should not take that much power starting the reaction should require a large amount of power because at first you have to heat the fuel to 10x the temp of the sun after that though the energy produced by heats inside the reactor is enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I should say that a fission reaction is not enough to create those kind of temps. Modern fission reactors only run at around 300C and proposed molten salt reactors would only run at 650C. You would need to turn this into electricity and focus the energy to start a fusion reactor so not being able to start the fusion reaction from electric charge makes no sense what so ever as long as you have enough of it, in fact the only real way to store enough energy to initiate fusion reactor portably would be with high capacity capacitors or high output batteries AND an constant energy source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said Game play is a valid reason but realism is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I should mention there are solutions for high capacity capacitors graphene capacitors are one root which you could output enough energy for just about long enough that would be compact and light enough to actually do it, obviously there is a higher leakage than batteries but really its the only way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T18:57:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by etheoma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PlayMp1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PlayMp1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, I can\u0027t tell if I\u0027m being a moron, but I can\u0027t seem to get the Thermal Rocket Nozzle to produce any thrust with any fuel except Hydrolox (which of course has pretty poor dV).

To Fix it, you got 2 options: make the nozzle smaller (using tweakscale) in the VAB (which also predicts your thrust) or replace the Gas Core Reactor by a reactor is optimized for High thrust (instead o High Isp but low thrust) like the Particle Reactor.

It might be that the technology is available too early. Instead of nerving them, I\u0027m thinking about balancing them like the other engines, which is to unlock higher performance with higher tech nodes. I could unlock ArcJet Variable Isp with Advanced Gridded Thrusters (1500 science) and Variable Plasma Thrusters Isp with Advanced Electromagnetic Systems (2250 science). The Plasma Thrusters ability to use vacuum plasma could be unlocked with Specialized Plasma Generation (4000 science. This would be a nice reason research those techs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I agree to add new tech nodes but isn\u0027t the science needed a bit too steep? I know it\u0027s a end game content but by the time I acquire all the KSPI tech I\u0027ll have nothing to do with it. It would be nice if you put the needed science for this new tech down a tier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E By the way, what\u0027s up with the aluminum hybrid engine in the newest update?
