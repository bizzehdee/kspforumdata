Just wondering as this is one of the reasons I halted work on RVE, and as far as I can tell there\u0027s no available option for it currently around in KSP other than altering the global body textures\n\u003E \n\nWell, as a first step I was planning to replace the PQS shaders and try to do some trickery with parallax mapping that would be procedurally generated and make the terrain look more detailed than it is. The new shaders introduced in 1.8 seem to do more or less what I had in mind.\n\nLater on, I would like to explore implementing my own terrain system (ie replace the PQS system with a custom terrain system), but not sure I\u0027ll ever have the time to do something so ambitious ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/6/2019 at 9:46 PM, General Petrov said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So I thought I\u0027d clarify on my previous question about an issue I\u0027m having with scatterer. Basically for some reason or another the surface terrain of Duna appears to be partially transparent from a distance. This is most noticeable as you descend through the atmosphere, and when you\u0027re on the surface looking at hills several kilometres away. Its not immediately clear from these screenshots, but you can just about see that at first the terrain almost appears as if its a part of the atmosphere, but as you descend it becomes less transparent.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried to find out what was causing this, and the only thing I found was that in the game Scatterer options menu, it looks as though Scatterer is loading the config for Urlum instead of Duna judging by the file path. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to change this though. I\u0027ve been looking for a solution for some time now but I can\u0027t find anything. Would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me stop my Duna from looking as though its being snapped out of existence as I enter orbit.\n\u003E \n\nThis is a limitation in how scatterer handles planets with a tiny radius and a (relatively) high atmo. No fix/workaround for now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/15/2019 at 11:20 PM, pingopete said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Been playing around with some new 128k downscaled to 64k earth textures, but having a hard time getting Scatterer to run properly, would be awesome to revamp this. I found if I enable eve integration with clouds and hit map clouds all terrain goes white, so for the time being I\u0027ve been running without that, but on occasion it would work briefly over certain areas:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just to clarify the mapping of eve clouds only seems to not work for cube mapped eve cloud texture but work fine for normal single texture cloud maps and detail\n\u003E \n\nHmm, could you open an issue on github?
