As near as I can tell, what I had been labeling the \u0027Service Module\u0027, is actually the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and landing segment.\n\n![GruDml5.png](http://i.imgur.com/GruDml5.png)\n\nThe blue colored parts would be the \u0027landing configuration\u0027.  The white colored bit is the LAS which is jettisoned once on-orbit (or during ascent).  On the landing segment, the upper portion contains the de-orbit engines, attitude control, parachutes, and soft-landing motors.  So basically, the entire blue segment would be returning from orbit.  The capsule itself has no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, parachutes, or other thrusters, it is merely a heat-shielded crew capsule.  Only the capsule was re-usable; the rest of the \u0027service module\u0027 bit would be replaced for each flight (or at least refurbished with new SRBs for the retro and soft-landing motors).\n\nThis is a bit different than I had originally planned/envisioned, but shouldn\u0027t impact the overall development of the parts.  It does render the whole \u0027size of top node\u0027 discussion a bit pointless though, and mostly eliminates the utility of having a docking port on the top of the capsule.  I\u0027m half tempted to combine the parts into a single-piece setup and entirely remove the docking port option.... but I also like the thought of having a generically usable 1.875m capsule.  I\u0027ll probably have to play around with the prototype parts a bit more to see where it all leads me.  Either way, nearly finished with the VA meshes / geometry (barring any changes needed from testing), and will be moving onto the meshes for one of the other capsules shortly (probably Mercury, as it is fairly simple and straightforward)."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T16:51:34Z","Content":"So, Gemini is the part of the NASA space program I liked the most.  A Pure science in preparation for Apollo missions that was added to speed up Apollo.\n\nHOWEVER, there are many hurdles as several people have mentioned.\n\nSince [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) mentioned he was concerned about the Geometry, since many people have mentioned that the docking port on Gemini is not passable (very true.)  Might I suggest an alternative?\n\nI give you BIG-Gemini!   The Nose is no longer used for docking but instead has a LANDING GEAR!   The tail end diameter is STOCK 2.5m  (the front of the nose would be 0.625 but wouldn\u0027t matter for much.)   It uses a PARAGLIDER to land and [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/) already has a modlette to support deploy-able lifting surfaces and someone else we know should have a good grasp on wheels/skids by this point ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).   It is designed to, and supports, many OTHER parts already in SSTU. Parts like, I don\u0027t know... .**STATION** parts.   And it\u0027s two primary service modules (3.75m for Saturn launched and 3.125m for LDC-Titan Launched) would have the docking ports, Life-support consumable/cargo and Retro thrusters.   Also Early on it would have used the Apollo Mk2 CSM.   The whole point of Big-G was to support Space Stations starting in the mid 1970s.   More cargo and cheaper to build/maintain than Apollo Blk III/IV.   Via Part switching the CM can have a crew capacity from 14 down to 4 with a capability to increase stowed consumables for the station (Life support.)\n\nIf I am barking up the wrong tree I apologize.  But it is a way to get one of the three variants of Gemini in the game without worrying about the geometry\n\nBTW stay away from Wikipedia on this one folks.  It has data makes it sound like BigG was a small program with one path... the neat thing about Big-G was that it was pretty modular and the only fixed points were that it was LOOSELY derived from Gemini.  Very few parts were the same however.   Rather it was a new space-craft with a structural similarity to an in production space craft at the time of proposal (Gemini-B)  The below link has some good RW documentation on it\n\n[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=37347.80](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=37347.80)\n\nHad NASA gone the route of many Space Stations like they thought they would in the  late 1960s.... Big-G would likely have been built since it would have been cheaper than any Space Shuttle program.   To be clear.  Big-G is not a space shuttle replacement... rather it is a cheaper alternative for  several of the rolls Space Shuttle was designed for.  Historically, as soon as the Follow on order for Saturn rockets failed to happen (in two consecutive years) there was no point to develop Big-G since no more Saturns meant no big Space Stations."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T17:05:22Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I was just about to post about the VA... the SM for VA is FGB and the combination of-course is called TKS.   IF VA launced it would launch with FGB module.  This is what made the FGB architecture so robust that it is used as the basis for several previous/current and future proposed Russian modules on the ISS and beyond.\n\nJust like Gemini-B, VA has a hatch in the heat shield.  However I am guessing that the Soviet/Russian space program didn\u0027t design it well, didn\u0027t like it or just preferred to stay with Soyuz (all are EASILY possible.) since VA was never landed maned..... that we know of."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T17:12:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Space Kadet said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so i was bored, so i made this\n\u003E \n\nYou are officially nuts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)    Welcome to the club!"},{"CreatedByName":"acolangelo","CreatedById":105343,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T17:27:51Z","Content":"Question/feedback about the v0.6 MUS changes.

Many mods have a bare-bones variant (FASA even has a 2.5-3.75m SM for it) but none have anywhere near the complete program as proposed in 1968 or finalized and canceled/ignored in 1971.\n\nI knew the SM would be an issue but I figured it would solve your geometry issue since the top would be 0.625 and the Bottom would be 2.5m.  I think most mod developers stay away from this beast for exactly two reasons...   1) Multiple configurations of SMs.  2) Docking port BEHIND the capsule... not in front of it.  \n\nIn your diagram above the Docking port would RETRACTED into the bottom of the bottom cone... Then extend out about a meter and a half and connect with a Station.    Incidentally, in my notes, I have several references to the 2.5mx3.75m conical SM being the least preferred version of the SM (Unsure if NASA or McD-D was calling it \u0022least preferred\u0022)  It appears a 2.5m (Kerbal Scale) Cylindrical SM would be used for both Apollo and via an Adapter... Titan IIIM (Ala Titan IVa)   In Kerbal scale Titan should be ~2M (1.95m to be exact.) same is true of the UA-120x SRM family (120\u0022 = 3.048m = 1.95m in Kerbal Scale)  The UA-156x family of 156\u0022 then becomes almost exactly 2.5m (2.53m to be exact.)\n\n\\*Considers looking into learning Blender, how to do layers in  PaintShopPro and how to use Unity to make a Big-G mod...."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T23:34:55Z","Content":"The TRAILS mod by [@Beale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70533-beale/) has a nice Gemini and Big Gemini.
