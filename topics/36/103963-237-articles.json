However, if I use the tracking station to get to the craft, the clouds are there. I\u0027m mostly bringing this up because the altitudes are the same, even if the mechanic is different.\n\nLatest KSP, up to date linux with up to date nvidia drivers.\n\nIt\u0027s more of an annoyance than anything since I now have complete workarounds for all the things I mention here, but I thought you might like to know.\n\nOh, and a few posts before the one I link I left a couple of eye-candies for you. Scatterer makes the overall experience of KSP sooooo much better. Has no material effect on the *game*, but has a huge one on the *experience* of playing the game.
