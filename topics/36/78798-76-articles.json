I am comforted in knowing that should mere Karbonite prove not quite up to the job of an Eve SSTO, there\u0027s Karbonium to fall back on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. But my question still remains..... What is the intended purpose of Karbonium?\u003Cp\u003EI have not yet heard of anybody making a Karbonite Eve SSTO (and I\u0027ve been subscribed to this thread for some time). I haven\u0027t quite succeeded myself yet but it\u0027s so close I could be arrested for stalking. So, there are only 2 possible outcomes as Karbonite now stands. Either Karbonite Eve SSTO succeeds or fais by a whisker either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of anything harder to do than tying an Eve colony into a system-wide exchange system. The accepted practice for an Eve ascent after doing no more than planting a flag is, with conventional rocketry, to rove the rocket to the highest convenient mountaintop, then use a Kerbal-made mountain of 1.25m rocket parts in several dozen stages all to get 1 Kerbal in a lawnchair into the lowest possible orbit. This can\u0027t in any way come close to being economically viable (forget mere contracts, I\u0027m talking about the long-term \u0022Eve India Company\u0022 colonial/imperial stuff), even with Extraplanetary Launchpads. The difference between this conventional approach and a Karbonite SSTO attempt that just barely fails is bigger than (EDIT insert reference to whatever scale seems appropriate here). So what more can Karbonium do that Karbonite can\u0027t do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonum = much better engine fuel, possibly other uses (talking to another modder at the moment).
