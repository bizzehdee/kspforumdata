Initial code is written, fairly simple after I figured out what all needed to be done; less than a few hundred lines for the entire system, and completely event driven (so should not add any appreciable performance costs).  The \u0027fixer\u0027 is a separate module that will be added in the flight scene to any part that contains a docking port (or multiple ports); every part in a vessel will be examined for docking ports, one \u0027fix\u0027 module will be added for each docking port present on the part. \n\nWhat it will do is add a \u0027Force Undock\u0027 button any time it detects that a docking port is \u0027stuck\u0027 (docking port is in docked state but \u0027undock\u0027 button is already deactivated); pressing the button will call a method to decouple the parts (using stock couple/decouple code).  And.. that should be it.  Nice and simple.\n\nGoing to -try- and develop it as an external mod, independent of SSTU (so, like my rescue-pod-fix).  Hopefully should be small and lightweight.  Will keep you guys posted, and put out some links if/when I get it working. \n\n(Although it begs the question of why the stock docking port doesn\u0027t include code to check -itself- for undocking errors; why is it disabling the undock button if it is still docked?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T11:04:06Z","Content":"Because, reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T15:38:09Z","Content":"Hehe. Reverse engineering stock design decisions is always fun, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T15:50:54Z","Content":"On the plus side, I figured out how to hook directly into the ModuleDockingNode\u0027s own Update code.  Heck, with the method they have used (FSM with delegate methods and callbacks), I can completely replace, in-line, most of the docking port code without breaking existing patches/etc.  Basically the module merely calls these delegate methods for its update functionality, and the devs were kind enough to leave them public/unprotected -- so you can remove or replace any particular bit of the docking port code without having to touch the original source.  Kind of a neat way of handling things -- it has not always been that way; previously all the functionality was built directly into the FixedUpdate, was truly \u0027hard-coded\u0027 and unalterable.\n\nThis means that if I can figure out what the -root- of the problem is, I can merely insert code into the docking port itself that can fix the problem (haven\u0027t tried yet, but I think I can even set it up in an override-fashion, adding new code and still calling the original delgate as well).\n\nSo.... if any of you guys run into an SSTU\u002Bstock craft that has stuck docking ports, please post up the persistence file to GitHub so that I can investigate the problem a bit more."},{"CreatedByName":"TopHeavy11","CreatedById":154744,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T23:37:17Z","Content":"How do you change diameter?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T23:45:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, TopHeavy11 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How do you change diameter?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m going to go out on a limb and say that you are in sandbox mode.
