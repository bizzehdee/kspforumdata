A 2.5 or 3.75M Command pod with a separate Science and/or engineering pod that would visually integrate with it.\n3. An X-37 type crew return module.\n4. A 2.5 and/or 3.75 engine ring with integrated landing legs, visualize a ring of 4 to 8 .625m engines with the landing legs part of the frame and they extend out from the bottom at an angle. This is about a 1m deep module with either fuel, monoprop or both.\n5. A crane cab think of this [http://www.cidbuildings.com/images/crane_cab_4.jpg](http://www.cidbuildings.com/images/crane_cab_4.jpg) but 1.25m round and almost all glass for skycranes or maneuver blisters. Transfer your pilot from the main cabin to the maneuver blister so you can land your munar base horizontally.\n\nThere are a few others on the gee that would be nice list that either I can\u0027t remember or can not fully describe."},{"CreatedByName":"NBZ","CreatedById":117892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:35:47Z","Content":"A cargo bay like the stock ones, but circular 3.75m (or 5m...) and WITH end cap and sliding doors that do not protrude.

I\u0027m going a bit by guesswork here, but something that gives a lander the same effect as being the next size up without needing a greatly enlarged fairing.\n\nthis was one of my v0.90 designs. It uses a 2.5m capsule, and the conical piece takes up up to 3.75m It\u0027s also an attempt to land a rover, with a fuel tank as a balance weight that can also be left behind. But you can imagine how big a fairing it would have to use. I could seeing it needing a 5m booster to get it into orbit\n\n![CCp1wAiWMAApNvF.png:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCp1wAiWMAApNvF.png:large)\n\nThe extra spread makes a huge difference to the slope-stability. The vehicle is rather over-powered, enough thrust to soft-land on Kerbin and, without the legs and platforms, might make a good orbital work-vehicle. But it feels at the upper-end of plausibility for the Kerbal attitude to problem-solving. I think that might be a usefully-different sort of landing leg"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T13:00:41Z","Content":"Made more progress on ladders.
