True, KSP is not that much work to deal with, and currently, I do need as much as a few pointers on where to start when I need new textures and models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, though, this shall be nothing more than me recoding stock parts, and making copies so that regular stock parts may be used. Thing about this is, it\u0027s not to give ANYONE a cheating advantage. True, MTE, and ETM transition is a very cheat-like thing, given you could load up a single orbital ship with umpteen hundred Pb-Ion generators, but thats the part I\u0027m not worried about, and it makes it to where I\u0027m going to have to harshen the values here. Like slow fuel production. True, yes, this could be used to make much smaller, and much easier to pilot return trip/reusable vessels, but at a slow rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, I might even put in a system that would make ti to where Kerbals die after so long, though without age effects... A simple cryochamber pod, (like some kind of altered hitch hiker pod), could keep them alive much long, and make this possible. Now that would be fun, but for now, no death for kerbals, just ETM and MTE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, I have no idea where to kick this off. I\u0027m not even starting at this moment.

But now that I think about it, transfering Liquidfuel to Solidfuel for a rocket (doing so sounds cool but complicated, and pretty advanced, given you can\u0027t shut down a solidfuel tank...), can require a different kind of figuring. Like, say, you convert The liquidfuel directly to Solidfuel instead of taking a long route of going from liquid to energy to solid, and it would save a lot of resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be a bit advanced, given that I\u0027m going to have to figure so many things, like which kind of fuel is heaviest, which is most volatile (puts out more thrust), and so on.

Now, first is Electric Charge generation, which is doable at 45 units per second by the use of a Pb-Ion generator. Multiply that by 8, and you get 360 per 8-snapped generators. I was going to base this off of 8 of the gigantor XL solar arrays, but they provide less than a Pb-Ion Generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the transfer is 0.9 Liquidfuel per 400 Electric Charge Units. And with equal amount of power, you can generate 1.1 Oxidizer, creating the same amount of fuel required to run any engine. That is, unless one particular rocket engine takes up to using more or less than that. One resource per part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis conversion seems fair for the rocket fuel, I think, but I\u0027m not sure if I should up the power consumption or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Made a mistake. The Pb-Ion generators produce 45 ECU per minute, not second, the gigantor XL solar arrays have just become the new energy supply lookoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.9 LiquidFuel per 160 ECU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.1 Oxidizer per 160 ECU\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T16:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SeventhArchitect\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T16:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJool-V just had an alternator like most engines. Even stock engines generate electric charge while running. You are probably thinking of the HOME mod also from bobcat, where the powerplant module had a \u0022nuclear reactor\u0022 in it, which you could throttle up or down for power as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the converting to solid fuel part, that is really just a chemical process. Since we do not know what liquid fuel and oxidizer actually ARE in KSP, you could swing that. Energy to mass conversion requires astronomical amounts of power, plus an understanding of physics that we just do not know yet ourselves. For example an electron has a rest mass of .511 MeV / c^2, which basically means that it is the equivalent of .511 MeV of energy condensed into a weird, self contained, oscillating state. Protons are about 938.272 MeV / c^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a hypothetical scenario, lets consider 1 mole of stable molecular oxygen (O2). Each oxygen atom consists of 7 protons, 7 neutrons, and 7 electrons. Since neutrons and protons are roughly the same (enough for this), there are 28 * 938.272 MeV / c^2 for the nuclei, and 14 * .511 MeV / c^2 for the electron cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 mole is 6.02 * 10^23 molecules. So we then have (6.02 * 10^23)(28*938.272 \u002B 14*.511) MeV / c^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works out to 1.582 * 10 ^ 28 MeV / c^2 of mass for the 1 mole of molecular oxygen. For the amount of energy, just drop the c^2, so there is 1.582 * 10^28 MeV of energy in that one mole of oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as a sobering reminder, here is a couple of comparisons. 1 mole of molecular oxygen is 32 grams. The actual mass of oxygen you consume on a daily basis is about 780 grams give or take. A 20 kT nuclear device will yield about 5.25 * 10^17 MeV of energy if you were able to capture all of it. Suddenly I find myself having much much more respect for the matter around me, and for the idea of energy to matter conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow having said that all, this is a game and not a simulator. Therefore, go nuts and have fun! make whatever you want m8. I personally think that a better-to-justify approach would be to use a quantity of energy to break down stuff and recombine. I think that is really what you are suggesting, but there are a couple of core problems with that too if you want to get into the physics (in quantum the sum of the parts does not always equal the whole, which is why fission produces energy for large atoms)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SeventhArchitect","CreatedById":80982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T16:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude, dude, I took chemistry, and studied physics, I know what I would be doing even if it were reality. But, when converting Mass to energy, you\u0027re not just breaking down molecules, or moving Electrons. TRUE Mass to Energy would be like turning the entire atom into nothing but pure energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I kinda follow what you\u0027re saying about it In-game. Currently, it\u0027s supposed to be an expensive process that will take a lot of time if you don\u0027t have an abundant amount of energy. In this particular idea, using 8 Gigantor XL Solar Arrays would be a bit under the line needed to produce fuel efficiently. This also to encourage large crafts, and the idea originally came from about 10 minutes looking over and reading through how a few people made reusable ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s meant to encourage the creation of big ships, space stations, and bases.
