I do feel, however, that this is part of the attraction of Remote Tech. It would probably be ridiculous to create a flight computer when something like kOS is around, so maybe delay could be togglable and/or detecting whether kOS is installed or not. If you would go the config route it would be ideal to be able to adjust the delay times too, so everything can be tweaked to be as realistic as possible or desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, relay sending via orbiting probes that do not have a continuous direct line of sight would be pretty neat, regardless of whether delay is implemented or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I am very glad that this project is going again.

I can continue science at A, my HDD is now empty. And need to transfer datas form B to C (it will take time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get the idea^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with everything you said but we have to be precise on what we should expect time delay to be (and as I said, I don\u0027t know if KSP already has a storage limit on their HDDs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the only time delay that could be compatibility-viable would be on research transmission. Their could be an Optional GUI window which could manage data storage between vessels and add a delay for every transmission. I believe it has to be optional actually, as it is a bit beside the purpose of RT I think, which core has to be as simple as possible in case another mod implements data transmission better for example and the user wants to use this other mod to do that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe would only have to install the core RT without the data transmission and he could install the other mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT needs to be modular as it changes things in a deep way, so incompatibilities are around the corner; and choice between mods is always better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see the new RT as a collection of modules related to data transmission (maybe including an optional simple flight computer). This way the user could always choose to replace an RT-module by a better third-party mod. In any game I played, I hated mods which did everything in a non-modular way because sometimes I loved some parts and hated some other, but I couldn\u0027t replace these bad parts with another mod. I like the UNIX way of thinking : small programs which do one small task and do it well. Mods should be designed like this. This way the user can choose every aspect of his game and developing/debugging has never been so easy. So now we need to define for RT what should be core and what shouldn\u0027t; then what modules could we add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give you my opinion on this : RT-core should strictly be : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 establishing connection with KSC or Command Station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 blocking vessel commands and dish pointing if no connection is set (like if there were no power anymore, not by blocking keyboard entries)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand that\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it seems something is missing, but don\u0027t worry you could use modules for whatever is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It is only my opinion though, so please add some more ideas or correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime delay on controls would be a module for example.
