You can do this by using a removeOcean=true in the kopernicus config. That will remove the default ocean from laythe, and then you should be able to use kittopia to add in a new ocean. At least in theory, I haven\u0027t actually tried it myself but it should work.

Instead of having a glowing Star (this idea kinda isn\u0027t relistic but who cares!), you have a Proto-Star. This, of coarse, would have the system VVEEEERRRYY far away from Kerbol, with an orbit that would take several generations (not even the Deep Freeze mod could reach it without 2 or 3 deep freeze tanks) to get to, and by the time that you DO get there, you\u0027ll have probably invented (read: downloaded a mod) the technology to get there faster, passing the old space craft, and be able to throw a welcome party for them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to the idea. The \u0022proto-star\u0022 would really be a giant gas giant (redundent redundecies are redundent), with a ring that would extend for the whole system, with gaps in the ring for the planets (and to allow you to actually see the orbits) Now, all of these \u0022planets\u0022 would be small, little balls of dust and rock that if you sneezed on you would obliterate it. There would be (in the system that is in my head) about five planetoids, each with atleast 4 biomes.

One of the bulbs that sticks out is a giant rock (reperesented in the texture) and it will be the \u0022Big Rock\u0022 biome, most of it would be made of up the \u0022Dusty Area\u0022 biome, an impact crater \u0022Dust Hole\u0022, and the poles. The rest would be along those lines, the closer to the \u0022star\u0022 the bigger they are, none would have moons (because 1. its easier, and 2. its a protostar, the planets would have billions of satellites orbiting them, and that would use up so much ram it would be like using a single can of paint to paint a mansion, you could do it, it just wouldn\u0027t look (read: play) very good (read: at all)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Borisbee","CreatedById":91794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T11:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I just tried my idea of removing the ocean from laythe through kopernicus config and adding an ocean back with kittopia.
