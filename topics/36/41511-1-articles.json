An external model, an internal model, and the props internal cfg. I usually make three blank gameobjects, center them, and build from those, one for each export. Put PartTools on the internal and external, and Proptools on the internal props transform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, I recommend you\u0027ve at least made a fuel tank or engine or something basic in Unity first, so you\u0027ve got a vague idea what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDirections things face\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe Kerbal transform Z faces forward, Y faces upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor external model Z faces up, Y faces forward. For the internal model, Y faces up, Z faces BACKWARD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor props they are a bit arkward. They all work a little different so you\u0027ll just have to try and play it by ear as I don\u0027t remember every individual ones direction. Note axis indicators all have the same orientation, so some will need to be placed with their transforms at 90 degrees to the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant note on Scales\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou must MUST work to reScaleFactor 1. If you don\u0027t, then it won\u0027t line up and you\u0027ll just have a big headache. Even if you think you\u0027ll be clever and resize the internal model 1.25 in Unity. It knows you\u0027re being a smartass and it\u0027ll make you pay dearly, trust me I tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Layers you need to use and not get wrong for everything in IVA\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 - Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis layer is used for placing the Kerbals transforms, and anything that you want visible in IVA AND the Kerbal portrait cameras. Place any box colliders with IsTrigger set TRUE for areas you can double click to change camera view (these may work on 20-internal space too but I haven\u0027t tried)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 - Internal Space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis layer is used for placing anything that you want visible in IVA but NOT the Kerbal portrait cameras. The external model of the MK3 cockpit is in this layer in the MK3 IVA mod for instance, so it doesn\u0027t block the portrait camera views, but is visible on the external cameras or to Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to add IVA cameras\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the cfg use \u0022InternalCameraSwitch\u0022. Set colliderTransformName to whatever you called it in Layer 16, and set cameraTransformName to the same name as an empty transform in Layer 16. It might not need to be in that layer - thats just what I used. in those transforms Z faces forward, Y faces up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Layers AND TAGS you need to use and not get wrong for everything in external model\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefault - Everything Kerbals won\u0027t use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E21 - Part Triggers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything you want to use as a Ladder or an Airlock MUST have this set as its layer. But these must also have Tags defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETags to also not get wrong, these are added the same place as Layers by clicking to the right on Element 0:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirlock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdding Airlocks and Ladders on your EXTERNAL MODEL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a BOX COLLIDER in a game object (name not important) X and Z size I use is about 0.5 but vary it as neccesary. A shallow hatch may be more to your taste if you get it working. Hatches Box colliders typically MUST overlap the collider for the model, and the models collider must overlap the ORIGIN of the model (0,0,0). You might get away with either of these but if you get \u0022Hatch obstructed\u0022 bug, not following those is probably the cause. Kerbals face toward the Z axis and climb up the Y axis. It is a very good idea to have a Ladder box collider overlapping the Airlock Box Collider, Typically in the same location. Be sure they are in LAYER 21 Part Triggers, and Ladders are set to \u0022Ladder\u0022 Tag, and Airlocks to \u0022Airlock\u0022 Tag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, move the TRANSFORM, NOT THE BOX COLLIDER CENTER. As that\u0027ll bug out to hell and just shoot off kerbals into space or inside your model itself. Center must be left as 0,0,0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor bent ladders just overlap the colliders a little. For climbing over a 90 degree bend, use multiple ladder colliders, so the Kerbal goes over the angle in steps. 3 colliders at 45 degrees should work fine though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdding your props\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProps are added using proptools. Its pretty self explanatory as you use it to be honest. But the old versions were really buggy and needed you to manually update the exported cfg file to get them working right. It used to export radar altimeter and the axis indicators wrong, so be careful with those and compare them to stock cockpit internal cfg\u0027s. This may have been fixed in the newest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always combine the PropConfig.cfg that is exported with the Internal.cfg file, but there is a lot of ways to get these into the model. Firespitter for instance adds these in the part.cfg! Just check out other implementations to find a way you like best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal note:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know somehow if anything is wrong and I\u0027ll look into updating this.

Important points you may have understood but I\u0027m going to repeat for clarity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The \u0027Ultralight_Vulture\u0027 object is the model, collision meshes, lights, animations, and nodes for the part which appears in the VAB. It is the source of a .mu file via the PartTools script. This .mu goes in the \u0027Parts\u0027 folder and is called by the part module in the .cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The \u0027Ultralight_Vulture-Orient-IVA\u0027 object does nothing except make it easier to understand where your various IVA objects are going. It does not output anything useful to KSP and is purely there for convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The \u0027Vulture-IVA\u0027 object is the model, lights, IVA cameras, and kerbal positions for the IVA mode which appears after you have launched the part. It is the source of a .mu file via the PartTools script. This .mu goes in the \u0027Spaces\u0027 folder and is called by the internal module in the internal.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The \u0027VultureProps\u0027 object is the placeholder for the various props used in the IVA view (Navball, buttons, and such). It is the source of a .cfg file via the PropTools script. This .cfg file provides the PROP {} values for the internal .cfg file in your \u0027Spaces\u0027 folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I believe the interal.cfg files could be rewritten to look more like the .20 part.cfg files.
