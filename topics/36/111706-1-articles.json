In this tree, the player begins with none of the above, but with the ability to quickly pursue any of these options. Starting parts include the external command seat (functions as a command module via dependency on TakeCommand), wheels, structural parts, batteries, antenna, thermometer, barometer, and seismometer (and the transmissibility of these 3 science parts has been increased to 100%). The external command seat strikes me as a particularly \u0022Kerbal\u0022 way to begin, but also handily limits the players progression, as it presumably won\u0027t be safe for re-entry once heating is fixed, thus encouraging the player to pursue either probes or manned pods.\n\nStarting out with multiple science parts, batteries, and antenna may seem like an odd decision, but it has several benefits:\n\n- It allows the player to conduct a quick science-gathering rover tour around the KSC, providing enough science to unlock several nodes that will define the player\u0027s early emphasis (aviation vs rocketry, manned vs unmanned)\n\n- It reduces grind by making it easy to collect a significant chunk of the cheesy KSC science in one fell swoop (100% transmissibility also makes this easier), rather than re-touring the KSC repeatedly as new science parts are unlocked\n\n- When choosing nodes to unlock, the incentive to make a beeline for science parts is reduced when you already have several; thus encouraging the player to make decisions on the basis of design ambitions rather than science-gathering necessity\n\n**Science changes**\n\nGrind is reduced in the early game as described above, and further mitigated by setting the max science of all experiments equal to the base amount, thus removing the incentive to repeat experiments. This also slightly reduces the total obtainable science, which - in combination with the significantly increased science needed to unlock the entire tree (27,000 vs 16,918 for stock) - means that science will remain relevant farther into one\u0027s career. Experiment data scales and science part costs were also rebalanced.\n\n**Mods**\n\n- [TakeCommand](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120740) is a dependency, as explained above\n\n- All of Nertea\u0027s mods ([NFT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed%29), [SSP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814), [Cryo Engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766-1-02-Cryogenic-Engines-high-Isp-chemical-rockets!-%2803-05-15-fuel-switch-fix%29)) are recommended (there will be some empty nodes without Nertea\u0027s mods, but they are not strictly required)\n\n- Porkjet\u0027s [Atomic Age](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855-1-0-Atomic-Age-Nuclear-Rockets) is supported\n\n- Optional config for [KeepFit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739-1-0-2-WIP-PLUGIN-0-7-2-1-28-05-2015-KeepFit-Kerbal-fitness-degradation), which assigns \u0022exercising\u0022 status to Nertea\u0027s habitation modules and slightly increases their masses to balance this advantage\n\n- Optional config for MechJeb, which currently adds the MJ module to all command parts and links functional progression to the unmanned techs\n\n- Communication tech progression is designed with [AntennaRange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-1-0-AntennaRange-1-9-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity-Now-with-Pretty-Lines!) in mind, but could be adapted to support RemoteTech easily enough; stock is also fine but there won\u0027t be much reason to unlock the dishes\n\n- Requires ModuleManager\n\n- Parts from unsupported mods are automatically assigned to the starting node for now, but adding support is relatively easy\n\n**Downloads**\n\n[Telos Tech Tree](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbhg06fwoe3zqfy/TechTree.cfg?dl=0)\n\n[Optional config for KeepFit \u002B Nertea\u0027s Habitation Modules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7t040aqzzie95pd/KeepFit.cfg?dl=0)\n\n[Optional config for MechJeb](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbx4sfk0ztjfh67/MechJeb.cfg?dl=0)\n\n**Further development**\n\nNo particular plans, but I\u0027m open to feedback, and if there\u0027s significant community interest, I would be happy to help provide support for other mods.\n\n**License is WTFPL**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T07:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"}]}
