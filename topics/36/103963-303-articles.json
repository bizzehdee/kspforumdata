I can uninstall Scatterer, install 50 other mods, and won\u0027t run into this problem. I\u0027m worried that something may be wrong with my graphics card or something internal as I can not find any others experiencing this same issue.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is my favorite graphics mod for KSP, I would be very disappointed if I am unable to run it on my Laptop.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Log:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bma6ck8ifdeudv6/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bma6ck8ifdeudv6/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here is a link to my log. The last time I started the game I had uninstalled every Mod Except Scatterer, Scatterer default config, and Scatterer sunflare.  Then I simply loaded a ship onto the launchpad and sat there for a couple minutes until the screen began flickering.  I then force closed the game.

I suggest downvolting or downclocking your GPU, setting a more agressive fan profile, or setting a framerate limit, and verifying if it holds better when temps are lower."}]}
