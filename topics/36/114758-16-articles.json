I feel like it fills the need of an early tech tree base system (it\u0027s like tents). Then you move into MKS/OKS modules which are meant for mid to late tree. I think these parts are the best looking and feel like stock, and I\u0027d actually prefer to use them as MKS parts if you want my brutal honesty ... \n\u003E \n\u003E ok now I\u0027m just blathering...\n\nTo be honest: I\u0027m not really sure if these parts should be for late game or not. On one hand, i would like to already have at least the most basic parts (e.g. Hab Mk1) available for the first contracts with bases on a planet or moon. On the other hand it would make a better end-game (and would probably be more realistic) if the parts for bases are available later. This would be like it is now in reality: We already have a quite complex station in orbit but are still many years from a base on mars or even moon.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It seems really hard to expand the parts list with things that are functionally new and keep balance.

I placed the parts at nodes which had parts that had the most similarities. Are there more people thinking the parts are too early in the tech tree?If so i will review this in one of the next iterations.\n\nThrowing my 2 cents in here on the TT placement. I personally feel they come early. I use CTT and the Pathfinder mod mentioned earlier. Pathfinder gives me my temporary mobile scouting base but at the same time I\u0027m getting those parts opened up I\u0027m already getting the Mk 1 Hab and gangway parts. One more node up and I\u0027ve got the adapter which combined with some creative strutting means I can milk the Modular Storage unit for fuel or storage while also getting my first permanent surface pieces put in place. Alongside that idea, at the same time we get the Planetary Lab/Greenhouse we\u0027re also just getting the first true station module from stock with the MPL. This means we\u0027re essentially getting our first station parts and our final permanent base parts at the same time.\n\nThis just seemed a bit wonky to me so I\u0027ve personally written my own CTT file and moved most of the KPBS pieces 2-3 nodes deeper. I don\u0027t go so far as moving the parts to the end of the tree since I don\u0027t treat these as true end game items but rather more along the lines of a major stepping stone to that level of tech. The way I see it the basic idea is to build using the adapters/I-beams and deliver using the Mk3 or 3.75m platforms and that translates into a need for parts to be moved further up the tree."},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:25:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not however sure how I feel about ore to fertilizer.

I also tried the parts from univeral storage (which has the right modulemanager version in it\u0027s download) and the parts also don\u0027t show up. It would be nice to let MM manage the availability of the parts.\n\nJust a question: Does MM also take care that the data and textures for parts that are unavailable are unloaded from the memory?

I have to go look but I think you can combine substrate, water and some electric charge (you know to run the mixer), and get mulch ?\n\u003E \n\u003E I mean chances are that if you have TAC or USI-LS you\u0027re going to have MKS right? So my suggestion would be that if the user only has the LS mod, then give them parts that let them prolong but not eliminate supply runs (ALA TAC\u0027s filters and stuff). If however you have MKS installed, then you should get another part that will let you do closed loop.\n\u003E \n\u003E How does that sound?\n\nReally why would you have MKS installed if you have this mod or any LS mod ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T23:08:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E which kind of stuff are you working on? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n Still the LS mods.

If you have any LS mod, then the next logical progression from that is to extend it to in-situ replenishment. Currently, the only mod with in-situ / self sustaining setups is MKS/OKS. RoverDude included all the code needed to setup these life support cycles. \n\nNot understanding exactly how mods work, maybe Planetary base systems could replace mks if it has the converters etc. But you have to also keep in mind that MKS extends more than just the LS mods, it also extends Extraplanetary Launchpads ...\n\nOHHHHH Nils what do you think about a rocket parts converter module? something that takes metals and turns them into rocketparts (EPL) or partskits (OSE Workshop)"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T02:41:07Z","Content":"the magazine on the airlock is called the daily kebal ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T02:53:55Z","Content":"There are others besides MKS that had green houses and so far has the code you can do it all with stock Modules and for LS there is also Soylent [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124501-1-0-4-Soylent-closing-the-Life-Support-cycle-with-Algae-v0-2-2015-06-20](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124501-1-0-4-Soylent-closing-the-Life-Support-cycle-with-Algae-v0-2-2015-06-20)"}]}
