I lunched a rocked and tryed out how it looked... **Awefull at first...** the hard transition from default 250000 settings to mine...omg  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nI litterly spend hours now for that \u0022simple\u0022 problem. So.... For all folks, who wanna try out my setting. The original mod-settings stay as they are, but from distance, Kerbin will look a bit more like before Scatterer...Check out the following pic and the actual wrote down settings: \n\n**CP** = Config point, **SE** = Scattering Exposure, **ETi** = Extinction Tint, **ETh** = Extinction Thickness  \n\nCP 0            (200AGL) ; SE = 0,23 ;  ETi = 0,5 ;      ETh = 1,0  \n\nCP 1         (1\u00B4000AGL) ; SE = 0,23 ;  ETi = 0,5 ;      ETh = 1,0  \n\nCP 2     (250\u00B4000AGL) ; SE = 0,01 ;  ETi = 0,2 ;      ETh = 1,0  \n\nCP 3 (1\u00B4000\u00B4000AGL) ; SE = 0,005 ; ETi = 0,005 ; ETh = 0,9\n\nHere is what it looks like approching from 2mio AGL (clockwise): [https://imgur.com/N7SKq5V](https://imgur.com/N7SKq5V)\n\nThx for the help in explaining the settings to Blackrack. Maybe someone who fully understands all the mod will make a tutorial how to \u0022play\u0022 whit all the settings.  \n\nSo far I checked.... SCATTERER is around for long, and \u0022allmost\u0022 every showcase vid on youtube advertise this mod, **damn rightly**.\n\nGreetings from a week old ksp mod-user so far ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) stay save"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-26T21:29:46Z","Content":"New version is up, fixes the occasional black screen when reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, has a small performance improvement when using the ocean shader, and adds compatibility with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E-Redux\u0027s new particle fading.

I really appreciate all the hard work many mod authors around here put in, but Scatter especially is one that really sticks out -- I can\u0027t even play the game without it anymore, it\u0027s become that crucial to me. That being said, I waited for months after the release of version 1.9 to update my game, simply because I didn\u0027t want to break my most crucial visual mods. Then last night, I saw that not only were there new versions of scatter and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E available, but that you\u0027d also been tinkering with your own version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, and so I just had to see what you were cooking up. I know the performance-improved build of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E has its own thread, but I am seeing probably ~20 more FPS in the areas where frame-rate used to really tank (that\u0027s a guess based on observation, but flying into volumetric clouds for example is noticeably smoother, no question). However, I do have a question about something I am noticing now when zooming in and out on my ship, while it\u0027s in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E...\n\n![QvVPvbm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QvVPvbm.jpg)\n\nSo, as you can see here, it looks good certainly, but the cloud shadows aren\u0027t exactly obvious, and it does have a more flat appearance I\u0027d say give that. Then, if I zoom out...\n\n![dbzevQI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dbzevQI.jpg)\n\nMajor shift to dark blue, as the atmosphere becomes dramatically more transparent, but the clouds in particular gain MUCH more apparent shadows. \n\nI have tried playing around with some of the settings djbcut listed above, and while they produce a result that is more similar to the second image I posted, it also causes a pretty abrupt cut over from the light-blue tinted lower atmosphere with more scattering going on, then suddenly at higher altitudes Kerbin becomes a much darker shade of blue, with its clouds hovering in a perfectly crystal clear atmosphere. Is there anyway to smooth out this transition between the way Kerbin appears at lower altitudes, vs the way it appears at higher ones? It\u0027s not so much that I mind the change, more so that it\u0027s instant and distracting, rather gradually fading as you get higher above the surface. \n\nOh and one last issue if anyone has any helpful tips for me. Like I mentioned above, I tried messing around with some of the scatter atmosphere config settings to change the appearance of Kerbin. However, I ended up having to do it manually by going in, finding what I was pretty sure would be the right config file (GameData\\scatterer\\config\\Planets\\Kerbin\\atmo.cfg), opened it in Notepad, looked for the specific parameters mentioned in djbcut\u0027s post, then edited and saved the file.
