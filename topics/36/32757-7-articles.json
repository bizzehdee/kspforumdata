Anything installed in the tank before hand needs to be able to survive whatever the tank is filled with (cryogenics, kerosene, or worse yet some of the hypergolics). They need to be engineered so that none of it comes loose and interferes with the flow of the contents of the tank (and since it\u0027s immersed in liquid, the loads are higher than if it were simply in air). They need to be designed so that they don\u0027t trap (and subsequently outgas) any of the tanks contents (a serious problem with H2, kerosene, or worse yet some of the hypergolics, a potential fire hazard in the case of LOX). They need to not interfere with any of the slosh modes inside the tank in such a way as to cause destructive vibrations... etc... etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what the bladders are for!!

I see no reason to perform a second launch when I can essentially pack all the supply contents into the top section of the stage and perform a marginally heavier launch. I wouldn\u0027t try to have any internal rooms or structure pre-installed while fuel is in the tank, I would however have simple tab A into slot B internal fittings preassembled and stacked pancake style in the top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on how much fuel space is sacrificed for equipment, you could easily pack in computers and other assets as well, all in the top portion of the tank. No need for complicated internal structure beyond having one internal wall section reinforced and bolted in to carry the load of the other equipment on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, the internal fuel bladders and fuel lines would need to be removed and packed into some module for deorbiting (perhaps even a lower sub-stage, using the engine of the lifting stage) and some sealing would need to be performed, but you\u0027d be left with a mostly empty cylinder, from there it\u0027d be fairly straightforward to move the internal walls down, one at a time from the top to their intended positions.
