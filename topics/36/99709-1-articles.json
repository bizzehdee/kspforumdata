I wasn\u0027t quite as interested in the mechanics of this stuff back then, but now I\u0027m really wondering how exactly it worked. Gonna have to go look that up again now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: So, I took a look at it and it seems they used an animation. My guess is that the animation is set up to change a specific transform to face a different angle and, from my memories of playing with the part, the animation/transformation is smooth too, but contains no visual change as would usually come from an animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to replicate this you would need a model with an animation attached to that transform (or whatever it is, I\u0027m not model development savvy right now) that modifies the direction that is considered \u0022forward\u0022 on that part, then activate that animation using your favorite animation module in the part config. I was hoping it was actually plugin-based, which would allow me to replicate the functionality to match the function in the control mode toggle plugin (I totally forgot what the plugin is called right now) to do more than just set flight mode. As it is, it wouldn\u0027t be very easy to adapt this for existing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-17T04:20:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MLWostal","CreatedById":134330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T21:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFound a way to do it!
