I believe a part can only have 1 drag cube assigned at a time, but I\u0027m not sure how overlapping cubes would be treated from multiple different parts; though I think that anything that is radially attached gets full drag applied for its cube regardless of if it is actually clipped in/intersecting other cubes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t so much use actual occlusion calculations for drag as far as I can tell; rather it is more node and attach-system based. An uncovered node generates full drag for that face/part, a covered node generates -far- less, though still some. A radially attached part generates full drag for its given orientation to the airstream. Actual clipping and part size-based occlusion is not used; e.g. clipping a surface/radially attached 1.25m fuel tank completely inside of a 2.5m tank will -not- remove its drag in the slightest. Putting -anything- on a node results in the same reduction in drag for the covered node, regardless of the size of part used to cover it (though I believe the different sized parts will themselves have different drag, still resulting in an overall difference to the vessel). If I remember correctly somebodies tests had shown that the best nosecone for nearly anything (from a drag perspective) was the tiny little cubic strut; it had the lowest drag itself (even with an uncovered top-node), and as such is the best suited to cover any other node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers would likely know more though; I\u0027ve tried to stay away from the whole drag-cube system as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-24T03:15:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2015 03:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T19:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeesh... sounds as though the aero system is somewhat awkwardly cobbled together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks again for your help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T19:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile you could add fake drag cubes to the fairings, the problem is it\u0027ll only ever occlude a part stack-attached to it, not parts attached to that first attached part.
