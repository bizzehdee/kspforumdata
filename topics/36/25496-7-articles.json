Dear Nothke,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBan-Anad here, founder and proprietor of the Cabana Corporation! As you may or may not know, Cabana Corp.\u0027s newest project, called the \u0022Expanded \u003Cem\u003ESCIENCE!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Initiative, is looking to... Well... Expand the scientific scope and capabilities of Kerbals in space! In this extent, our Research and Development Department is developing new and exciting experiments for Kerbals to perform while in space. Not only that but our programmers at the \u0022Theoretically Scientific\u0022 Division have been hard at work coding the software for Data Storage Drives! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, while the prospect of storing your experimental data onto hard drives based on Mit value is still rather far off, many of the experiments devised by the \u0022Misapplied Sciences\u0022 and \u0022Occult Practices\u0022 Divisions are mostly done! We... just lack a container of some kind that would allow for the storage of the equipment required to perform said experiments. Because simply duct-taping a hamster onto a solid booster doesn\u0027t end well... for either party. We still have PETA breathing down our necks on that one! Apparently it\u0027s \u0022immoral\u0022 and \u0022unethical\u0022 and... *Off microphone* What\u0027s that other thing they said? Oh!

If so, would you be willing to design several models of the KASPAR payload container with the \u0022Expanded \u003Cem\u003ESCIENCE!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 experiments in mind? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould you accept, you will of course retain any and all copyright and ownership of the containers\u0027 models and design but not their contents which will remain the property of the Cabana Corporation.
