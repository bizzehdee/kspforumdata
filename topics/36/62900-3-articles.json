You managed to catch a bug that doesn\u0027t exist yet where you can no longer recover anything at all! I have no idea how to fix it yet. As for the original issue, I haven\u0027t been able to test it yet. Can anyone confirm it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Yep. That\u0027s a bug! I also learned that Kerbals are being added as parts... Need to go fix that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 3: Well, the Kerbals being parts I\u0027ve probably fixed. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s causing the issue with recovering in the tracking station, since the log says that things are being recovered and the game state is being saved... It appears to be happening any time you recover anything from the tracking station. The temporary solution is likely to not recover anything through the tracking station. It could be because the vessel isn\u0027t loaded, like you suspect. Once I figure out the issues I\u0027m having in my dev version I can probably fix it for next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 4: Simple fix, I forgot to actually care about saving the state during the tracking station scene.

When I released PR3 I asked what people wanted me to focus on: the build list, improving simulations, or crew gui and assorted efforts. No one really gave a direct reply, but it ended up being crew gui \u002B other small stuff. After the next release it will be improving the build list or improving simulations. I imagine the build list will win out, so here\u0027s a list of planned features regarding that: edit a building ship, improve the control of the order, fix up the GUI some, add tech tree support, limit the size of the build list and the vessel storage (unlocking tech nodes will increase the size/allow you to build several ships simultaneously). But first I need to finish this version, which will hopefully be soon, I\u0027ve just got a couple tricky bugs to fix (which may take a while...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I slightly misread you, as I was thinking about editing ships that are currently being built. If the ship is finished and you scrap it, you get all the parts, so any new parts you add are pretty much the only ones that take time to build. I may add something so adding a few parts doesn\u0027t take so long (since new parts are at full value it takes a while the normal way), but at the same time it should take some non-trivial time to add parts to an already complete ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-08T17:40:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2014 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T19:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple dream features I had while half-awake this morning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParallel part manufacturing.
