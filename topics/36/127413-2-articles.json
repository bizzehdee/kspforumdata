really was just a cluster of A-4 motors exhausting into a shared nozzle, but I suspect they had issues making it behave with all the required propellant flows and having all 6 motors not interfering with each other\u0027s thrust through the single exhaust.\u00A0 I\u0027m kinda glad they didn\u0027t.\u00A0 The A-4 is already absurdly complex with it\u0027s 18 pre-combustion mixers, 6 sets of that would have me making so many damned pipes I wouldn\u0027t finish this side of next century.\u00A0 Also, test rigs designed for the expected thrust (360tons, as opposed to the A-10\u0027s 200) were found after the war, so it\u0027s likely the design was tested.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think the dual chamber idea was a large mixing chamber feeding to the main combustion chamber, but I\u0027m just hazarding guesses.\u00A0 The reasons for the A-4\u0027s complexity was that they had trouble getting even mixing and burning with a single large chamber.\u00A0 Leading to hot spots, and unburned fuel inefficiencies.\u00A0 So my premise (read \u0022wild guess\u0022) is they decided to premix fuel and oxidizer to create a more evn combustion.\u00A0 And considering the post war efforts at rocketry, esp in the US, I strongly suspect we know the 2-chamber design (what-ever it was) doesn\u0027t work is because it was tested.\u00A0 The direct successors are the redstone rockets followed by Mercury
