I just have a bit of a code-side mess that I need to clean up to allow the procedural mesh generator to more easily use different UV maps / texture layouts. Honestly, I could just add the texture switching as-is (using the existing UV layouts), but would rather clean up the mess first (would allow for greater re-use of the mesh-generator for other purposes). No particular ETA; this will likely be done when I am working on the procedural interstage decouplers (will be a double decoupler -top\u0026bottom- with integrated ullage engines/rockets and separation rockets; if I can get it all to work out).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E God I can\u0027t wait for these new engines to be textured and such.\n\u003E But the fairing mounts, they\u0027re just a misc thing I was wondering.

I might just include some stock-rescale-patches for the interim for the 1.875 / 5 / 6.25m sizes.\n\nThe finished articles will be very (-very-) similar to the KW rocketry fairing bases; might even use the same setup they have with a standard \u002B widebody base. Have not yet decided entirely if I will be using the stock fairing plugin, or adapt the SSTUNodeFairing module to be piecewise buildable.\n\nUsing the stock module would come with all the pros\u0027 and cons\u0027 that the stock fairings have (confetti, lack of control, a bit fiddly trying to make certain shapes, but works reliably and is quite configurable).\n\nUsing the SSTUNodeFairing (or derivative) would have its own set of pros\u0027 and cons\u0027 to deal with. Would be highly configurable but would have a very complex GUI/setup system (I\u0027m not interested in doing the mouse-driven system from stock; unless they have an easily usable API that I could just plug into); would require custom setting the height/radius for each segment individually, and would not pre-generate curves the way that stock does (you would have to generate whatever curve you wanted manually). However I could set it up to create sections whatever way was needed (e.g. split 2/3/4 section fairings lengthwise) rather than the stock confetti. Still a ways out on these though, so a bit of time yet to think this through / figure out the best methods.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E By fairing bases I meant the engine fairings around the SIC. Will it have an area to attach fins?\n\nAs already stated, yes. The engines and mounts will be surface attachable / you will be able to attach fins to them. Will it have a specific area intended -just for fins-, or attach nodes for them? No. Put them wherever you want, as many as you want, in whatever pattern/arrangement you want, angled whichever way that you want. (For reference, it will have the collider faces aligned properly for surface-attachment at those points, so they be able to be just slapped on there and \u0027just work\u0027)\n\nEdit:\n\nWill be posting up a .craft file here in an hour or so for testing of the radial decouplers.

If not, there is little point to doing any tests, as the results would not really tell me anything more than I already know (that there is a conflict/config problem somewhere).\n\n So, set up a clean KSP instance (can copy the entire ksp folder, clear the GameData folder of everything but squad, sstu, and module manager). Either start a new game and add the test craft to that games ships\u0027 folder, or drop it in with the stock craft files (KSP/Ships/Vab). \n\nThe first test will be without KJR, to ensure that the baseline in stock works consistently. Load up the test craft and launch it. Without struts (or KJR) the SRBs should sag pretty badly (See figure 1). Please take a screenshot at this point for comparison if anything looks different. Press the staging button to activate the SRBs. After the initial pad-explosion flames subside, you should see something very similar to figure 2 - if not, please screenshot it for comparison. If anything does not look like the posted shots for figure 1 or 2, please include logs in your post as well.\n\nThe next test will be with KJR installed. Install KJR into the the previously setup testing instance. Go through the same steps of launching and comparison as before. The intended results are in figures 3 and 4. If your results differ, please post screenshots \u002B logs \u002B your KJR config files (let me know if you need help with those).\n\nFinally, load the test craft file into your normal playing KSP setup, and repeat the test a third time. If you have do not have KJR installed, you should see results as per figures 1 and 2. If you do have KJR installed, you should see results as-per figures 3 and 4. If neither of these is true, please post screenshots, if you have KJR installed or not, and any relevant information related to the mods installed.\n\nThank you for your help in tracking down this issue, and sorry for the long and convoluted testing process. Unfortunately, due to potential mod conflicts or other strange interaction, this is the only way that I will know where to even begin investigating potential solutions, or if they are even a problem on my end and not some other mod interaction/\u0027feature\u0027.\n\nFigure 1: Stock, no-KJR, unlit SRBs\n\n![PuzilUs.png](http://i.imgur.com/PuzilUs.png)\n\nFigure 2: Stock, no-KJR, lit SRBs\n\n![32hxIzN.png](http://i.imgur.com/32hxIzN.png)\n\nFigure 3: KJR installed, unlit SRBs\n\n![ekrkUXG.png](http://i.imgur.com/ekrkUXG.png)\n\nFigure 4: KJR installed, lit SRBs\n\n![hL0Z64n.png](http://i.imgur.com/hL0Z64n.png)\n\nYes, there is a few degrees worth of sag even with KJR installed.

It would involve making use of the MultiModeEngine module, and a custom resource for the jettison motors (JettisonFuel or somesuch; doesn\u0027t matter at this point). I would then add a third custom module that would watch for a staging actions, or watch for the part being detached from the craft, and it would activate the MultiModeEngine switch and/or force-activate the secondary jettison engine module. And as MultiModeEngine/switching is fully supported through MJ and KJR, this solution would be fully compatible for the mods that I would be using.\n\nThis would not obsolete the new booster-decoupler either, as it could still be used for liquid fueled boosters and non SSTU SRBs. About the only bit I haven\u0027t figured out would be how to manage the top end thrust transforms / disable the jettison motors when the flat-cap is selected (stack attached rather than radial). I guess I could even just check for that in the plugin, and/or have manual control to enable/disable the jettison motors.https://www.dropbox.com/s/xzucor55n9t9mhg/JointTestCraft.craft?dl=0\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E sweet ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E [snip]\n\u003E \n\u003E are you talking about tanks or engines?\n\u003E \n\u003E for tanks, here\u0027s an example of a MM patch that you can use to make your very own tank (just remove the RO stuff in it): [https://github.com/FFCJoseEduardo/RealismOverhaul/blob/a533058d61fd8eef2224cf56d984a9d1d7b1ad48/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RO_SuggestedMods/SSTU/SSTU_Tanks.cfg#L683-L778](https://github.com/FFCJoseEduardo/RealismOverhaul/blob/a533058d61fd8eef2224cf56d984a9d1d7b1ad48/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RO_SuggestedMods/SSTU/SSTU_Tanks.cfg#L683-L778)\n\u003E \n\u003E for engines, just take a look at the engines folder, the examples there can be used as base, the clusters in the albums I posted in the last page were made based on them\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Could you maybe add support for 0.9375m, 1.875m, 3.125m, and other interrim sizes used by modders?\n\nAs noted, the support exists, I merely don\u0027t ship configs for some of it.

I\u0027m not too far along, so I\u0027ll see about some mock-ups to see how it would look/work out.\n\nEither way, fuel-resources can easily be added to any of the single-mount (non-switchable) engine clusters either directly or through patching.

Allowing layout swapping by the mount-option definition for any layout with the same number of engines (cannot add/remove engines, only reposition them; stock limitation that I cannot workaround without introducing incompatibilities with tons of mods). This would allow for several mount/layout options for, for example, a 3x rs-25 cluster.\n\n2.) Allow per-mount-option overrides of the layout spacing. This would allow for, for example, the SLS mount to be rescaled and re-used at 6.25m for the 4-engine cluster all within the same part, as well as potentially combining it with any other 4-engine variants/mount options.\n\nThese two changes / enhancements would basically just allow for a bit more editor-part-count reduction, by combining the various mounts and layouts for a single engine type-count-combo into a single part, rather than potentially one part-per mount option.\n\nMost of the support is already there. The per-mount-option layout spacing override would be like 2-3 short lines of code.

It seems to be somewhat intermittent.\n\nRan into this myself today, and think I have a test-case that can reproduce it reliably, so I should be able to get this one cleaned up for this weekend.\n\nEdit: And, resolved. Was a bug in the parsing code for restoring from persistent data... that would only effect the 2nd and subsequent fairing sub-parts for a module. All cleaned up now though, will be available with the next release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-03T03:57:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T03:30:20Z","Content":"May I offer a suggestion.

Until then I am A: Trying to keep the dev releases a bit more stable, and B: Trying to not overload myself with work to pack up and test new releases all the time (I generally do ~3 hours of testing before each release, and this is just not something I have time to do during the week while still making any new progress)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T16:19:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Think I also found/realized a few improvements that I can make to the engine cluster module now that things are a bit more settled/finalized.\n\u003E 1.) Allowing layout swapping by the mount-option definition for any layout with the same number of engines (cannot add/remove engines, only reposition them; stock limitation that I cannot workaround without introducing incompatibilities with tons of mods). This would allow for several mount/layout options for, for example, a 3x rs-25 cluster.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.) Allow per-mount-option overrides of the layout spacing. This would allow for, for example, the SLS mount to be rescaled and re-used at 6.25m for the 4-engine cluster all within the same part, as well as potentially combining it with any other 4-engine variants/mount options.\n\u003E \n\u003E [...snip...]\n\nThese two enhancements have been implemented in the dev-branch and seem to be working quite well. Still have a bit more testing/verification to do on them, but so far, so good. I made a test engine cluster using 3x RS-25; and have it swapping between several mounts, with different spacing and engine-layouts on a per-mount basis. Seems like it was a good addition, and was very clean to implement (as opposed to hacky)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T16:20:39Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s what I was saying, but are you going to fix that issue with the ICPS?"}]}
