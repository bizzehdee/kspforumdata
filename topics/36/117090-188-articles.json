They\u0027ll look black (or very dark orange) when not reflecting any light, but should be highly reflective/high-gloss value with colored reflection (can see this done in the SC-A-SM solar panels -- they are textured as black, but reflect gold/yellow light).\n\nRe: RimFalloff/RimHighlighting -- There won\u0027t be any actual transparency in the parts, will be all faked through the shader/lighting.  And as I\u0027m writing my own shader(s)... I can do some things with it that you can\u0027t do with the stock KSP shaders.  Doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027ll be able to get it working/looking good... but I\u0027m going to give it a try ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  (may be something like reading the RimFalloff value from the alpha channel in the specular texture, to allow for variance across the texture/faces).\n\nWould also like to figure out how to get some of the prismatic reflection effect that happens on some of the solar panels... may require yet-more custom shader work though (probably pretty easy to do through a shader actually).\n\nBasic resources on the subject: [http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch16.html](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch16.html)\n\nOn that note, wrote up a \u0027custom shader applicator\u0027 yesterday.  This will allow me to run my models through PartTools using the standard KSP shaders, but replace them with the custom shaders (and material/textures) during KSP\u0027s database loading, prior to parts being compiled.  Basically just a workaround to Unity\u0027s Shader.Find() not working with user-added shaders... but allows for a PartModule-less solution to setting custom shaders and textures on model prefabs (which will then be cloned to the actual models used by the parts and icons).  As it also supports setting of textures (needed for the custom shaders), this gives an opportunity to \u0027override\u0027 whatever texture a model was exported/compiled with... basically just a small version of TextureReplacer."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T21:59:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/29/2016 at 2:16 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just keep making more awesome models ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Yours are some of the few \u0027stock-alike\u0027 textured models that I think look nice and don\u0027t make me cringe; I think its mainly due to the use of AO/shading and the \u0027abstract\u0027 level of detail on your models (not spartan, but not \u0027busy\u0027 looking either; a good middle-ground).\n\u003E \n\nDaww.

Or, who knows, I may do them up myself for my next career playthrough (which likely isn\u0027t too far off).\n\nTesting out (okay.. playing with) shaders a bit more. \n\nRim-lighting was not really the answer I was looking for, as that was based on view direction and surface normal... which means it is present even with no light in the scene (or at least the KSP implementation of it).  However the rim-lighting is used by the in-game part highlight functions so it is probably good to have support for it anyway.\n\nAdded \u0027back-light\u0027 capability based on alpha channel in specular mask, using specular color/map for the color data; effect amount is based on the (clamped) negative dot between view direction and lighting direction; so if you are staring at the panels with the sun behind them, it\u0027ll light them up/make them glow a bit.  Basically a very cheap type of semi-transparency or sub-surf-scatter effect; you can\u0027t \u0027see\u0027 through it, but bright light can pass through at some angles. \n\nIn the image below the light source is a directional light pointing mostly at the camera, the two orange tones on the panels are differences in the \u0027back-light mask\u0027, whereas the black lines are part of the specular color texture (not possible to have backlight without specular reflection on that fragment, a separate \u0027backlight\u0027 texture would fix that limitation though).\n\n![bSk3SHY.png](http://i.imgur.com/bSk3SHY.png)\n\nStill a bit of work to do (on both the texture and shader)... but getting much closer to the desired effect:\n\n![iss-solar-panels-shine.jpg?1340142370](http://www.space.com/images/i/000/018/631/original/iss-solar-panels-shine.jpg?1340142370)\n\nAnd looking at the panels a bit more, there really is an orange band around the edges... still not sure how I feel about it though, and may leave the setup as-is... we\u0027ll see.\n\n(pic for reference)  \n![BJCPKUcCAAAd3dp.jpg-large.jpeg](http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BJCPKUcCAAAd3dp.jpg-large.jpeg)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T16:15:25Z","Content":"For future reference:\n\n![Raptor.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/Raptor.jpg)\n\nRaptor."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T16:29:45Z","Content":"If anyone knows the Methalox F/O ratio for KSP, I have the engine files based off the Merlin 1D and 1DV already (as Elon said the Raptor is roughly the same size as the 1D) with 7.5:1 F/O ratio but don\u0027t know if that is accurate (Methane needs twice the oxygen vs Hydrogen I know, but the ratio is not mole based).

I can work a bit on the exact scaling and follow up here if you are interested.\n\nThe stock docking ports are odd scale wise... The pass-through on standard docking ports is usually 80cm (Apollo was 81cm). Even if the structure around the port brings the outer diameter to 1m, that would make a kerbal scale port 0.64. So the smallest port is actually biggish (which is good given their heads). The 1.25, OTOH, is huge.\n\nThe new IBDM is 1.42m across (outer) with an 80cm passthrough.  The Common Berthing Mechanism outer diameter is about 2m, which to kerbal scale is 1.28---so the larger kerbal ports are CBMs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-01T17:15:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2016 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T18:21:43Z","Content":"Apparently the backlight shader works fine with shadows, and also looks much better after I made it use a separate RGB texture.
