After some thought about whether to put this in Ship Manifest or not, I\u0027ve decide to make it separate mod. So, Ship Checklists is born. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts for checklists go like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA persistent, configurable checklist, by ship and by flight, based on a ship\u0027s template, that can be assigned when the ship is built. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking it should be subassembly aware, and allow you to save checklists to the root node. the final ship checklist is \u0022assembled\u0022 from these subassemblies and can be extended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would account for undocking, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They should be open and flexible, combining free text with some automation (pseudo action groups!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They should allow you to \u0022program\u0022 an action or activity. One button press and the action is completed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They should have check boxes to indicate completion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They should allow you to enter notes during flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They should be persistent. You can quit the game and come back and your list is still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This is where multi-part actions will fit nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan for flow (at this time)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChecklists can be created in the VAB, SPH, preflight, or in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can select from a list of templates, or you can create a new template.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edesign the checklist and it is saved when you save your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use a checklist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen checklist window. Add items, execute items, make notes. Click save after making changes Actions performed by clicking on go are automatically saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When creating the Checklist item, using a set of drop downs, Select the action (Transfer),select resource, select all source parts, select 1 or more target parts, and click ok. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The checklist item is then ready for when you reach that part in the \u0022program\u0022 as NASA used to call it in the day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Clicking the Go button in the checklist item performs the action, and checks the list item.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, any in-flight tweak-able on a part should be available from the checklist as well. Full control in an ordered (and repeatable) way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave as a template for the ship in assembly and you can add to the list for the ship at launch or in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you can save a Checklist for a craft, and have a \u0022This is how you fly it\u0022 included with the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I\u0027d start a development thread so we can discuss anything you may want in this mod.
