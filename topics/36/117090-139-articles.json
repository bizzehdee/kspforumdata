It\u0027s that I had to resize the tanks to match the resized landers.  And the landers were resized so that the docking port matched the port on the Orion which was in turn resized to match the known size.  After resizing everything, I was then trying to list what the newly sized lander/tanks could carry.  Have it all resolved now, though.  Thank you for the assist there.\n\nAs for the RESOURCE thing, ok.

Smaller launcher?\n\u003E \n\nMy designs use gridfins from the launchers mod pack which slow it down (aerobrakes are a good stock alternative), and both use more than 400m/s for landing.\n\nLooking at your earlier post with your falcon 9, i\u0027d recommend that you check whether you really need 9 merlins. (bearing in mind 8 of them only add mass during the landing). If you use Kerbal Engineer, use as many merlins as you need for a TWR of 1.3-1.5 on the pad, no more."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T14:50:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E are these just for adapters or can they become semi-procedural interstages like the soviet ones later on? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I like #1 (mainly because it reminds me a bit of N-1 and Proton interstages) and #2  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E #3 looks kinda fragile\n\u003E \n\nJust adapters; there is no way to do procedural stuff with these.\n\nI do have plans for a model-switchable decoupler, but it would be a standard decoupler (e.g. no retrorockets), and no idea if/when I\u0027ll ever make it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, chrisl said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I like the middle one as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Got another question about SSTUModelSwitch.
