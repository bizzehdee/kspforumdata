Also, if the radar return signal is lower than a certain fraction of the jammer\u0027s strength, the lock will be broken. This means your maximum range for maintaining a lock is smaller.

On modern digital displays, jamming manifests itself in some cute ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, one type of jamming shows up on a digital PPI as a ring that oscillates back and forth (the ring goes to the outer edge of the display then towards the center of the display, and back again), completely concealing the range and bearing of the targets. The closer the jammer is, the faster it moves, and the closer the ring gets to the center of the display on the contraction part of the oscillation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a B scope display (that\u0027s your A2A display you have) it manifests as a line that does the same thing - wavers back and forth between being close to the radar and to the edge of the radar range, and gets worse the closer the jammer gets. Once the jammer is within the ECCM range of the radar, the contact flickers for approximately 2-3 seconds before becoming a solid track... but further targets are still protected by the jammer, so the rings/lines continue. If you want I can make some gifs of what it looks like on both scopes.
