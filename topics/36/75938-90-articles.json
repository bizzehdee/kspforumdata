I don\u0027t have the data right in front of me, but in my tests it really mattered very little what I did to the config because I always broke the wheels right off the bat with anything I used them on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote a MM config to make the ability to break any wheel (stock module) false and have never looked back. Since the way the stock wheels behave is so far from what you would expect in a real-world situation (lack of suspension, bounce due to air-filled tires, or the toughness of airless tires, and the difference between a locking brake and a friction brake which would allow slow-braking and thus no flipping) meant that an invincible wheel was entirely plausible. With lo-fi\u0027s reinvention of the wheel, however, I think a breaking wheel would be entirely doable and usable without too much of a frustration for the end user, as long as it took into consideration the pressure on the part that would be reduced by the number of wheels being used to support the craft and limited breaking based on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that\u0027s that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate on the CollisionFX stuff.

While moving on a surface that \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E produce an effect, the nullrefs cease. It\u0027s only when I am currentlystationary on a surface that is able to produce effects, but is not producing (since there is no active scraping at the time) the dust. I also get nullrefs when moving on a surface that does not produce dust (such as the landscape objects that make up the KSC raised-platform landscape). Details of the log show that it is three functions which are simultaneously producing this exception: \u0022ScrapeParticles\u0022, \u0022Scrape\u0022, and \u0022OnCollisionStay\u0022 which are all functions defined in CollisionFX.dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Link removed, problem has been taken care of.

Oh, you want more proof? Well, I did manage to completely, and (as far as I can tell) 100% fix the CollisionFX issue. How you ask? Well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt goes something like this... I decided that trying to run the dust effects separately from the collision sparks within the same module was jsut too complicated to be worth it. So, I copied the relevant parts of the original code into a new part module that I called \u0022DustFX\u0022 and re-named all the various functions to take into account this new name. It still runs within the namespace \u0022CollisionFX\u0022 but has it\u0027s own module and does not share any information with the original module. This means we get dust, colored to match the biome and/or surface (the KSC raised platform meshes give off a generic white/gray dust while the ground around the KSC (the parts that are not raised and/or are part of the planetary mesh) gets a dirt-colored dust. There are no sound effects, but that is taken care of in the KF wheels themselves using an EFFECT node. I will look into re-implementing the sounds for impacts at a later time. Now I just want to spawn off a third class so that I can re-add the sparks to the specific parts that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E cause sparks on certain materials such as the hypno-drive. That thing would definitely spark as you twist it over the concrete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting will now be a major thing for me, and I need to revert my changes to the original class to eliminate the nullrefs it was producing and still produces right after any of the original sparks are played. Overall, however, this last attempt has been a success. Once I get a chance to take a KF-armed rover to Duna we\u0027ll see if the off-world dust will function and then I will start looking into how this stuff could be exported to a config file for easier color/biome definitions. I\u0027ve never been all that great with putting together albums of screenshots, so you\u0027ll all just have to take my word for it that it\u0027s working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: Woohoo!

It\u0027s also worth pointing out that the effects as they are only really make sense on the tracks. Wheels would likely produce a lot less dust on more solid materials, and likely not produce any such effect on extremely solid surfaces.

I built yours and it still wouldn\u0027t work, turns out I can\u0027t make Module Manager configs or something; had to manually add the module to a set of wheels, then it works. But the dust color switching doesn\u0027t seem to be working. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was just too subtle for me to tell, so I changed dirtColor to red, lightDirtColor to blue and still only gray. Not sure why though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you might want to put the OnPause and OnUnpause events back in, using dustFx.particleEmitter.enabled to pause/unpause the system.
