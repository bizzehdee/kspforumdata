And all those PBR textures... jeez, its cool as hell! \\*drools\\*  \n\nI have a question. Lets say I have a standard MFT-A 2.5m x2.0 lightweight tank filled with LH2:  \n\nSpoiler\n\n![3902e-clip-1132kb.png?nocache=1](https://clip2net.com/clip/m151706/3902e-clip-1132kb.png?nocache=1)\n\nThen the volume of this tank is 5 \\* \u03C0 \\* 2.5^2 \u2248 **98.17 m^3** *(Notice that the menu says its volume is 24.5 m^3 and its usable volume is 20,8 m^3.)*  \n\nNow as we have mass and volume we can calculate LH2 density: m / V = 1475kg / 98.17 m^3 \u2248 **14.025 kg/m^3**  \n\nGoogle says the density of Liquid Hydrogen is something around 70.8 kg/m^3 that is almost 5 times greater.  \n\nIf we consider the told volume (20.8 m^3) then the calculations are correct and the resulting density will be 70.91 kg/m^3.  \n\nI have also looked into the CRP config - it defines LqdHydrogen density as \n\n    density = 0.00007085000\n\nwhich seems to be correct.  \n\nDoes SSTU divide the resulting volume by 5 just to match stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and LOX? Because it fills itself with stock resources correctly. But it seems like a strange solution as it completely breaks the usage of LH2 and other resources.  \n\nMy SSTU version is 0.39.149 (KSP is 1.3.1).  \n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-22T19:11:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2018 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by atomontage**\n  \ngrammar"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-22T19:21:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 29 minutes ago, atomontage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have a question.

Would have a volume of 24.54 m3 (24540 liters)  (pi \\* r^2 \\* h).  So looks like the GUI is correct on the raw volume.  Usable volume should be ~85% of that.\n\nStock resources are defined in 5-liter \u0027units\u0027.  LH2 and other CRP resources are defined in 1-liter \u0027units\u0027.  So yes, there will be a 5x discrepancy if comparing by number of units alone; but the ***volume*** will be the same.  Edit:  Also note that LH2 is extremely \u0027light\u0027 when compared to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel -- it is far less dense, so you will need much more volume in order to get the same mass of propellant.\n\nIf you compare these two screenshots, you can see that the \u0027usable volume\u0027 doesn\u0027t change depending on the resource selected.\n\n![6cVpbWA.png](https://i.imgur.com/6cVpbWA.png)\n\n![DlxdnwH.png](https://i.imgur.com/DlxdnwH.png)\n\n20825 liters of usable volume, filled with LH2, = 1.475451t of propellant (1475.451 kg), which would give a density of:  0.070828331332533  kg/l   or  70.828331332533 kg/m^3  (minor discrepancies likely due to floating-point rounding errors)\n\nSeems like it all checks out to me....\n\nEdit:  Looks like the error in your volume calculations are due to using \u0027diameter\u0027 rather than \u0027radius\u0027.

A real 64% Saturn-V would have a 6.4m diameter S-IC, but stock likely did not want to add even larger fuel tanks.  In SSTU it is entirely possible to have 6.4m tanks (or 6.25m), and the engines fit just fine when everything is done to the proper scale.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that SSTU is really intended to be played with most stock (and other mods\u0027) parts removed or disabled.
