That scramjet seems tto be out of balance on heat. By tthe time I am up to speed to start it and it starts, its almost completely overheated. Also, I would love a mk3 version I think. Plus maybe a bumped up nose. The mk3 shuttle look a like cockpit is close to good, but since it takes some peak re-entry heat and superr sonic heat, I think I need an upgrade. Maybe with a good nose point, as that flat spot I put a 1.25 basic cone on, and looks a little off. \n\nAlso, I wouln\u0027t mind mk2/mk3 mono engines for final work/re-entry efficiency.\n\nI am not expecting any of these, they would be just be nice. Like a couple cargo bays that instead of swing open doors have retracting/roll in doors. Also, on thing I liked from B9 was the cargo bay had radiator features.
