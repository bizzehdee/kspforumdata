But this is about Add-on Development, so without further ado...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start from the beginning, I am playing with Kerbal Konstructs since the 64-bit version of KSP allows me to play with literally any mod i like. Having new launch sites and so on is quite cool, but i was also missing some other buildings on Kerbin. I know ther is the\u00A0Kerbal City project and some other like this, but here the design of the buildings is not Kerbal enough in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo one day, looking something up in Google I stumbled upon \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis...\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eand I knew exactly, that I want it in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222_gioe2g.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://static.domain.com.au/domainblog/uploads/2015/08/07141500/2_gioe2g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am planning to recreate this very cool house for Kerbal Konstructs as my first ever mod for KSP (besides tinkering with cfg files and sometimes with textures)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it my knowledge in CAD modelling might be helpful, but it seems to make it even more complicated. So here is a first look into my progress.
