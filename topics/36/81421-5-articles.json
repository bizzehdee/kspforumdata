Now, if RealFuels wanted to join in, it would require at this point them to see about aligning with some of the analogues we already have in CRP, and that would include some compromises on things like resource names, densities, etc. and I pretty much always welcome that dialogue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, you can also do what UndercoverYankee did with KSPI when Fractal decided to not continue down the interop path Wave was going down with KSPI-L - just build a MM compatibility pack that syncs everything up (either by changing USI stuff to RF, which I recall someone was already working on), or RF to CRP (especially if you use other USI mods or are considering NFT).

A modern rechargable AA battery can easily hold 1500mAh at 1.2V nominal, which equals 1.8 Watt hours. so a 5kg space battery (that\u0027s 11 lbs in old money) holds a fraction over half of the power of a 20g AA cell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when you allow for charging cirtuitry, power management, hardening for space etc. then the batteries in game are actually pretty reasonably balanced for 1U=1kWs when compared to modern DC systems (at least based on commercial UPS units I use in the server rooms here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo setting 1EC/s=33W may well balance solar panels, but it royally throws off all the other electrical systems in game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T12:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, I think ElectricCharge nomenclature is the Viet Nam of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have seen as the most consistent, both in use and on things like the RTG, batteries, etc. is the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 EC/S = 1000 Watts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 EC = 1000 Joules\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T18:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep, I think ElectricCharge nomenclature is the Viet Nam of KSP.\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have seen as the most consistent, both in use and on things like the RTG, batteries, etc. is the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 EC/S = 1000 Watts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 EC = 1000 Joules\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 2 pennies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine how much time someone would need to spend before they might say \u0022I\u0027ve spent an embarrassing amount of time on this idea so I do not want to really tell you how much it has been.\u0022 Now double it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rebalanced my entire game to use a factor of Wh for electric charge.
