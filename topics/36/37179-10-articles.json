Suffice to say there was a lot of noise in the log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun Fact: The way Kethane determines if a drill is penetrating the ground in a place that has kethane is by casting a ray between two points of the drill model and seeing if that ray hits a mesh that is on layer 15 and then determining if the point it hit exists in a hexregion that contains kethane. As such Statics count, and theoretically any part who\u0027s mesh is on layer 15 should also count (mid air kethane mining?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun Fact: The FireSpitter bomber cockpit can survive a fall from 10Km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razchek","CreatedById":62645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T14:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.11 Beta Released\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbTown now manipulates the FlightCamera to chase selected Static Objects.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbTown now remembers the last launch site used (if it still exists).
