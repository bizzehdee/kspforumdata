For the secondary question if I had a doors, do I need a group of frames for the open and close animation or do I only need one way and KSP will automatically use the reverse as the close?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OOnkQpZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OOnkQpZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steedcrugeon","CreatedById":168050,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T10:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should probably be moved to the modelling and textures sub-forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nregardless, are you using the old nifty255 videos as tutorials? I did the same when I\u00A0started learning to mod KSP. With the latest version of Unity you can use the [add physics -\u0026gt; mesh collider and check \u0022is convex\u0022 tick box] this will give you a collider for the object in question (it\u0027s how I\u00A0achieve the peculiar shaped colliders used by the REKT OTAV pod). This mean that you don;t need to create a separate mesh collider. However given the shape above i\u0027m guessing it\u0027s going to be some kind of storage bay. In which case i\u0027d advise splitting the object into 3 (top cylinder, bottom cylinder and the central shaft). Then given them each their own mesh collider with \u0027is convex\u0027 checked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP will automatically reverse your \u0027deploying\u0027 animation. for instance: closing cargo bay doors is opening cargo bay doors, just played backwards. So yes, you only need to make the one animation to cover that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
