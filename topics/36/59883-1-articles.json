At least at first. Since tree.cfg already as part assignments, any tree manager would essentially trim away the parts that are not installed every time a user chooses to do so. During the trim process, the manager would revalue each node depending on how much science value in parts had been removed from each node and adjust the nodes\u0027 costs accordingly. Right now, I have an excel sheet that essentially does the trimming and the revalueing, the only problem is that the user must have TreeEdit and Excel or similar installed and do some work as outlined below to complete the process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Edownload tree.cfg, put in save folder\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eopen your save file in KSP\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Egoto research and development, if you have treeloader installed and this is your first time there is will ask you to sellect a tree, I always click stock here\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epress F5 to save locally, this will overwrite the existing tree.cfg with the one loaded into TreeEdit, all parts that are not loaded into KSP will not be put into the tree.cfg file but all nodes will remain otherwise intact\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ereturn to KSP\u0027s main title screen\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ealt\u002Btab to excel, load the revaluer \u0027program\u0027\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eopen tree.cfg in a text editor\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ecopy the text from tree.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epaste the text to the excel program in the space indicated\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ecopy the output text back into tree.cfg and save\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ego back to KSP and reload your save file \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Edone\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can see why I am hesitant to require this process just to change the cost of the nodes, even if it make the experience better. For now I have friends willing to help write a program to do all this behind the scenes. Eventually I would like it to have some sort of rudimentary sorting system of its own, so there may never be an unsupported mod again for this tech tree. I imagine it would be pretty simple, or even user driven to help understand the function and category of various parts so it knew where to place them and have generic cost modifiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now a problem I see is how to treat the parts\u0027 science value. Some parts are obviously more valuable than others, while others still, as pointed out by cxg, do not neccesarily contribute to science production, so they may or may not even change node pricing. Currently there are 2,270 parts assigned to the TechTree, and to give each part a relative science value might take a bit of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it is through supply and demand. The tree is there to supplies the user\u0027s demands for parts and technology to a degree, but mostly for parts. Ideally, to solve this would be to lock the parts themselves from the user until they pay for them piecemeal after first buying access to the node for an amount that never changes between mod sets, something that I do not know if it is even possible to do right now without over-writing R\u0026amp;D entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cxg2827\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cxg2827\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs your idea to increase the science requirements for nodes when using parts pack suck as KW rocketry and NovaPunch, or is it more for mods/add-ons that add parts that don\u0027t have a stock equivalent, such as the ALCOR, BOBCAT Colonization, Kethane, etc?\u003Cp\u003EI personally almost exclusively use KW parts because it gives cleaner looking rockets. I don\u0027t think parts like these really give an advantage over the stock ones as it just gives a different look, rather that provide any advantage over stock (maybe just the engines, as some I think might be more powerful than the stock equivalents).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps, Started trying out your vertical tree last night. Nice work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like the science costs in R\u0026amp;D to be more meaningful and not as arbitrary. A goal of mine is to make using R\u0026amp;D feel more researchy (giving me an idea for another related mod). The tree kind of does what I want by putting bigger and better parts higher up, but take away any user experience from reading some of the descriptions and the entire tree just feels like a store selling parts rather than technological research department, which is little different from how I feel about the stock tree. But, until reforms are made with the research and development via Squad or mods, the parts store view is still the best way to look at the TechTree I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, something that would be interesting is if in addition to parts, buying nodes also unlocked performance or abilites, just as MechJeb does with its modules, and dynamically. Imagine if when you load KSP, the techtree manager builds MM configs or similar that suppress the performance or abilites of most parts, such as engine thrust/isp being diminished and increased incrimentally with buying certain nodes, or gimballing is locked until you buy the node containing the relavent research. Or modifications to the mass of parts as better materials are researched. Or any variable really for that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as part packs like KW and NP2, using the tech tree like a store and science like money imbues value even to these kinds of parts that are technologically/performancly similar to stock parts. Unfortunately, that value cannot be conveyed unless it is grouped with parts of the same value, otherwise it is worth the average value of all the parts in the node. (A thousand or so nodes is probably impractical as well, each with only a couple of parts in it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to make a longer post long, there are mods that add a little to a lot of science potential to the game and these should have the effect of increasing the total science cost of all the nodes that lie beyond the science giving parts. For this the manager must know the structure of the tech tree and what parents what. I did this in excel, so I should think C# can handle it too.. I did however need more than 4.5 million cells to map out the connections for 146 nodes, now there are 188 nodes and more than the difference in new connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoy the TechTree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nelien","CreatedById":65665,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T00:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miracmert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022miracmert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA little idea: Maybe you can make a little client that works like a manager, and as you load mods into that client it automatically integrates those mods into the tech tree and than it adds specific amount of science points into nodes.

I find the concept of a vertical tree intriguing, but if I can\u0027t launch and reasonably recover a vehicle with the first node, it\u0027s a deal breaker.

It is supposed to shine a light on the fact that at one point, the Kerbals had no rockets. This is what it was like in my version of the historic accounts. They started with a truss and a capsule.
