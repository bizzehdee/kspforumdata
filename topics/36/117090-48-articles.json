Here\u0027s why:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*BEGIN LONG WINDED TECHNICAL DISCUSSION\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hydrolox engines have much higher Isp than kerolox engines, but in real life that comes at a price - you need much larger tank volume and you have to deal with boiloff.  In KSP, neither of those things exist, so using raw, real world I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E numbers for the comparison is going to make hydrolox engines look very good and kerolox engines look bad.  So I think it might make sense to scale the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E based on the mixture before doing the comparison.  KSP engines have I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E values pretty close to real world kerolox engines (well, actually a bit closer to hypergolics but the difference is only about 5%.  The conversion factor that RealFuels uses to compare I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E between hydrolox and kerlolox engines is 1.27 (vacuum) / 1.3 (sea level).  Applying a scale of 1.27 would give the RL10 a vacuum Isp of 364s, which is high for stock engines, but not way outside the range (particularly considering how low the thrust is).  If you apply the hypergolic scaling too, you get 346s ... at this point it might be more reasonable to apply the scaling you did to begin with.\n\u003E \n\nMy personal view on the KLOX / HLOX rift for stock is this:   Stock -has- LH2; it is just the same density as RP1, offers minimal ISP increase, and just happens to be named \u0027LiquidFuel\u0027 as well.  If I take a look at the stock poodle and LV-909; I have a hard time seeing those as anything but vacuum optimized lh2 engines.  The only real problem with this is that some of the stock RP1 engines creep upwards into LH2 territory a bit too far (ISP wise); if a few could be knocked down 10-15 ISP, this rift in stock engine types would become even more apparent.\n\nThis general view places hypergolics/monopropellants in the ~300-ISP range; standard RP1 at ~310, and LH2 at the higher end ~350.  \n\nHowever, I\u0027m not going to say that the balance on my engines is final; its not.  It is mostly a first-pass, with zero manual tweaking (so far).  After I have developed a few more of the \u0027main\u0027 engine variants, I will likely take another good look at the balance and see what needs to be tweaked.  The problem with trying to do it now is that there are some apparent gaps that will be filled by new engines, rather than filling them by re balancing existing engines.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)  Re the RO/Plumes thing: An \u0022easy\u0022 fix (in terms of not changing your code) would be to make a modular mount to let us just mount the separate engines on and that has an interstage node should anyone want to use a cluster on a second stage.

If you want to set them up as such, go for it; nothing stopping you.  You could certainly make traditional stock-like parts with the engines; they use a regular old .mu model file just like any other KSP part. \n\nSeriously though, there -is- a way to get those patches working, you just need to figure it out yourself, or -wait- until i can figure it out.

Keep in mind you will need to find some other way to handle the animation on those engines;  the stock ModuleAnimateGeneric -might- work for it.  Could also leave the SSTUAnimateControlled in place, and add an SSTUAnimateUsable as the user-interface module for it (examples of this can be seen in the LanderCore parts for the ladder-extension functionality).

Not sure how I\u0027ll get it situated on the 0.625m ports (as they will use much more of their internal space/no room for cubbies).\n\n![GTkS6vP.png](http://i.imgur.com/GTkS6vP.png)\n\nStill not sure how to integrate the lights without external stuff.  Hmm..... mayhaps I could make them an animated-deployable bit (that would come out of cubbies on the other 3rds of the model).   Thoughts?  \n\nTrying to think a bit more long-term on these docking ports, as I know I want to use the same (or -very similar-/compatible) geometry for the station parts when I get there.\n\nAnd in doing all of this playing around with existing \u0027finished and textured\u0027 geometry for the docking port, I\u0027ve learned a few techniques that will make it easier to do geometry changes in the future.  Massive changes will still require a re-uv layout and full-new texture, but for -some- things I might be able to rework existing geometry without requiring a full re-do of the part.  No matter what though, **any** geometry change still requires redoing the AO bake (in part or in full); which for some models might still take many hours to break up the model, do the bake, and re-combine the model.  So... still don\u0027t expect me to go about reworking/changing existing finished models too much; but I know have a few tools that I can use in those cases where it **really** is needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T23:05:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think it might be doable - I\u0027ll take a look if I have time.  Overriding the events is easy ... now that I think about it, action groups might be the hard part.\n\u003E \n\nThinking more on this; seems like it should all/mostly be doable from an external class.  Have the \u0027Deploy Animation Module\u0027 have its own set of \u0027Activate Engine\u0027 gui and action group methods; during its init pass, go in and disable all of the ModuleEngines own action groups and gui event fields (through the Actions[] and Events[] accessors); from then on you can route all interaction with the ModuleEngines through the \u0027Deploy Animation Module\u0027\u0027s own gui and action group stuff and/or publicly accessible methods.  Basically it would be throwing a wrapper around the ModuleEngines user-interface stuff and routing it through the \u0027Deploy Animation Module\u0027 user-interface and methods first.\n\nIt is a bit of a workaround, but it might actually be cleaner implementation-wise in the end than the existing code.  Will likely play around with this tonight after I get the bugfix release cleaned up / packaged / posted.\n\nAnd one more test of the docking port geometry; with integrated and deployable lights/camera geometry.  Definitely looking like a better setup and implementation, and will likely be sticking with this or something -very- similar.\n\nHeck, the geometry is clean enough that I\u0027ll likely only do a single stand-alone version of the docking ports -- with parachutes and docking lights for all! (where if you don\u0027t want them, just don\u0027t use them!)\n\n![s1dpCTj.png](http://i.imgur.com/s1dpCTj.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-23T23:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T23:42:37Z","Content":"Docking camera, cool!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T01:01:11Z","Content":"are the adjustable fueltanks n stuff realy nessesary? because theres a mod that does *exactly* that , procedural parts, has procedural SRBS with adjustable thrust, vaccum oriented or surface oriented ISPs, size, diameter, height, texture, even shape: u can have cone shapped, orb, smooth curve, and more shapes of SRBs."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T02:35:35Z","Content":"Proc Parts is a huge load on my CPU for some reason.

Deployment altitudes are configurable in flight. The chute safety indicator seems to be working as intended. The engine bell warmed up to a nice red glow when hot, a little less red than most of the engines you have (then again i was in the sunlight), but it was real enough to know it was hot, so tuning it down isn\u0027t really necessary, at least not on my computer. The only real issue is the staging of the parachute. It -says- it\u0027s staged, but it doesn\u0027t show it\u0027s staged on the stage list icons. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s intentional, a minor thing or something that comes with the territory on modifications such as this. \n\nAnother thing that caught my attention is that you have two control options in the gui on the a series pod. I know you were going for a one piece system on this, but couldn\u0027t you put a difference in control, like \u0022control from command module\u0022 and \u0022control from docking port\u0022 to tell the difference? It may of been a silly request, but that\u0027s all I seen. But, as far as the parachutes, they work great and nice coloring on the pod chute. that red/olive drab is awesome! Drogues and chutes work as intended. If there\u0027s anything I missed, I\u0027m sure Jim will pick it up lol. \n\nEDIT: The parachute module shows staging and is configurable in the bay and in flight, sorry forgot to mention that. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T04:23:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lynwoodm**"}]}
