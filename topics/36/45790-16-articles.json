The takeoff mass right now is only a little less than the real Skylon takeoff mass iirc, so I can safely remove more resources to keep the mass proportional to its scale. I\u0027m aiming to achieve a 300km orbit with a heavy payload, with enough resources left to deorbit, and fly about a bit in the atmosphere.

It had 10,000 oxygen, and 22,000 hydrogen balanced evenly between both tanks.
