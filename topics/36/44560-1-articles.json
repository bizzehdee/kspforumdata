Retractable solar panels and RCS thrusters have been omitted for clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I wanted to address was the Service Module. Supernovy has made two versions of a combined Service Module (Fuel/RCS/Battery/Reaction Wheel), and while I am currently happily using it for my own setup, I personally found the pre-0.18-eqsue texture to be a little jarring. Also, while the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo Service module\u003C/a\u003E was mostly exposed during launch, I didn\u0027t like the idea of RCS thrusters and stowed solar panels being subjected to atmospheric drag at liftoff (retracting the latter does prevent breakage, but it is not aesthetically pleasing). As such, my intention is for my Service Module design to have a 2.5 m-ish mating section with the Command Pod as well as a narrower rear section covered by ejectable side fairings containing the solar panels, thrusters, and some other neat little surface-attached accessories I had in mind for future releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027ve noted that some folks had concerns over the use of docking ports and parachutes. Currently, the only stock solutions are to either choose between having a docking port or a parachute at the apex of the pod, or to carefully position radial parachute packs into the sloped sides of the pod (no easy feat). My current idea is to combine both into one assembly, with the parachute stowed in a side compartment built into the docking port and triggered through staging or action groups as usual. MODEL{} nodes would allow me to reuse the mesh of the stock Clamp-o-tron for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also realized that the new IACBM docking ports from my FusTek pack are (deliberately) incompatible with Clamp-o-trons, and so I will be including an IACBM variant of the parachute-enhanced docking port as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of the Service Module\u0027s main engine, I decided that just the stock Rockomax LV-909 would suffice; however, it will come as a variant without the auto-fairings (since I already have fairings for the Service Module proper).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA heat shield has been thrown in for good measure; I have no idea how to make it Deadly Reentry compatible (as I don\u0027t use the mod myself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I won\u0027t be making an Escape Tower, since not everyone would use one, and mods like KSPX and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/prilla-launch-escape-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBFGfreak\u0027s Prilla LES\u003C/a\u003E would already suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWork In Progress (WIP) parts available for download\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k1gbdeb3rq3jrqr/ksp_sdhi_sms_v1_0.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E - this link will be updated irregularly with newly-completed parts, so check back regularly!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T23:39:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T07:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to see what you can do with this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T07:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sum Dum\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDum Dum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENight at the museum? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archer","CreatedById":10378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T20:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick question, are your IACBM\u0027s the same thickness as the stock clamp-o-trons?
