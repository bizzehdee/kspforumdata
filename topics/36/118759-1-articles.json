It seems like they practically show the game where it has to simulate the parts drag or so. Maybe you know it, but I am working on the 1.0 release of my Atlas V rocket, and I have big issues with the 500 variants fairings. I first thought, because they are so big, and because the Aero doesn\u0027t supports these kind of Fairings, that their size would be the reason which makes the rocket flip over. But now, Thomas P. Kerman made the dragcubes of my Fairing visible and discovered this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RuSS29J.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RuSS29J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, those are the dragcubes. And now you can clearly see why this thing flips over every time. Now, I wan\u0027t to change those automatically generated dragcubes, but I don\u0027t have any idea how. I know that the game-generated drag cubes can be found in the PartDatabase, and I found this for that Fairing there: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E DRAG_CUBE\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E {\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E cube = Default, 126.6394,0.7717016,2.786276, 126.6394,0.8077257,2.706669, 11.37778,0.3338757,7.917125, 11.37778,0.4912322,23.55094, 62.35514,0.7758831,2.789024, 62.35514,0.7709386,2.789024, 1.35,12.67764,-4.533876E-06, 2.700002,25.35527,5.40001\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E }\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what the ... are all those numbers?

I\u0027d guess on the sides of the model, and when the model changes (like getting thinner) I\u0027d place them there too.
