In which case, feel free to test them out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  If you felt like playing with the \u0027balance\u0027 on them, you can alter (or add) the fluxMult parameter to the SSTUHeatShield module (default = 1; increase it to increase heat-load-capacity of the shield, decrease it to lower the heat-load capacity).\n\n@PART[SSTU-SC-GEN-MHS]  \n\n{  \n\n    @MODULE[SSTUHeatShield]  \n\n    {  \n\n        %fluxMult = 1  \n\n    }  \n\n    @MODULE[SSTUModularHeatShield]  \n\n    {  \n\n        @SHIELDTYPE,\\*[\\*]  \n\n        {  \n\n            %ablationMult = 1  \n\n        }  \n\n    }  \n\n}\n\nDrop that patch into a .cfg file somewhere in your GameData directory, and then alter the fluxMult value to adjust it for different heat-loads.   After heat-loading has been balanced, you can adjust the ablationMult if you find yourself running out of ablator too early or have too much ablator.  Lower = use more ablator, higher = use less ablator (it is a multiplier to the efficiency of each unit of ablator resource).  (Patch untested, written off the top of my head... but it -should- work.. or looks like it should work at least ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) )\n\nThat same patch could/would be used for solar-system rescales (though I\u0027ll likely fix the ablationMult bit to be a single-line patch in the SSTUHeatShield module, rather than fixing it on a per-shield type basis).  For larger systems, you would use larger values for both flux and ablation multipliers.\n\nWhat I would -really- like to do for the heat-shields, is derive a formula that could be used to balance them for specific scenarios.  But I have no idea how stock caclulates the heat load, and thus now way to derive such a formula.\n\nIts something like heatLoadFlux = (extTemp - skinTemp) \\* exposedArea   -- but not exactly; and therein lies the problem -- there appear to be several other coefficients at play that I\u0027m unfamiliar with.  I\u0027ve sucessfully negated the \\*exposedArea part of the equation (used for the MHS parts to make them perform the same regardless of size), but cannot fathom how they are deriving the temperature input; especially as it relates to speed and atmospheric density (and I think each planet has a specific heating multiplier as well, to account for different gas types perhaps?)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T15:38:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E RoverDude has said he\u0027s looking at his own EPL-type functionality at some point, FWIW.\n\u003E \n\nThat would be nice -- would like to support (by default/as-shipped) a single production chain.

There is zero reason for three separate resources from a gameplay perspective, all it does is clutter up the part menu and resource list unnecessarily.  From a realism perspective...well.. they likely recycle/are reclaimed/re-used at different ratios... but that could all be abstracted into the \u0027loss factor\u0027 for the single-resource setup as well.  This is why I lean towards (and will only personally support) USI-LS; it is -just- as complex as it needs to be (from a resource perspective; I have not touched/played with any of the hab stuff, though I can\u0027t say that I\u0027m a fan of it given what I\u0027ve read on it so far).\n\nIVAs -- unfortunately they cannot work like that; you cannot stack IVA models as each kerbal seat requires a uniquely named transform.  If you duplicate the models, the transform names are duplicated, not renamed sequentially like would be needed.  This would have to be done by using several pre-made IVAs for each internal setup, and swapping between them at runtime -- which I\u0027m not sure is possible; the part loading sequence caches a ton of IVA related stuff, and I\u0027m unsure how to force-reload it when the IVA setup changes, or if it is even possible.  Overall I\u0027m just going to ignore IVAs.  Someone else can figure them out if they want to spend the time on it.\n\nStation parts -- still in the very early concept dev stage on them... no clue yet what they will entail.  I aim to use the upcoming yet-to-be-implemented module-switching functionality to allow a single part to serve a multitude of potential functions, and to enable a truly modular setup for those parts.  Should be quite capable of making \u0027single part\u0027 stations for most simpler designs, or using the modules (parts) in combination for larger/more complex stations.
