The transponder will scan the antennas on the vessel and adopt the stronger of the strongest single active antenna, or combined power of combinable active antennas, and present itself to CommNet as a relay antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach transponder has a maximum power. Multiple transponders may be added to a vessel increase the maximum possible relaying power. The transponders have no transmission capability on their own - the power will never exceed that of your antennas. Bandwidth as a limiting factor would seem to make more sense, but that does not appear to come into play on an unloaded vessel that is acting as a relay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETODO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears to work but needs harsher testing.

Non relay antennas are much lighter and cheaper than relay antennas with the same range.

As far as I\u0027m concerned if you can make the connection and have the hardware installed to relay it\u0027s a go. My motivation here is to provide more choices in antenna selection. There\u0027s the obvious gain of being able to relay with any antenna. But also with the relay ability\u00A0decoupled from the antenna, we\u0027re\u00A0potentially able to de-relay the relay antennas and lower the mass (and cost) accordingly, making them useful for general purposes. With an antenna in the RA-100 class that\u0027s worth a half a ton of weight removed from a probe that has no need to provide relay services.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe range limitation (which was admittedly an afterthought) is to maintain balance and there may be a better way of going about it. I\u0027m still pondering some sort of\u00A0bandwidth limit but I have my doubts that will work. The idea is the mass (and cost) removed from the relay antennas goes into the transponder parts. A\u00A0small 50kg unit that could enable an HG-5 sized relay would not work on an RA-100. You\u0027d need a half ton of equipment for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronCretin","CreatedById":158162,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T17:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s actually a stock module that does some of this, iirc.
