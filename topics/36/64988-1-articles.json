The straightforward way is simply assign actions to an action group and ignore if ships are docked or not. However, that means that the player has to keep things straight so that the same functions are in the same groups when designing their vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have heard complaints about groups getting confused when vessels dock because different functions are assigned to the same group number but I\u0027m not sure if I need to worry about it as this mod will have so many action groups you can assign groups 1-15 for vessel 1 and groups 16-30 for vessel 2 so that when they dock they stay separate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if I do it that way, the keybinds are different for vessel 1 and 2 as for vessel 2, group 16 is group \u00271\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I make it so a key can be bound to multiple action groups, that way the same key activates both group 1 and group 16 so it performs the same function on both vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T04:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t think about action groups in numbers, from a users perspective.

I will be offering the option to rename groups though so they have user-friendly names. I have no plans for merging groups by name or anything like that for the initial release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of the initial release, here\u0027s a relatively firm list of features. No guarantees but I\u0027m now making the UI so any changes are more likely to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntegration with KSP\u0027s default action groups.\u003C/strong\u003E Action Groups 1 - 10 will stay managed by default KSP. Any changes made through this mod will be saved back so that if the mod is uninstalled, those actions will still be in the correct groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIncrease the available Action Groups up to 260\u003C/strong\u003E, to be displayed in groups of 20 in the UI. In the code only groups that have actions assigned will be loaded into memory so there should be no performance hit for supporting that many groups. This will be a hard limit however, my comments from earlier in the thread about increasing the number of groups being easy is no longer valid as increasing past 260 will required re-writing most of the mod. Having said that, if you need more then 260 action groups, just what ARE you doing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EName actiongroups.\u003C/strong\u003E Can\u0027t remember what an actiongroup does? Now you can name them with a (short) text description to be visible in flight. These descriptions will be saved on a per vessel basis so different vessel\u0027s groups can be named different things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAssign ActionGroups in flight mode.\u003C/strong\u003E All Action Groups (so including KSP\u0027s default 10 groups) can be edited in flight mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne Key, Multiple Groups.\u003C/strong\u003E A single hotkey activating multiple groups will be supported. How this used will come down to player preference, but it increases the mod\u0027s flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiple Saved Keybindings.\u003C/strong\u003E Also under the flexibility heading, you can easily swap between different keybindings setups for different ships. Have an interplanetary mothership and a separate lander? Assign groups 1 - 10 to actions on the lander and groups 11-20 to the mothership. Then while launching the lander to dock have physical keys 1-10 on the keyboard control groups 1-10, then once docked and controlling the mothership, have physical keys 1-10 control groups 11-20 instead. Note that this swap will be automatic as each vessel will save which keybinding setup to use. (Optional of course, you can manually control which keybinding setup is in use at any time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I just now need the time to hack the GUI out.
