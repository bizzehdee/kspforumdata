How I\u0027ve up the mod to work is; there are multiple config files in a separate folder that are set to only \u0022activate\u0022 if you have certain mods installed. For instance,if you have RO installed, the RO configs that comes with the mod will automatically detect RO and use the RO configs. If you only play in RSS with RealFuels without RO, the mod will only use the RealFuels configs. If you have RealPlume and Smokescreen installed, the mod will detect these and use the RealPlume and Smokescreen configs that comes with this mod and so on.\n\nIf you don\u0027t use RSS, RO, RealFuels, RealPlume, Remote Tech etc, there will be another set of configs available (Thanks to Kartoffelkuchen) that can replace the default configs and set up all the launchers for either Stock or 6.4x. If someone makes configs for 2x and 3.2x, I\u0027ll add these configs to the mod as well. The configs for stock, 2x, 3.2x and 6.4x will need to manually replace the default configs, whilst the configs for RO, RP, RF, RT etc are already set up to auto-activate if they detect any of these mods.\n\nDoing it this way should make life a lot easier for anyone who installs this mod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Basically all you\u0027ll have to do (once the mod is re-released) is to paste the \u0022Liquidhype\u0022 folder into your GameData directory.
