And its big brother.\n\nYou know, I hadn\u0027t really thought about that. But integrated thrusters (and lights) could be interesting. I\u0027ll think on it. I was already thinking of another set of legs, to bridge the gap between the LL-4M and the larger stock legs.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi Necrobones,\n\u003E just had an idea: what about adding floats and airbags, maybe even built into the command pod? And will there be a service module?\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for this ne awesomness and Cheers\n\nHuh, interesting idea. I\u0027m trying to be careful about adding too much to any one part, but interesting ideas. A service module is a possibility.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I want that pod, oh yes, want it very much.\n\nAwesome. Soon now.
