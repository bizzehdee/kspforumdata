If you go onto Youtube and search for \u0022Cybutek\u0022 (a modder here on the forums) he has some plugin development tutorials. He uses Visual Studio but MD is just as good (not to mention that VS is Windows-exclusive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was working on an engine modeling tutorial a while back but I\u0027ve never been a good teacher, so I dropped it.
