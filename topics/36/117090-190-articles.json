Sadly I have discovered several new things which the stock code broke in one way or another that I\u0027m not sure on how to solve (or if I even can solve them).\n\nNotably the inflatable modules will no longer update their crew capacity and cause null-refs, the inflatable modules that were using blend-shapes for some reason show up missing their textures / can see through them (except the shadows show up on the mesh...), and I\u0027ve still got a bit of a mess to cleanup with regards to tank textures/shaders/etc.\n\nHopefully I\u0027ll be able to get the blend-shapes working again.  Well, the animations work, but the textures are just... missing....  It is quite strange.  It flashes pink for half a second when spawned (which usually denotes shader is missing), and they show up fine in the part-icon preview.  Verified that the shaders and materials are all in place, but for some reason they are just not rendering.\n\n![Etc6v3x.png](http://i.imgur.com/Etc6v3x.png)\n\nThe crew capacity though... that\u0027s just borked.  Zero chance of fixing it unless stock fixes the back-end code.  So, we\u0027ll more than likely be losing the inflatables.\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149405-changing-crewcapacity-of-a-part-in-the-editor/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSo.. sadly, no release today.  Perhaps next weekend.  Will likely be losing the inflatable modules and torus if I can\u0027t fix the crew capacity and rendering issues.  Quite sick of losing parts due to stock breaking stuff and I\u0027m not going to put up with it for much longer (would rather move on to something else than spend time constantly fixing things *that I did not break* and having previously working features removed *without viable replacements*).\n\nEdit:  Have fixed the shader/material problems for the AssetBundle based models (inflatables).  Apparently Unity 5.4 does not setup the shaders properly when the model is loaded from the AssetBundle so I have to manually re-seat them.  Strangely, they worked fine with Unity 5.2.....\n\nStill have not been able to fix the crew capacity problems however.  Really don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to find any solutions to that one...\n\nFurther edit:\n\nCrew capacity code is... strange.  It halfway works.  Until stock decides to reset/revert things when you add/remove parts in the editor.  Might be able to get it working with some hooks into the editor events.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-09T20:02:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2016 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T19:31:40Z","Content":"If all else fails, I\u0027d say not being able to add crew to inflatables in the editor is fine.

If a **prefab** part has crewCapacity \u003E 0, the crew selection shows up for the part in the editor regardless of that part instance\u0027s current crewCapacity value.  The root of the problem is that the stock code is pulling crew capacity from prefab/availablePart/partInfo rather than the actual part instance.  And if you set the prefab/config to specify crewCapacity = 0 it causes problems on initialization of the craft while in flight (deleting the crew...).\n\nWorking on some hacks/workarounds for it, but it is going to be quite ugly (from a code perspective).  You can see a bit of the code that I\u0027m working on at the thread linked earlier:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149405-changing-crewcapacity-of-a-part-in-the-editor/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt is partially working so far.
