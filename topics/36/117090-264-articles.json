Due to the way that specific part is put together, and that it uses the SSTUModularStationCore, there is an easy solution for this specific part (most SSTU parts ignore \u0027rescaleFactor\u0027 entirely as things are scaled through plugin code; other station-core parts are far more complex).\n\nThe three lines in the config \u0027topDiameter\u0027, \u0027coreDiameter\u0027, and \u0027bottomDiameter\u0027 all determine the size of that particular part.

They should, by default, have no colliders and simply phase through other objects/parts when jettisoned.  This was done/made optional specifically because of explosion-related issues with the fairings;  their placement is a bit too precise considering the sloppy setup that most other parts\u0027 colliders have.\n\nBut...to aid in your debugging, there is this handy little mod:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149706-13-collide-o-scope-v115/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt adds a right-click button to the parts to enable rendering a wireframe of any colliders on the part.  I\u0027ve already used it for a fair bit of debugging on parts as it is quicker than trying to import the .mu model into Blender (at least it is quicker when I actually have access to KSP)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-02T20:49:56Z","Content":"[https://twitter.com/Astro2fish/status/892837427919769600](https://twitter.com/Astro2fish/status/892837427919769600)\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#14171a\u0022\u003EThe forum is not embedding tweets for me. \u003C/font\u003E\n\n![DGPyJnSXcAA8Q9N.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGPyJnSXcAA8Q9N.jpg)\n\nClick to embiggen.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-02T20:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2017 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-02T23:40:42Z","Content":"[@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/)\n\nMy screenshot-framing skills are not quite up to the task (at least not in the 5 free minutes I had), but I thought I would post this up:\n\n![DasiKsK.png](http://i.imgur.com/DasiKsK.png)\n\nAlso seem to be missing some of the atmosphere decay effects for the nice golden sunrise/sunset; probably just didn\u0027t get SVE/etc setup properly.
