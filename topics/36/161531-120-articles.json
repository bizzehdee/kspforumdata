Warp speed is currently a function of (power * vesselmass / warpdrivemass). This means if you combine a strong warpdrive with a small vessel with power reactor, you can reach very high warp speeds.

I want to make it difficult, not impossible to use low tech reactors to start warp. You will be able to reach warp, but not very fast or long, requiring a vessel with a high warp to vessel mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-13T18:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnigmaG","CreatedById":140576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T18:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE: Warp drives;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought there was supposed to be a minimum velocity of 0.100C with warp drives?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that warp drives would require Fusion power at the very least, which means it should require about half a gigawatt of power for any of the warp drives at 1.25m size, no matter how light the rest of the ship is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, hard lower speed limit of 0.100C, with a hard lower power requirement of 500MW.
