As in I select them from the catalog, put them in place while they\u0027re at the appropriate resolution, then some 10-15 minutes later- I look at the vessel (I spend a LOT of time alt-tabbed, mostly looking at spacecraft concepts and real world images, I think I have a problem*) and the part in question got downgraded (or dropped, or whatever).
