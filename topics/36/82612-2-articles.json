Beacons now use electricity, both as a large initial requirement and as a constant operational charge. Both amounts are determined by the ratio of the beacon\u0027s gravity limit to the current gravity, as well as by the amount of fuel available to the beacon. The GMU now carries a penalty to these charges to compensate for the increased operational range it gives you. The charges are pretty reasonable - you can easily online a fully fueled IB-1 using stock electrical parts - but it requires some forethought and gets much harder to manage if you\u0027re using the GMU or are too far out for effective solar use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso included in this release is the updated LB10 model I posted previously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygxa6iu8o76kzv0/ESLDBeacons%200.2c.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E2014-08-30 0.2c\u003Cbr\u003E  -Beacons now require ElectricCharge to turn on and to operate.\u003Cbr\u003E    -A large initial charge is required to activate the beacon.\u003Cbr\u003E    -A constant per-second charge is required to keep it operational.\u003Cbr\u003E    -Charge amounts are determined based on the current gravity vs the beacon\u0027s gravity limit and the amount of fuel in the beacon.\u003Cbr\u003E    -Using the Gravitational Mitigator now carries a penalty to required activation and operation charges.\u003Cbr\u003E  -Beacons will not start up without at least a small amount of Karborundum aboard.\u003Cbr\u003E  -New model for the LB10 beacon.\u003Cbr\u003E    -Better inline fit\u003Cbr\u003E    -Much lighter filesize - 25% of previous.  \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4nxs","CreatedById":80680,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T18:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice progress last few days.

The reason I am asking is I want to balance the Karborundum drives, as well as tanks (unless you already have some?)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have placeholder tanks, but nothing fancy. The amount of Karborundum used by the drives is based on tonnage and the distance traveled, as well as the model of drive used. Different drives provide the most efficient transfer depending on how heavy your ship is and how far it\u0027s going. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dmXkyDB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dmXkyDB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the curves for the small, medium and large beacons. t for tonnage, d for distance, K for the distance from Kerbin to Kerbol, and p is a penalty only applied after 1GM for the small beacon because I couldn\u0027t get it to curve right without it. The resulting number from those equations can be divided by tonnage and multiplied by 10000 to get the cost per ton in funds for transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with that, the base transfer cost for getting a 40 ton ship over one Kerbin AU (13.6GM) using the medium drive (most efficient for that weight and distance) is almost exactly 40 Karborundum for the base cost, or $80,000 in material worth. Additionally, if you have any of the tech modules on board that will increase. Matching speeds over that distance (let\u0027s say an exit vector of about 2.5km/s) would incur a cost from the Alignment Matrix equivalent to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(C*T)/(LOG10(C*T)^2)/200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC for Compensation amount in m/s, T for tonnage. Comes out to an additional 20 units for this example. You actually made me realize just now that I hadn\u0027t updated that in the current release, so thanks for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, if the ship is carrying Karborundum, crew, or any other resources that need to be protected by the Heisenkerb Compensator, it will exact a toll equivalent to 2% of the protected items\u0027 weight in Karborundum. If this example ship is carrying 500 units of Karborundum and no crew it will take 10 units. So, for this example we\u0027re looking at a total trip cost of 70 units of Karborundum, or 140,000 in funds. Keep in mind all this is paid by the origin-side beacon, not the transferring ship - unless it\u0027s a ship with the jumpdrive module, in which case it does pay its own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal jumps with smaller ships are MUCH cheaper, and you can dodge most of that added cost if you time your jump to avoid huge DV changes and aren\u0027t carrying a crapton of KBD. Simply tranferring a 10 ton ship to Minmus from Kerbin with AMU and HCU costs would be closer to 7 units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T17:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent.
