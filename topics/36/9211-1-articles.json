I haven\\\u0027t dove deep enough into the KSP SDK to know much about plugin dev so I\\\u0027ll be working in stock part classes for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are wider set, higher-strength landing gear suited to high gravity landings or heavy craft. Param wise they have the same impact tolerance as sunday punch\\\u0027s huge landing strut part. They aren\\\u0027t quite as strong but their wide structure reduces axial roll when you land while moving sideways, so they\\\u0027re less likely to tip out from under you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m working on the config files right now. The UV unwrap is only partially done and the parts just textured with gobbledygook at the moment. I also need to make some adjustments to the anchors so that they actually appear to go into the body instead of sticking out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny feedback on what I\\\u0027ve got so far? Does it need any param tweaking? Any advice on the model or collision boxes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anariaq","CreatedById":19400,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-06T21:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey ill say that is just what is needed for my bigger Munar lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave tested the landing gears. But for me they keep falling off, when I land faster than 2m/s and even worse when having a little side movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut not sure, if its because Im using the vanilla tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is the design I used to test the landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l389/anariaq/KSP%20album/screenshot0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l389/anariaq/KSP%20album/screenshot1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have no idea how to fix the part where the sides stick out of the model. Have been planning to make my own legs. Really same design as the one you have made. But could not figure out how to do the side connectores. Though got a shuttle to finish now. So Im glad there is someone making them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you can fix it.

Stock 1 meter tanks won\\\u0027t fit the legs too well. Its just the nature of attachment points on KSP, you can only have one, so having a wide part connecting on the sides means its not going to fit smaller stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also have an extra wide node collider. I\\\u0027d guess that a parts ability to stay connected to your ship depends on how in contact the collider is with the part its attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry out some of the parts from the NovaPunch remix pack, thats what these legs are designed for.
