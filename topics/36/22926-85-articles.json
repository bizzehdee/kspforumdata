Or is that something MFT would have to implement? Sorry, don\u0027t know how a lot of this stuff works. E.g. right click menu includes \u0022switch tank type\u0022 to cycle through things like LFO mix, all fuel, all oxidizer, all xenon, whatever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that there are two parts with identical names: LLLCirc2b2f, both the FuelTank/2-50m/HeatTile/Circ25FuelTankHT and HeatTile/Circ25Fuel are named this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, sorry I forgot that that file is in the TweakScale folder, it is supposed to be removed. I don\u0027t think he has updated it yet. I HAVE NOT changed the SXT file at all however. Please delete the LLL cfg in the tweakscale directory. He has asked us to keep that cfg file in the base LLL directory and on the next release it should be in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the kethane tanks, they DO work for me. Yeah I like the idea of the standard tanks too, the NEW version of MFT has a right click option to open the tank U.I. however when they released that they changed the way that they deleted the non MFT managed resources and the change in the TankTypes.cfg, at least when I change it with Modulemanager breaks the whole MFT system. I spoke with one of the programmers he is supposed to be addressing the problem. But yes to actually switch between tank types like set tank types on the right click menu would be an MFT option. That being said, It would be a neat option to be able to right click and cycle through the default tank types, but you would need to request that with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat duplicate part name is actually a bug in the LLL release, Lack actually accidently left the Circ25FuelTank folder in the 2-50m folder under fueltank. //lll/parts/fueltank/2-50m/heattile/circ25fueltank I think its labeled if you delete that folder so that you JUST have the Circ25FuelTankHT and Circ25FuelTankSmlHT then it will resolve that problem. I have been meinging to mention it to Lack, I thought it was my fault when I had coppied over some other parts. but yeah that should solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHANKS for testing. please let me know of any other problems you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: In respect to the extra parts, in career mode the extra parts are removed, Well the extra larger parts. I don\u0027t know if we will be bundling these without the other tanks, I have not spoken with lack about this. My personal folders will eventually only have the standard tanks. I want to get rid of a ton of tanks so I can lower the amount of parts loading in my system. So basically I will be ripping tons of parts out of my mods because I will only be using like a set number of tanks from each size and removing the rest. This is a little extreme but my install is huge and I am Forever hitting the 4g limit even with textures reduced as much as possible. But yeah in career mode you note that the 4x2 parts and such are gone.
