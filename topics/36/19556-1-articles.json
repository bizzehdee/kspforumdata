I have been thinking this mod for a long time. I wanted to build it but may need some feedback. You could help build it too.

High breaking torque and force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe elevator, a donut shaped unmanned command pod. The command pod should have the tube go through it. Needs some fuel to propel itself upwards. Use RCS or retrothrusters to slow down when reaching highest point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe support, positioned at the base of the elevator. Have it on land or water. If it\u0027s on land, make wheels in case it needs to move about. Needs to have very very long legs for extreme stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highest point, positioned in Keosynchronous Orbit. Needs some propulsion and RCS and ASAS for emergencies. Needs high breaking torque and force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe habitats, attached to the elevator. Holds Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, I guess its kinda hard.
