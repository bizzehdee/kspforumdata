You can see the tower I mean in the red box. Behind the rocket in the blue box is another \u0022tower\u0022 structure that I wish was a separate model. If it were separate, I can make the red box tower look animated with movie magic. I can\u0027t make it look natural if the tower in the blue box is moving at the same time with the real tower though. Any chance of getting a special atlas2.mu of my own? And an atlas2b.mu with the little blue box tower separated out? I could make the CFGs myself. I would just need models.\n\n![wP5u28N.png](http://i.imgur.com/wP5u28N.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T05:12:51Z","Content":"Ok I just Pm you"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T19:00:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m slowly building out Cape Canaveral for RSS for Project Alexandria:\n\n![vUwZl8q.png](http://i.imgur.com/vUwZl8q.png)"}]}
