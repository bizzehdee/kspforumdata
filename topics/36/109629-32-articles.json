We had the Enterprise prototype. Then there was Columbia and Challenger which where more science oriented and did not have docking modules off the line. These shuttles had a bigger science role and also where planned to have the spacelab module. When the Daedalus project (later the ISS) project was approved Discovery and Atlantis had docking modules (to dock with mir at the time) and had more of a \u0022space truck\u0022 mindset. Some lighter materials where used in its construction they learned after building the first 2. Endeavor was the last to be built (replacing challenger) which had the best of all the shuttles. Endeavor was the newest and as such implemented corrections to later determined flaws in the earlier shuttles. As all of the shuttles got upgrades to be comparable to the rest each and every one had some minor differences and got built in different time frames where the government had different roles for them. In conclusion this can be the case with the shuttles tech tree. You can start with enterprise launch from the 747 and land. Move into more science based missions with Challenger and Columbia, Discovery and Atlantis start launching satellites, probes and docking with things finally moving into endeavor which was built in a time ISS construction was the priority of the shuttle program.\n\nAs each shuttle had a name they also had unique numbers.\n\nOV-102 *Columbia, OV-099* *Challenger, OV-103* *Discovery, OV-104* *Atlantis, and OV-105* *Endeavour*\n\nFrom wiki\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle)\n\n***Orbiter add-ons***\n\n*The orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-ons depending on the mission.

Yes I will of course have the normal shuttle with all textures as main download pack, and the realism pack. Unlockable. \n\nAlso I underatand ksp has limitations but for the 747 I can make a craft file for this. Maybe some models for the attachment to the 747 and treat them as decouplers.\n\nYour research is great thank you.\n\nI think it will be enjoyable for those who want a progressive gameplay (and have patience) and unlick science to simulate the real thing.
