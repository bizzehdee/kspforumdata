As you said, distant object enhancements fixes the gray background (it has been a must use with scatterer for a while anyway). The only real issue that remains is transition to the PQS on the dark side of the planet will show a difference in luminosity but in my testing it wasn\u0027t very bad and definitely worth the tradeoff.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Mitchz95 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible to get the eclipses to work in 1.0.4, without the rest of the mod?\n\u003E \n\nAt the moment they are built into the sky shader so not possible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, The Destroyer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well, It doesn\u0027t appear to be linked with steam screenshots, just a coincidence.
