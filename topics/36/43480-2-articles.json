It\u0027s not intuitive and at all and would feel terribly realistic. It\u0027s different for resources, because you\u0027re not trying to create an exact map of the resources--you just want to know where they are, and where they aren\u0027t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EBut you haven\u0027t addressed the problem of USING the maps, which a lot of us do. Lets say you want to land on the dark side of a body. The maps allow you to pick your landing spot even when you can\u0027t see the ground, you can get a set of coordinates, but then what? The in-game HUD works on the actual body - you can adjust your maneuver node to hit a spot on the ground, but there\u0027s no way to hit a set of coordinates unless you plug them into MechJeb. Since the in-game navigation tools work on the bodes themselves, it makes sense to put the map there. Pick a spot on the map, adjust your maneuver node and land. And the old system made it really hard to see if a given landing spot had kethane on it, and as new features get added, we\u0027ll have the same problem. If I can find a promising spot, hit a button and have it switch to kethane, then zoom in on that hex and fine tune my location, that would be fantastic. You can\u0027t do that now - not even close.

They start as an icosahedron, which is twelve vertices and twenty faces, and then those faces are subdivided until you get the desired level of detail. You can even subdivide some faces more than others. Level of detail is essentially built into the design of the grid. Currently, the Kethane grid code isn\u0027t well-suited to varying subdivisions, but I\u0027ve been working on an indexing method that more closely represents the recursive nature of the grid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means a mapping satellite would never scan the point \u003Cem\u003Edirectly\u003C/em\u003E below the spacecraft; instead, it would scan a point on the grid at the current level of detail. I doubt anyone would ever notice the difference, but it means you aren\u0027t generating a constant stream of potentially redundant data like ISA. Instead, you\u0027re constantly increasing the level of detail at areas around the planet, generating a grid that reflects those levels of detail, and then sampling terrain at those grid points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to see why such a system works elegantly for mapping if you\u0027ve only played with the Kethane grid, which appears to be a set of discrete same-sized cells. A subdivided grid (of any sort) affords a lot of flexibility with level of detail. Perfect example: the KSP terrain system uses subdivided quads. The geodesic grid is just a subdividing grid that works well for evenly distributing data on a sphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kimberly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kimberly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrankly, Kethane scanning is very simplistic--and that\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing, because mapping is not the central focus of the mod. But it would certainly devalue Mapsat if you went with the Kethane paradigm of \u0022lower orbital period = better\u0022, with a ton of scanners being necessary for scanning at warp instead of being able to adjust resolution and orbit to something that will work at a high level of warp and produce a high-detail result.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote earlier that you should not jump to conclusions about how such a system would work just because some of the underlying \u003Cem\u003Ecode\u003C/em\u003E comes from Kethane. The details of Kethane scanning have little to do with the geodesic grid.

The in-game HUD works on the actual body - you can adjust your maneuver node to hit a spot on the ground, but there\u0027s no way to hit a set of coordinates unless you plug them into MechJeb.
