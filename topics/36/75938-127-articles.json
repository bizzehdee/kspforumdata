For the GUI itself, I\u0027ve rediscovered an old download that included an entire library useful for generation and managing GUI elements which I\u0027m using as a base for my own attempts at a GUI. It really simplifies things a lot. Of course, when KSP goes Unity 5, we\u0027ll have access to visual GUI designers similar to the form designers in modern programming environments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really awesome would be for someone to make an easily-imported project that did all the hard work of getting something like this set up and provided an easy way for someone to then simply define what the button should do when pressed. Something along the lines of the Blizzy toolbar\u0027s set of methods that I see imported into just about every mod that supports the toolbar mod. I may have to export whatever I end up with here for such a purpose.

I\u0027m making slow progress. I don\u0027t have time to devote whole days to the project, but it\u0027s coming along. I\u0027m just trying to figure out what parts of the AffinityUI package I\u0027ll need so I don\u0027t end up importing the entire library into KF. It\u0027s going to make constructing the GUI a lot easier though. I\u0027m going to try and strip down my install of KSP for an extremely lightweight testing platform and work on that over the next few days. I figure if I back up nearly everything related to \u0022parts\u0022 and force KSP to load without them, then it will simply be a matter of loading the bundled assets and spitting me out to the main menu. I can start a new save for the sole purpose of testing the GUI and simply get it to output any changes done to the config state to a log to make sure it\u0027s working properly. We can worry about testing if it actually works on the parts or not after I get it looking presentable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy trouble with doing stuff like this is that my brain doesn\u0027t make all the connections as to how things are supposed to go together in the code until I\u0027m able to see a working example or the code and the output. this is why I\u0027ve often wished for a KSP console-only mode for loading configs and testing interactivity with those configs without the rest of the game getting in the way. Along those lines, an ability to load KSP into a GUI-testing mode where it would load everything it needs to display a dummy scene with the app launcher and any settings screens that KSP comes with, along with a fully functional config database. This way I could even test GUI additions without having to manually purge my gamedata folder of parts to test this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, though many other GUI-using mod authors would disagree about it, when KSP goes to Unity 5, we\u0027ll have access to a GUI designer in Unity (I\u0027ve read this anyway, not confirmed) which will ease the issues with designing and coding interactions and visuals for a GUI addition. On the down side, it will also screw over any form of GUI mods currently use because it will require the use of the Unity 5 GUI rendering system. I for one am looking forward to it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Never mind that progress report above... I\u0027m back to the drawing board. AffinityUI is a lot easier to create a GUI with, but the examples it provides don\u0027t include how I\u0027m suppose to call it from the stock toolbar or anything. Even the example plugin, which supposedly will load into KSP and let you bring up an example of what can be done, doesn\u0027t even contain any code to actually put the GUI button on the app launcher! How am I expected to view the example if all it does it \u003Cem\u003Ecreate\u003C/em\u003E the GUI and doesn\u0027t actually have a way of displaying it? This is getting really stupid! I just need some working example code to learn from and I\u0027m good to go, but everything I look at either only has parts of what I need, or claims to have what I need and then doesn\u0027t deliver in the end!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T03:28:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T08:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have a look at adding in what Aqua posted, it didn\u0027t look too tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T11:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo no no, what Aqua posted was easy, it\u0027s the actual GUI that\u0027s screwing with me.

I was looking at it in the way you display forms in Windows based UI forms, where you create the form first, then call it up from the code. The form stays as it is like a template for what the code works with. In KSP, when you display your GUI the code is the actual code that builds it. You\u0027re not just telling KSP to make your GUI visible, you\u0027re telling KSP to rebuild it on-demand every single time you need it. This makes it difficult for me to wrap my head around, but I\u0027m slowing making my way there.

The only thing I\u0027m choking on now is how to save the settings. BD uses a config file without a parent node. It simply just lists the variables and their values in order. I\u0027m using a parent config node and putting the values inside that, so saving the values from the GUI isn\u0027t going to be as straight forward as his mod has. Going to dig around in the DustFX stuff and see if the default file generator will be of any use to me.

His mod doesn\u0027t do anything with OnDestroy, or anything that references something being destroyed, nor does it use an \u0022Awake\u0022 state or anything, and from my experience there\u0027s never been any problem with it sticking around after scene changes, or duplicating itself for any reason, so I\u0027m calling it good for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: So, it looks like the current way I load the config is not going to be compatible with the way I want to save the settings, after a user changes them in the GUI, in order to allow the settings to persist between KSP launches. Once that\u0027s handled, I\u0027ll do a little testing to make sure the settings are loaded and saves from the GUI.
