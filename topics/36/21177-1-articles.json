But there are some things I would like to see in 0.18 and future versions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Multiplayer: Yes I know theres multiple people synced single player but that is just not multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Light speed: transportation to different galaxies and you can discover new planets other players have not found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Its war!: Everyone seems to want to be able to have a war driven planet or what not, I think that would be cool to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Satellites and Rovers: If theres war it would be awesome if you could drive a rover on a hostile planet, satellites would come in so they could map out people and see if theres any missiles or enemy spaceships coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it!

Use the search function in the addon release and project showcase thread. Multiplayer is impossible, how do you make timewarp possible for multiple people? Well I suppose you could put the server near a black hole or something...free relativity right?! Also, the game currently makes the player the center of the universe. Something about more accurate physics that way I heard? So obviously you can\u0027t have multiple universes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best we could hope for is a co-op mode where you get to ride-along with a friend in a capsule, then tear up duna in rovers or something. Holy crap I just had a brain blast!!! Gonna post to suggestions now!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
