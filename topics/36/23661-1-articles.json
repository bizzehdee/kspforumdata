I\u0027ve been playing KSP off and on for quite a while now, and I\u0027ve been lurking around here for a little while. I figured a while back that I\u0027d try my hand at some plugin dev stuff. My plugin(s) will address little itches I have about the game, so whether or not they\u0027re useful or interesting to other people will remain to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my first trick, I thought I\u0027d make a docking cam system. I quickly found a 3D model I could use\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E and started poking at the code. Making a RenderTexture and displaying it was the easy part. Took a little while to figure out the positioning and direction from the model. The issue now is that I don\u0027t seem to be able to render the scene properly. Initially I could just see the components of the rocket, the launchpad and everything else was Unity\u0027s lovely shade of blue default clear colour. I figured I\u0027d be clever and copy near/far clipping planes, culling mask and clear flags from the main camera, but then what I get is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GPtvPk4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GPtvPk4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for reference, it\u0027s mounted thusly with nothing above it\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g00fJ9o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g00fJ9o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any experience with creating cameras for KSP that I could look at your code for how you set them up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera renders to a 128x128 RenderTexture currently. I was playing with the idea of sticking a post processor on there and making it fuzzy and/or black and white. Maybe for a different camera model. I have 4 different cameras planned right now: standard cheap-o CCTV box (the current model) webcam (surface mount like linear RCS thrusters) HD cam (more round model CCTV with 256x256 RenderTexture) and one with limited movement. Also going to (when I figure out how this all works) plug it in so the cams only display when they are enabled. As well as help with why my cameras are playing up, I\u0027d love to hear feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E although in hindsight, I may have to resize it a little, as it looks very out of place next to larger, clunkier parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E I am, at best, a poor 3D modeller, but I\u0027m a terrible texturer, right now it has some default material on it that makes it go black. I will try and texture it at some point, when I\u0027m done arguing with the code perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: After taking a little while away from this and coming back, the answer is relatively obvious, KSP is rendered with (at least) 2 cameras normally. One for a custom \u0022skybox\u0022 and one for the player. I haven\u0027t been able to tell if there are more cameras yet. That does, however explain why the camera was going crazy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: I just checked the number of cameras present in the game scene on launch. 10. Eek. Well, I\u0027m going to do some digging. With any luck I can pick a couple that I will need to use. I think adding 10 more game cameras per docking cam is more than a little unrealistic\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-24T08:47:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2013 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nistur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbernick","CreatedById":57485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T11:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can have a look at Lazor code, it has a docking cam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nistur","CreatedById":60155,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T12:19:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
