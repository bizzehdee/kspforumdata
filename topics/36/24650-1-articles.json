In modding friendly games (rfactor, for example) the game checks mod files and reports a \u0022mismatch\u0022 if you don\u0027t have a mod that the server has (or is other version). While joining server, the server should send a list of cfg-s installed and then compare with those of the joining player. Another way to handle mods, is that YOU don\u0027t need to have the mods, but if another player has a mod you don\u0027t have, the game displays a \u0022generic models\u0022 like a box (eg.) that shows up instead of a mod model. When you install the mod, it would shape correctly.
