I\u0027m guessing an issue with reparenting as well, at least one of the planet packs seems to be putting things down at distances from Kerbin\u0027s sun as it stands now, rather than at the Galactic Core. It isn\u0027t until I zoom out all the way to where the planets/systems SHOULD be in the GN, that the parenting issue corrects itself. Like I said, it\u0027s not exactly a game breaker, just something I noticed upon starting a new science career, that is easily worked around. I\u0027d love to test it in 32 bit Windows, but at a 7-11 gig memory loadout right now, that\u0027s frankly impossible to exactly duplicate with all the mods being used, etc. Anyways. Take a look at the images at least, and see if you agree, or maybe there IS a minor issue handling one of the planet packs that nobody else had noticed yet? Don\u0027t kill yourself over it though, I understand you\u0027ve probably got bigger fish to fry, and I\u0027m hoping a newer version of Kopernicus manages to alleviate the various reparenting issues that arise at is. Being able to get solar from ANY star would be amazing.\n\nEDIT: It seems to be focused on bodies from Sido\u0027s Urania Planet Pack\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
