I guessed it would help noobs like myself in creating their own parts and modifying others, but I hit a brick wall when I realized that the part.cfg files in my parts directory have greatly different modules and parameters from the tutorial on wiki (which is probably very very out of date actually ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u003C/a\u003E )) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m stuck because I don\u0027t know what to actually add and what not to add. It\u0027s already hard enough since I\u0027ve only been learning programming for like 5 months and not in school either... so any help would be awesome and appreciated. I of course already looked all over google but other then a few scattered tutorials that had nothing to do with it i didn\u0027t find anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI of course already wrote to the \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d3f6e491bca3a7babcbdf6e497\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u00221e6d6b6e6e716c6a5e757b6c7c7f726d6e7f7d7b6e6c71796c7f73307d7173\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E address, but they didn\u0027t get back to me yet on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main problems are #1 what part types have what standard and specific parameters, and what modules i have to look for and how those work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in forward!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
