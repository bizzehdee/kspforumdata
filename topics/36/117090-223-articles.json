They should all now have at least some semblance of balanced cost/entry-cost/tech-node placement.  Tech nodes are still a bit... off... but the choices on the stock tree are so limited, and the parts have to go -somewhere-, so they were put where the closest stock equivalent parts are located.\n\nOn the note of \u0027tech-tree placement\u0027 -- Several of the SSTU modular parts have compound capabilities that cannot be easily placed into a single tech-node.  For instance the integrated solar panels and docking ports, and to a lesser extent the integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, probe-cores, and antenna.  Currently they assume that you have already unlocked those capabilities in the tree before unlocking/using some of the SSTU parts.  While I\u0027m mostly okay playing with the honor system, I also think it would be nice to have those capabilities properly unlock when their respective tech-nodes are unlocked.\n\nTo that end I\u0027m working on integrating the part-upgrade system a bit more into the ModularStationCore module, and creating additional \u0027upgrade parts\u0027 that will unlock solar panels and docking ports for the StationCore parts.  The solar panel and docking port tech nodes will each get additional part(s) added to them that will enable the use of those features on the station-core modules.  So if you grab a ST-DOS-LAB it will not have solar panels or docking ports (or even the options for them) until you have unlocked the respective tech nodes.\n\nWill probably also be adding the probe core upgrades as additional tech-node unlocks;  the parts will start with very basic probe cores (no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E), which will be upgraded through tech-node unlocks to have better capabilities.  Integrated antennas may see range upgrades as higher level tech is unlocked.\n\nThere are a few other areas that I\u0027de like to make use of the upgrade system, but going to take things one bit at a time and get the station-core bits sorted out first."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T17:35:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 44 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E General development update:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To that end I\u0027m working on integrating the part-upgrade system a bit more into the ModularStationCore module, and creating additional \u0027upgrade parts\u0027 that will unlock solar panels and docking ports for the StationCore parts.

The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E in the very early game.  More precisely, their base stats will be nerfed and it will require upgrades to some of them to achieve their \u0027current\u0027 stats -- for instance the Merlin engine line will probably have a bit lower stats initially than they currently do, with their full potential being unlockable one or more tech nodes later than the base engine is unlocked.  Might also put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E gimbals behind an upgrade, or at least have their gimbal range be upgrade/upgrade-able.

Initial tests reveal that I can properly limit the selection of available solar panels and/or docking ports in the editor based on what tech has been unlocked.  Need to do a lot more config work to implement it in all of the StationCore parts, and decide how I want to handle the \u0027default\u0027 setup (for icon/etc) and if/how the default will change with upgrades/unlocks.  But so far so good.\n\nExpanding on that, I added the support for part-upgrades-as-unlocks at the lowest level of model-definitions, so that the same features might be applied in general to adapters / nosecones / mounts / nozzles / tank variants.  Currently the code only supports it at the PartModule level for solar and dock options on the StationCore parts, but it would only be a few lines of changes to the other modules/etc to enable it more generically.  This would for example be used to limit the multi-coupler adapters to only unlock with the stock multi-couplers, or unlock other adapters or mounts in a more gradual and gated fashion.  Not saying that I will be using it in those areas, merely pointing out some examples.  None of this would be coming anytime soon either.  It will take quite a while to decide if and how I would want to set it up, and I\u0027m not in any huge rush for it as it doesn\u0027t really add much to the gameplay.\n\nA bit even further down the road I could see the upgrade-unlock system being used for engine layouts (limit cluster numbers in early career), fuel-tank modifier types (e.g. ZBO requires an unlock), and even some integration into the life-support capabilities for the station/base modules (start lower quality, unlock better scrubbers/etc).

A Historical progression is fine, if you keep things historical.   However, If you are not careful it will really bog down the game.   In some ways, I think [@frizzank](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57210-frizzank/) did it right when he set up FASA in the stock tech tree.  he brought the 2.5m size forward and focused on Maned missions. \n\nSo my suggestion is move the 1.875 and 2.5m unlocks to earlier in the tree, This includes the non inflatable station parts (being available earlier.)   Doing so frees up more nodes for later in the game that you need to achieve \u0022balance.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-13T22:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2016 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T15:39:37Z","Content":"I really liked RP-0, but unfortunately it is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E tech tree, it doesn\u0027t play well on stock, it CAN be played, but shouldn\u0027t play well, mainly because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E changes the name or clones parts and RP-0 needs them  \n\na stock RP-0 would be cool though, but it would need more people involved"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T16:51:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure why I thought that CTT re-organized the parts; that was the impression I had originally, but looking over the source and config files it is apparent that all it does is add new nodes and re-link them into the stock tech tree.
