Although I\u0027m not entirely sure it\u0027s a general bug or just me having it.\u003Cp\u003EEssentially for a couple of engines, the \u003Cstrong\u003ERockomax 24-77\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003ERockomax 48-7S\u003C/strong\u003E specifically, the engines had their effect running at full blast even with the engines off. Now I know this have been seen before, and usually had to do with conflicts on other mods, but I tries exclusively with only Squad, SmokeScreen, ModuleManager, HotRockets and your squad config and it still happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaking down the issue, I tried removing your config. That obviously put the 24-77 and 48-7S engines back to normal but without any hotrockets effects (since they\u0027re not configured in hotrockets, duh!). So it was clear it had to do with your config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what was the solution? Well, after a lot of eagle eyed comparison between files, I realised that the 24-77 and 48-7S engines are written a little different, they already have a module \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EModuleEnginesFX\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022, but your config was looking for the typical \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EModuleEngines\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 module in the part instead. By simply changing the line \u0022@MODULE[ModuleEngines]\u0022 to \u0022@MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX]\u0022 on those two engines I solved the issue. The engine effect for those engines are a bit.. simple, by default, but at least they work (I could edit the values properly with SmokeScreen inside the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, this is something that was changed in .25 I missed it because I\u0027m still using .24.2 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E lol, I have allot of custom tweaked stuff in my career and havent felt like taking the time to do that all over again for a .25 install, and now with .90 here there really is no point until all my core mods get updated for .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Proot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Proot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENothing special right now lol, just to make it work.

A few of the smaller probe engines don\u0027t have HotRockets enabled on them yet so they will just be running stock flames. Oh and make sure the individual configs for the engines are stock, changing certain things in them might result in sadness when MM tries to apply the HotRockets patch, things like messing with the thrust/ISP/mass/fuel stuff is ok though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as credit where credit is due FPSlacker is the one that really wrote those and got the atmo expansion thing down, I just went in and fixed the fact that throttle no longer had any effect on the engine FX, fixed some compatibility issues with a few other mods that make changes to some of the engines, and a few other little tweaks, and all my other work like the KW FX is all derived from his work on those two cfgs.
