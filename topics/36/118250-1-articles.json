Will have a stealth grey color similar to the one modern fighter jets are painted with and will happen in stages. The stages are below. Also note this will take time since I have basically no idea what I am doing......\n\nFuel Tanks:\n\n-Mk1 tank with 400LF\n\n-Half length Mk2 tank with 600 LF\n\n-Quarter length Mk2 tank with 300 LF\n\n-Mk2 Bi-coupler with 150LF\n\n-Mk1 and Mk2 empty structural parts\n\nCockpits:\n\n-Mk1 and Mk2. Each with a 1 kerbal and 2 kerbal cockpit. Will also include a built in radar with Baha\u0027s permission(Got permission so this will happen!). Will be modeled after F15 and F22 cockpits\n\nEngines:\n\n-Jet engine similar to turbojet with a different appearance and more vectoring ability\n\n-Mk1 and Mk2 jet engine with a VTOL ability(like the ones in \n\n-Counter thrust fans for VTOL for Mk1 and Mk2(the one for Mk2 will have an option for one or two engines which will change the thrust it produces so it accurately counters the main engine(s)\n\n-Possible after burner feature for the engines. Toggle able like the rapier engines.\n\nNormal mode: 160 Thrust, 5000 ISP, .3LF/ Second\n\nAfterburner Mode: 250 Thrust, 2.3LF/Second\n\nOther Parts:\n\n-Advanced thrust vectoring system like the one found in quiztech except the thrusters won\u0027t have the annoying flap and will be smaller in size.\n\n-Weapons mounting hardpoints(quad mount, tri mount, etc...)\n\n-Smaller bays for Mk1 and Mk2 that will be similar to the stock service bays to hold ammo boxes and weapons managers and over smaller things that look ugly attached to plane exteriors\n\nWeapons bays:\n\n-Mk2 Weapons bay. Built like the current cargo bay but will have 2hardpoints attached to each door so that when they open the weapons swing out like actual weapons bays work. Will have two editions. One with an empty interior so you can place other things inside it and one that has the top part blocked off and will hold 150LF\n\n-Mk1 Weapons Bay. Similar to Mk2 Weapons Bay but will only hold two weapons and will only hold 50LF\n\nExternal Fuel Tanks:\n\n-External drop tanks similar to fire spitters but with a different mount, shape, and size\n\n-Mk1 and Mk2 Conformal Drop tanks which will carry around 150LF each and attach to the fuel tanks or structural elements of the Mk1/2 parts."},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T05:21:55Z","Content":"Well, there are plenty of tutorials to help you here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/14-Modelling-and-Texturing-Discussion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/14-Modelling-and-Texturing-Discussion)\n\nDon\u0027t be afraid to ask for help too, just don\u0027t ask me.
