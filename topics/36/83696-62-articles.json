The current stock model is very nice and works with the other spaceplane parts, but it has an issue. The Engine Nacelle and Engine Precooler have nice fan models, but the Circular Intake isn\u0027t hollow, so you can\u0027t see it. Could we have it slightly tweaked with a hole in the middle so we can see the fan on the other parts?
