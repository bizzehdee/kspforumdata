The first pic is of the last completed, unlaunched Almaz. It had two docking ports, looked a lot like late-model Salyut with an Almaz propulsion system. The second one is another station that was midway through construction, featuring an odd-looking quartet of tanks on the front face. The third and the 4th pic are not actually of a space station, but of an Almaz-T spy satellite. It is identifiable by the T-shaped antenna (folded in the 3rd pic) and the radiators. The last pic is of a \u0022typical\u0022, launched Almaz, likely OPS-3 (the last one to be launched). It can be recognized by the \u0022CANIOT\u0022 writing on the stern. No manned Almaz was actually designated as such, they were all launched as Salyuts.
