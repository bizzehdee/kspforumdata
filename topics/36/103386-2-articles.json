Refer to the Tantares thread for instructions. The 1.875m parts make it really easy."},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:57:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Na, not again \\_Augustus\\_. It\u0027s nice that you finally want to start modelling, or at least learning it. But isn\u0027t this a \\*way\\* too ambitious? I mean, you didn\u0027t even started to model. My well-meaned advise now would be: Concentrate now first on an easy part like a Fuel Tank, then, when you are a bit more familiar with it, making some more complicated things like an engine, and when you can get those things into KSP without any trouble, then you should be ready to maintain and work on something like this. Now, it\u0027s still too early for you. \n\u003E BTW, an Ariane V and ATV you can find in the German Space Alliance Mod.\n\nI agree with this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is designed to go with Tantares, it has an ATV. I have TheShadow1138 doing ESA parts.\n\u003E Also, I just woke up after returning from a 12-hour drive home. I\u0027ll try to start this week, but I have vacation next week so I won\u0027t be home.\n\nTo be honest, I don\u0027t really see it having much to do with Tantares, aside from some vague notions of texture re-use (The textures are open source anyway).\n\nReally wished you could have sent me a PM or just *any* kind of notification before starting this.\n\nI\u0027ve given it a bit of thought, but could you drop the name? I know this is a bit of a reversal on my part (Although you have changed the planned craft quite a lot).\n\nI\u0027m not sure why you *would* want to tie yourself to an already existing mod to be honest, especially if you\u0027re just learning to model. It\u0027ll be like trying to mod with a hand tied behind your back (Especially the using existing textures part).\n\nAnyway, the Morpheus would be very nice to have and I do wish you luck with this, sorry to woofle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T15:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beale**"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:22:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree with this.\n\nI also agree with this."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:31:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree with this.\n\n I started this while I was on an emergency trip. I\u0027m not good at early-warning systems, when I get ideas I just post. When I get ideas my blood sugar level is also very high (Certain amounts of sugar do the same thing for me as what small amounts of alcohol do for coders).\nAlso, someone already made an expansion for your mod, why do you like mine so much less? \n\nAnd I came up with this during the car ride there. I thought:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Why doesn\u0027t Tantares have much in the way of American, ESA, and Chinese/Japanese launchers? I love the ATV, but I don\u0027t want to have to cobble a few mods\u0027 parts together for an Ariane 5. Also, what about the manned ATV? The Mk 1-2 doesn\u0027t have the same proportions as that pod. Furthermore, what happened to modern American vehicles? I don\u0027t see an Apollo, Orion, etc. in there.*\n\u003E *And why is there no stockalike CMES mod? I love the idea of whatever that guy Borklund was doing, but it doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s gonna be finished any time soon, nor focusing on entirely realistic spacecraft. Also, he hasn\u0027t even ported anything to Unity yet, or started texturing.*\n\nAnd I started the thread. \n\nWe do have actual work going on. Shadow hasn\u0027t given me much in the way of PM\u0027s either, but he is modelling, I\u0027m sure.\n\n(Thanks for the support for the Morpheus. I think that if they use it on Mars they\u0027ll have an LDSD mounted on top similar to a skycrane, so I may do that too. I won\u0027t be working on the Morpheus for 2 weeks or so, I have testing this week and then vacation, on which I will be in Texas.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T21:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\_Augustus\\_**"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:21:02Z","Content":"\u003E Also, someone already made an expansion for your mod, why do you like mine so much less?\n\nThe simple answer, is because your add-on doesn\u0027t exist yet.
