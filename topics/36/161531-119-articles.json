If it\u0027s not called after docking, the whole re-initialization will never occur. This explains all problems with docking. The internal power manager never get properly re-initialized. The generators still operate separately or worse they become frozen because they cannot find the manager which should have been created during initialization.

You first need to charge the warpdrive untill you have accumulated enough Exotic Matter before you initiate warp. Once you have reached the amount needed to warp, you stop accumulating but continue to require power. If you stop charging before initiating warp, you lose all exoticic matter and can no longer warp untill you charge again. Jumping to warp will also cause all exotic matter to be lost. You cannot charge durring warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
