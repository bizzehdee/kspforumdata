They may be getting caught on the solar panels, I need to do more testing. If I do end up making them I\u0027ll make fairings their own tab in HGR/Parts so they\u0027re easy to delete if you don\u0027t need them. A lot of people ask for them and I know more will come release, especially with how many refuse to use Procs. It\u0027s more work, but it might be something I have to do for completeness sake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
