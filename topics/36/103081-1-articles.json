{"TopicId":103081,"ForumId":36,"TopicTitle":"[1.0.2] [MM] Stock Science Tweaks v0.4","CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T23:24:35Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T23:24:35Z","Content":"Note: This mod was formerly known as Barometer Science Tweaks, but now it covers a bit more than that so now I\u0027m calling it Stock Science Tweaks.\n\nThis mod consists of several independent experiments and tweaks, each in its own self-contained config file or folder. If you don\u0027t want to play with all of them, simply delete the components you don\u0027t want.\n\nEver since playing Better than Starting Manned, I\u0027ve been annoyed that barometers ceased to function entirely outside atmospheres, making them entirely useless for getting science from airless bodies. The thing is, reading 0 pressure is still a perfectly valid science point. How else would you know that a body is airless? Also, it seemed kind of silly that there is no equivalent to crew reports for probes, so I (likely along with many other players) ended up slapping a thermometer on a satellite just to be able to do the science from space contracts. Realistically, a lot of information can be gained simply from a spacecraft\u0027s telemetry, and I\u0027ve seen a few other mods implement a telemetry style experiment, but they either had other dependencies or added other things I didn\u0027t really want so I figured I would create a very simple one that only requires module manager. The latest update also includes a modified Communotron 16 to represent a drill that can take surface samples so you don\u0027t have to always send kerbals, I always thought it was silly that kerbals couldn\u0027t build probes that could see what the surface of a planet is made of when we have several rovers on Mars that are perfectly capable of doing that. Again, this type of experiment is represented in other mods but not in a simple, stock-friendly way (at least that I\u0027ve seen). I\u0027ve also integrated Capt Robau\u0027s microgravity experiment as suggested by Free Thinker to make the hitchhiker more useful.\n\nAs of 1.0, the barometer file is obsolete but it still works if you happen to like my implementation better than stock.\n\nCredits: FlowerChild for the initial concept for the barometer as seen in BTSM, CrowdSourcedScience for a MM template file that I completely rewrote, Squad for some of the science messages. Starwaster for his probe science configs that I\u0027ve based mine on. Edit: Also Capt. Robau and zekew11 for the [Science Revisited Revisited](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111985-0-90-Science-Revisited-Revisited) mod, which I\u0027ve borrowed several tweaks and an experiment from. \n\nLicense: Creative Commons for the situation reports (at least the ones I wrote, there\u0027s a few from Squad I\u0027ve repurposed, they\u0027re noted in the barometer experiment file). The other parts are either MM configs or Squad-style experiment definitions which you can shamelessly copy for your own experiments (i.e. I don\u0027t care what you do with them, I copied them myself from other examples).\n\nTo use this mod, download the zip and copy the file into your Gamedata folder. If you don\u0027t want all the experiments, delete the files for the ones you don\u0027t want from the StockScienceTweaks folder.\n\nCurrent Version: 0.4\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.4 Enabled biomes for barometer when flying low, added some new situation reports for the telemetry experiment, added Crew and EVA report switch, added Capt Robau\u0027s microgravity experiment for the hitchhiker.\n\n0.3 Rescaled drill and added a custom texture to differentiate it from the antenna.\n\n0.2 Added a new drill part (copied from communotron 16) that can do the stock surface sample experiment so you don\u0027t have to always use kerbals.\n\n0.1 Initial release with barometer tweaks and probe report experiment\n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/StockScienceTweaks.zip)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T02:08:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"zilfondel","CreatedById":108254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T08:54:50Z","Content":"Just curious, how many science points do they give?

(they are both named ProbeReport). It was better as a separate experiment - Starwaster sought to replicate some of the crew report (I have cameras on my probe so I use that as a basis for this report) and the original telemetry report was pure probe data. So two separate probe experiments. For now I\u0027ve reverted back to the original telemetry data experiment. Also why the change in biomemask from 7 to 3?

I didn\u0027t look too closely at what StarWaster did for the reports, I was more interested in the MM code to make it work. Eventually I want to repurpose a stock part as a camera for a higher value experiment and give it a science value and transmission cost along the lines of the atmosphere analysis. Having it as a separate part means that you can easily add it to manned vessels as well, in my mind the crew report is a simple audio transmission where the crew reports in.\n\nFor the biome mash switch, in stock, the crew report in low orbit would give a generic low orbit response for all biomes, but EVA had a unique message (and science) for each biome. The switch flips these so you don\u0027t have to keep sending your Kerbals on EVA for every biome (which is kind of silly) and can get the science from crew reports instead. I plan on moving the biome specific EVA reports as appropriate to the crew report so you\u0027ll still get the unique messages.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T19:05:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T21:08:37Z","Content":"up to you ultimately if you feel reverting back is good for the mod.

Three guilty parties stand accused! Lord Aurelius, DuoDex, and Nightingale, you are accused of mod-mayhem! \n\nLord Aurelius - Crime: Duplicitous Duplication!\n\nDuoDex - Crime: Partially Defined Experiments!\n\nNightingale - Crime: Broad-spectrum Experiment Gathering! \n\nIssue: Field Research Contract Pack asks for \u0022Probe Report\u0022 experiments.\n\nProblem: No such report exists.\n\nReason:\n\n- Lord Aurelius\u0027 Mod [Stock Science Tweaks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114436-0-90-MM-WIP-Stock-Science-Tweaks) used to refer to them as Probe Reports but changed them to Telemetry Reports.\n\n1. Installing Stock Science Tweaks does not solve the problem because you only get a Telemetry Report button which does not satisfy the contract.\n\n2. If you have the SETI Community Tech Tree mod, it already incorporates Aurelius\u0027 SST mod, which gives you a duplicate Telemetry button; this one won\u0027t work either because SETI CTT\u0027s config file uses the updated Telemetry naming instead of Probe.\n\n- \u003E \n\u003E The Probe Report is for Lord Aurelius\u0027s [Stock Science Tweaks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114436-0-90-MM-WIP-Stock-Science-Tweaks). The fact that they are showing up for you is actually   \n\u003E due to a bug in Crowd Sourced Science, which DuoDex has already fixed (but not released).\n\n1. The Crowd Sourced Science mod has an incorrect config file\n\nGameData\\CrowdSourcedScience\\planets\\000\\_default\\StockScienceProbeTweaks.cfg\n\nThis file only partially defines an experiment called Probe Report, but because it is not a fully defined experiment, there is no way to perform this action in the game.\n\n- Nightingale\u0027s config files for the Field Research use: \n\n        experiments = AllExperiments().ExcludeAll([ evaReport, crewReport ]\n\n     This method was grabbing the broken Probe Report, mistaking it for a valid experiment for contracts.\n\nSolutions:\n\n- **End Users Like Me:** Remove the above mentioned StockScienceProbeTweaks.cfg file from Crowd Sourced Science so it won\u0027t show up in contracts. If you already have a contract asking for a Probe Report, you need to cancel it since it can\u0027t be completed. Further contracts will then ask for Telemetry Reports instead.\n- **Lord Aurelius:** Please get in touch with SETI CTT and see if you can find a way to avoid the button duplication if both mods are installed. Thanks!\n- **DuoDex:** You are already aware of the issue, but perhaps you could add a note in your main post until it is fixed? Or maybe even a super-tiny patch hotfix that simply removes the offending file? Or release the next update ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n- **Nightingale:** Uh, nothing really. The way you grab all experiments is the right way to do things. You get a gold star!\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Thank you all for your hard work and awesome mods.
