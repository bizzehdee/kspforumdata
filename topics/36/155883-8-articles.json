AmpYear actually estimates the EC requirement for a landed dark side transit as infinite. So pretty much any ground base (which is what KPBS is designed for) is going to have generation and sufficient storage. There\u0027s probably enough EC simply built into the modules to make it a trivial matter; there certainly is in MKS parts. I haven\u0027t actually included even a single EC storage part in my Minmus base, and it still has six figures of EC storage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: Biologist...

How is this any different? It just ties a different class to a different module, just like MKS does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe:\u00A0form over function... Of course, I didn\u0027t mean to imply that you\u0027re not making them functional. But someone who is satisfied with function alone would just use MKS and be done with it, was my logic. If they\u0027re going to go to the trouble of downloading two extra mods to get \u0022prettier\u0022 high-end ground bases, they obviously care about appearance quite a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: three different parts... Is there a coding reason why there needs to be a \u0027standard cost\u0027? There isn\u0027t in MKS. I\u0027m not sure I agree that it needs to be the same. The greenhouse is an inherently space-filled part, because the plants need room and light to grow. Until they -do- grow, that\u0027s all just empty space, making it easy to collapse to half size, and still have room to spare for the equipment needed to deploy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, I could totally see a habitation module requiring Material Kits, as there might not be enough room in the collapsed state for all of the furniture and equipment. So if the beds and life support are built into the wall sections, for example, they\u0027d have to ship up food prep equipment, exercise equipment, tables and chairs, etc, to fill out the middle section once it\u0027s expanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for it being annoying... I\u0027m not sure I agree. To me, the underlying spirit of MKS is to -not- have to ship things up. Material Kits are basically a third-tier product on the manufacturing tree (mining, precursor production, then MKs). That means it\u0027s not always feasible to manufacture them right away (or at all for a small mining outpost), so you have to ship some up. Water is first-tier... just mining. And KPBS has that lovely inline water drill already built in. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0So rather than having to ship up your water, that just means having enough power generation and cooling to run the drill, and enough supplies to handle the hour or so it\u0027ll take it to generate enough water to expand the greenhouse.

Material Kits are basically a third-tier product on the manufacturing tree (mining, precursor production, then MKs).

I like that it transforms the game from stock\u0027s \u0022go fetch science points from different biomes\u0022, into actually scanning and mapping planets, scouring them for the best locations, planning out what resources to get from where, and so on. I like the Duna and Ranger modules. They feel advanced but realistic. I just... really don\u0027t like the Tundra modules. I don\u0027t like the NASA design they were copied off of. To me, it looks like they landed a chunk of the ISS, rather than designing something that\u0027s actually built for the ground, and if Duna could Recycle, and could make Silicon, Refined Exotics, Colony Supplies, and Specialized Parts, I\u0027d just forget about Tundra unless I\u0027m building an orbital station, and never look back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, I like the KPBS models a lot, but I don\u0027t like how simple it is to \u0022colonize\u0022 with them, or that the upper limit of their usefulness is to just be able to say you have a colony, not to -do- much of anything with it, aside from maybe mine fuel, which frankly is not that hard to do in stock with a totally automated system with no kerbals at all. If I\u0027m gonna go to the trouble and expense and challenge of building permanent kerbal colonies, A: I want it to feel like I\u0027ve really accomplished something, which\u00A0MKS does extremely well... and B: I want it to be able to -do- something for me, which the integration with Workshop and Ground Construction do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m interested in this mod to basically be able to play MKS with prettier parts that make more sense to me for a near-future land base. Of course, it seems RD is making some rather gorgeous models for a larger form factor for MKS, so I dunno. I will check out Pathfinder, though. I\u0027d not heard of it until a few days ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...what am I saying, in terms of this discussion? *ponders*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I\u0027m saying, \u0022go big or go home\u0022, in a way. Either make the resources required to deploy serve as\u00A0a meaningful barrier that takes significant effort, to give the player a sense of achievement, or assume that the KPBS modules are inherently well-designed, and just need to expand with hydraulics and then nothing... no bolts to do up, nothing. An MK requirement that really just boils down to a single small\u00A0storage part and an engine to disassemble seems to me like creating extra busy-work with no real challenge; very small hoops for the player to arbitrarily have to jump through.

And yet to make them deployable with no effort kind of defeats the spirit of the Duna/Ranger feel of MKS (though not a pure Tundra base, actually).

Unfortunately, the recycler container profile was a little restrictive, so we\u0027ve made them more powerful than they *should* be volume-wise, but they are also much heavier. The alternative was going to be to make the recycling containers too weak to be useful. As for habitation times, we found that Nils\u0027 base parts tend to have a decent sized footprint, but they are only as tall as a kerbal needs. This means that they aren\u0027t terribly voluminous (compared to something spherical or cylindrical) but all of the space is useful living space; there aren\u0027t any awkward curves or anything. This is why we gave the base parts each a small hab multiplier. What I found was that the KPBS MK1 habitat would have less hab time than the Ranger mini hab even though they had roughly the same footprint. The mini hab, though, got very tall in the centre, so it had a higher volume. The MK1 habitat doesn\u0027t get nearly as tall, but it also doesn\u0027t lose the space around the edges either. Adding a small hab multiplier to base parts seemed to be a decent compromise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn MKS land, the only reason there\u0027s a cost for deployment is to consume/reassign mass (this by the way is done via a hidden resource so that you can launch light stuff and turn it into heavy stuff). \u00A0If you don\u0027t need to adjust mass, then no need to charge for deployment (and just use the deployed volume and deployed mass as noted above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis I was aware of - part of the discussion was how we wanted to do this without upsetting the balance of the parts.\u00A0 We knew from a pure balance standpoint that the resources weren\u0027t necessary for the mass, but we wanted some of the feel of having them.\u00A0 Hence a discussion on how many to use to make it feel realistic, non-trival, and yet not unbalance things.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E (This is part of this pack, not part of the PR I sent to Nils, as it\u0027s effectively an MKS mechanic, not a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E one.\u00A0 Which also means that the parts should balance fairly well either with or without the resources, as people will be using them both ways.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis reminds me: if we\u0027re using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E deployment module and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E converter/other modules, does that mean that the deployable base parts can only use their functions once they have been deployed?
