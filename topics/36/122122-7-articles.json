I think either way it would take large amounts of time. So to save resources staying in LEO would be the most cost efficient. Launch several SLS to refuel and resupply the Hermes would be insanely expensive. Plus building the Hermes which I suppose could have been done in LEO and then pushed out to a Lagrange point but if it was built that far out would be unjustifiably expensive. I think all the money should go to NASA lol but realistically I\u0027m just saying a project like that would be prohibitively expensive. So I think if we are cutting cost Hermes in LEO would be cheaper in terms of ressuplying and crewing at the cost of time to the crew escaping LEO at a snails pace. Again the issue is similar when the get to Mars. They aren\u0027t going to be to high of orbit at Mars because the higher they are the larger the MAV needs to be. So LMO would be optimal and could take a really long time to escape as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T18:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you\u0027re rignt, it could be built in LEO and then slowly get to Lagrange point on itself.

They couldn\u0027t slow down to get into Mars Orbit. They flew by and caught him, and the MAV needed to be heavily modified to get into a higher orbit and to match velocities. I think we are having three simultaneous conversations. Let me be clear I don\u0027t disagree with you about what would be better in real life I disagree with you about the feasibility of that infrastructure in the book and movie. Furthermore in real life I can\u0027t picture the program functioning like that. I mean we are talking about a little over a dozen SLS launches per Ares mission including one that would just have the crew? Im sorry that is prohibitively expensive. Yes it would take a very very long time to leave earths gravity like that in real life but NASA will easily trade time for money.
