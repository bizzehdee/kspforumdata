Jovzin youre model is too beautiful to just scrap. Maybe the changes that Mike has made can be applied to yours. Instead of have having Dragon do the cfg for it why not just let Mike do it.

Although it looks like the same textures (ready made one on google searc that even mine uses) it does have good animations but I guess the 3d model is different shape?. It will be tricky to get the animations to play right as ksp does not allow delays in animations by default and plays all at once from the same action. For example cargobay doors will open together. I manages to work around that. Also the dish he has may need to be a seperate item and use a comunitron cfg or similar. And the eva and ET flaps will need to be controlled manually or by action group.\n\nJovzin, I have unity import export experience and cfg creation I can get it to work in game and send it back to you then we can talk?\n\nFinding new textures means getting pics of the orbiter online and cut pasti g then modifying and then uv mapping which is what I wanted to do but I think we should have a go at jovzins model first? \n\nLet me know..."},{"CreatedByName":"Drj3199","CreatedById":143663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:28:53Z","Content":"Is anyone else having an issue with the SSME\u0027s not working?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T03:12:15Z","Content":"Thats odd.
