This is my first mod. I noticed that scramjet engines don\u0027t get much love here, so I decided to make one. The engines have higher efficiency and thrust the higher and faster you go, but needs to be going at around 700-900 m/s at around 10Km to produce much thrust. They\u0027re lighter than a turbojet engine, but cost more. There\u0027s one that stacks like a normal engine, and another that is attached radially.\n\n![YzPM04t.png](http://i.imgur.com/YzPM04t.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9A_UrSl_F0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nTo-do list:\n\n- Balancing\n- Better textures?\n- hotrockets config\n- Emissives\n- \n\nChangelog:\n\n0.02\n\nRedid atmosphere and velocity curves.\n\n0.03\n\nUpdated for 1.0.2 and added XE-202 radial scramjet\n\nDownload:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6c5Wgsrm-zTOU9sT3ZJTVVwV0U](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6c5Wgsrm-zTOU9sT3ZJTVVwV0U)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T03:45:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 03:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 8bitsblu**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T16:10:37Z","Content":"Watching this with great interest.

I plan on making a smaller, radial version of this engine that will be designed that way. I might add its own intake in the future, but for now I mostly want to get the engine working."},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T18:02:35Z","Content":"can you also add radial heat shields? like the space shuttle ones, because the 1.0.2 heat mealts the crafts"}]}
