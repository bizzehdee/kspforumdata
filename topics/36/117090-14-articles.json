As such, the standard F1 would not work for those boosters, it is far too large (its like 2.5m diameter even after scaling 64% for KSP).\n\nSo.. if I can find enough reference materials, I might look at doing an F1B engine as well.

Ideally I want to strap a couple of thrust transforms for SRBs onto a decoupler, and move the thrust transforms around (up/down) in addition to some model geometry (for the clamps/struts/surround rings). However this is going to require yet-another plugin and set of models and textures (will likely be making models for 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75m strut/attach rings), and as such I\u0027m currently lacking a bit of motivation to do much on it.

I\u0027m open to engines from wherever, but there needs to be a ton of pics and diagrams available for me to work on it.

(specs/images? All I can find is basically that -one- image that was linked earlier)\n\nI\u0027m trying to figure out how the heck they fit 2 of those engines underneath that booster. The engine is still huge (even though it is shorter/smaller diameter than the full F1), and there is no way that two of them would fit beneath a strap on booster when everyhing is done at KSP scale. At 64% the engine -bell- alone is 2.2m diameter (might go as low as 2m if I shorten it more); Just not seeing how two of those are supposed to fit under a 2.5m booster? (or even a 3.75m...just would not fit).\n\nHmm.. just found this ([http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2410/1](http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2410/1)) that suggests the boosters will have 5.5m tanks (3.52m at 64% scale; would probably just use 3.75m).

I\u0027m sure many others will be thankful as well ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nLet me know if you run into any questions regarding any config/plugin stuff along the way, will be glad to help you sort it all out.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi Shadowmage\n\u003E I realy like your stuff, realy. Your orion capsule is top of the line quality and have fonctionality that can\u0027t be found elsewhere. Its neat, combine many part and these jetisonable panel that act like cargo and sheild stuff inside is just awesome. I realy hope you keep going with this, and maybe do other capsule as well. I know there is many clone of the soyuz already. But I would love to have one that incorporate fonctionality that your Orion have.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you are going this way, may I ask for more stuff? Could you do a customisable engine? With a choice of feeding mechanism, gimbals and bells? And maybe even multiple bell like the RD-170 family? That would be something!\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ve tried to do things in a bit of a different way, glad you are finding them useful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t currently have any plans for other capsules...but if I do, the Soyuz stuff might well be on the list (seeing as how stock already has an Apollo-like module).\n\nI\u0027ve given quite a bit of though to the whole custom engines bit lately. Lots of thought. Ideally, yes, I would love to do something along those lines, and might eventually. For now though I will likely be sticking with pre-made engine models and allow choice of cluster configurations, engine shrouds, and perhaps some stats-only \u0027upgrade options\u0027 (might be texture switch even?). Heh, still working out all the details.\n\nRD-170 is on the list of engines I am going to look into creating models for. No clue if I\u0027ll actually be able to do it or not, but I\u0027m going to at least look into it at some point. Mostly it will depend on if I can find enough pictures/schematics. I\u0027m slowly learning to do things a bit more free-hand with the modeling, but still fairly reliant on diagrams and such for physical accuracy.\n\nToday\u0027s frustrating little gem:\n\nOne of the most often used upper stage engines, in one of its older variants\n\nRL-10A-3-1 (the 1966 model)\n\n![s4tAJMe.png](http://imgur.com/s4tAJMe.png)\n\nSome of that piping was...not easy to figure out, and the turbopump assembly in real life has got to be the most convoluted assembly I have ever seen be cast by molds. So many ins, outs, shafts, gears...wow. And I thought the F1 turbopump was bad. Sadly, I\u0027m not quite yet up to the task of trying to model the pump in too much detail... but I think I got the important bits. And there are many, many, different variants of this engine; trying to find consistent information was...ugh. I probably still have some details from other variants in there... hard to keep them all straight.\n\nAlso going to do 2 other RL-10 variants\n\nRL-10A-4-2N -- modern day \u0027short\u0027 RL-10, which has a short extendable nozzle (in reality it is offered with no extension, fixed extension, or mechanical extension); minor thrust, isp, and mass increase\n\nRL-10B-2-1 -- the long one, used on the ICPS and many others. Has a nozzle extension that more than doubles the length of the nozzle, and increases ratio from 84 to ~285. decent thrust and isp increase, but more than doubles the mass.\n\nShould give a decent selection of upper stage engines as they all have fairly different stats IRL. Looking into a few other engines as well... but honestly the RL10 has been used almost exclusively for US upper stages (and I\u0027m not all that familiar with the Russian stuff...yet). The other main candidate is the AJ-10 engine; a hypergolic thruster that has been (and still is) used everywhere, in many different variants. Between the two it should offer a fairly decent selection of smaller upper stage engines.\n\nNot quite sure what to do regarding smaller lifter / lower stage engines. I suppose I\u0027ll have to look into some of the old missiles? Any suggestions towards that end?\n\nYes, I\u0027m probably going to get 6\u002B engines made up with geometry only before I go onto the next step, as I need a good assortment of mounting and fuel inlet layouts in order to plan how the next pieces will work geometry wise (the mounting plates and fuel distributors for clusters). Hopefully I\u0027ll have enough engines by mid next week, and can start working on the mounting stuff for that weekend.\n\nSo, quick heads up that there might not be much/anything on this weekends update. I\u0027ll take a look into the effects stuff likely Sat. morning, so might have some of that ready. In the meantime, if you see any bugs you need squashed for this update, let me know sooner rather than later ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T06:36:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not quite sure what to do regarding smaller lifter / lower stage engines.

Would it be possible to unify these a bit more?\n\nAye, I will be offering the RS-25 in various cluster options as well / as part of the configurable engine stuff. However I have to redo it a bit to add all the plumbing/pumps and bring it in line with the other engine models.\n\nOn the ICPS/HUS balance -- yep, there is a pretty wide gap between them at the moment. \n\nI\u0027m fairly happy where the HUS is; it has been balanced (volume wise at least) to be in line with stock fuel tanks for resources and mass, and is intended as its name would suggest, a -Heavy- upper stage, to enable lifting of the 200-400t payloads that the system should be capable of. Which is also why it has gobs of thrust. I might have forgotten about the ISP; it is supposed to be down in the ~340 range.\n\nThe ICPS though, has been balanced towards being a dedicated range-extender for the CSM stack to enable Mun/Minmus operation (and is likely useless for any other purpose). I\u0027m basically trying to emulate the performance stats you would get if the thing were actually LH2 powered, without breaking stock balancing in regards to ISP. I\u0027m not entirely happy with it though, and will likely be redoing it a bit, but unsure what direction to go with it. Would love to bring it in-line with stock balancing; the problem is you end up with \u003E3.5kms of dV from it (with the CMS on top) due to its volume, and it ends up weighing 35t by itself due to stock fuel densities and poor ISP, making it far too heavy and powerful for its intended purpose."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T17:20:34Z","Content":"So are you going to make an Ares rocket from Constellation?"}]}
