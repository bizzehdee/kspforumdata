As stated, negative mass did not cause any particular change, while negative friction had an unintended side effect. While it was utterly useless for providing lift above 35KM, it did have a few amusing and one potentially useful side effect. One of the side effect, the useful one, is that if you started going really horizontal, you would eventually accelerate to escape velocity, which means in theory if we could change drag mid-air (possibly with the help of the chute), we could make a device which would allow an easy 35KM orbit.\n\nThe other side effect, more amusing this one, is that while it DID slingshot you out of the planet, the reverse was also true. Which made the parachute obsolete - it made the ship accelerate towards the ground anyway. \n\nAlthough now that I think of it, I might have a new part idea in the making. Anyone here excelling at making orbits?"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T20:57:09Z","Content":"Haha, I tried making a ramjet with negative drag.

If drag were a vector instead of a scalar, maybe...\n\nWhat an AWESOME idea!!\n\nI see the problem with it producing thrust in the yaw direction though... that kinda sucks. I\u0027m trying to think of a workaround...\n\nI know that most parts have separate minimum and maximum drag parameters, which I presume are for forward flight and for sideways flight. Obviously, for a ramjet, we\u0027d only want the FORWARD-FLIGHT value (i.e. minimum drag) to be negative. However, this alone is still not fully sufficient, as it would still cause a divergent situation at low AOA until the (presumably interpolated) drag value crossed the zero mark. To make up for this, I\u0027d probably look into using the winglet module instead and adding some degree of lift to pull the net-force vector back to (or at least close to) the centerline of the rocket.\n\n[Also, drag IS a vector. By definition, it is always in the direction opposite your direction of flight (which is NOT necessarily the direction you\u0027re pointed, mind you). The other component of total aerodynamic force is lift, which is - by definition - PERPENDICULAR to the direction of flight.]"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-08T20:35:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, drag IS a vector.\n\n I think you know what I mean.

Alter the direction or strength of the force by config file.\n\nThe values in the .cfg are LABELED as coefficients (well, in the winglets anyways), which makes sense, because there\u0027s naturally no way to dictate the velocity or dynamic pressure of a part through configuration. However, I\u0027m not certain that they actually are coefficients, as that would mean that the program would have to dictate the characteristic area being used to determine the drag FROM this coefficient (and velocity and density and whatnot). This COULD be done via a simple calculation of frontal cross-sectional area, or an on-the-fly calculation of head-on area with respect to the direction of travel (doubtful), or more likely, this \u0027coefficient\u0027 is actually the \u0027drag area,\u0027 that is, the true drag coefficient TIMES the characteristic area. I still need to test for this; if this is indeed the case, the part developer would need to manually input higher drag values for larger parts of the same shape.\n\nA little insight from the game devs would be wonderful right now... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"techtakular","CreatedById":1981,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-10T16:06:43Z","Content":"bump"},{"CreatedByName":"millsw","CreatedById":4053,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-10T17:51:36Z","Content":"in the night."}]}
