The problems that cause one are different from what causes the other, so that added to my confusion. It also doesn\u0027t help that I haven\u0027t gotten to test anything in about a week \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I have some potential ideas for what is causing the ridiculously fast rollouts. I know it\u0027s due to the change in the formula, but might also have to do with the mass calculation of the ship (which are related). I\u0027m going to look at what I changed compared to what it was before. I imagine reconditioning is similarly affected, since those use the same formula (and are, in fact, the same internal data types).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESvm420\u003C/strong\u003E the way you can save a scene change is that now you don\u0027t have to roll out a vessel at the space center, go to the VAB to select the launch site, and then go back to the space center to launch the ship. Instead you roll out the vessel at the space center, go to the VAB to select the launch site, and launch from the VAB. You still have to do rollout in a scene where time passes (space center, flight, tracking station). They have to be totally rolled out to let you launch. I need to make sure that it works properly for the SPH and when rollout percent is 0. I actually haven\u0027t tested launching from the VAB at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: HA, found the issue! KCT_GameStates.timeSettings.BuildEffect is not the same as KCT_GameStates.timeSettings.ReconditioningEffect. I accidentally am using the Build Effect instead of the Reconditioning Effect.

Which is why I\u0027m glad people like you are testing out these development versions and letting me know what issues you find, since I don\u0027t get enough time to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for KK, like I mentioned in the main thread, after this next release I\u0027m gonna try to get some tighter integration with KK so it isn\u0027t such a pain to use KCT with it. Things like rollout and reconditioning on a per launchsite basis, along with letting you choose the launch site when you go to launch from the space center or flight. It should also open up multiple launchpads in the stock game, which I have a kind of cool idea for how to handle (since each pad will be upgraded independently, I\u0027m going to use the stock upgrade system and \u0022replace\u0022 the launchpad with the one you have selected. So if you have a tier 3 launchpad as your primary, and a tier 1 launchpad as your secondary, when you switch from the tier 3 to the tier 1 it will actually switch the model to the tier 1 launchpad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll need to figure out how to handle switching pads if you destroy one of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once I add in the things mentioned in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/issues/56\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis github issue\u003C/a\u003E (point 2 from the post I made at the end of the previous page of this thread) then I\u0027m gonna try to come up with some example configurations that people might find interesting. RP-0 will obviously have one that will have some major changes, but two of the ones I\u0027m considering are one that makes things in line with ExtraPlanetary Launchpads times, and a second one that \u0022simplifies\u0022 things by relying entirely on the Stock upgrades and doesn\u0027t use upgrade points at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat second one sounds like fun to me. Things like having build rates have 3 tiers in line with the R\u0026amp;D center tiers, and the number of build rates in each building determined by their level. (So R\u0026amp;D tier 1 might have rates of (1.0, 0.5, 0.25) with only 1 rate unlocked with VAB level 1. If you up to R\u0026amp;D tier 2 the rates go to (1.5, 1.0, 0.5) or if you unlock VAB tier 2 you unlock the second rate (so 0.5 with R\u0026amp;D tier 1, or 1.0 with R\u0026amp;D tier 2). Tech node rates might depend only on their cost, or might get a boost with R\u0026amp;D tier (so if you unlock tier 2 without unlocking all of the tier 1 nodes, the remaining tier 1 nodes will unlock faster).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to start a thread to have people submit configs so we can have a \u0022library\u0022 of them, but I doubt too many people will take the time to play around with them that much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
