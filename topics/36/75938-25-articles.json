Sorry, I\u0027m getting a little ahead of myself. Spanner made the fatal mistake of offering to help, so I challenged him to make an Auxiliary Power Unit.

Basically a self-contained, miniaturised, turbo-electric power plant.

As for the intake-air thing, you might just work around that issue by adding a generator to the config that takes an input of intake-air and outputs oxidizer.

Actually, if you do figure out how to make it happen without user input, we might finally be able to upgrade those dual-mode engines to actually automatically switch modes in both directions ad advertized, instead of only switching to rocket mode when flaming out due to loosing the atmospheric intake of air.

I still have the original RBI tracks here, they just dont work anymore, very little or no torque at all, but if you want the models, i can get them to you aswell. \u003Cp\u003EBest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might pass on trying to set that up in my install! I\u0027ll get back to you with some testing bits, though, thanks. I did spot a potential pitfall in the code.

The big ones, not so much. I\u0027d love to see some more wheels too, I used to use the rollkage ones before I found these. Those seem to be abandoned unfortunately.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERollcage were always my favoured wheels before I started with my own.

I wouldn\u0027t mind getting the old ones working again, but some of the stuff they were showing off when the mod was last actually worked on were looking down right amazing.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I totally love that you, Haifi, tell us you\u0027re having problems with a craft that I must say looks to me like a completely insane rover that I\u0027d be afraid I was going to break every time I sneezed. I\u0027d love to see that thing in action though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat RBI crawler thing is a monster! I might get a flash of inspiration one day, but I won\u0027t promise anything! TBH, I think it needs and deserves its own dedicated plugin to make it into a proper mobile launch platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just took a peek at the poll results. It shouldn\u0027t take me long to get the RBI track unit I\u0027m working released, which should satisfy at least some of the desire for more tracks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I have a couple of robust rover bodies already made that I\u0027ve had good feedback on from the testing team, though, like everything, they need some texture love.
