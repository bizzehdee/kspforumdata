Especially when it comes to wings. D12 wings are almost useless, especially to FAR users, due to their collider issues (no good radial attachment is possible) and aerodynamic model issues. D12 missiles are nice, but ultimately, there\u0027s no difference between warheads, fin sets and engines. And there should be. Texture switcher is nice, but mesh switcher needs to be used with care, and not abused like D12 does.
