Other Unity games offer multiplayer so obviously you could make multiplayer work in KSP just as easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem, however, is that KSP revolves around features and mechanics that simply don\u0027t function in a multiplayer environment. If you had a vote for warp, then you\u0027d only be able to warp when everyone\u0027s ready and you\u0027d still wind up waiting large amounts of time. If you did the thing where you phase out into a singleplayer instance while warping, then your position and the position of all the planets would have to synch together with the server, which would be a very jarring and immersion-breaking experience for people, if you had multiple people controlling the same ship...well, I just don\u0027t really think that\u0027d be all that fun, not going to lie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what I\u0027ve always thought would be really fun multiplayer in KSP would be...basically kerbal Moonbase Alpha.

The clients will have to share information on which engines are active, engine throttle information, engine thrust vectors, fuel supplies, etc. Also, if the ship being controlled remotely is actually performing an engine burn then the calculations for that burn will be being done seperately on two different machines, which could result in positional deviation, that means additional synchronisation code is going to be needed to keep the ships from diverging in each game instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, the game doesn\u0027t call any special functions in response to a change of field data, which means you\u0027re probably forced into periodically polling for updates on every part module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative might be to try a lot of visual trickery to make two ships appear to be the same, even if they\u0027re not - that might involve spawning cloned ships with fake part modules that look like the original but don\u0027t actually do anything other than produce visual effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth approaches sound nightmarishly complicated but I wish the developer well and will be interested to see how this develops.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T04:06:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pwolf","CreatedById":75262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T14:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately, I think Majiir is right in that timewarp is not the real problem - it\u0027s synchronising all the game coordinates as well as synchronising the states of each PartModule between game instances.

However, like most of the other MP related projects, this may die also. I\u0027m not promising anything so please don\u0027t expect too much out of me or this project. I do appreciate the words of encouragement though. So, thanks and I hope I\u0027ll be able to show you guys some more stuff as I work through it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T05:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I can say is goodluck, given that multiplayer has \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eless than 1% chance to be implemented as an in-game feature\u003C/a\u003E, due to a number of issues that must be addressed first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd by the fact that pretty much everyone that has been here for a considerable amount of time is \u003Cem\u003Esick and tired\u003C/em\u003E of seeing random multiplayer suggestions and ideas thread popping up anywhere in the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOT: I then remember people before who created mods to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etransform Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (which is STRICTLY singleplayer) into a LAN game\u003C/a\u003E, with varying levels of success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T05:41:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 05:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Flixxbeatz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"22andrew22","CreatedById":80755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T08:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m excited looking at your work.

We\u0027re also assuming that players will want to play an entire game with you start to finish.. in reality this is not a practical proposition to expect from the vast majority of players. Instead how about we have a feature to invite people to play with a single mission controller player, who controls game speeds. You would have provide some sort of communication and then provide a vote system for warps, Nothing in the game would actually belong to player X or A, B, C it all belongs to the controller. with the caveat that on one player can control 1 kerbal at a time. The controller has control of the ships, although he could transfer control to a \u0027pilot\u0027 That\u0027s right 1 kerbal.. if you die, back to the KSC. getting players to control kerbals instead of ships could allow multiple players riding on one ship doing 1 mission only needing 1 time reference for warping. I think this is where a multiplayer function could really shine.. forget about merging whole solar systems and space programs.. invite your friends to yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour welcome, this idea is for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
