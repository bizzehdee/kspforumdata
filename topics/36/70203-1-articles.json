This way, standard sized parts would fit inside them, if a bit snugly. The set is supposed to be extremely modular, so you can build a ship in whatever configuration is best suited to your desired mission profile.

Rather than make another part that was only able to be used with this specific pack, what I did was put additional stack nodes on the adapter and separator. It\u0027s easier to see if you have the part open, but there are a set of nodes even with the top of the rim that are used for attaching the structural parts, and there is a set of nodes flush with the base for attaching other things to. These, along with the stack node on the side-mount on that version of the saddle truss, I intended for people to be able to attach docking ports/decouplers to, so that the current ones available could be used easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still the possibility of adding one though, if the demand is there.

The main difference is that choosing the diameter would rescale the entire part rather than just the width. His menu allows rescaling in (iirc) 0.25m increments, which should coincidentally allow proper resizing for any RSS utilization as well. As my personal abilities for coding the plugin are next to non-existant, I\u0027ll have to sell someone else with the proper skills and the willingness to keep it updated on the idea.
