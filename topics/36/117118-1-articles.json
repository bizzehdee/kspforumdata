The ShareAlike building block in first license requires that the newly created work is released under that license and can therefore be used commercially, whereas the second license requires you to release the new add-on under a license that does not permit commercial use.\n\n* * *\n\n**Remixing add-ons with a NoDerivative building block**\n\nIt is not possible to use an add-on in a remix where NoDerivative is a building block, as said add-ons released under this license may only be distributed in their original form. This restriction also applies to portions/subsets of the original add-on, including cropped or lower-resolution images/textures.\n\n* * *\n\n**Original Version**\n\n[https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Wiki/cc_license_compatibility](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Wiki/cc_license_compatibility) - fixed spelling/grammatical errors in the original, adapted paragraphs to fit the context of add-on authoring for KSP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T03:52:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**\n  \nEmphasis on using the \u0022most restrictive\u0022 licence for combined works"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T00:05:20Z","Content":"What if we add in the BSD (2-, 3- \u0026 4-clause), MIT, GPL and LGPL licenses?

While this may annoy certain users who prefer everything they need to be include in an all-in-one package, not only does my approach sidestep the licencing/redistribution issue, but also ensures that said dependencies can be updated independently from their original source without versioning conflicts. Add-on managers like CKAN make this process much easier for proponents of all-in-one add-on installations."},{"CreatedByName":"sardet","CreatedById":194966,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-25T11:17:51Z","Content":"It\u0027s more clear now"}]}
