While this works somewhat I\u0027m still looking for a proper way to get the filepath of parts as the AvaiblePart fields regarding those information are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can rename and reorder tags to your likings, this happens both inside the tag editor as well as on the toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe visibility of tags on the toolbar can be switched between full visibility, only in SPH, only in VAB and hidden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe partlists inside the tag editor is filtered to your current editor category, can be ordered by part cfg name, part title and part manifacturer and omits already included parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in development is a searchbox / quick filter in order to filter both the editor partlist aswell as the tag editor partlist by part name and manufacturer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther planned are key shortcuts to the tags on your toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t finished by far, I still got a few ideas for it, but if you got some ideas how to improve it or got some other feedback please post it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T03:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea.
