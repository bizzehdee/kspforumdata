The easiest way to do that is with the SUBMODEL setup.  You would need to change the docking port model defs to something like:\n\n    SSTU_MODEL\n    {name = Dock-LargemodelName = Dock-LargeinvertForTop = falseinvertForBottom = true//vOffset needs adjusted by scale 0.05 * 0.938 = 0.0469verticalOffset = 0.0469//height needs adjusted for scale, old = 0.29 * 0.938 = 0.27202height = 0.27202//diameter gets adjusted by scale as welldiameter = 2.347mass = 0volume = 0upgradeUnlock = SSTU-ST-DockUpgradeLargecost = 1000fairingDisabled = truefairingTopOffset = 0defaultTextureSet = none//need to adjust node for the scale below//old = node = 0, 0.29, 0, 0, 1, 0node = 0, 0.272252, 0, 0, 1, 0SUBMODEL{\tmodelName = Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPortSr/model\tposition = 0, 0, 0\trotation = 0, 0, 0\t//scale is the ratio of the new diamter to the raw unscaled diameter of the model\t//2.347 / 2.5 = 0.938\tscale = 0.938, 0.938, 0.938}\n    }\n\nNote that you need to adjust verticalOffset, height, diameter, and node positions in the model definition for the change in model scale.  What the SUBMODEL block of code does is manipulate the model before the ModelData/ModularParts even see it.  So as far as the other sysetms are concerned, the model is exactly like you specify in the config (the rest of the system still sees the model at its \u0027new\u0027 100% scale, which is 2.347m in diameter).\n\nAlso note that most of the fields in the model definitions don\u0027t specify the values that get used in the modular parts; they specify the parameters of the model at 100% scale, which are then used to calculate what scale various bits need to be at when you select \u00272.5m diamter\u0027 on the diameter adjustment sliders.\n\nOn the station-core parts, there is no \u0027diameter adjustment\u0027, and the docking port models get used unscaled.  This is why changing the \u0027diameter\u0027 in the model definition did not work (the station-core module does not scale the docking port models; they are not intended to be scale-able).  On other models changing the \u0027diameter\u0027 would not work how you are expecting either.  Basically... don\u0027t change the specified diameters, there is no reason to, and it will only break things.\n\nAnd final note:  The above patch is untested.  If it doesn\u0027t work for you, the documentation on how to fix it is all online (source code for the plugins [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/tree/master/Source](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/tree/master/Source)  ).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, NotTheRealRMS said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Are the diameters hardcoded to refuse anything that doesn\u0027t conform to Stock standards?\n\u003E \n\nHehe, I\u0027ll let this slide, as you are obviously new here. \n\nClose to nothing is hard-coded in SSTU, you just need to know the proper way to adjust the configs (which is undocumented outside of the plugin source code; which is actually excellent documentation for me, but might be hard for other to read...)."},{"CreatedByName":"ridik58","CreatedById":16077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T20:43:36Z","Content":"Hello is anyone able to make a patch to have the ISRUs that produce carburan (lqd Hydrogen, NTO, Aerozine)?

At this points most parts support recoloring, with the last few expected to be converted within the next couple of weeks.  -Tons- of back-end code/module side changes that need testing, as well as all of the new texture sets/coloring configuration options that need a good looking over.  Would love to have a couple more sets of eyes going over it to make sure that the initial release of the new system is as good as it can be.\n\nGeneral Development Updates:\n\nStill working on the recoloring system.  Shaders are done, MFT tanks and engine mounts are done.  MUS, nosecones, and adapter textures are mostly done (need some texture side cleanup).  MSRB parts are WIP, with the StationCore scheduled for a bit later in the week.  Last up is a bit of code-side work to enable recoloring for all of the fairing types used by SSTU (NodeFairing, ISDC, resizable stock fairings); should be some simple changes to get those working, mostly just adding in the persistent fields to track the user-configured colors.\n\nDebating whether to release the recoloring stuff as a final 1.2.2 update, or wait for 1.3 to be officially available.  As there are quite a few potentially craft/save breaking changes, I would prefer to hold off for the KSP update, but things could go either way depending on the timing of the 1.3 release and how quickly the rest of the work (and testing) gets completed.\n\nOne highlight of the recent work that I can share is the consolidation of the MSRB parts into a single in-editor part, using the same type of \u0027variant\u0027 system that is in use by the MFT-A tanks.

Anyway I do not consider myself as reliable enough to do this. About updating prior to 1.3, you do not have to, the current release is more than ok for anyone that would wish to stick with 1.2.2.
