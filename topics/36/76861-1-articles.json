Most of the players that have been in KSP for a while have probably experienced the same thing. You add stuff till it lags then stop going there because it\u0027s too laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I figured, what if my base had all the same functionality but only took a few fairly simple parts. My first thought was a saucer configuration since it seemed appropriate for little green men, but pretty much any shape would work. The image below should give you an idea of what I had in mind. The pillar in the center of the ship would be the core. This would be a probe core so it would be the basis of your ship but wouldn\u0027t be able to fly the ship by itself. (more on that later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached to the core would be the upper and lower mounting plates. There would be a couple of variations of each depending on how you wanted to set up the ship. Choices for the lower plate would be single center engine or multiple engine setup. (multi would be needed for an unbalanced ship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChoices for the upper would be a flat disc, or a dome for a second upper deck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween the upper and lower plates and surrounding the core you\u0027d have a number of wedge shaped modules. This is where most of the customizing happens. These wedges could be maned cockpits or drone cores. They could be fuel tanks or batteries. They could be short term passenger compartments for many or long term compartments for few. They could be kethane converters or KAS storage lockers. And of course you\u0027d have a few empty boxes that you could fill with normal KSP parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nice thing is that most parts are just a mesh and a config file so if you distribute a UV template image with the mod people can paint their own textures, add a config, and get any module they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp to this point it\u0027s just standard KSP stuff with less parts in a different configuration. If I\u0027m not mistaken, anyone can define a resource in KSP. This would allow you to customize installed modules by adding stuff like CPU cycles or Crewed Workstations or Science Equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: suppose you add a lab module to your ship. It would weigh 3 tons, need 2 crew to operate, contain 5 science equipment, and need 10 CPU cycle. And it would transmit at the same level as a stock lab. Add another 5 science equipment to it and it weighs 4 tons, needs 20 CPU cycles, and needs 3 crew to operate, but transmits 5% better than the stock lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should all be possible with config files and most modules would be upgradable, but there would always be a tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also thinking the tradeoff would carry over to the drive system. You could choose from chemical rockets for high thrust but low isp, electric drive for high isp and low thrust, (like a more powerful ion engine) and a third system that allows you to adjust the thrust/isp ratio on the fly. Of course that one would be less efficient than either of the other options, but more versatile. (one of the mod packs out already has an engine like that, but I can\u0027t recall which one just now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the engines would also require CPU cycles so the basic core alone wouldn\u0027t be enough to run them. You\u0027d also need a drone pilot or crewed cockpit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d still have to compromise at every stage of the design, but would end up with a ship with less parts that should be less prone to lag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thought is that if the central core was surrounded by invisible docking ports rather than just connect nodes, and each module had a built in docking port, you could change modules in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s what I had in mind when I started the object in the picture. Now that I\u0027ve realized I don\u0027t have the ability to pull it off perhaps someone more talented would be interested in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/582404500468042054/3C9BD83EEE40CA7A0572B8AFDF67B180F0D7B2EA/\u0022 alt=\u00223C9BD83EEE40CA7A0572B8AFDF67B180F0D7B2EA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T04:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not aware of any mod currently that implements a CPU cycles type of resource, so you would have to build a DLL to support it. Oh, I think I got it...much like a command pod has the requirement for X kerbals to operate, you simply provide X cpu cycles (like a fuel type) to power your additional parts. Kewl idea. As for the modular ship/base, thats a good idea.
