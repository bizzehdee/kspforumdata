While they are similar, there are some fundamental differences, such as the part ID being a part of the part name instead of on a separate line. Easy enough, a regex solves that.\n\nNow i\u0027ve come to the position and rotation part of the two files. In the .craft I assume it\u0027s relative to some point in the VAB, but what about in the .sfs? Centre of mass of whatever body you\u0027re orbiting?\n\nIs there any documentation of these two file formats? Google has given me some, but it\u0027s mostly research done by others who have also been going by intuition, guesswork, as well as trial and error."}]}
