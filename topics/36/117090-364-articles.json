Lighter upper stage means more lower stage delta-V. (the reason why Saturn V second and third stages were hydrogen based)\n\nI put a permanent single stage lander over the Mun to service the tourists that I keep getting contracts for. To maintain it I need a depot. To maintain the depot I will need regular shipments out there. Aerozine50 was the original best choice for the lander but that resulted in  1300 ton propellant shipments. Methane and hydrogen were 700 and 500 tons respectively. Methane gave better performance isp wise for the lander but hydrogen won out again to drive the shipment costs lower. Those were all real choices I had to make last night that weren\u0027t roleplaying choices. So now I have a lander design using the LC5 pod \u002B lengthened lander tanks \u002B a cupola for the pilot. (six tourist lander design...) - hydrogen based.
