In fact, Lockheed deleted some of the required HLV hardware from the CCB tooling back in 2004, which is why there is the 30 month lead time on building one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELockheed flew all the parts of what was to be the first Atlas V Heavy to Florida in 2003, but never stacked or launched it because their only customer at the time (the USAF and NRO) was unable to fly the variant due to the use of the RD-180 engine, which restricts the Atlas V from being available for \u0022National Security\u0022 missions as it is not a domestically developed or produced engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Atlas V Heavy would have not had fuel crossfeed between the boosters. It would have used a modified throttle profile on the center CCB to conserve fuel during the Stage.0 flight portion very similar to how Lockheed does on the Delta IV Heavy. Fuel hoses on booster segments has always been an extremely iffy thing as the pipes are subjected to extreme forces during launch and you are playing with fire (literally) if those hoses don\u0027t fully evacuate prior to separation and the activation of the separation charges.

As on commercial airliners, protective shells surround each engine to contain a worst-case situation such as fire or a chamber rupture, and prevent it from affecting the other engines and stages. A disabled engine is automatically shut down, and the remaining engines operate slightly longer to compensate for the loss without detriment to the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFalcon Heavy will be the first rocket in history to feature propellant cross-feed from the side boosters to the center core. Propellant cross-feeding leaves the center core still carrying the majority of its propellant after the side boosters separate. This gives Falcon Heavy performance comparable to that of a three-stage rocket, even though only the single Merlin engine on the upper stage requires ignition after lift-off, further improving both reliability and payload performance. Should cross-feed not be required for lower mass missions, it can be easily turned off.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnticipating potential astronaut transport needs, Falcon Heavy is also designed to meet NASA human rating standards. Falcon Heavy is designed to higher structural safety margins of 40% above flight loads, rather than the 25% level of other rockets, and triple redundant avionics. Despite being designed to higher structural margins than other rockets, the Falcon Heavy side booster stages have a mass ratio (full vs. empty) above 30, better than any launcher in history. By comparison, the Delta IV side boosters have a mass ratio of about 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CAPFlyer","CreatedById":8575,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T14:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
