This leaved me with the option of either having slightly retracted Rover wheels or using the low altitude jetfuel engines. However, since landings can be rough, i needed the sturdy wheels till touchdown, meaning more Debris and a slight drop if cut off then (possible wheel explosion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the fast Jet engines AND having to land upright meaned I needed a wider base, wich lead to the structural beams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wings themselves are fairly simple: every wing is connected to the decoupler, and upon firing the stage seperatrons eject the wing upwards and outwards, while parachutes on the top side of the craft (landing upright) deploy. (Btw, you might wanna cut off the engine a bit earlier , or it will make a looping).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Weaponry ist just a Abrams turret slapped ontop of the thing, and the Bombs are somewhat counterweight, and allow for a fly-by-bombing before you land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it, tell me what you think about it, I might upload the craft file if there are multiple requests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: forgot to mention that you need to take off by going full speeds to the end of the runway, and lift the nose CAREFULLY, otherwise the flappy wings become unstable. Also it is not very manouverable (It\u0027s a tank, duhh).
