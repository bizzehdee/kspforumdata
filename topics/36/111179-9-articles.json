Kopernicus exported normal, however, is already set to 50%. Also, for memory usage, I would recommend making all the normals into greyscale. you can do that with Gimp2 (what I also use as primary planet texture editor) selecting greyscale in the \u0022image\u0022 panel. You can also do that with photoshop but I don\u0027t use it so I have no knoledge of how to do that.
