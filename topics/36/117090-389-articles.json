With a better UI that\u0027s how it could work in KSP 2. One part replaces a few hundred - no jokes - and the mod also has a myriad of other highly-detailed, multi-function parts and habitats. I can\u0027t stress how much I wish this mod was being actively developed to become one mod to rule them all. It could use a custom UI and procedural replacements for even more parts (although it replaces most.) I\u0027m not a fan of TweakScale because scaling engines defeats the purpose of having more than 1 of each type - SSTU doesn\u0027t scale them. It clusters them automatically with customizable mount types.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u0027t completely work in 1.10, as some parts are broken or invisible, and even the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E is outdated with the screenshots missing. Most features work correctly.\n\n![1aLi3NY.png](https://i.imgur.com/1aLi3NY.png)\n\nThis **one-part** fuel tank is just an example of what you could customize a fuel tank into (not that you want to make something that looks like this.) But don\u0027t forget the rest of SSTU parts which may not be in the KSP art style (like the real engines) but look great nonetheless. \n\nBug: the node at the top of this contraption is backwards.\n\n**SSTU is an alternative to many of the popular mods**, allowing you to have 1 parts mod instead of 10 (if you want to have the same functionality but less parts): ReStock\u002B, Fuel Tanks Plus, KW Rocketry, Near Future Launch Vehicles, SpaceY Heavy Lifters\u0026Expanded, RLA - essentially any mod that adds fuel tanks, normal rocket engines and boosters but also adapters, and makes engine clusters using really well-modelled real-life engines with thrust up to 3300 kN. SSTU also rivals Near Future Solar, the 3rd most downloaded parts pack on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Planetary Base System, Stockalike Station Parts (adding parts with the same functions) and other mods that add bigger lander and command modules *to a degree*, station parts and parts for bases.\n\nI wish more of the parts were grouped into single parts using the B9 parts switch, such as the solar panels, habitats, etc. This is a must-have in a future update.\n\nWhy is this masterpiece of a mod no longer developed to the point that it\u0027s not even on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and the screenshots from the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
