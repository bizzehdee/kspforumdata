A year ago, the only experience I had programming was \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E amount of C for micro controllers, and wheels were still largely an obscure mystery in KSP.

All the steering, torque, braking, rolling resistance and load curves need editing, as do weights, costs and descriptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaalidas, I think we ought to look at changing the method used for DustFX. Rather than detecting collisions using hooks into OnColliisionEnter etc. - which are prefect if you want to detect an object colliding with something in any fashion - we might be better served getting KFModuleWheel to drive the particle emission based on the hit info from the colliders (which it accesses anyway). That way we know it\u0027s a wheel collider creating the collision, and can tailor the effects much more effectively. Most of the work you\u0027ve already done can stay as-is - we just need to hook into the DustFX module and call the emissions methods from KFModuleWheel, rather than the hooks into OnCollision*. Same goes for the repulsor module; which is nearly finished btw, and much more maintainable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m messing with that, and given your new found skills with confignodes, could you figure out a way to create a global config file?

The colors are referenced using the config file that I uploaded which contains all the definitions, and are called up using a body/biome name, and lat/lon coords. I don\u0027t really understand much about how it really works, cause that part was written by xEvilReaperx and I \u003Cem\u003Ebarely\u003C/em\u003E managed to get it all working with the original CollisionFX code back when the color project was being worked on. I may have to compare the current code with the unchanged project that I have still under a separate folder from back before I merged with KF. By the way, I watched that video. Nice audio. The dust effects on static buildings such as the KSC (including its non-PQS grass and such) will always produce only the default color, which is supposed to be an extremely subtle gray color. In fact, more subtle than you\u0027ve displayed in that video. I mean, real vehicles don\u0027t really produce much of an effect on the road unless they\u0027re spinning the tires. That would be an awesome thing to have in KSP by the way, some wheels just stopping completely when the brake is applied, others just spinning and producing massive amounts of dust (and generating lots of heat). Something for the future. The larger dust effects were meant for off-road applications, with the largest dust plumes being emitted on snow and sand, or when being repulsed at high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a little testing today and found that, probably due to your changing of the modules and the methods they make use of, tracks such as the small ones no longer respond to the ride height adjustments. I also discovered that, when attached to something like the rollcage, they have an immense amount of torque. In fact, with a torque ratio of 1, which is the default, I could flip the craft just by moving forward slightly. That\u0027s not the biggest concern though, cause I was able to do an entire back flip (and landed on my head after it continued flipping after a complete flip) when I did the exact same thing but with the E-brake applied. That\u0027s right, those tracks were running at full speed, \u003Cem\u003Ewith the emergency brake on\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E, \u003C/em\u003Eeven with the torque ratio set to 0.25! If you thought the mole tracks on an under-weight craft would flip you, you ain\u0027t seen nothing yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the rollcage needs some work. First of all, I would not suggest using the JSI transparent pod stuff in the latest edition of RPM. The results are hilariously messed up. About 5 minutes into my test today, suddenly the dashboard prop grew to massive side, reoriented itself in a strange way, and from the outside of the craft it looked like I was using a giant concrete overpass section for a hood ornament. Not to mention all the interior indicators and stuff were all over the place. I also noticed the rollcage has some funky collision surfaces in which to attach things radially to it, and it contains a single stack node which is oriented towards the back of the pod but is located exactly in the dead center of the part. Weird stuff there. I\u0027m unsure why RPM hasn\u0027t received an update to fix the transparent pod issues, but I do know they\u0027re rather unique to KSP 1.0.2 and the latest RPM update. Annoying stuff to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah... things need to be tweaked... \u003Cem\u003Ea lot...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, sure, I\u0027ll leave the DustFX stuff alone for a few days at least. I was just thinking about the ways we could cut out the separate module and integrate it more cleanly with the KF modules. I didn\u0027t get a chance to test my first iteration of a possible water collider effect, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll likely fail on the first go anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lo-fi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lo-fi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder how many people lurk silently, watching the development madness as it unfolds....\u003Cp\u003EStill chasing a pesky nullref in DustFX.

In any case, it\u0027s a simple bool, so the culprit has to be isImpactDataNull() method. Except that\u0027s just a (somewhat redundant looking) wrapper for checking if the sound file string is null or empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads me to believe there\u0027s something wrong with how WheelImpactSound is instantiated in the DustAudio() method. Or somewhere else, but the code is so convoluted I can\u0027t figure out why!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why this is happening to you, but that fix I created using that method to test the null-ness of the data was originally thought up when I was checking for more than just a few simple null cases. It\u0027s probably not as necessary now. the thing it, that fix was just thoroughly tested by me today and I got absolutely \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E exceptions with the above code. I\u0027m thinking right now, however, we could just disable anything in the area of the impact audio. That\u0027s all impact is used for right now. CollisionFX uses it for stuff like spark effects too, I think, but those were not useful to me so I chucked them in the ol\u0027 proverbial trash bin. If we want to implement rough-impact sound effects for wheels, we\u0027ll do it in a much more efficient way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lo-fi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lo-fi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess you never know what\u0027s going to happen.
