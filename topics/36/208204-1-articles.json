I\u0027ve been promising Kerbalism support for the Skyhawk Science System for quite a while, but never really expanded on it, at least until now that is... I feel comfortable enough about the amount and quality of work done to release an initial alpha for testing. Similarly to the original SSS release, these alpha releases are NOT recommended for actual gameplay as they are incomplate and may have bees. Instead, there available for people who are either interested to see what I\u0027m working on or who would like to help playtest and find bugs/errors/balance issues for me.

And adding an external antenna does not help either because Kerbalism calculates the total data rate of multiple antennas on a craft as the geometric mean of the individual data rates. Suggestion: Either give the internal antenna of the ESRAC a data rate comparable to the early Communotrons (i.e. something around 2kB/s), or drop it altogether and give the player the opportunity to choose a suitable external antenna (the \u0022Communotron 16-S\u0022 available at the starting node should work fine with its 2.2kB/s data rate).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the \u0022Sounding Rocket Payload\u0022 that takes a minute to run, has to run in flight, and has to be recovered (at least I think it has to be recovered from the description) is plain evil when the first parachute available is at least three nodes down the tech tree (or maybe I\u0027m just dumb, but I honestly don\u0027t see any way to construct a rocket with first node tech that both flies for a minute and comes down slow enough to even partially survive landing or splashdown). Suggestion: Either drop this experiment from the ESRAC core, or make it a part upgrade available after unlocking the first parachute (or make a \u0027chute available in the starting node).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are is definitely a bug in both experiments: After launch, both experiments complain about \u0022no storage space\u0022 and do not gather any data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, is it intended that both experiments are always present, or should the ESRAC have one configurable experiment slot (like the Stayputnik in standard Kerbalism) where you can choose one of the experiments?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the heads up and for the narrative to go along with it - makes reading bug reports much more fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a classic example of me realizing there is an issue and then forgetting to fix it - I had meant to add in an early-game parachute for exactly this reason (should be called \u0022Osiris Recovery Chute\u0022 or something like that, but then apparently failed to do that. Just pushed an update onto the git repo that should solve that issue. Same deal with the storage space - I had meant to code in a special hard drive for sounding rocket control cores, and then never did it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the experiments both being present, that is intentional - SK takes a different tack in regards to experiment configurability than standard Kerbalism. All probe cores only have the standard telemetry report, meaning additional science instruments are needed on most probes (unless they come with other science experiments built into them, like in some BDB probes). This was done to encourage people to actually use all the really nice science instruments that BDB has, rather than just using the probe cores to do all the heavy lifting as they sometimes ended up doing in stock Kerbalism, and also to allow it to play nicely with the tiered experiments that I do instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-19T01:51:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2022 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by CessnaSkyhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CessnaSkyhawk","CreatedById":205876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-20T16:26:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi everyone - I\u0027ve got a quick balance question I\u0027d love to hear people\u0027s thoughts on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, Science Labs serve two functions - they can either be used for converting samples into transmissible data, or for a selection of science experiments for a variety of different situations (one each for things like orbit, landed, and splashed down, etc). I\u0027m thinking of changing this to something different to give them more utility. There would be three different ways you could use them: General Studies, where they can process samples into data, and also perform a general science experiment that produces a low amount of science\u00A0 anywhere(like 10 a year at Kerbin, increasing as you go to more distant planets, and can be done either in orbit or landed (slightly more science for being landed)) but is effectively infinite, \u0022Projects\u0022, which have specific requirements but give lots of science (two that currently exist are the Lunar Radiotelescope Array and the Colonial Feasibility Demonstration), and a \u0022Sickbay\u0022, which has a lot of built in things like Radiation Decontamination Units and Stress reducers to help make bases more viable.

The early Pioneer probes only have enough EC for about 6 hours, which is not enough to reach the Mun, their intended target.
