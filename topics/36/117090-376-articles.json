That was my thought as well; pentagon/hexagon shaped petals that folded down around a center piece, or even truncated wedge-shapes that folded down.  As you say though, it is hard to get them to all stack and fit while collapsed/stowed without clipping into eachother.\n\nThe issue with an iris shape is much the same for an iris that expands out from the center -- you can\u0027t stack all of the petals in the center without clipping (or literal stacking).  The standard iris design (closing from the outside) is obviously of no use for this kind of setup.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 39 minutes ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The problem with inflatable is that I have a hard time believing I am reentering an atmosphere at mach 15 when my heat shield looks like a raft I rented at Myrtle Beach.\n\u003E \n\nTrue, to a point.\n\nBut mach 15 at 0.0001 atm is basically just a gentle breeze at 1atm, which is what these inflatable units are supposed to support.  Lots of heat, but not much actual air pressure, so minimal structure is needed.\n\nNow, hitting mach 15 much lower in the atmo -- yeah, that\u0027d crumple and crush an inflatable shield.  No doubt.

If playing an an recaled solar system, you need to adjust the atmosphere thermal parameters accordingly (though, this should have been done by the author of the rescale pack); otherwise you get insane heat levels during re-entry.  Not saying that is definitely what you are seeing, merely offering a potential explanation for what seems like an abnormal situation (e.g. boosters should *not* need heat-shields for basic sub-orbital reentry).\n\nJust thinking of the Space-X flyback boosters.

That was my thought as well; pentagon/hexagon shaped petals that folded down around a center piece, or even truncated wedge-shapes that folded down.  As you say though, it is hard to get them to all stack and fit while collapsed/stowed without clipping into eachother.\n\u003E \n\nAnother way to do it would be just to use rectangles as the petals, which would stow without overlapping. After they extend down, you expand the outer edge circumferentially to fill the gaps between the rectangles. That could probably be done in a way that looks like a cool interlocking mechanism designed to prevent hot gases from penetrating.\n\nThis need also applies to pods in many cases for me also, on Mun/Minmus reentries (5500m/s\u002B) I\u0027ve been losing stowed solar panels, and anything surface attached anywhere near the heat shield, even with a somewhat oversized shield.
