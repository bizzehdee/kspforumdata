Otherwise, anyone have ideas they\u0027d like to see?\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of dependencies, the cool thing with FS texture switching is it\u0027s easy failback. If you don\u0027t have FS, you at least get the *default* texture.

Really excited to see where you take it. Ideas... well I wouldn\u0027t know what to tell you specifically. So far I love the style you have used for the tanks. So anything that compliments that would be perfect. So maybe some black texture, something close to the white gamma style. Also something for interstage fairings would be super awesome. The bare white right now just sticks out and is so plain when next to your textures. Hope that help. CAn\u0027t wait to see what you mae.

And I wanted to see how much detail you could bring over, I think that there\u0027s a fair bit of rescaling that occurs that I haven\u0027t worked around yet. I might just port over my standard interstage textures to the pFairings, only issue currently being the normal maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll probably be both black and white versions to match the parts I have currently, I just don\u0027t want to replicate things that have already been done (Like the ones Chaka has done for CMES or CardboardBoxProcessor made for KOSMOS.)
