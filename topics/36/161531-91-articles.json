I can build a ship with good ISP value but with a TWR that let me cry. Or a good ship where the fuel of the reactor is running out in only a fraction of the mission time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it way more effective to build a conventional rocket. So my conclusion is, i am doing something wrong and like to learn more without studying nuclear science \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope there is someone who made a tutorial that helps me on my way to the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T16:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ABZB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ABZB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be possible to instead make a MM patch with a NEEDS[TACLS] that would add a new field to the relevant engines, which would tell it to ignore water etc. in capsules and TACLS fuel tanks?
