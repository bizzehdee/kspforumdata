The Rombus is one of those over sized concepts, it would have been able to deliver 450 tons to orbit or 1200 soldiers, and be reuseable!

Not to mention I need to work on the look of the giant aerospike as well as fine tune some of the collision meshes. Other than that, all that I need to do is polish up textures and work out some accurate numbers for fuel tanks, engines etc...
