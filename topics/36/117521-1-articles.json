It comes in 2 parts, wings and rod. Pretty straight forward.\n\nMy issue with it is that it was planned to have tweakables (or that\u0027s what the part.cfg said in it), and it\u0027s buggy in the current version of KSP when phys-warp is activated. \n\nAlso, creating a rig to launch the rods from a satellite and propelling them retrograde requires external forces such as separation motors. So that throws off the aerodynamics of it as well.\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t know who the original creator is, but feel free to check it, and analyze it to hell or something.\n\n[http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/226577-rods-from-the-gods](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/226577-rods-from-the-gods)\n\nIf you do know/find out who the original creator was, let me know so I can give full rights, and notify them of what I\u0027m doing/planning to do."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:10:46Z","Content":"Well, I never could get Unity to work in Wine, or get the Blender Mu exporter to work right so it languished, when Unity release a Linux editor I might have another go with it.\n\nIt\u0027s literally just a bar and a winglet, you have to provide your own de-orbit mechanism and that tweakables line was part of the original cfg files, I don\u0027t see what you could possibly tweak with a metal bar and a winglet.\n\nI think it just needs [part] tags added to the cfg, but really anyone with Unity could make another.\n\nI only uploaded it here, not to Curse or anywhere else, but if you really, *really* want to play with it [**here it is.**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nod75tco8oyx2t/rods%20from%20the%20gods%20mod%20dev%20files%20-%20sal_vager.7z?dl=0)\n\nAlso, license, [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)"},{"CreatedByName":"stickman939","CreatedById":131481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:38:21Z","Content":"I can only assume you are the original developer. Lol\n\nThat is true. It\u0027s the simplest mod I\u0027ve seen. But honestly, I don\u0027t see what to do with tweakables at the moment, either. Or ever. At least, not in it\u0027s current state.\n\nAnyways, if I need to credit you, let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:48:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ll let the license explain.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You are free to:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Share \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u009D copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\n\u003E \n\u003E  Adapt \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u009D remix, transform, and build upon the material\n\u003E \n\u003E  for any purpose, even commercially.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.\n\u003E \n\u003E Under the following terms:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Attribution \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u009D You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.

Well, I could, but I literally run on a PC I picked up at the store and didn\u0027t add better hardware. Which wasn\u0027t my intention until I got invested in youtube. But that\u0027s off topic.\n\nI guess the interest in it *is* because of Manley, or at least in part, and is also the reason I went on a hunt for your mod. Honestly, when I had uploaded it, I expected it to not get attention because it\u0027s such a simple mod that doesn\u0027t serve a purpose other than mucking around.
