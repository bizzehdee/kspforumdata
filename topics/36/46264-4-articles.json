Using the original picture you posted way back when, I understood the design element for the internal motors, I struggled to understand how the ball mounts while allowing a slipring function somewhere (Apollo design aside).

Would love to see pictures on the setup as you\u0027ve currently got the internals whenever you get around to it as it\u0027d be interesting to see how much your planned layout change from the original pic from a few years back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be using a lead weight to balance out the offset stepper but it\u0027s a lot less using the NEMA14 14\u0027s thank god...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and one thing... remember to buy a hollow rod for your main axle... and make it big enough for the wires lol. Prototype 5 failed because I didn\u0027t give the wiring enough room and one or two wires got skinned and I didn\u0027t notice. That is when I burned out some of my drivers quite spectacularly... first thing I did with my new roll axle was make sure EVERYTHING was smoooth, smoooooooooth, smoooooooooooooooooth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the slip ring.... it\u0027s a 12 way for a huge reason. I didn\u0027t want to be resetting the ball every time I load d up KSP so I figured out that something as simple as a magnet and a Hall effect sensor does the trick. Glue the magnet to the inside of the ball and the sensor mounted on the plate, that\u0027s the pitch done... then a magnet on the edge of the plate with the sensor on a mount on the cage did the yaw... and finally a disk on the roll axle with a magnet attatched and a sensor on the case sorted out the roll. Then all you do is something like the homing routine of a cnc machine will reset the ball when you need to. Add some buttons to your cockpit like IMU Cage on the Apollo CM and LEM dashboards and then use the three thumbwheels attatched to rotary encoders to fine tune it (on Apollo that was on its own panel called the Attitude Set Control Panel - Panel A in the image below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is anything you need or any advice my way... well... both are welcome. Oh and regarding my design... it\u0027s changed drastically over the years... loads of REALLY crappy decisions led to new neurons firing thank god... almost gave up a few times but then I decided to mod a Farm Simulator joystick which triggered my mod \u00A0obsession once again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: 1.

But then again if I get the coding on the needles right I wouldnt need the the ball positioning so it could be either way heh. But I do like the Apollo setup. BUT does that mean I have to code in an ORDEAL mode.... That\u0027s going to be fun if it is used on multiple planetary bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.... I\u0027m going to make the hardware first and concentrate on that. It\u0027s only a couple of changes of rotating the roll axis 90 degrees and painting it up in Navball colours.... oh and then moving the magnet position... or the sensor position... one of the two, to make the ball go to zero when I cage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike some really intelligent git once said... \u0022If you have a large problem, just cut it into small parts and solve those small problems, one at a time, and the large problem sorts itself out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: P.s.
