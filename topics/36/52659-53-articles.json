They can almost give a light weight probe a useable TWR. You\u0027re putting two (how are you going to power both?) one the back of a plane. Yes, SSTO planes are going to be light but really, you\u0027re pushing either 3 engines (one central and two on the wings) or 1 (RAPIER? Or a nuke? Because there\u0027s no way ion thrusters can be used as your orbital insertion engines), all the wings, a command pod.. they\u0027d only be useful for very small OMS, not for interplanetary travel, the thrust is too damned low. And you\u0027d need to create about 18 E/s - that\u0027s one Gigantor or 9 of the smaller extendible ones. And they have to always be in direct sunlight. Ion thrusters don\u0027t make much sense to put on the back of a heavy cargo plane. On one that\u0027s made of cubic struts, massless batteries and solar panels, sure, but not an SSTO.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, people have been building ion-powered spacecrafts for some time now.
