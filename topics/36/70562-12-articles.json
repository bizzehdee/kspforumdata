A ramp up to the widest part or a ramp to the bottom? A sketch would be nice. For the S2, wouldn\u0027t a simple end-cap that swings out like a door be enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell when I was trying this in blender not long ago( well actually quit some time) I did what the HL ramp did and pushed the side planes to the level of the bottom planes, and coverd that bump you see with the HL with side intakes....so my version of the S2-WB ramp had a round bottom not an angled one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what would be cool is a design that had two doors in the back, that where heat shielded and swung to ether side of the body. and then a set of ramps that came down for each level (so in other words you would have a center ramp and then one for each raised area. That should look relatively well and be functional with most rovers. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this gives you a general idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry I don\u0027t have a scanner and paint just dos not cut it for me. cant send you a sketch\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-03T18:36:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2014 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tidus Klein\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T18:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, I got a good image from that description.
