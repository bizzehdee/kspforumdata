Most things just are not present in the new CM config as they use the default values\n\nMODULE  \n\n{  \n\nname = SSTUHeatShield  \n\nresourceName = Ablator  \n\nheatShieldVector = 0, -1, 0  \n\n//minimum start temp for ablation process  \n\nablationStartTemp = 500  \n\n//minimum dot product of shield vector and wind direction that the shield will have any effect  \n\nheatShieldMinDot = 0.2  \n\n//beyond this point the shield does not become more effective (to allow for some deviation from \u0027perfect\u0027 without losing shield effectiveness)  \n\nheatShieldMaxDot = 0.8  \n\n//determines effectiveness of each unit of ablator material - this matches the stock \u0027pyrolysisLossFactor\u0027 of the stock heat shield (KW of heat flux rejected per mass unit = resource specific heat capacity \\* ablationEfficiency). This represents the additional bonus to the heat rejection due to pyrolysis outgassing, which really only simulates that the heat would never have entered the heat-shield in the first place  \n\nablationEfficiency = 6000  \n\n//this floatCurve determines actual ablator used per input temperature beyond start temp (e.g 2500 temp - 500 start = 2000 for input value, 0.0050 from float curve = 2000\\*0.005 = 10 ablator per second used, multiplied out further by the flux-per-ablator factors listed above = final temp reduction in KW )  \n\n//higher settings will use more ablator and expel more heat/flux  \n\n//default settings are:  \n\nheatCurve  \n\n{  \n\n     key = 0 0.00002  \n\n     key = 50 0.00005  \n\n     key = 150 0.00010  \n\n     key = 750 0.00015  \n\n     key = 1000 0.00020  \n\n     key = 2000 0.00050  \n\n     key = 3000 0.00100  \n\n     key = 10000 0.002000  \n\n}\n\n}  \n\nIt is not fully implemented yet; I want to add a few more modes for active and passive thermal soak type heat-shields (e.g. Space Shuttle, some icb-missiles), and clean up some of the other settings related to using it on integrated parts (a lot of the stock thermal system I don\u0027t really understand yet, nor is thermodynamics one of my stronger points.. or anything I\u0027ve even studied).  But I believe the current settings should give some usable configuration and allow the module to be re-used on other parts, and/or tweaked for larger-scale systems.\n\nOne of the most important settings is \u0027heatCurve\u0027 -- if you find you are overheating, increase the decimal numbers.  Feel free to add more keys for more control.  At default, it doesn\u0027t even start ablating noticeably until it hits ~1500k part skin temperature, which matches the settings on the stock module that I tested.  Still some tweaking to be done in the curve to be sure ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)   This setting simulates the surface area of the heat-shield - larger decimal values represent more surface area for the same mass = more ablation per second = more heat dissipation = lower overall temps for any given load and capability to handle higher input heat loads.\n\nThe other important setting is \u0027ablationEfficiency\u0027 -- if you find you are using too much ablator (and don\u0027t want to add more to the part), increase this number accordingly.  Higher value = more heat rejected-per-ablator-unit.  Changes to this setting -also- directly effect the overall effectiveness of the heat-shield, but in a singular, linear, manner.  Higher values here will reject more heat for less ablator;  as the results of heatCurve is units-per-time, it will need to be changed to accommodate the higher flux-per-unit from the change efficiency value."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T17:36:42Z","Content":"What files do I need to keep if I only want the engines?

Basically the only part being kept was the normals and side-paneling details (bolts/ports/radiators).  Have even changed around the base coloring to give it a bit more of an unpainted metallic look.  Still work to be done, but is mostly presentable.\n- Includes engine bell geometry from the AJ10-137 (just the bell, no need for all the plumbing, as it is hidden anyway).\n- Includes automatic lower fairing around the engine.  Will also include a second node at the end of the main cylinder for use with the Interstage Petal Adapter.\n- Cleaned up the in-editor lag when right-clicking on parts.  This was caused by every fairing on every part rebuilding itself every time anything was right-clicked or moved; have adjusted the fairing code to only rebuild/recalculate only when it needs to, rather than when -anything- changes.
