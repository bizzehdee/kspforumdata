Most parts have been moved over to use the new \u0027Model Selection GUI\u0027 for selecting nose caps and mounts.\n\nMFT-A tank now has four variants:  Klox, Hlox, Cryo, Cryo-Framed (see below).  Cryo and Cryo-Framed both made possible by the custom shader with swappable AO maps.\n\n![1e4TAcB.png](http://i.imgur.com/1e4TAcB.png)\n\nWill be continuing work on the updating this week for 1.2.  Most of the fuel-tank reworking goals have been completed, and most everything works that has been tested in 1.2.  A few new bugs to track down, and a few new features to clean up (PartUpgrades).  Investigating one more fuel-tank type (MFT-F, freight container) but unsure that I\u0027ll be able to get it setup right now; it may still have to wait a while.  Ideally it will be re-using the other MFT textures, but perhaps have its own custom normal/spec/ao maps.\n\nShould likely be back onto station-parts a bit later this week... next parts to be worked on and finished will likely be the solar-truss and blanket style solar panels (Hint:  Its not going to have much truss to it anymore....); should be transitioning to those later this week/weekend. \n\nRe:  PartUpgrades -- right now I\u0027m only using them for diameter on things.  For fuel tanks I could lock the different \u0027tank modifiers\u0027/\u0027tank types\u0027 behind upgrades (as well as add a few more?) -- so Zero-Boiloff tanks might be a late-career thing, as would be some of the lightweight tank types (and a new line of \u0027composite\u0027 tank types).  Had contemplated having specific resources be locked behind upgrades as well... but I\u0027m not very fond of the idea (either from the implementation or balance end of things).\n\nWas thinking of having the MSRB\u0027s gimbal be locked behind a PartUpgrade, and potentially its thrust-curve setup as well.\n\nEngine Clusters -- obviously they are all candidates for various engine stat upgrades (which -should- be working/compatible...).  Not sure how far I want to go with them though; perhaps one or two upgrades per engine / line of engines.  These will take a bit of time to get setup and balanced.\n\nEdit:  \n\nThe custom shader / splitting off the AO map allows me to do some neat stuff that I couldn\u0027t previously pull off in regards to texture sharing/re-use:\n\n![kZiyW0h.png](http://i.imgur.com/kZiyW0h.png)\n\nMFT-S line of tanks (prototype shown, still much WIP).  Will only require a single additional texture to be created; the AO map (possibly a second AO map for the trusses).  Yes it will have both framed and unframed variants.\n\nAlso working on the MFT-F line of containers which will re-use the existing MFT textures; they should only require a new AO and NRM map.  Still working out the specifics of how they will be setup, but they\u0027ll share a form-factor with the Near-Future trusses and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kontainer parts (semi-octagonal).\n\nMany new parts, only a couple new textures.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-20T18:50:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2016 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T19:28:34Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I imagine it will be possible to have these structure empty as well?

The crew would be at a distance, but within the solid-angle that is the shadow of that shielding. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That thing have legs????\n\u003E \n\nVon Braun moon lander concept. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T22:02:55Z","Content":"[@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) Indeed, distance does not replace shadow shielding, But further away you are more space is covered by the shadow shield.

For fuel tanks I could lock the different \u0027tank modifiers\u0027/\u0027tank types\u0027 behind upgrades (as well as add a few more?) -- so Zero-Boiloff tanks might be a late-career thing, as would be some of the lightweight tank types (and a new line of \u0027composite\u0027 tank types).  Had contemplated having specific resources be locked behind upgrades as well... but I\u0027m not very fond of the idea (either from the implementation or balance end of things).\n\u003E \u003C/snip\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Was thinking of having the MSRB\u0027s gimbal be locked behind a PartUpgrade, and potentially its thrust-curve setup as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Engine Clusters -- obviously they are all candidates for various engine stat upgrades (which -should- be working/compatible...).  Not sure how far I want to go with them though; perhaps one or two upgrades per engine / line of engines.  These will take a bit of time to get setup and balanced.\n\u003E \n\nRE Tank Variants,   By Variants I assume differing textures based on tank selected, we can then choose to swap out say KLox for NTO?\n\nRE Part upgrades and SRBs:   Most SRBs of X type do not ever get upgraded.  The Exception to the rule is the Space Shuttle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \n\nIE the UA-1205 used the same fuel and thrust curve from the 1960s right up until it\u0027s last launch in the 1990s.   The UA-1207, which uses a slightly different fuel and two addtional segments, was the same from the late 1960s right up until the early 2000s for last launch.\n\nThe next Generation USRM for the Titan however is a whole new beast and is more technology advanced than any rehash of the Shuttle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E (it was after all designed with lessons from the Challenger explosion in mind.)\n\nPART Upgrade and Engines:   I can see a great use for this so long as we are not trying to bring Different engines in that re-use the same designation (J-2X vs J-2, they are almost completely unique to each other.)  For example the J-2 via the J-2X (first use) program resulted in 9 engine variants... not all are germain to Part upgrade (J-2T Annular aerospike) and not all were actually built.  The engine that has the most upgrades is the TItan\u0027s LR-87-AJ-x for the US.  THe RD-58 also has 8 differing engines.\n\n \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E    *ISSUE*   \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003EThere are reasons a lot of engines have Variants... Not always is it because it is better.   For example the LR-87-AJ-3 was KLOx, not NTO like all later production LR-87s.   LR-87-AJ-3s were used at the same time as the Latter LR-87-AJ-5 (NTO) engine was used.   I am personally not for using Part Upgrade unless there is a way to \u0022Decrement\u0022 back to an older version for things other than tanks.\n\nLastly Engine Clusters.   Instead of making it a change in thrust.  What about if it is a change in the SIZE of the cluster (# of engines.)"},{"CreatedByName":"mechanicH","CreatedById":167929,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T00:11:36Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Just out of curiosity, since your pods and shuttles are embedded with mechjeb (which I Absolutely LOVE that you did that) , how is it going to function in 1.2, or will it be disabled?"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T00:16:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Just out of curiosity, since your pods and shuttles are embedded with mechjeb (which I Absolutely LOVE that you did that) , how is it going to function in 1.2, or will it be disabled?\n\u003E \n\nWhy would 1.2 change any of that?"},{"CreatedByName":"mechanicH","CreatedById":167929,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T00:18:25Z","Content":"Well because mechjeb does not work in 1.2 ... i have tried it a few times and its not functioning correctly. \n\nunless i doing something wrong putting it in the gamedata folder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T00:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mechanicH**"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T00:19:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Just out of curiosity, since your pods and shuttles are embedded with mechjeb (which I Absolutely LOVE that you did that) , how is it going to function in 1.2, or will it be disabled?\n\u003E \n\nMechjeb isn\u0027t required, the module is only added in the presence of Mechjeb."},{"CreatedByName":"mechanicH","CreatedById":167929,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T00:24:18Z","Content":"ohh i see now, thank you for clearing that up for me.
