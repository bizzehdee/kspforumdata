I was fooled by the UI, since it highlights \u0022Integrated\u0022 but the text above says \u0022no preset - custom settings.\u0022 I haven\u0027t messed with the settings. So maybe it\u0027s not defaulting to integrated, but as I mentioned I get weird shadows unless I choose another preset before the flight scene. I did have the latest Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack installed, but removing that didn\u0027t fix the issue. The only other visual mod I have is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. I will try reinstalling scatterer to see if that lets it default to one of the other presets.\n\nHere is the preset UI and all the settings pages I am seeing: [https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmAxSBcQL19WnrZ_GbwSB4b_rYREUQ](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmAxSBcQL19WnrZ_GbwSB4b_rYREUQ)\n\n**Edit:** Just reinstalled and now defaults to Low. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022) Sorry for not trying that first but I really appreciate the pointer!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-27T14:30:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2021 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Zelda**\n  \nIt\u0027s working now"}]}
