It fits easily inside the COS parts, and the SSTU COS parts have pretty low crew values for their size, so even with roleplaying it makes sense.\n\nThe only kooky bit was that the SSTU IVA is defaulted to the shuttle as airliner internal (?) I think (don\u0027t use plane parts, unsure, but rows of seats).\n\nFor the COS parts, the hitchiker would work great as a default IVA, so I reset it to that, and it fits nicely as they are all 2.5m cans. Certainly makes little difference, I\u0027d not have even looked at the IVA except for the new mod (that\u0027s what you do with IVAs, right? Get a new mod, look at IVA if it has one, never look at it again, lol).\n\nI was actually thinking of making a patch once I get LS back in my game that makes a copy of some of the COS parts with 1 more crew, each (smallest to 2, medium to 4, etc). Station contracts are always 5 or 10 crew, often with a lab, and I end up needing more parts than I would like to fulfill requirements. Once LS is in play, I could make them hold an extra person, but for a lower timeframe.\n\nIt\u0027s fun to play again.\n\nSomething that occurred to me was the stock science box part. That part has a few added lines to ModuleScienceContainer that must allow the whole \u0022collact all\u0022 functionality. That would be really useful, along with transfer (if that\u0027s a thing) for command parts.\n\nI\u0027ll mess with that tonight as well.\n\nI\u0027d like the lander to be able to \u0022collect all\u0022, then when docked back in orbit, to be able to transfer.
