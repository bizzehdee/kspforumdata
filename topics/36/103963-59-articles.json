Alt\u002BS?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This mod is amazing when put alongside GEMFX it looks beautiful beyond imagination. I personally do not enjoy using this with clouds. Does anyone know any cloud mods that is jut a flat layer of high-res clouds or clouds that only come/fade into view after you pass a certain distance from the surface. I have noticed one bug though. When I start the game up such as loading a save, reverting to launch, or going to the launch pad or runway there is no atmosphere and the sky is all black. This bug is easily fixable by zooming way out until the atmosphere suddenly appears permanently until you go back to the space center but it is very annoying. Also I am running this on KSP x64. Another thing to mention the github link for the config is not working.\n\u003E Edit: I have also been experiencing the flashing bug that alot of other people seem to be having.\n\nSorry about the config tool, I may have messed up, I\u0027ll put it back up later."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T10:54:57Z","Content":"Alt-S is a trim command when in flight, probably not a good choice.
