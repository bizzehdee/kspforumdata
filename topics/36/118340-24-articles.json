If someone would like to make the textures while I do the modeling I think I could do what I\u0027m good at much better. I would prefer anybody except liquid, triston at kart because they\u0027re all good at everything and I\u0027d be holding them back. So do I have any volunteers?\n\nWhite sands runway and V-2 pad are done on the 3D moddeling part of it, they need texturing tho\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T00:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MajorLeaugeRocketScience**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T00:16:33Z","Content":"I\u0027ll do Vandenberg if I have time\n\nPS.
