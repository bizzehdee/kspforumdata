I won\u0027t be looking for people to simply play the game for 10 minutes using my mod and giving me feedback such as \u0022it gets into orbit\u0022 and \u0022the decouplers decouple\u0022.\n\n I\u0027ve thought about stockifying them, but ended up going with no. That doesn\u0027t mean they absolutely won\u0027t be stock sized/stock re-balanced, it just means I won\u0027t be the one doing it. I will be looking for people who wants to help speed up development by making configs for stock, 2x scale, 3.2x scale and 6.4x scale. I basically want everyone to have the chance to use these launch vehicles, regardless of which mods or size of Kerbol system they use. The problem is, it will take forever if I am the one who has to do all of this for every single launch vehicle.\n\nThis time around I\u0027ve included a \u0022configs\u0022 folder for each of the launch vehicles that contains configs for RSS, RSSRO, RealFuels, RealPlume, KMGimbal, RemoteTech etc. The way these configs works is, they only activate if any of these other mods are detected within your GameData directory.
