This texture tells the shaders which parts are metallic (white in the texture, reflect the color from the diffuse map), and which parts are non-metallic (black in the texture, reflect white light in game), as well as influences a few other properties about how the surface responds to light.\n\nI really wish I could make the process easier, but I have not been able to find any good information on automated conversion processes.  There is simply no way to extract the metallic map information out of existing diffuse/specular texture setups.  The existing diffuse/specular (and nrm) textures should \u0027mostly\u0027 work... but even then some will need to be replaced to get the proper effects.  For example the stock \u0027silver\u0027 fuel tank texture would likely need to be entirely replaced; the diffuse is too dark (might work for steel?), and the specular/gloss is a bit too low.\n\nThe only reason I\u0027ve been able to convert the SSTU recolorable part textures \u0027easily\u0027 is because they\u0027ve mostly been authored as grayscale detail maps to begin with.  The recoloring shader takes the colors from the recoloring-gui selections directly, and applies the detail textures on top of them as minor highlights/shadows (or rough/gloss areas in the gloss map).  As the textures were already neutral, it was mostly just applying some metallic-masks to the existing specular textures (lots and lots of textures...), and adding in control of the metallic channel in the GUI (the easy part)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-13T02:57:11Z","Content":"Gotcha!
