Been looking at all the public classes looking for something similar to KerbalEVA class/partmodule but for a kerbal in IVA.\n\nEssentially I want to figure out if it\u0027s possible to change the default stance of a kerbal in IVA from sitting to standing?\n\nThe Kerbal class only has transforms defined for eye, helmet and head, and I can\u0027t figure out how to reference the IVA animiations?\n\nDoes anyone have any clues, ideas, or answers?\n\nJPLRepo."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:00:15Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need to reference the animations directly, you just need to either set the Kerbals vessel situation, or Finite Machine State to what you want.

They exist as a Kerbal, but the FMS is not attached, or not public. The kerbal has animations for their face and arms it would appear and nothing else.\n\nIt would appear they only have a sitting state defined. I think I recall long way back reading about how IVAs are only Partially implemented?\n\nI\u0027m not looking to animate them as such.
