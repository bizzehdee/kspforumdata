is\u00A0the probes we have sent out like Voyager, Cassini, and New Horizons. A fixed view angle\u00A0camera would require images with the planet to take up a certain amount of the viewport. \u00A0Each of the three cameras would have a different angle and stricter requirements. \u00A0Lower orbits with closer\u00A0tolerances for the higher tiered processor. \u00A0Missions will not even require an orbit. \u00A0 This would mean that a properly placed flyby could get the science without having to pull out of the hyperbolic orbit. \u00A0This would also allow for Cassini type orbits to grab pictures of the moons. \u00A0Grand tour type contracts may be in order as well at a later point.\u00A0 Another thing this would allow is the specification of a view that includes a specific place on a planet\u0027s surface, but that is not for this part of the update.
