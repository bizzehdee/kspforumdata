(Before using Spectra/Scatterer, I was using \u0022Better Looking Ocean\u0022 to tweak just the water surfaces, and that does not have issues with Waterfall)  \n\nEven if I noticed that, slightly, even if they became \u0022almost totally transparent\u0022, paying attention is still possible to notice the boundaries of Waterfall models, as they still have some different behaviours than the pure \u0022air\u0022 in a more stock-ish atmosphere (mostly, the shadows are sligthly different).\n\n(My 2 cents: I think is more of a Waterfall shader interaction problem, with Scatterer just ending to be and \u0022offended part\u0022, rather than the original cause: in fact I firstly addressed this issue with the Waterfall team, as even without scatterer their model are not totally \u0022invisible\u0022 as they should. I just did the same for you here mostly for knowledge)\n\n... even if...  \n\nCould it be eventually a problem derived by \u0022Texture Unlimited\u0022? Because some part mods that have \u0022transparent parts\u0022 also showed the \u0022weird\u0022 ability to be transpared but capable to \u0022delete\u0022 a lot of graphic effects,.  \n\nI\u0027ll update about it once I\u0027d run some experiments.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-28T19:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2021 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Araym**"},{"CreatedByName":"KawaiiLucy","CreatedById":201212,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-28T18:59:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/27/2021 at 6:11 PM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So this happens with Integrated preset only?
