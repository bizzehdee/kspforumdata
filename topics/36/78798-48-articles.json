Personally, I take the opposite tack. Karbonite is relatively common - Eve has oceans of the stuff, Jool (formerly the most useless planet ever) is made up of the stuff. Nobody cares on Kerbin because it\u0027s so much heavier than liquid fuel, so it\u0027s not a valuable commodity. But it\u0027s incredibly useful for space exploration and ISRU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of Karbonite less as some new, amazing thing and more of taking advantage of something that\u0027s plentiful on location vs. shipping expensive LiquidFuel from Kerbin. the price being the mass, the need to do local (surface-based) refinery, and it\u0027s low ISP for engines that use the stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit to avoid double post)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would add, is that anyone is welcome to code a change for that. I don\u0027t mean that in a \u0027if you don\u0027t like it do it yourself\u0027 way, but rather quite the opposite. The entire point of Karbonite is to serve as a starting point for people to change, mash-up, and extend what it does and give us more options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, that\u0027s what I really hope happens, and it\u0027s why I want to link to everyone\u0027s Karbonite-inspired and derived works, because one size does not fit all.

Personally, I take the opposite tack. Karbonite is relatively common - Eve has oceans of the stuff, Jool (formerly the most useless planet ever) is made up of the stuff. Nobody cares on Kerbin because it\u0027s so much heavier than liquid fuel, so it\u0027s not a valuable commodity. But it\u0027s incredibly useful for space exploration and ISRU.\u003Cp\u003EThink of Karbonite less as some new, amazing thing and more of taking advantage of something that\u0027s plentiful on location vs. shipping expensive LiquidFuel from Kerbin. the price being the mass, the need to do local (surface-based) refinery, and it\u0027s low ISP for engines that use the stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit to avoid double post)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would add, is that anyone is welcome to code a change for that. I don\u0027t mean that in a \u0027if you don\u0027t like it do it yourself\u0027 way, but rather quite the opposite. The entire point of Karbonite is to serve as a starting point for people to change, mash-up, and extend what it does and give us more options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, that\u0027s what I really hope happens, and it\u0027s why I want to link to everyone\u0027s Karbonite-inspired and derived works, because one size does not fit all.
