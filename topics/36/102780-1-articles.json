So I had this idea the other day about how a plugin could possibly track the relationships between the kerbals in the space program and how those relationships could affect their performance during missions, and I\u0027ve spent the last day or so coding furiously to make it work (sort of). This is my first attempt at modding with the unity engine, and I\u0027ve thrown it together quite quickly so it\u0027s still a bit raw and lacking on the GUI side (which is one thing that\u0027s definitely never been my specialty, links to any guides or mods that make a lot of use of the GUI would be really nice). It does seem to work fairly well during the semi-thorough testing I\u0027ve done so far. Anyway, here\u0027s what it does:\n\nBased on the different personalities of the kerbals (and RNG), kerbals will begin to like or dislike each other after spending time with each other in spacecraft. Kerbals who have very different stupidity levels may be more likely to have negative results, while a non-courageous kerbal may take a quick liking to one who is more courageous (though that feeling may not be reciprocated!)\n\nOnce they reach a certain threshold of liking (or disliking) another kerbal, they will gain a \u0022feeling\u0022 towards the other kerbal. There are three different positive feelings and three negative feelings which are chosen at random once the threshold is passed. When they are on a mission, they will gain or lose personality traits and experience levels based on their feelings towards the other kerbals on their mission. These feelings are:\n\nPositive traits give \u002B1 experience level:\n\n- Playful: Raises stupidity\n- In Love: Raises stupidity and courage\n- Inspired: Lowers stupidity\n\nNegative traits give -1 experience level:\n\n- Scared: Lowers courage\n- Annoyed: Raises stupidity\n- Hateful: Raises stupidity and courage\n\nThese changes aren\u0027t permanent, and are only in effect while the kerbal(s) they have the feelings towards are sharing a vessel with them.\n\nKerbals also have a certain amount of \u0022sanity\u0022 which will depreciate over longer missions. It will go down faster if they have negative feelings towards kerbals in their vessel, and slower if there are more kerbals they feel positively towards in the ship. Lower sanity will increase the amount that RNG impacts their feelings towards the other kerbals at the end of the mission. My goal is for sanity to play a few different roles in the future as well, mentioned below.\n\nRight now the only GUI that I\u0027ve created is shown when a ship is recovered, it informs the user of the kerbals changing feelings towards each other at the end of every mission (and needs scroll bars, HELP!). Feelings change relatively slowly, so it may take more than a few days on a mission together before the kerbals reach the feeling threshold.\n\n[**Here\u0027s the github link for anyone who is interested in checking it out**](https://github.com/wpatter6/KerbalFeels)[**(includes .zip file for normal installation)**](https://github.com/wpatter6/KerbalFeels)\n\nThings on the to do list:\n\n- Feelings impact the amount of experience gained from a mission (inspired and hateful give more xp; playful and annoyed give less)\n- Murder and/or suicide will happen with negative feelings and/or lack of sanity \u002B RNG\n- Death of a kerbal can permanently (or for a certain amount of time) affect traits and/or sanity of the kerbals who had positive feelings towards them\n- Parts ideas:  \n\n    - Recreational/Athletic/general activity parts for ships and space stations will reduce negative feelings and improve (or possibly even reduce) the crew\u0027s sanity\n    - Brain scan gives science and is either affected by or has effects on kerbal\u0027s sanity -- I think it would be neat if you could get more science if your kerbal is less sane, but not sure how feasable that is\n\n    [\\*]Tweaking to constant variables after testing and/or feedback\n\n    [\\*]Better GUI so player can see how all the kerbals feel towards each other at any time (**maybe in the astronaut complex and/or crew selection interface -- can existing game GUIs be manipulated somehow?**)\n\n    [\\*]Add a list of randomly selected \u0022reasons\u0022 why feelings changed for the better or worse and have them display when they change (\u0022They wouldn\u0027t stop farting!\u0022, \u0022We had a nice conversation about our mothers\u0022, ...etc)\n\n    [\\*]Patching the holes where calculations aren\u0027t performed. **This is actually another part I could use help on, if someone could refer me to a mod or explain a good way to do a constant recurring check of all active vessels I\u0027d be greatly obliged.** I was thinking I\u0027d try a new thread with an endless loop that checks every so often but I wasn\u0027t sure how well the mod engine handled threading, and wasn\u0027t sure how to account for things like time warping, etc. Right now I\u0027m relying on the various GameEvents to try and keep track of who is in what vessel and for how long, and it\u0027s not perfect. It would also be nice to recalculate feelings and sanity in a recurring fashion instead of relying on the various GameEvents as well.\n\nI think once it\u0027s fleshed out it could be a pretty neat way to have players put more thought into what kerbals go on missions together, as well as give a second thought to sending a beloved kerbal on a dangerous or one-way mission. Anyway, let me know what you think, or if you have any other ideas you think I should implement. I\u0027ve gotta say, the modding of this game is pretty spectacular, if a little tedious. Debugging in visual studio would be nice!\n\nLegalese edit: \n\nCopyright \u00A9 2015, wpatter6\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0022AS IS\u0022, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Just throwing some ideas out there.\n\nYeah suicide and/or murder would certainly become more of a concern if you left your kerbals floating for a long time, even if you were planning to rescue them. I think having a part for space stations to help accommodate this fact may be important, but one goal of this is to give players a reason to cycle station crew in a slightly more realistic fashion instead of just leaving the same group up there forever.\n\nMurder would sometimes just be an instant kill inside the vessel, but I was thinking that there might be \u0022attempts\u0022 as well, where say someone gets thrown out of an airlock as the engines fire or upon entering the atmosphere, but the victim could still potentially be rescued if the player noticed and reacted quickly enough. Still, I think it\u0027ll be pretty rare when playing normally, though it will also be entirely possible to intentionally send kerbals who hate each other on long missions for the more sadistic players...\n\nRetribution on the attacker would be more tricky to figure out, but I\u0027m thinking it might work something like if there\u0027s no one else on the ship it goes unpunished, and if there is, the crew all have their opinion of that person drop a certain amount, and if it\u0027s no longer positive after that drop, that kerbal would be \u0022arrested\u0022 which would effectively be the same thing as death as well... Or maybe something like, if the other kerbal(s) end up with a negative feeling after the murder, they play judge/jury/executioner and off the guy right there, otherwise, he\u0027s \u0022arrested\u0022 and shows on the missing tab for some amount of time... I dunno, just spitballing, these ideas may or may not be feasable."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T12:44:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ve always wanted something like this!
