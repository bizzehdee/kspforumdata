This is the right size, early enough in the tech tree, the parts all work together well (capsule, nose, heat shield, seperator, monoprop tank, and the engine). it fills a niche perfectly - and its useful all the way through the end of the tech tree. This is my go-to for \u0022evac pods\u0022, a spare command spot to build my tugs with, rescues (of course), and its light enough to be a return stage for landers. And \u003Cstrong\u003Eit simply looks good\u003C/strong\u003E - it looks \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E. This is my most used component of any parts mod I have downloaded. For the base parts (above) you dont need to change a thing! Add other parts as you see fit, but \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease leave the core as it is\u003C/strong\u003E - no need to change anything about it other than updating it for game engine changes, and possibly altering the tank to be a true service module - mabye with monoprop core, and a couple hatches that would take advantage of KIS/KAS style crates - like Universal Storage does. But keep the look and the monoprop - and the attachable monoprop engine. Having several hundred delta-v attached and looking integrated comes in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T07:25:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
