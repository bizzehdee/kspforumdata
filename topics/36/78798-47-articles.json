Because the basic jet can take advantage of much thinner air at 15km, rather than 8km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Karbonite jet was much faster to get to top speed of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo based on all this, my humble recommendation would be to increase the height that the Karbonite jet engine starts to lose scoped air resource a little bit. But the main thing would be to massively increase the gradient of resource loss relative to height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intend to try a comparison with turbojets and maybe some firespitter props later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way is the \u0022scooped air\u0022 resource similar to the \u0022intake atmosphere\u0022 resource that KSP-I uses?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScooped air is similar to intake atmosphere of KSPI.

I\u0027m planning to start diving into the airship code soon and see what I can make of it and learn from it and once I do that I will be taking a look into making a new part that will, ONLY under certain conditions, allow a ship to lock into stationary position while in mid air by faking the system into thinking it is landed. I am making no promises of this coming to anything or working in the least but I will at least look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent, ping me if you need any assistance - I appreciate it!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/gzrltot812ealfp/KaJetsRepack.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/gzrltot812ealfp/KaJetsRepack.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a repack of the 3 Jet engines, should save about 10 megs of texture. and audio for Prop Fan should work now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjusted the Velocity curves, Max thrust, mass, and ISP some to make them closer to Squad engines.
