My current idea of how the plugin will work is it will get the vessel type, determine if that vessel is a space object. Then get the Kerbin periapsis of the Vessel.

And, I only knew when they actually entered the SoI, what info I got with initial discovery wasn\u0027t giving any close pass. An early warning of such dangers would have made it somewhat easier (I could just about catch them and save Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I may suggest, could you consider making some references to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://b612foundation.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB612\u003C/a\u003E in your mod?
