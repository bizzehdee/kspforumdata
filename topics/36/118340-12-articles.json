Honestly many people are skeptical about the SLS I however really do believe in it. I mean I have had the NASA Kool-Aid hundreds of times over. I am a true fan boy. However the SLS program is essentially the same program. The goal with the SLS is an eventual voyage to Mars. Although cool looking placing a manned capsule on top of a SRB was crazy. I can\u0027t honestly imagine sitting on top of a SRB. But the capsule that was supposed to go on top was the Orion and they are way to far into developing that to just cancel it.
