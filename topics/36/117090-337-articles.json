Taken directly out of the repo/patches that someone linked for you earlier ( [https://github.com/FFCJoseEduardo/SSTU-Expansion/blob/master/GameData/SSTU-Expansion/Parts/ShipCore/Pods.cfg#L274-L286](https://github.com/FFCJoseEduardo/SSTU-Expansion/blob/master/GameData/SSTU-Expansion/Parts/ShipCore/Pods.cfg#L274-L286) )\n\n    \u002BPART[SSTU-SC-C-CM]:FINAL\n    {@name = SSTU-SC-C-CM-NDP@title = SSTU - SC-C - CM - Re-Entry Module - No Docking Port!MODEL,1{}@node_stack_top = 0,1.5957,0,0,1,0,1%node_stack_BPC = 0,1.3957,0,0,-1,0,2!MODULE[ModuleDockingNode]{}\n    }\n\n(very soon I\u0027m going to stop doing all this work for other people; I have not the time to be writing patches and doing research for other people, when they should full well be capable of doing the research and writing it themselves; every time I do this it only takes away from actual development time.... you guys do actually want me to update SSTU sometime this century, right?  So, expect in the future that I will simply ignore support requests for trivial stuff like this.  Nothing personal, but I\u0027ve got things to get done, and nobody else is going to do them.)\n\nIn general development news:\n\nYes, I\u0027m still working on SSTU.  Unfortunately my real life schedule has not opened up much, and sounds like it will actually be getting busier over the next few months, including a trip to Dallas in the next couple of weeks to help with some setup and training on the systems that I\u0027m responsible for.\n\nBut I\u0027m still working on things.  Recent efforts have been towards getting TU and KSPWheel to be usable and stable, and are nearly there.  I have a couple small issues to clean up in TU regarding transparent materials/shaders/flags-on-parts, and need to fix the dust-effects in KSPWheel (started/WIP/no rush on it).\n\nI\u0027ve also been spending time cleaning up some UI and other odd issues with the new SSTUModularPart module, and have been making pretty good progress on that as well.  I\u0027ve actually made it far enough that the part loads, the models load, and the texture sets work.  Most of the model-switching functionality is working, but I\u0027ve got some config and/or code-side issues regarding model positioning to cleanup.  Progress.  Slow, but undeniable.\n\nCurrent state of the UI, and general look at how many things are working/broken (note all of the broken pods in the editor part selection window.... still a lot to fix).\n\n![JcyZ5dU.png](https://i.imgur.com/JcyZ5dU.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T00:03:20Z","Content":"I did try..that said, thank you for your help."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T13:54:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I\u0027m still working on SSTU.  \u003Cu\u003EUnfortunately my real life schedule has not opened up much, and sounds like it will actually be getting busier over the next few months\u003C/u\u003E, including a trip to Dallas in the next couple of weeks to help with some setup and training on the systems that I\u0027m responsible for.\n\u003E \n\nHahaha! told you!

The main problem with it would be defining the range in which the model could be offset.... but I might be able to borrow he validation that I\u0027ve setup for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E positioning (the valid range of movement is defined in the model definition of whatever model the solar/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E would be mounted to; including an \u0027angle\u0027 parameter for conic parts).  The second (and probably larger) problem would be ensuring that the position specification is valid for every solar panel model; some solar panel models extend down from their mounting point, some upwards; likely to cause problems with mesh clipping.\n\nThe current solar panel support was based on the existing needs of the StationCore parts -- which only require static placement of the solar panels; though I could certainly see the use of positional controls for part setups like the MSM.\n\nThey will have \u0027parent slot\u0027 controls at the very least.  So you\u0027ll be able to specify that the solar (or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E) should be mounted on the CORE, NOSE, etc. slots, and the models will be moved and positioned appropriately for the model and slot they are mounted on.

The new MH-stock engines are pretty good geometry wise, comparable detail to SSTU.  Most are fairly close dimensions wise as well (for 64% of real scale).  Textures... are fairly well done as well, though certainly in the stock-alike aesthetic.\n\nF-1 -- The SSTU engine is quite a bit larger, both in length and in diameter.  I think it is because the stock version is scaled down further to enable a Saturn-V setup at 5m diameter (SSTU would use 6.25m\u002B diameter for the same replica)\n\n![GxUAifd.png](https://i.imgur.com/GxUAifd.png)\n\nRD-107 is very similar, both geometry and dimensions wise.\n\n![CEdS8Mn.png](https://i.imgur.com/CEdS8Mn.png)\n\nStock J-2 looks good from the front.  Texture is well done with plenty of contrast to make the engine interesting, though it is lacking of the full-length cooling tubes that were quite apparent on this engine.  Obviously the stock version is also lacking the PBR based metallic reflections, but still not bad for legacy texturing.\n\n![S7Oc0Qj.png](https://i.imgur.com/S7Oc0Qj.png)\n\nGeometry was good in the front, but lacks some details on the rear.\n\n![QPog9Kq.png](https://i.imgur.com/QPog9Kq.png)\n\nOverall I think the new stock models are pretty good.
