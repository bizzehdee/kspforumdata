The clues are: Brakes. Call the braketorque to the log and you\u0027ll see the brakes are not being applied even when the model seems glued to the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotating the wheelcolliders away from the floor leaves the part firmly planted on the floor (though now appearing to float). This is a dead give-away, which lead me to messing with transform placement in the model. I can get the colliders to do their job \u003Cem\u003Ecorrectly\u003C/em\u003E so long as there are no transforms below their level in the part and they are enabled. I came to the firm conclusion that it\u0027s not a collider issue, but a topology issue I\u0027m afraid. At very least, the tranform position of the master parts needs fixing (this is easy), but your CONTACT object also causes the issue and this seemed instrumental to your simulation working as it stands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m puzzled why you\u0027ve got a separate raycast when you can use the racast from the collider, though?
