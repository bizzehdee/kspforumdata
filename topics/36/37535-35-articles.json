We had a few delays having to do with the MFD process since it involved some art that eventually ZRM did procedurally to make the instruments much more accurate. Hence we lost a couple weeks there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that we should be on schedule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what happened was that I was doing the GUI artwork for the MFDs. Unfortunately it wasn\u0027t accurate enough and we were having communication difficulties between what ZRM wanted, what I wanted, what worked, what didn\u0027t and so on. Unfortunately we ended up losing more time than the time we gained by me doing that. In the end ZRM wrote a series of scripts and plugins to create the stuff differently. The board going down didn\u0027t help any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re not making any changes or additions. So any suggestions being mentioned above are pretty much being ignored.
