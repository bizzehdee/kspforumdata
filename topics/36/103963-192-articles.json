I\u0027m about to release yet another mod containing submarines and one of the things I was waiting for comments on was the fact that Nathan Kell screwed with the underwater scenery during the \u0027buoyancy\u0027 debacle to the point that after dark, you could see stars through the ocean floor.  Your mod fixed that beautifully. I now know exactly where to direct those that have my same complaint.\n\nOne request.  Darkness at depth.  If you\u0027re a kilometer below the surface of the ocean, daylight shouldn\u0027t be visible.  Prior to the \u0027buoyancy fix\u0027 we had a solution. A large dome shaped object (5km wide) that rode above the vessel and it\u0027s transparency and color changed the deeper you went. \n\nHaven\u0027t tried that trick lately so not sure if that would still work.  I\u0027m sure you\u0027d have a much more elegant solution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-04T08:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2016 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"}]}
