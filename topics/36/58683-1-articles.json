As the Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that there is no such thing as an exact amount of energy in an exact location, vacuum fluctuations are known to lead to discernible effects such as the Casimir effect. The differential sail was a speculation that it might be possible to induce differences in the pressure of vacuum fluctuations on either side of sail-like structure\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwith the pressure being somehow reduced on the forward surface of the sail, but pushing as normal on the aft surface\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand thus propel a vehicle forward.
