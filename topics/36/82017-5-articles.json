Looking good! Here are a few suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - B9.Structure.HX1.G is kind of in a weird spot in Specialized Electrics as you get the rest of the HX parts elsewhere.

You don\u0027t need ladders to explore anything until maybe Duna anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Similarly, I\u0027ve ignored Field Science for 300 because when I\u0027ve needed to drive a car around I use landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - These parts should move into the Orbital Refining node: HangarRecycler, OrbitalRocketWorkshop, OKS.Storage.RocketParts, RocketWorkshop, SmallerBlastSmelter, BlastSmelter, TinyBlastSmelter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - These parts should be removed from the tree because they\u0027re obsolete: oreBin, metalBin, exLaunchPad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - ionArgon-0625-2 and ionArgon-0625 should swap positions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Suggest moving the KSPi/KSPiL arcjet and plasma thruster somewhere into nuclear propulsion as they\u0027re useless without KSPi reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - resourceStorage still seems kind of expensive to me because I think that the bigger fuel tanks aren\u0027t very useful since Karbonite/Kethane mining and conversion are mostly done while mining it so you only need a tiny storage tank to run the converters. Maybe drop it to 150 or 225?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other note - without much else in the way of mods that add science (like custom biomes) I\u0027ve been doing a lot of contracts.

I\u0027ve been following your thread pretty closely. I think the sub-tree support is an awesome feature, but I\u0027m not sure I have a use for it at the moment since I like to have a lot of interdependencies. Then again, I\u0027m a little fuzzy on what all you can do with the subtrees. I\u0027ll play around with it when I get the chance (which may be a while).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cvod","CreatedById":110540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechManager is now included in the download.
