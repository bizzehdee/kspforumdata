Big side fits delta wing size and smaller side fits medium connector wing size. The wing is also now flat across the top and bottom instead of tapered to the tip.

Since they only use IntakeAir (and therefore no fuel), it\u0027s a LITTLE cheaty for maneuverability, IMHO. I thought perhaps forcing them to use a resource that is generated by the engines would be decent. My thought for BleedAir would be similar to how EC is generated (but can\u0027t be stored). Otherwise, I think the RCS thrusters should use EC. It feels odd that they are unlimited use with what is essentially an infinite resource.\n\nBTW, I realize the Cyclone has its own intake while the K-FAN doesn\u0027t, though the K-FAN does have an intake config in its CFG file (again, this is in KSP v0.90 with v1.2.2 of this mod).
