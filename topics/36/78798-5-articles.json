It\u0027s exciting to see the advances in gameplay potential from all of this. I had one concern when reading about using the stock antennas for initial version scanning models. Using an MM config to attach additional functionality to them would conflict with Remote Tech and a few other mods. I\u0027d like to suggest that you just create new part configs that use the current models as reference with new names. Then you can update the models later and not conflict as heavily with other mods that use the antennas as antennas. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould be fine since I am adding modules not sealing it or overriding ones that RT probably uses \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E MKS already overrides these in the same way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AdmiralTigerclaw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AdmiralTigerclaw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Rover, I put the following up as a thought to resourcing models a few weeks back:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84630-Proposal-for-resourcer-modders-Automatic-Resourcing-Mod-Model?highlight=model\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84630-Proposal-for-resourcer-modders-Automatic-Resourcing-Mod-Model?highlight=model\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven your automatic logistics hub, ORS, and now your desire for Kethane, it seems this would be a good time to put in my two cents by saying: \u0027Go read that\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a big fan of \u0027Set it And Forget It\u0027 type of setups.

Some see a convenient realistic space simulation sandbox just waiting to happen (RSS junkies). Others see an easy learning tool where everything is simplified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of marketing, you want to pander to the widest demographic possible. KSP has the advantage in this field in that the basic game can be easily run by anyone who can at least point and click, while the mods are more or less easy to install and can expand it to those looking for \u0027more\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience since my first treks into online gaming 15 years ago, you have to consider the end result carefully and where the player is going to be in the end. You\u0027re right in that people often see something and want to get right to it and not spend forever and a day setting it up. But there does need to be a challenge to it or it becomes unfulfilling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, you want examine the ladder-climbing and grind mechanics. The worst dynamic to put in place is monotonous time grinding or repetitive tasks. Consider from the perspective of a player who starts over from scratch due to say, KSPs game-breaking major updates. They want to get BACK to where they were, not spend a week just grinding for \u0027XP\u0027. In this case, you want to ensure that in terms of how the learning curve and grind executes, if the player is a skilled veteran, they can easily blitz through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of tasks, you want to avoid the same monotony. Building a base, mining operations, mid-mission refueling... These are \u0027new and exciting\u0027 until you do them a couple of times. Then when you move on and you\u0027re trying to do something greater, it becomes a necessary evil, and an annoying monotony. Once the player can do these tasks themselves, you want their next step to be learning how to automate these tasks. Then you want to \u0027set it and forget it\u0027 so you can focus on designing for your next objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a \u0027fluff\u0027 perspective, the mechanic is kind of like saying that you pioneered the operation, now it\u0027s someone else\u0027s problem to maintain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the important part of the concept is that you want to keep the player progressing and doing something new and better with every mission. If the player keeps having to repeat the same half-hour long monotonous operation every ten minutes of new gameplay, then you\u0027ve got a problem. It\u0027s even worse if, for the sake of \u0027realism\u0027, you\u0027re forcing ONE PLAYER, who can only do one thing at any given time, to simulate the tasks that would be REALISTICALLY maintained by a dedicated team of hundreds. (Remote Tech Satellite orbit maintenance, or Kethane drilling ops... That kind of thing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want to saddle the player with an ever growing list of things to maintain. Even with the argument of \u0027realism\u0027, that becomes unrealistic. That\u0027s one of the nice things about what RoverDude is trying to build here. It looks like his general game philosophy is similar to mine. You do the work learning and setting up - the part that\u0027s fun - then you move on because it\u0027s automated if you did it right and you only need to check on it occasionally to ensure it\u0027s running as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part is ensuring the learning curve is challenging enough to do to be rewarding, but not so hard as to frustrate. Going full realism with mods can lead to the latter of course if you\u0027re not familiar with things. And of course, there\u0027s also giving the player the proper tools for doing a task. You don\u0027t plot interplanetary intercepts and not give a player the means to at least figure out the transfer windows. And you don\u0027t throw little kids a game with complex spaceflight math without easy to use calculators and explanations that render the work little more than arithmetic. Even a really complex task can be made simple in concept with the right tools. If you build the game engine right, you can shock the world when an 8 year old is working on the same competency level as a NASA engineer. And you can do it with full realism in mind. You just have to shape the learning curve the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T15:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually something I\u0027ve been thinking about since my playthrough with kethane.
