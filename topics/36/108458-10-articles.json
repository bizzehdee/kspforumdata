This makes them more of a challenge to click in place because they now get stuck more often on the hangar walls, floor and ceiling. It\u0027s something that changed in KSP1.1.3 which causes, but i don\u0027t know what exactly.\n\nWhat helps for me, is to look straight at the connection node so you\u0027re looking 90\u00B0 down on the surface where the connector is, and then shove the tank in front of that keeping shift/alt pressed. The editor should figure out which end of the tank has a connector facing the right way to connect with the one on the ship, and snap it into place. I don\u0027t know if it influences this, but i should also mention i have the editor extentions installed.

WarpDrives are powermunchers, and that\u0027s putting it mildly. But if you correctly assemble the IXS, it is capable of generating enough ElectricCharge. You won\u0027t need all the parts included in the mod, there is more in there then what the IXS needs to function. This is because multiple maintainers have had their hands on this mod, and everyone tends to add their little touch.\n\nThe Alcubierre warpdrive needs Exotic Matter and ElectricCharge to function. These are obtained like this:\n\n![29716218655_d52f9f41a7_b.jpg](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8503/29716218655_d52f9f41a7_b.jpg)\n\nElectricCharge from the solar panels is combined with LqDeuterium from a fuel tank by the Tokamak reactor in the main hull producing more ElectricCharge. Some of that charge is combined with LqHe3 in the Portable Hadron Collider, housed in the secondary/support ring, producing ExoticMatter. \n\nCheck that you have all required mods installed:\n\n- RoverDude\u0027s Alcubierre Drive\n\n- Community Resource Pack (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E does not install this one automatically yet!).\n\nHere you can download the .craft file i use for testing: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/1yv2x6h1naqfhmw/IXS01 Warpship Prototype.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1yv2x6h1naqfhmw/IXS01%20Warpship%20Prototype.craft?dl=0) \n\nI hope this will put you on the right track to reach those far off spaces where no Kerbal has gone before.

The largest spacedock included in the mod will accommodate the IXS amply. The EPL code for the Spacedocks however has been removed a while back. Instead i tend to use [Keridian Dynamics mod](http://spacedock.info/mod/308/Keridian%20Dynamics%20-%20Vessel%20Assembly) to supplement EPL. It has a very nice orbital launchpad that fits perfectly onto the spacedocks, \u002B it has some very nice pads for on the surface as well (and it has alternatives for the ugly ugly blue parts of EPL ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) ). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To get the Spacedock in orbit, you can either first build a smaller construction station, build it there then tow the spacedock into place (look at this [orbital tug](http://spacedock.info/mod/313/Orbital%20Utility%20Vehicle) for a good vessel for doing that). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Or, the alternative is to launch the spacedock with this monstrosity: [Nexus II booster stage](http://spacedock.info/mod/147/Super%20Heavy%20Boosters%20Historical%20-%20Nexus)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I hope i managed to tell you what you wanted to know and give you a bit of inspiration along the way?\n\u003E \n\nFirst delivery of building materials to the station. Still haven\u0027t figured out the develocitizer yet.. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\n![WSUKK5h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WSUKK5h.jpg)"}]}
