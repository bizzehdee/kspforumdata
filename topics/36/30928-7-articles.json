I have run a good few boosters in similar config to the Delta IV Heavy (because I like it) and it works pretty well. It can in some cases reduce the payload capacity though using crossflow as it makes the post-strap-on-booster centre stage heavier, meaning lower TWR. I think it\u0027d be better to just supply a common CBC and an optional nose-cone and let people work out the best way themselves. Like you say, it\u0027s not possible to run the game the way the Delta IV Heavy runs anyway due to the unified throttle control.
