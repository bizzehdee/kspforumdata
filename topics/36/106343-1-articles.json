View full album](//imgur.com/a/CKsDp)\n\nIt is heavily in development, I am working on the models right now, and I am planning to add SRB\u0027s to increase launch vehicle performance. The overall diameter of the rocket is 1.875m, the diameter of the two engines is 1.25m to make it usable with Stock tanks and such, the diameter of the fairings is 2.5m and the complete launch vehicle is 24.3m long. As for the stats, the first stages \u0022Sway\u0022 Liquid Engine will probably have a thrust between the LV-T45 and the Rockomax \u0022Skipper\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine, so about 400kN probably, but I am not sure about the upper stage currently, I guess I will give it about 100kN thrust, but it is still some time until I will have to worry about game stats. \n\nI hope you will like it so far, and if you have questions, requests or things you don\u0027t like on the model, feel free to post it! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:52:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kartoffelkuchen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:47:55Z","Content":"Looks nice ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:48:54Z","Content":"Nice!

One thing i have noticed atleast that it is now much more efficient, better looking, cost effective, and realistic to use SRBs with the new aerodynamics. I am not gonna say that Asparagus staging is dead but SRBs function exceptionally well now. So I guess what I am saying is that a line of versatile SRBs would really round out a pack like this.
