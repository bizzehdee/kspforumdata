A democratic Federal Republic with a economy with a strong focus on the sciences, robotics and medical innovation. Its former military consisted of a sizeable number of very expensive but highly reliable hi-tech units, UAVs. Jeb, Bob and Bill Kerman are from the Confederacy - Jeb served as a combat pilot, Bob as a test pilot and Bill as an engineer under Dr. von Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKrussian People\u0027s Republic\u003C/strong\u003E - Analogous to Soviet Russia during the Cold War, and needless to say came under a Communist regime with a heavily industrialized economy. Its former military made use of heavy ground armor (wheeled and legged mecha) supported by infantry and artillery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHonko Hegemony\u003C/strong\u003E - Analogous to the waning days of Imperial China* or Japan. The economy was primarily based on agriculture, with a large proportion of the population as peasants or merchants supporting a small elite of feudal (and later, imperial) leadership. What they lacked in refined technology or industrial prowess, they compensated with fanaticism and honor; this is noted in their use of waves of mass infantry and so-called \u0022Special Attack Units\u0022 (essentially Kamikaze or suicide units)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKeinsberg - \u003C/strong\u003EA small nation-state Analogous to postwar Germany. In the history of Kerbin, Keinsberg was steadfastly allied with the Confederacy, and paid a heavy price when the Krussians simply leveled their population centers to punish their defiance. Dr. Wernher von Kerman, the chief engineer in the Kerbal Space Program, was a child when the Krussians invaded; he and his family fled as refugees to Confederate territory, where von Kerman would later design various weapon systems to help the Confederate war effort, including the ballistic missiles that would later serve as the precursors of the rockets used in the Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end of the decades-long global war between the superpowers and their proxies came after (amongst other things) mutual devastation by the development and deployment of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs); the Confederates under Dr. von Kerman were the first to field these weapons, followed by the Krussians and the Honko Hegemony, whom simply reverse-engineered early captured duds. Such was the extent of the horrors inflicted on civilians of all sides that the remnants of the superpowers vowed never again to engage in such folly - this gave rise to the unified \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Federation\u003C/strong\u003E we see today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal race\u0027s accelerated efforts towards spaceflight initially came about as a side-effect of faulty ICBMs that failed to deorbit and strike their targets; after the war, it was felt that exploring outside their homeworld with enable them to seek new and abundant resources and curtail any future squabbling between nation-states over what little remained on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003ESpace Center complex\u003C/strong\u003E, originally a Confederate ICBM test site, is the result of years of investment and re-development by member states of the Federation for this endeavor, serving as the primary mission control, development, launch and tracking facility. The colloquially dubbed \u003Cstrong\u003EKSC2\u003C/strong\u003E is located in former Krussian territory, and is used by the now-democratic Krussians to launch unmanned cargo vessels to support crewed operations in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin City\u003C/strong\u003E is an ambitious multinational development project, and is intended to eventually serve as the political, financial and legislative capital of the unified Kerbal race.

You go into the tunnel structure (which is above land) and at one point (before reaching terrain), you teleport to an identical place, but which is at another location above ground (presumably without noticeable transitions so that you still think you are in the same tunnel). You go through the above-ground tunnel and at the end of it, you go through another portal to teleport you to the real place of exit. Some games are doing it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the future \u0022downtown\u0022 island I will have a road tunnel that connects the south and north (you can see it as a dotted blue line on the sketches), and possibly the train route on the island will be underground too.
