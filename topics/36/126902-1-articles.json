The \u0022beacon\u0022 isn\u0027t the radio in my mind (every capsule has a radio for locating it already), it\u0027s the infrastructure required to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efully recover a vessel\u003C/em\u003E, which shouldn\u0027t be a small thing. Honestly I\u0027d like to see something like MKS or EPL where you have to have several (sizeable) parts to meet the requirements, requiring a full base to be set up to have the recovery function fully work. If we abstract that to just being a single part (or a few parts), I\u0027d like to see it as something (minimally) like this:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h206/Krakken/duna3_zps7d356951.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022duna3_zps7d356951.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022749\u0022 src=\u0022http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h206/Krakken/duna3_zps7d356951.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a short range beacon only needs something the size of a 1.25 meter fuel tank and an attached antenna.
