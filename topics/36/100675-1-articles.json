No, I won\u0027t be adding any parts (I\u0027m no good at modeling or anything like that). The main goal of this mod is to add KAS features that feature some realism (small, light-ish weight parts only) to any and all mods that the community wants. And if I feel like it, I \\*might\\* add things like Tweakscale, TweakableEverything, etc. for mods as well.\n\nEDIT: I really do appreciate you pointing those out, it will help me get off to a solid start adding mods. Also, the USI mods are some of my favorites and therefore are close to the top of my list to check out, although I know Kolonization already has at least partial compatibility.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T04:49:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbinDriveYards**"},{"CreatedByName":"WarrenSchultz","CreatedById":125481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:15:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hm, theres already two similar things, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71683-A-Mechanic-Is-Jeb-or-KAS-For-Almost-Everything](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71683-A-Mechanic-Is-Jeb-or-KAS-For-Almost-Everything) (doesn\u0027t seem to have been updated or added to in a long while), and [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99235-0-90-2015-01-08-MonkeyWrench-0-1-6-For-when-subtlety-and-finesse-just-won-t-do](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99235-0-90-2015-01-08-MonkeyWrench-0-1-6-For-when-subtlety-and-finesse-just-won-t-do) (has the same parts as the previous one, and then some, plus throws in a few extra features and a few parts the author made, but those are optional.
