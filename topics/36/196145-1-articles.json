I\u0027m trying to play this game in my own way, and my way consists of me having to make\u00A0precise calculations given previous similar experimental data. For instance: let\u0027s suppose I need to be at height h with speed v with a rocket (some common missions ask that). To do that I want to calculate the tweakable settings to apply to obtain that result. The last piece I\u0027m missing now is a model for the drag force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already got data about thrust in function of atmospheric pressure, athmosferic density in function of pressure and pressure in function of height. I got this data using, modifying and running the mod KOS, but now I\u0027m switching to RedOnion (check it out!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question itself is this: how does AeroGUI calculate the shown Total Drag or CdS??? I tried various properties like part.DragCube.various_things with various multiplications and computation of total drag vectors, but I can\u0027t get AeroGUI value and I don\u0027t know the meaning of any of those various_properties of DragCube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I wrote clearly enough..\u00A0 Thank you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-07T16:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag cubes explained in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106610-drag-cubes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E thread.
