As a bonus they should be mostly compatible with the SSTU shuttle cargo bay (it is very close to the stock bays / other shuttle mod bay form factors).  Haven\u0027t actually tried it yet due to the other problems with the shuttle, but will certainly be giving it a go with my next playthrough.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nice Shuttle parts [@Jimbodiah](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152759-jimbodiah/),  these would work perfect with the SC-E or even the stock build.

Will require quite a bit of work on the KSPWheel system which I haven\u0027t had time to work on recently.\n\nAside from that it also needs some love on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E/Aero stability -- I realized that it has roll instability because of the inertia tensor -- need to remove mass from the fuselage and add it to the wings to make it more stable in simulation;  this will make it more resistant to changes in roll orientation due to the increased mass simulated towards the wings.  May help with yaw instability as well a bit.\n\nI -think- that those are the main outstanding problems with the SC-E parts that need to be fixed up.  Most everything else seemed to be working decently.  Might be nice if I could get the custom \u0027control from here\u0027 transform for the thrust-line working as well (more accurate ascents when using autopilots)... but I consider that purely a \u0027bonus\u0027.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nah, doesn\u0027t work as nicely and I\u0027ve had that just stop working during launches.

What you have set up is obviously 100% A-OK for stock, but if you use SMURFF the parts become too heavy to their new lighter counterparts. I painstakingly edited all tankagemasses in my 1.1.3 save to fall in line with the SMURFF tankagemass. Once I\u0027m done I\u0027ll probably upload it or something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T09:55:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by falken**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T20:00:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, falken said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One thing I\u0027d suggest with the ST-MST-ISS solar system would be to reduce the diameter of the \u0027barrel\u0027 section a little, simply so that it can fit into a Mk3 cargo bay. The thing is slightly too big for it, and it would make sense for an ISS inspired part to be able to be ferried up into orbit in a shuttle.\n\u003E \n\nUm, not to nitpick but nowhere does SQUAD say that the MK3 pattern fuselage is supposed to mimic in scale the Space Shuttle.\n\nOn the other hand.
