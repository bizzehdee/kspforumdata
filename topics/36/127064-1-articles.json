I\u0027m trying to make a mod in which players can take an assortment of parts, and assemble them into an on-site \u0022VAB\u0022 which can construct or deconstruct sufficiently small vessels.\u00A0 However, I\u0027d like to have this set up in such a way that the player still sees the site at which they\u0027re actually building the vessel, instead of changing scenes back to the VAB itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore succinctly, I want to get the VAB GUI and building interface, without getting the VAB background scene.\u00A0 Is this possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T12:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery interesting.
