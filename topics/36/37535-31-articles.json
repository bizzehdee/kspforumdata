Frankly, the only truly useful spacecraft IVA I\u0027ve used to date (as in being able to dock using strictly a cockpit window view) is frizzank\u0027s Gemini. A useful window view is, in my opinion, critical for normal flight.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot necessarily critical, if you have the right instrumentation, but yes, it\u0027s very useful. Don\u0027t forget that the cockpit will eventually be including an in-cockpit video feed from the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a first attempt at a high visibility view. Remember that this view can be zoomed and rotated just like Kerbal POVs.
