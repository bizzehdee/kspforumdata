I\u0027ve never *officially* developed anything, but I\u0027m constantly messing around with stuff, so I\u0027m hoping this will be my first official project. For those of you who don\u0027t know what Subnautica is, it is an amazing survival game, in which you\u0027re stranded on an almost entirely ocean-based planet, in which basically everything wants to rip your jugular out. The ship is hit by a mysterious energy pulse, and that is why it crashes. I won\u0027t spoil anything else. Anyways, in the game, there is the Aurora, the (assumed) colonization ship which brought you there, three vessels, the Cyclops, Seamoth, and P.R.A.W.N., which is an exosuit, and, of course, the base aspects. This game is by far my favorite game of all time. Anyways, I hope to add these things to KSP. The underwater vessels, the Cyclops and Seamoth, could be useful on Kerbin and Eve, the P.R.A.W.N., just about anywhere, and the Aurora, for reaching other solar systems. The bases could also be used just about anywhere, and, if I figure out how to do circumstantial modeling, also as a Space Station. However, I am very new to this, and would very much appreciate any aid provided to me. I hardly even know where to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Li0n","CreatedById":142527,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T12:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a lot of modeling, first step will be to learn \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.blender.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBlender\u003C/a\u003E I guess.
