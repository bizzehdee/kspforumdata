I\u0027m kind of clueless when it comes to the mechanics of it, but from what I can see, this is fairly accurate. There are two sets of brackets that hold the wheel mount (gearbox I assume?) to the base. There are also two shock springs in there, and the two bracket arms are on hinges. The whole assembly: brackets, shocks, wheel mount, wheel - move up and down in relation to the base.
