They\u0027ll take contracts from you, they\u0027ll outdo you at collecting science, they\u0027ll beat you to Jool!\n\nTrain your kerbonauts before sending them to their doom!\n\nForce your engineers to work 6/426 on experimental hardware!\n\nBeg your scientists to research future technologies for personal gain!\n\nBeat those commies at their own game in SPACE RACE!\n\nProject Goals/Status:\n\n-Adding the need to assign a Kerbal Scientist to a research node to unlock it over time, dependent on Kerbal level. 100% complete.\n\n-Adding the need to assign a Kerbal Engineer to design parts from researched nodes, dependent on Kerbal level. 100% complete.\n\n-Adding ability to rush both of the above jobs with either science or funds, respectively. 100% complete.\n\n-Adding Mission Simulators for some missions to level up Kerbals to level 3. Levels 4-5 will need to be earned the old fashioned way. 100% complete.\n\n-Last but DEFINITELY not least: Adding a Rival space agency, that can take non-essential contracts and steal your people away. 15% complete\n\nI\u0027ll release the pre-release plugin once the Science, Engineering, and Training modules are done.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T17:42:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by johnqevil**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T23:32:13Z","Content":"Not just an empty promise, he did already make a plugin.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104000](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104000)"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:15:25Z","Content":"Neat!

The easiest and probably the smoothest to implement, if the least interesting.\n\nI see, out of the above options then the one I would choose is having them gain science points.\n\nHowever, just as a suggestion, I think it would be pretty cool to have it so that in order to \u0022unlock\u0022 a node you must use science points, but then you need actual scientists to do research to actually get the node and it\u0027s parts, if that makes sense. Essentially making a timer that is based on the number of scientists assigned and there respective levels, and the cost in science points of a node, that must complete before you actually unlock said node.\n\n(from a role play perspective the science earned would represent all the raw data you have collected from experiments and such, this would keep experiments, planning missions to go collect science, as a still necessary game mechanic. The scientist would then be taking this data and performing analysis and such on it in order to apply the findings to newer and better components)\n\nSomething like this should be somewhat doable, of course the most I have ever done coding wise was JAVA and a little C\u002B\u002B in highschool, so I really don\u0027t know what I am talking about.\n\n Kerbal Construction Time has a similar thing where there is research time associated with actually unlocking nodes. You can go into the R\u0026D building and unlock nodes, but then once you leave the R\u0026D building it has a timer that counts down before the node actually becomes unlocked, the time is based on the expense of the node and an upgradable research speed stat.\n\nSome thing else that could be cool as an additional hard mode, like the stock games setting where you can research a node but then need to pay to unlock each individual part, would be using my above suggestion with scientists researching and unlocking nodes, but then needing scientists and engineers to actually develop the parts in that node.\n\nAnyways just some ideas and suggestions that I\u0027m tossing out there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T22:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Akira\\_R**\n  \nI can grammar"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T22:58:34Z","Content":"Are you going to add military contracts?

Since KCT and DangIt are already really well done, I\u0027m not going to be covering the same ground there.\n\nThe rival agency is going to be more background, but somewhat intrusive. Here are the goals for that aspect:\n\n-One random \u0022Rival\u0022 event every 10-40 days, that ranges from reaching another body first or beating you to a tech node. This is more \u0022flavor text.\u0022\n\n-Any none-permanent contract (part testing, surveys, etc) could be taken by the competition first, removing it from your available pool and giving the rival a bonus in both funds and science.\n\n-The rival can steal science points from your available pool.\n\n-The rival can steal any unassigned employee from you, except the big 3. This includes any that you\u0027ve paid to train up or leveled up on mission.\n\n-The rival can experience many setbacks, including catastrophic failures.\n\n-If I can figure out how to spawn a ship directly into orbit, then I think we can get the \u0022save their bacon\u0022 contracts done. We could at LEAST do a \u0022save their stranded Kerbal\u0022 contract since that would just be attaching to an existing system.\n\nSome of those are not going to be in the initial release(s), but are specific goals."},{"CreatedByName":"johnqevil","CreatedById":119237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:10:12Z","Content":"Still alive, just had to go out of town for a few days.
