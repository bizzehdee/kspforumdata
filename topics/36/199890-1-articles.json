In this topic I will be talking about various ideas I have and things I\u0027m working on. If I ever release one of those, they will have it\u0027s own post on the Addon\u0027s Release section. However while on development, as I will only work on one thing at a time, they all will be here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a disclaimer, I\u0027m pretty lazy, I almost never finish a project. So most of the things I say on this post, may never see the light of day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFocus of the development\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, I tried to start a career mode campaign. I didn\u0027t played the game since 2018, so there were many new things to see, and so many mods to test... However, to my disliking, I wasn\u0027t able to find the perfect mods to setup and balance my career. So I decided that is time to clean the dust of some of my never-started proyects, and start modding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan is to make various mods to enhance the experience of the career mod. I don\u0027t want to go really over the top, my plan isn\u0027t make a complete overhaul. There are many mods that changes completely how the game plays, and they are doing it great\u003Cem\u003E (Bureaucracy, Build Rockets Takes Time, Etc...),\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what I want is to do is make little changes, to have a funnier early game experience (because, for a returning player, early game may feel like an endless grind) and to give direction and things to do on late game.\u00A0 And everything, without removing the Vanilla feel of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this is my plan. First, I need to make small changes to the Technology Tree. I want a experience akin to what \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95645-13x-seti-unmanned-before-manned-patreon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EUnmanned Before Manned\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181013-ksp-181-probes-before-crew-pbc-version-28/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EProbes Before Crew\u003C/a\u003E offered, but I don\u0027t fully agree with his dispositions. Using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-111x-community-tech-tree-december-23-2020/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECommunity Tech Tree\u003C/a\u003E as a base, I will make an addon to rearrange the first steps of kerbals on space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second step, will be science. Most of my concerns are already fixed by Science Revisited, a mod that already was\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/100920-143-re4visited-science-revisited-170/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Erevisited many times\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0by diferent people. So it may be revisited one more time, as I have a different opinion on how some things should be done. Especially in how labs should work, I want to take special attention to them. Maybe even make a plugin if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, the focus will be the contracts. Right now, there are a lot of old contract packs. Most of them still work well \u003Cem\u003E(some of them with some bugs, like the Tourist Contract Pack)\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and they generally do the job... But in therms of displaying the missions, they seems cluncky and unorganized, as they have different ways of internal organization. What I want to do it\u0027s a mega pack, that should be used alone and that has everything well organized. Making good contracts isn\u0027t easy, so I will be using exisisting content when licenses allowed me, fix what is broken, give all the attributions necesary, and create what is left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, a engaging career campaign is more than doable. However, there is a few more things that I want to revisit. One of them, is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131808-18x-strategia-v180-2019-10-22/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EStrategia\u003C/a\u003E. As a mod cemented in stone, Strategia is probably the very core of most moded career campaigns. And what this glorious little piece of art adds to the game, is a overhaul of the vanilla strategy system. With little to no changes since it\u0027s creation, it\u0027s hard to believe that it could be improved. But sometimes questioning the very basis of your beliefs, may lead you to astonishing discoveries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, only left to see if there is any old and unmaintained mod that I want to use and it\u0027s worth to revive and maintain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFinished mods:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199957-1111-better-early-tree-v101/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EBetter Early Tree\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECurrently working on: KSP Module Parser for Python\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPython it\u0027s a well known programming lenguage. I use it pretty often, from facilitate the deploy of some other code, to read, analyze and process big chunks of data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRigth now I\u0027m working on implementing a Python wheel to parsing and reading all the CFG files of the game, and from mods. The idea is to first\u00A0 being able to read and analyze stock modules, and latter add the capacity of Module Manager to read and process patches, so you can even test your patches without opening the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea behind this came from a small script I made to facilitate the creation of my Mod, Better Early Tree. The script looks torugh the game files to find parts, and then it printed a file with a list of all the parts, and the Technology with they appear on the Reasearch Center. After that, another script read through a list I wrote, and generate all the patches that relocate the parts on the new tree. These script were quite simple and just work for my specific situation, so I thought of making a more general solution that worked on most situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m starting to redo most of the code, as I thought that RegEx could do most of the job, but it can barely do it if it\u0027s used alone. So it should rely a little less on RegEx.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/GonDragon/KSPModule\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGithub Repo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis Python Module, after finished, could lead to some interesting things, other automation scripting to facilitate modding, or patch testing... for example, a script to easily create/update a Parts Catalog Website from a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-08T02:02:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2021 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by GonDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hemeac","CreatedById":59783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-29T22:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways great to see more tech tree mods, not to mention the fact that you are saving yourself a lot of problems by using python to create the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches for you.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GonDragon","CreatedById":174274,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T05:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223916986\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199890\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611958625\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259783\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hemeac\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, hemeac said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways great to see more tech tree mods, not to mention the fact that you are saving yourself a lot of problems by using python to create the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patches for you.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yes!
