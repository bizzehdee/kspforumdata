Considering the insanely low number of polys being rendered at their highest LOD in any KSP scene, the rendering pipeline has to be a minority fraction of the time being taken to render frames.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed, performance impact should be minimal / negligible.  This is the Unity \u0027Standard\u0027 shader after all -- it is intended to work even on mobile (though with fewer features/simpler rendering); even now the models used in KSP are relatively simple, and the textures fairly low resolution.  The only bit that is being done...outside..the normal Unity graphics pipeline is the reflection probe updates, and those have to be updated one way or another. \n\nHowever one thing that I will be doing before I officially change over to the new shader is some mass-testing / performance limit testing.  Find out exactly how it compares to the recoloring shader, and how they both compare vs. the simple KSP shaders;  both with and without Scatterer/etc.  Another thing that I\u0027ll likely implement is some in-game settings to control the quality of the reflections / frequency of updates, including an option for \u0027static\u0027 (so there should be no run-time impact for reflection updates).\n\nOn the Scatterer note -- still not quite working well with it yet.  Scatterer does some... strange... things regarding rendering of its special features;  it renders them in screen-space as a post-processing effect.  Which is all good and fine... until you change the camera you are rendering from (for updating reflections), without updating the camera-basis transform for the screen-space translation.  So my reflection camera ends up rendering the ocean/sky effects in the position they would be if the refl camera was the main KSP camera.  Except the skybox/atmosphere... that is rendered traditionally.\n\nBit of a mess... but I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ll be able to sort it out to at least disable the extra renders during reflection updating.  -Ideally- I would be able to link into scatterer and update its screen-space transforms/matrix on a per-reflection-cube face basis, and render the scatterer ocean and etc directly into the reflections.  If I was a bit more familiar with the low-level rendering hacks that are in use it would be done already.  Will be taking it up in the Scatterer thread to see if anyone there has any ideas / see if the author has a minute to chat (last I checked though he was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E from the forums).\n\nHmm... looks like there is some hard-coded support for fixing reflections for TextureReplacer.  ([https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/commit/dea51546c8fb58e97ddc2d10860a0301cb5a5110](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/commit/dea51546c8fb58e97ddc2d10860a0301cb5a5110)) I can probably hook into those and make it all work simply by naming my camera \u0027TRReflectionCamera\u0027.   (WTB proper inter-mod API capability)  Will have to talk to blackrack about getting a proper API-based/mod-agnostic setup for that function.  Seems like there should be a very simple toggle to turn the post-processing on/off via external code (well... technically... scatterrer should check what camera is being rendered before applying post-processing; and this whole issue would be a non-issue).  And ideally, there would be the option to include the ocean and other effects into the reflections (though I can see that being expensive; as it is done as a post-processing effect, the entire setup would have to be redone for each face of the reflection cube).  Perhaps that can be a long-term integration goal.\n\nUp next will be looking at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E clouds.  Really not sure where to begin on that one.  As with scatterer, I\u0027ll have to do a bit of digging into the code to see how best to handle it.  I\u0027m really hoping that it is done in a bit of a more traditional rendering setup (e.g. using meshes/particles/objects/whatever), as I\u0027m already familiar with how to handle those types of setups."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-16T16:41:31Z","Content":"Neat to hear!

Only works from in-atmo; while in-orbit the atmosphere scatter is not rendered.  Due to how scatterer works, it would require support on the scatterer end of things (re-setup and re-render the scene from the 6 directions, adjusting the screen-space setup accordingly).  Will look into it further after more research on if the system itself will be viable and something that I\u0027m going to use.  The important part is that it is generally artifact-free -- most things will not be very reflective or have rougher reflections where minor imperfections in the environment map will not be visible.\n\nScatterer sunrise, in reflection (also with some eve clouds...):\n\n![AlCZ846.png](https://i.imgur.com/AlCZ846.png)\n\nAlso got the local-space \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E cloud reflections all figured out (removed the ugly terrain \u0027shadows\u0027).\n\n![Jq1RN6h.png](https://i.imgur.com/Jq1RN6h.png)\n\nSo in-atmo effects are working quite well.

The fundamentals of both mods are pretty simple; the implementations a bit of a mess though.  The atmo bit of Scatterer is pretty much screen-space fog, using some special functions to calculate the color and depth (the ocean stuff is a bit more complex).  Eve clouds are essentially just a textured sphere overlaid onto the planet (more to it than that, but that is the base of it).  Those two bits I could probably replicate and get working without too much difficulty.  The other functions though would require a bit more effort to get functional.\n\nEven as it stands I\u0027ll likely be putting in some PRs to both in order to accomplish better (higher performance, better looking) integration with the reflection rendering.  Nothing major, just a few accessibility changes, but should make everything run smoother.\n\nToday I\u0027m starting work on setting up the \u0027optimized\u0027 reflection handling code.  This will be a single central class that is responsible for updating the reflection textures for all parts/vessels on a scene, handling changes in functionality due to config options (update frequency, texture size), and managing the camera update functions.  Once this is in place and working, I\u0027ll look into doing some performance testing to see how it all lines up compared to existing KSP and SSTU shaders.  Will be doing testing on both my desktop for high-spec test (GTX970, 24g ram, [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)), and on my laptop for a low-spec test (GTX940MX, 8g ram, dual core [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).  If this all goes well, I will see about putting together a performance testing pack to make available for download, and try to get some performance data from whomever is interested in helping to test it.\n\nInitially I\u0027m going to set the reflections up to be on a \u0027per-vessel\u0027 basis, and reflect only the surrounding scenery (no other vessels / parts).  Updating of the reflection texture will likely be done once per-second (~60 frames); when used as an environment map, that will be plenty for most materials (mirror-like materials could benefit from up-to real-time updating, if the system is capable of it). \n\nCurrently I have the reflections updating in real-time (every frame), and there is no noticeable performance drop on my desktop from updating of the reflection cubemap when testing on very simple craft at low/medium cube resolution (256x) (even with Eve/Scatterer in place, steady 60fps).  I would imagine that the performance hit will be minor, and that performance will still be far more limited by part-count and collider-complexity than it is by the rendering pipeline (even if you double the rendering time, it will still be minor compared to the physics update time).\n\nGeneral development news:\n\nNot much.  Have been playing with shaders too much the last week to accomplish much else.  There were a couple new issues opened on GitHub this week though, and I\u0027m going to try to find time to get those fixed up.  Continuing deliberations on how to clean up the career mode progression and might have a few more tech-tree updates coming as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Kuldaralagh said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey guys, I was building a space station and I realized the docking ports are not cls compatible.
