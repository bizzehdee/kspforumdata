One of the main things I would like to do is make it so that you can view the data in the knowledge base, instead of building yet another custom UI. I\u0027m aware that the knowledge base is likely to change quite significantly but I\u0027ll worry about that when it happens \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found there is a KnowledgeBase class with an Instance property that looks promising.
