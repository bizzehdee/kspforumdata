What do you have in mind ? The only way my implementation would fail (which is also Z-Key\u0027s but a little stronger towards failure) is when KSP crashes during IVA. I tested it in all the possible ways the player could exit IVA and it always restored settings correctly. So yeah, basically, if you are keeping the \u0022GameSettings modification on the fly\u0022 way, you can\u0027t counter this bug in any other way than writing states in a file that would survive a KSP.exe crash. By loading it in PCR initialisation, you could see that IVA wasn\u0027t closed correctly and restore the settings state that were before entering IVA.
