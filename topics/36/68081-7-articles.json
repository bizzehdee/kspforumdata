I have a very large jet with 4 turbojet engines and a small jet with 1 basic jet engine. Due to it only seeming to try and match the T/W ratio the big jet\u0027s thrust was limited, and it couldn\u0027t reach a suitable takeoff speed, while the small jet humorously slammed into the big one at high speed while on the runway destroying them both (The small jet reaches like 700 mph at sea level it\u0027s ridiculous). Otherwise it seems to work great for anything outside the atmosphere, which definitely leads to some fun rocket fleet moments. It does co-operate when the crafts in atmosphere are exactly identical though, as shown in the videos provided.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meerkatking","CreatedById":116613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T18:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mod is great, super cool. however, when i set one ship to follow my Kolony ship, it it orients itself on the right heading but stubbornly stays rolled at a 90 degree angle. it doesnt affect usability but it does affect coolness :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T03:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that this mod is amazing, but inherently flawed in it\u0027s execution. It merely copies heading and acceleration, relying on RS to cancel out drift. Instead, each ship should be flying itself to maintain a fixed point relative to the leader, letting it steer and throttle to maintain that position and correct for the minute errors that become a big deal in a short time when flying so closely. This would negate the need for RCS, and would eliminate drift in atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supergamervictor","CreatedById":23473,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T13:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mod seems to have a conflict with MJ.The only other mod that does this is CactEye.Any help to why this is happening\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T14:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022victor tan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022victor tan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe mod seems to have a conflict with MJ.The only other mod that does this is CactEye.Any help to why this is happening\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECacteye has been a real troublemaker.
