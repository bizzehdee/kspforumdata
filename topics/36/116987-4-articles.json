The only thing I\u0027m still worried about is the engine-heat during the landing. The LaunchPads are sort of passive \u0022radiators\u0022 to prevent explosions due to overheating but I haven\u0027t tested actual landing on a pad ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\nPlayed a bit with OSE Workshop and this is what I can add via ModuleManager patches for the next update:\n\n- 3D-Printer can convert Ore to MaterialKits. (I\u0027d prefere Metal or Metal\u002BOre to MaterialKits but that would require balancing and I think it\u0027s better to use OSEs settings for now.)\n- A new part that is going to be introduced with the next update can build/recycle parts with the OSE Workshop module.\n- Tank setup for MaterialKits (XenonGas config will be overwritten).\n\nAtm there is no part available to do the Dirt to RareMetals/ExoticMinerals conversion. Once I do some more with the recycling concept, there will be some sort of chemical plant that could do it. In the meantime I could add a config for the tanks to store RareMetals/ExoticMinerals, if desired. This would overwrite some more tank-configs or some configs would use the same color.\n\nThe update should be ready by weekend \\*fingers crossed\\*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 09/05/2016 at 8:00 AM, Joshwoo69 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E yeah not sure if it is 1.1 compatible.. still but yeah I was kinda goig for that. was thinking that you can make the middle open space fully passable.\n\u003E \n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/TnQe9E4.jpg) is a very ruff concept of the Orbital Construction Hangar. The main cylinder will be 2.5 m in diameter. To have the middle fully passable is good idea. This way it can be extended by stacking the hangars. After the next update I\u0027m going to turn the concept into a proper part."},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T22:34:29Z","Content":"**Version 0.7 is released!**\n\n**Download from [SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/308/Keridian%20Dynamics%20-%20Vessel%20Assembly)**\n\n**Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/EleusisLaArwall/KeridianDynamics-VesselAssembly/releases/tag/v0.7)**\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/fApQ1/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**What\u0027s new?**\n\nThe Mobile VAB is now available for surface-based operations or just for faster assembly anywhere. Also the SledgeHammer and LaunchSite left the Experimental Section. In combination with the Mobile VAB they can be used to launch new vessels. They work similar to ELs SurveyStation, SurveyStake and Mallet.  \n\nThis is my first attempt with the new IVA overlay and interior stuff in general. I had a lot fun doing it but I also learned how hard and time-consuming it can be. It\u0027s not finished yet but good enough for a first release.\n\n[OSE Workshop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97537-11-ose-workshop-kis-addon-v0130-20160426/) is now supported! The 3D-Printer can convert Ore to Material Kits and the Mobile VAB has an OSE workshop and OSE recycler module. RareMetals and ExoticMinerals can\u0027t be converter yet but a tank-setup is available to store them. A new tank-setup for MaterialKits is also available.\n\nDependency has changed. ModuleManager is 100% required because it detects what mods are installed and applies Part-settings and modules accordingly.  \n\nExtraplanetary Launchpads and Kerbal Inventory System are not 100% required. I think they are needed because most of the parts will have no function without them and can be considered dead weight. Never the less all parts will appear in the VAB/SPH without these mods.  \n\nInterstellarFuelSwitch is not a dependency anymore but still supported and highly recommended. A new MM-config will detect if InterstellarFuelSwitch or Firespitter (bundled with OSE Workshop) is installed.  \n\n-If IFS and Firespitter are NOT installed: Seperate tanks for RocketParts and Metal are available.  \n\n-If IFS is installed but not Firespitter: tanks use InterstellarFuelSwitch.  \n\n-IF Firespitter is installed: tanks use Firespitters fuel switch (even if IFS is also installed).  \n\nThis patch took a lot of time to write but it can propably be improved. I really like what MM can do but sadly I\u0027m not good at writing configs for it. Let me know if you encounter any problems or have improvements for it.\n\nEnough talk for now, have fun and enjoy the update!\n\n**Changelog:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n2016-05-16 - Universal Assembly - v0.7  \n\n    -New part: KD-MobileVAB. Acts primary as Survey Station and offers a high productivity factor for up to 12 Kerbals.  \n\n    -New part (previously experimental): KD-LaunchSite (reworked). Acts as Survey Stake.  \n\n    -New part (previously experimental): KD-SledgeHammer. Needed to attach the LaunchSite to the ground.  \n\n    -All parts above need Kerbal Inventory System to work properly.  \n\n    -Added support for OSE workshop.  \n\n    -KD-3D-Printer can convert Ore to MaterialKits.  \n\n    -KD-MobileVAB can be used as OSE workshop and OSE recycler.  \n\n    -KD-T125FS and KD-T250FS have 2 additional setups (Materialkits and RareMetals/ExoticMinerals).  \n\n    -InterstellarFuelSwitch is not a dependency anymore but still supported and highly recommended.  \n\n    -Added support for Firespitter (FSmeshSwitch \u0026 FSfuelSwitch).  \n\n    -Added MM-config that autodetects if Firespitter and/or InterstellarFuelSwitch is installed and applies the corresponding modules to the tanks. (If both are NOT installed, two tanks for RocketParts and two tanks for Metal are available.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerenatus","CreatedById":151246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T03:26:59Z","Content":"With this beautiful mod, now I want to use EL again!\n\nThank you for your work!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T03:32:43Z","Content":"Eleusis, you mentioned that you may change the 3D printer to produce material kits out of metal for us folks that are using MKS or MKS Lite.\n\nPlease do!\n\nI am already planning on trying out your launch pads on my remote base.

The furnace and 3D printer would be great to try out as well.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m no MKS expert, so correct me if I\u0027m wrong but afaik MKS uses the resource \u0022 Metals \u0022 (with an extra s) instead of Metal. Metal is not defined in CommunityResourcePack and comes with EL. Unless MKS switches to Metal when EL is installed I think it\u0027s not that easy to make MKS compatible. Metals is defined with a density of 0.0078 and Metal is 5 times more dense with a density of 0.039. This is a big compatibility issue that I\u0027ve been thinking about for quite some time and I have no real solution found yet.\n\nMaybe I can come up with a MM patch that switches Furnace and 3D Printer to use MKS resources and production-chain. As I said before I\u0027m not very familiar with MKS, so If someone already has a config or would like to write one I\u0027d be more than happy to include it (with attribution of course). ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nBtw in the changelog I forgot to mentioned that the resource definition for Metal and RocketParts is now included by default (in case you don\u0027t have EL installed, the furnace, 3D printer and tanks still work)."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T00:27:09Z","Content":"I am using MKS Lite at this time, so I can\u0027t speak for how the full MKS version works.\n\nIn MKS Lite ore is directly converted to material kits/specialized parts with the Scout inflatable workshop.\n\nThe full version has a much more complicated supply chain."},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T11:55:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Dr Farnsworth said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am using MKS Lite at this time, so I can\u0027t speak for how the full MKS version works.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In MKS Lite ore is directly converted to material kits/specialized parts with the Scout inflatable workshop.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The full version has a much more complicated supply chain.\n\u003E \n\nExperimented a bit with MKS Lite and I think I missunderstood you ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022) So I made a patch that enables the 3D-Printer to convert Metal to MaterialKits. It\u0027s available for [download from Github](https://github.com/EleusisLaArwall/KeridianDynamics-VesselAssembly/releases/tag/v0.7) ([direct download](https://github.com/EleusisLaArwall/KeridianDynamics-VesselAssembly/releases/download/v0.7/KeridianDynamics_VA_Metal2MaterialKit_patch.zip)). Just install it after KeridianDynamics and overwrite the one file.\n\nThis patch makes it harder/more time-consuming because the convertion ratio from Ore to MaterialKits is lower than OSE and MKS Lite. In numbers (mass, NOT units!): MKS Lite Workshop extracts about 6.9%, OSE Workshop about 3.8% and KD about 1% (the 3D Printer actually converts almost 1:1 but the Furnace exctracts only 1 kg Metal from 100 kg Ore).\n\nIf used with MKS Lite a patch for EL to use MaterialKits is more or less required. For testing I used [this one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139754-extraplanetary-launchpads-for-mks-lite-patch/) provided by dsonbill."},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T03:09:58Z","Content":"Do the LaunchSite stakes always go into the ground facing the same way?

The KD parts should work with and without the original parts.\n\nTo be honest, I was a bit lazy last week and haven\u0027t done as much as I wanted but today I\u0027ve started with the Orbital Hangar IVA and still learning/playing around with lights in unity. I\u0027ve noticed that the MVAB IVA has actually no lights at the moment and it\u0027s pretty dark during the night. Will be fiixed with the next version.\n\nSince there have been a lot of compatibility questions and suggestions lately I\u0027m thinking about an integration of the MetallicOre --\u003E Metal and MetalOre --\u003E Metal configs for the Furnace. I\u0027d like to have all three conversion options available at the Furnace but only one can run at a time. Have to check if and how this is possible but otherwise I maybe add derivates of the Furnace for each conversion.

The new StationTanks come in 6 sizes plus one adapter and offer between 450 and 7500 units of resources. They are crew-passable and provide an interior (requires JSI advanced transparant pods). Additionally the tanks are equipped with illuminated signs to distinguish them in the dark. By default they can store RocketParts, Metal and Ore. If Community Resource Pack is installed additional setups for MaterialKits, RareMetals/ExoticMinerals, Dirt and MetalOre are available.\n\n**Orbital Hangar:**  \n\nA new way for off-world construction is introduced with the OrbitalHangar. It is pretty large, has room for 8 Kerbals and provides a good productivity factor. It is usable but still WIP (see spoiler for more info).\n\nSpoiler\n\n1. LaunchPositions: In the EL GUI you will see TWO LaunchPads (Orbital Hangar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and Orbital Hangar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E). The first should be used with craft-files from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the latter with craft-files from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s very important to choose the right Pad for the right craft BEFORE you start building. If not done correctly the new vessel will spawn 90\u00B0 rotated (very likely inside the hangar).\n2. Ladders: It\u0027s a real pain to set them up correctly and not all work as of now. All ladders on the main cylinder work. It is possible to switch from ladder to ladder by holding A or D but does not work 100%.\n3. Variants: Three Variants are possible. No radial node; 1.25 m radial node; 2.5 m radial node. If neither Firespitter nor InterstellarFuelSwitch is installed, the adapters will spawn automatically when attaching something to the corresponding node (don\u0027t attach decouplers/seperators directly). The downside is that they have no colliders and the ladders don\u0027t work. If Firespitter and/or InterstellarFuelSwitch is installed you need to switch between the variants manually to make the adapters appear but they have colliders and the ladders work.\n4. Colliders: The colliders are very simple and some areas don\u0027t have any ...\n\nStill on the todo list:\n\n- Better IVA (no more \u0022if you have seen one wall, you have seen em all\u0022).\n- Working Ladders on the scaffolding.\n- Floodlights.\n- Spawnmarkers\n- (Better colliders)\n\n**TechTree:**  \n\n(Re)Balanced the tech-nodes (stock and CTT), costs and costs to unlock. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/VUV3f94.png) is a picture that shows all required tech-nodes in the stock-tree.\n\n**Have fun with the update!**\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuture plans:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E  \n\nMore adapters for the StationTanks are in development and some non-passable StationTanks/overhaul of the old tanks are planed.

SC has a different density defined for the resource metal (0.007 while EL/KD uses 0.039). To compensate the difference this patch modifies the ratios in the resourceconverters to match KDs default resource conversion ratios. Definition for density(Metal)=0.039 is removed if SimpleConstruction is installed.\n2. Usually the folder \u0022ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads\u0022 inside GameData triggers the ModuleManager patches to apply the required modules. SC ships its own version of the Launchpad.dll and the \u0022ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads\u0022 folder does not exist. This patch adds a trigger to apply the modules if the folder \u0022SimpleConstruction\u0022 exists AND \u0022ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads\u0022 does NOT (inside GameData).\n\nI\u0027ve read something about automated construction a while ago if I remember correctly but can\u0027t find it right now. I\u0027ll keep my eyes open but at the moment Kerbals are required to assemble new vessels."}]}
