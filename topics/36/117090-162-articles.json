All of those I did not try to undock.   I exited the game completely, launched a new KSP itterationand  was able to undock..... only these parts I never attempted to undock before.   If I gave you the save file I would have to send you about 40 CFG files for parts that I have altered the CFGs on (Specifically FASA fuel tanks and engines, that I have used as part of the Station structure.)   \n\nGiven me finding this today I think I can trace the issue.   \n\nWhen I first tried to undock, I had crew on board and connected Living space mod installed.    Note that CLS is now un-installed.   New items un-dock freely.  Old pre CLS mod removal parts will not undock.   Every part I have tried to undock has a Probe core or a crew station with a pilot.....   \n\n[http://imgur.com/a/FHajg](http://imgur.com/a/FHajg)\n\nI am using HyperEdit to land the disfunctional space station.   You can see the Bad weld between the two Solar arrays (closest to KSP in this view, the second one bends up,)    All of the non DOS Colored ports are the SC-GEN-DP-1P 1.25m ports. The Back Left and Right (in this view) sections each have a single weld.  The HAB side has a perfect weld, I was more patient.  The Solar array side has about a 5 degree to the right and 7 degree up bend at this angle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-11T01:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2016 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**\n  \nRe-added Image"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T02:20:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Domfluff said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was playing around with the idea of a design-for-effect robot arm mod, one that had a model, but didn\u0027t physically move anything, just acted as an increase to the mass you can move with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I was playing around with this on the most basic level - giving the functionality to a copy of a cubic octagonal strut - and had that working fine... but the actual implementation was somewhat lacking.

Design for effect, the actual utility is more important here.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E The real problem I\u0027ve had in designing plausible vehicles is the problem with hab multipliers, which make little sense to me. The idea is that working space (e.g., labs) give you some available space, hab modules give more more room to move (bonus kerbalmonths) and multipliers are supposed to be parts which give benefits throughout the whole ship. To give a far-future (slightly silly) example, a cinema or pub would give you a bonus throughout, not just for that module.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E For a less far-future example, I think the toruses are more than reasonable to use as hab modifiers. Crews can rotate through the ship, so having work time spent in-gravity during transit is of great overall benefit to the crew. What values are given here are something quite different though.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Thinking in terms of actual game effect, I don\u0027t think you should \\*need\\* artificial gravity for a Duna mission. It would be nice, and might be a really good idea, but I think you should be able to get by without. This is also a good reason to have torus parts above hab parts on the CTT, so you can slum it in a low tech manner.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Duna transit is less than 300 days, so that\u0027s a reasonable figure to aim at for a Deep Space Habitat-like vehicle (i.e., ISS Lab module, ISS docking nod, ISS hab/MPLM module \u002B propulsion bus, Orion and MMSEV). Architecture of this manner could keep a transit vehicle in-orbit and land the crew to an unmanned and previously deployed surface hab.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Anything beyond Duna should probably require artificial gravity. Checking out the Outer Planets mod, the extremes of the solar system (Neidon and Plock) are something like 23 and 35\u002B years to transit for a minimum energy transfer one way. Clearly then, a long term space habitat needs to end up with hab time approaching 50-100 years. That might be with a minimum crew (probably 4 or 6, since 2x Scientists, 1x Pilot, 1x Engineer seems sensible as crew minimum in most cases in KSP, but there are arguments for more especially with mission involving ISRU or other base parts. If I recall correctly, UKS does model \u0022unhappiness\u0022 in the form of inefficiency for fewer than five kerbals at a Kolony, which may or may not be a consideration).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E So, just throwing some arbitrary numbers out for the extreme end of things:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 30 man torus for a 6 crew long (really long) duration mission would have:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E (30 \u002B Bonus Kerbal months) \\* Multiplier / Crew  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Without bonuses, hab time is 150 days per crew member.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Assuming a bonus of 200 kerbal months (one KM per seat means this is \u002B170) and a crew of six, that\u0027s:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 30 \u002B 170 \\* Multiplier / 6  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Using a **Multiplier of 30 and bonus of 200 Kerbalmonths** here would allow for the largest torus to support hab time for six crew for about 70 years. That seems reasonable to me as a top-end \u0022permanent\u0022 habitat, and is within reason for an interstellar flight (therefore a decent practical endgame limit for KSP). Certainly fine for pootling around the solar system.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Tuesday, August 09, 2016 at 7:10 PM, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Domfluff](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64903-domfluff/) makes good points. I took this up in the USILS thread when it first came up, largely because the suggested hab multiplier is the *mass* for a part like the cupola. You could make a part with a single window (thick, leaded glass) and the entire thing is made out of lead, and that sucker multiplies habitation by its mass. Crew of 30, and 1 really overbuilt window can do what you like... how about a 10-ton porthole! 10X hab multiplier! Or, you know, spam cupolas.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the large torus used its mass as a hab multiplier, lol. Yeah, move the wife and kids and settle down up there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I\u0027m trying to figure out the best way to do the balancing on the inflatables and torii.  They certainly won\u0027t be mass based... more likely a hand-tailored value derived from gameplay balanced setups (e.g. how long does it take to go to the longest planet?  aim for 2-3x that as the max hab duration for a decently equipped vessel).\n\nI\u0027ll be trying to avoid any single super-overpowered parts, and most of the effect for the parts will come from combining multiple hab parts together.  So.. instead of spamming cuppolas you would include a large hab torus, perhaps an inflatable or two (hab/support), and your main command part (be it a CM or whatever); that should be enough to get you several -years- worth of hab time for a station or interplanetary craft.  And of course you can always build bigger for longer durations ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nEither way, the hab/multiplier for some of the largest parts will be quite large.  You shouldn\u0027t need multiples of any parts for any sort of reasonable length voyage.  -Might- need it for some of the OPM planets with transits of 20\u002B years one way (or you could just patch the parts to increase the mults...).\n\nSo far I\u0027ve been putting together a small bit of initial LS setup for the DOS/COS parts.  Aiming for 2-months hab-time each (and ~2 months of supplies, including recyclers) with a crew of 2/module; though for a reasonable station and crew count the actual calculated duration will be much higher (after some of the parts with multipliers, converters, or bonus hab time are included).  -Might- have an updated release this weekend with the initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS patch for the DOS parts (sorry, inflatables will be coming later after I get the hang of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS balancing and play with it a bit).\n\nWill also be doing an overhaul of the plugin code in a few areas; the VolumeContainer module/setup needs a bit of... attention... regarding some symmetry updates and making it easier to have empty/zeroed resources or containers.  Should be able to maintain compatibility across the update as it will mostly be GUI and interaction related stuff that will change (and the persistent data for those parts is pretty simple and has all the data needed... hard to break/should not need changes).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Tuesday, August 09, 2016 at 7:04 PM, StickyScissors said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As it turns out, i actually am interested in them. me want.

In going through my limited notes on Kerbal Contract Station 1, I noticed that I had tried to move a Kerbal from a habitat can to a science lab before I had issues un-docking.\n\nVERY MINOR weird glitch with the tracking solar panels pm tje mew station parts.  Every time I come back to the scene they \u0022Re-aquire\u0022 their sun pointing as if they have been out of proper alignment for days...   Even if I only JUST left the scene for 5 seconds.   I will try again with my new station once I get the next 3 launches up (later tonight.)   Currently my station is running on the DOS attached as built panels and a few stocks ones.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-11T22:33:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2016 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**\n  \nClarification"}]}
