I have also added code for textural swaps for most all of these tanks, There is a bug here in the dual2x1 the bottom texture is not switching, this part needs to be rerendered to solve this problem, and lack is under the gun at work so it may be a while till its fixed. I built a few more colors to play with as well. Please feel free to add more or change things around and show us what I have not thought of in this respect. Most of these changes require one or more mods to function. Firespitter is required for the textual swap, ModularTanks is required for the standard tanks to swap there contents, I have included files for adding the resources for KSPI, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and TACLS. This also has the cfgs for several other mods, including CLS, DRE, and Scaling. I have also added electric charge to modular tanks with the cfg for it. Please feel free to mess around with all of these, and let me know if you find any errors. You will find also that the scaling cfg\u0027s take out all the larger scaled items from the career mode track. The parts are still there, but are no longer needed because all the standard sizes can now be enlarged to the larger sizes and beyond (i.e. 2x1 -\u0026gt; 1x0.5, 4x2, 8x4, 16x8) This also breaks the 4x1 nuke engine, but I am going to fix that here in a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is currently a problem with the current version of MFT, they are working on it but it breaks the ability to change the tanktypes file.

This zip file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5GoisSOPfY4VUZjVXFEMUpuR0E/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E contains the standard size tanks 1x1, 2x1, dual 2x1, 2x1 expanded, twin spherical 1x1, 3x1, and 4x1. I have also added code for textural swaps for most all of these tanks, There is a bug here in the dual2x1 the bottom texture is not switching, this part needs to be rerendered to solve this problem, and lack is under the gun at work so it may be a while till its fixed. I built a few more colors to play with as well. Please feel free to add more or change things around and show us what I have not thought of in this respect. Most of these changes require one or more mods to function. Firespitter is required for the textual swap, ModularTanks is required for the standard tanks to swap there contents, I have included files for adding the resources for KSPI, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and TACLS. This also has the cfgs for several other mods, including CLS, DRE, and Scaling. I have also added electric charge to modular tanks with the cfg for it. Please feel free to mess around with all of these, and let me know if you find any errors. You will find also that the scaling cfg\u0027s take out all the larger scaled items from the career mode track. The parts are still there, but are no longer needed because all the standard sizes can now be enlarged to the larger sizes and beyond (i.e. 2x1 -\u0026gt; 1x0.5, 4x2, 8x4, 16x8) This also breaks the 4x1 nuke engine, but I am going to fix that here in a few minutes.\u003Cp\u003EThere is currently a problem with the current version of MFT, they are working on it but it breaks the ability to change the tanktypes file. If you have the new version of MFT and need the older version let me know and I can give you a link to my dll for MFT so you can play with these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sorry for the lack of formatting I have my son wanting to play skylanders with me and I am trying to post this as quick as possible. I will edit this post when I fix the nuke engine part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a heads up - as is, TweakScale\u0027s download/directory also includes the LLL configs, with which the ones you bundle in your zip conflict mightily - maybe you are just throwing them in there for now, though, but thought it might be worth pointing out if the cfgs will be bundled in the future too. It would be nice but not particularly important too to delete a bunch of superfluous LLL parts (or hide them from the part list maybe?) if you were thinking of making TweakScale a required piece - or not, if not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027comic sans ms\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EAlso, don\u0027t know why, but the LLL kethane tanks are broken (zero mass, zero contents) as is with those configs. Is this the bug you\u0027re talking about with MFT?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m an idiot, helps to have kethane installed for kethane-based tanks to work, I\u0027m guessing (was playing around with clean install \u002B this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of standard tanks and swapping fuel/resource types, though, and I like that you made it possible to swap colors - is there any way to make this quickly accessible via right-click menu? Or is that something MFT would have to implement? Sorry, don\u0027t know how a lot of this stuff works. E.g. right click menu includes \u0022switch tank type\u0022 to cycle through things like LFO mix, all fuel, all oxidizer, all xenon, whatever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that there are two parts with identical names: LLLCirc2b2f, both the FuelTank/2-50m/HeatTile/Circ25FuelTankHT and HeatTile/Circ25Fuel are named this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T00:14:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T00:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have added a standard 2x1 Third Length tank.
