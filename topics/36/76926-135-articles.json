Since it relies on Line of Sight, the weapon (obviously) should have line of sight to the target. After launching the weapon, the player has to put the white pipper (The circle thingy that replaces your mouse when you activate a weapon in flight) on the target and the missile SHOULD pick the SHORTEST path to the white pipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe missile also requires some sort of connection to the firing platform. The TOW does this through a wire attached to the firing platform and in other weapons such as the 9M133 Kornet ride a laser beam pointing directly to a target. So when this connection gets cut off somehow (Like when the TOW missile\u0027s wire is cut off and the 9M133 Kornet\u0027s laser beam is interrupted) the missile will go wherever it wants. I haven\u0027t done much research on the Kornet and i\u0027m not sure, but the Kornet should ride the laser beam once it re-detects it. The TOW, obviously not, as the wire is actually cut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make REALLY good ATGMs, using AGMs like the Hellfire on my tanks is really annoying, and they have no short range capability.

I have been able to get all different kinds of planes to fly fine with AI in FAR. It sounds like you may have turned steer damping too high. What steer damping does is it applies input to counter angular velocity. You need it so that the plane will slow it\u0027s rotation as it gets close to the attitude it wants, otherwise it will keep overshooting and overadjusting. If it\u0027s too high, the plane will try to slow its rotation down as soon as it starts turning so it will never pull any Gs. 5 seems to be a good value for most planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the missiles sticking - I\u0027ll see if I can get it to work more consistently (its a KSP issue with load ranges) but for now try increasing the phys range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Archdukemango\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Archdukemango\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Bahamuto, I\u0027m having this really odd problem with the smart guard.
