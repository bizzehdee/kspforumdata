Might be easier with Venn\u0027s, as he redoes quite a few of the stock models entirely, but the limitations in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E still make it more difficult than it should be.\n\nProbably a good example / place to start is the one stock engine that I\u0027ve converted to the clustering system, the NRV engine:  [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/GameData/SSTU/Parts/ShipCore/engines/SC-ENG-NRV.cfg](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/GameData/SSTU/Parts/ShipCore/engines/SC-ENG-NRV.cfg)\n\nEssentially I had to create an entirely new part config in order to redefine the order that the modules are specified in the config file (and thus the order they are loaded in) -- specifically, the SSTUEngineCluster module must be in the part config BEFORE the ModuleEnginesXXX module (the engine cluster code needs to run prior to ModuleEngines init code to make sure the model is setup properly).\n\nLet me know if you need more pointers/etc on how to get things set up.  And once you do have things working for stock engines (or other mods\u0027 engines), feel free to submit a PR with the patches if you feel so inclined, I have no problem hosting/distributing some configs for better mod integration."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T17:10:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E SSTU has a decoupler w/integrated separation motors as well, the ISDC.

So its not a lack of configs or lack of support at a plugin level, but would have to be something specific with the parts.\n\nWhat specific parts does SS have a problem with?\n\nI need to know specific parts, because nearly every part in SSTU is setup differently (and with special consideration to the features of the part).  Some might have plugin/module level conflicts, others may simply be some errors in the configs.\n\nFrom a quick guess, I would think that the petal adapter, ISDC, RBDC, and the recolorable/resizable stock fairings might have problems (these parts all have problems with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E code to some extent, depending on use; mostly due to multiple decouplers).  Possibly some of the command pods as well due to their integrated decouplers.

So I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support. I really like it.  \n\nI have just now realized how \u0022Habitation\u0022 works in the mod. Basically its not just supplies for them to eat and drink but also the \u0022Room\u0022 they have to stretch. Basically you could have 2 years of supplies but if you dont have a big enough area the living space can be so cramped they could only have 10 days of \u0022Habitation\u0022. They basically go \u0022Crazy\u0022 in 10 days and stop accepting orders.  \n\nMy point is.... Is there any modification I can make to currently exsisting SSTU habs to give them \u0022Habitation\u0022 Bonuses? Like a patch? I can use all the SSTU station habs. Have huge space for them to live in but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E doesnt recognize the habs and the overall \u0022Habitation\u0022 is still like 10 days.  \n\nI could go poke around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E habs. Find out where the \u0022Habitation\u0022 stat is and copy, adjust it over but I feel like im gonna break the mod if I do that lol. Any suggestions? Or should I just switch back to TAC Life Support?  \n\nEdit: NEVERMIND Im once again an idiot. Didnt configure the procedural hab right.  \n\nEdit Edit: Going to try to get help or make one my self. Maybe a patch for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support and SSTU\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-07T12:29:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2017 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by TheKnave**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-07T14:36:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, TheKnave said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quick question.
