If you want to know why it makes a difference, try driving a stock rover, and then a MK4 on Gilly and watch the difference. When that happened to me is when I removed them from my 0.23.0 folder and moved on. They feel too much like cheat parts now to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the parts to load in-game is as simple as putting PART {} around the config files and downloading the updated cleverbobcat.dll.

If they click on a link (especially one in the official thread), and unpack as normal, then they will all too often complain that the parts simply don\u0027t meet their quality expectations for Bobcat releases.... and the thread fills up with complaints about something that the OP didn\u0027t even do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that gives you a better understanding of why some mod-authors are resistant to derivative works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeriki","CreatedById":3039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T17:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esame could you pm it to me...\u003Cp\u003EOPIONION ALERT!!:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO if modders don\u0027t like to share their models/work then it\u0027s fine by me but it does seem odd... if one person hates people begging for updates why not asseble a team and spread it out evenly so it\u0027s not too stressful (and you could just push all the update pokes to that guy/s) and also it keeps the mod alive and i doubt anyone would want to destroy or reak havoc with the DEMV rovers.
