Which in turn means that PartTools bombed out before it finished writing the file.\n\nIt\u0027s often caused by having a **mesh collider**, **mesh renderer** or similar assigned to a GO without a **mesh filter**. Borked animations can also cause this, but check for rogue GO\u0027s first. As LordPrometheus pointed out, it can also be a material that hasn\u0027t had a shader properly assigned. Either way, something is stopping PartTools from exporting it correctly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T18:07:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lo-fi**"}]}
