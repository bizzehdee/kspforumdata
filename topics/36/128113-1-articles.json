But only if at that time Input is possible in VR (and by that I mean natural input as implicated in my video, not a controller or Joystick). Hopefully we get something like that done by then. Additionally I hope we can make a proper VR Implementation of the headsets, which should be possible as soon there is SDK 1.0 available from Oculus and we have KSP 1.1 released (probably in 1/2016). As for what I can get done at the moment is a good working non 3d virtual environment in Vorpx or a distorted 3d environment in Tridef - so lots of space for improvement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as soon we get Input (Like with Hydra for the moment\u00A0and OTouch/HTCvive in the future) and Output (Preferably native Support with unity 5 in KSP 1.1) done the only thing we would have to care about is FPS (which I think should be solvable with some tweaks and 1.1), so nobody gets sick\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E!
