So I would *STRONGLY* suggest removing the penalty on Ammonia altogether.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Hydrazine, it\u0027s definitely realistic- but it could easily be (and probably currently is based on the description, although I haven\u0027t had the chance to play-test it yet) over-done. I would suggest giving it the Reputation penalty Ammonia currently has (Ammonia shouldn\u0027t have ANY reputation penalty, its toxicity is so light compared to other fuels like hypergolics and Kero/LOX, it is actually a comparatively *clean* fuel) such as to not be overly-harsh on players. After all, this is a game (and Reputation is much more valuable than you think, as it can be burned for large quantities of Funds or Science...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, how do you actually scale the Reputation-penalty?

(other planets don\u0027t matter) If the former, I would suggest switching it to the latter...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, but not least, how do you inform players that they\u0027ve actually been subjected to a Reputation penalty for using Hydrazine/Ammonia in-atmosphere?

And keeping the penalty very small- not more than 5-10 Reputation points (which, with the appropriate strategy, can actually convert to quite a few Science points on a mission- or quite a large discount on a new tech-node at R\u0026amp;D...) for most larger/heavier launches (and less for smaller ones). This is because, after all, Kerbal is a game- and Kerbals are little green men who likely place much less value on their lives and the environment based on all the existing lore (through stock part descriptions and such) and options the game gives you.

Still I think we might use this in some sort of \u0022Save The Environment Strategy\u0022 \u0022 which gives you bonuses when use clean technologies and punish you when you damage the environment. Another option would be some anti nuclear statagy. It would be great for any player which does not want to send Nuclear reactors into space.

It started as a 5m Large Fusion Reactor with 5m Large Electric Generators on both ends, one for thermal and one for charged particles. I noticed that it wasn\u0027t producing nearly as much power as I expected, so I right clicked on the generators and they said their max power was very low. I remembered the 3.75m version making more power, so I made the generators smaller but forgot to change the reactor\u0027s size. The power output increased so I tried 2.5m generators and they made even more power. Then I tried 1.875m and 1.25m small generators, and as expected the max power decreased with size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it may have something to do with the fact that the default size for the large generator is the smallest it can go, while the default size for the small generator is the largest it can go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I can\u0027t be sure, but it may have something to do with TweakScale not properly changing the radius property of the reactor, causing the system to think it\u0027s always 2.5m.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T11:51:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrNukealizer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T13:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrNukealizer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrNukealizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it may have something to do with the fact that the default size for the large generator is the smallest it can go, while the default size for the small generator is the largest it can go.\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I can\u0027t be sure, but it may have something to do with TweakScale not properly changing the radius property of the reactor, causing the system to think it\u0027s always 2.5m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
