For a mod like HGR wich is trying to introduce an all new diameter, it feels weird that the first craft* would be essentially 2.5m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*craft as in the way the soyjuice lets you build something \u0022like\u0022 a real life counterpart, but can be used however you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why an adapter like the current one couldn\u0027t be used. That doesn\u0027t make the pod feel like it needs a whole new set of sized parts. To me it\u0027s more like the pod is a stopgap between two sizes and the adapter could be considered a part of the pod itself. People can already do what they want with the current Radish, I frequently use it with both 1.25 and 1.875 parts in the early career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely include an adapter similar to the current one, auto shrouds don\u0027t play well with FAR and reentry and don\u0027t take up any less memory anyway. It could even be designed to be flipped over and used to taper the SM down to 1.25 this time. Two sizes of SM is an interesting idea and might be possible, but I\u0027d only pull the trigger on the larger size if It could be mapped to the same texture space as the \u0022standard\u0022 one, because I don\u0027t want to do the texture work for two service modules and it would take up more memory. I\u0027m mostly sure I could do it, but don\u0027t want to promise anything this early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the input so far everyone, I appreciate the brainstorming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I used a Radish in the old HGR, it was almost always a 2.5m spacecraft because it didn\u0027t look good on either 1.875m or 1.25m parts. Making a mercury pod using the Mk1 pod and using a re-entry pack that\u0027s 0.625m doesn\u0027t make the craft a 0.625m craft. And KSP users almost always use 1.25m tanks under it even if they could go down or up. The utility of the radish would be greatly expanded by allowing you to go directly to 1.875m or to use an adapter fuel tank to make a service module for replica craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s just the fact both the Apollo service module and the Titan Rockets were silver, so the Rockomax tanks fit them best as a rocket stage.

And branch it off into its own mini mod as it isn\u0027t really a 1.875m part set and is likely more fitting being on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: I could turn it into a 1.875m pod with 1.25 nodes. This is closer to the scale of actual Vostok and LK, but it might be strange having such a big pod only carry one Kerbal. This would be a big change and might upset a largish portion of the user base however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just my initial thoughts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T20:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can set up a poll to ask users.

The good thing about making it bigger is that there is potential to make an alternate \u0022voskhod\u0022 version by using some creative model welding and an alternative IVA set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity why do you feel the original doesn\u0027t work for Vostok missions using the parts in HGR?

The de-orbit engine ends up being either too big - too much fuel in too long service compartment - or too small with 0.625 engine. I have once resized Spud to 1.875, put some procedural conical tank and clipped inside it an upper-stage 1.875 engine and got nice-looking Vostok, then replaced it with Onion and probe part and used that as Voskhod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Voskhod crashed into terrain and killed Jeb and Bill.
