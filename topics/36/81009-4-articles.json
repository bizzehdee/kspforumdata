So this Command Module is a bit of a compromise of both worlds. It has a good, in-built SAS reaction that can rotate the entire ship at a reasonable rate, and also comes with 8000 Electric Charge, double the size of the best battery (since its further down the tech tree than the large battery). The size of the command module would lend you to believe it could accommodate both. And at end game KSP-I when things get very part-heavy, this should at least help lighten the load slightly without taking any of the customization of kerbal away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMAIN HULL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The idea behind the main hull is to be an antimatter reactor (and originally a generator as well, but interstellar wouldnt let me make it both). But to be an antimatter reactor that is slightly -less- powerful and efficient than the one packed with Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The PAYOFF however, is that it is lighter, and comes with the truss system that allows for an extremely modular customization system. (attaching things via the truss system then adds weight, balancing it back up to be heavy once more)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The reason i had to make a second Warp Ring a Generator is due to the fact that Interstellar wouldnt let me make this main hull both a reactor AND a generator (and would also not let me crossfeed either through a warp ring to the Quantum Vacuum Engine). So this is the current compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaste Heat is currently turned off on it, but i will be bringing it in as a slow rise. The story being the other pro to this is it has built in heat vents at the back, not as effective as shoving a ton of heat radiators onto everything in sight, but enough to give the ship a long life before you need to go back to Starbase, dock up, unfuel your antimatter, and give your reactor a rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQUANTUM VACUUM ENGINE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m very wary of QV engines. Whilst they work in RL in their early tests, their capabilities arent fully known. And whilst running off basically thin air, have the capability to unbalance things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Whilst i love near future technology in game, i dont want it to take the challenge out of the game. So getting this engine right is important to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Being used in conjunction with the Warp drive, it should be there to make attaining orbit from a warp jump possible, but not be used for every situation with regards to the rest of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So i\u0027d like a drawback, possibly overheating, possibly the length of time it takes to work its magic.
