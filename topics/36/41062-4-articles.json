My school district is messed up quite a lot, and 6th grade is still elementary, while 7th is middle school. I don\u0027t know why. The ironic thing is that we\u0027re about 40 points down below the national average on the main test we take to measure progress, the MAP test, while I get scores of around 45 points \u003Cem\u003Eover\u003C/em\u003E the national average.
