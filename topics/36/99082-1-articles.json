Most likely they execute some code at startup that makes some alterations to the techtree. Now I would not recommend this technique because it\u0027s likely to cause incompatibilities with other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now it\u0027s hardcoded, but you can make your own, using techmanager.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of empty nodes left in the stock tech tree that, because they are empty, are invisible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to add somthing to such a node (by editing the TechRequired field in a part config file), it will make that node show up ingame. That is the way pure part packs do it without requiring any sort of assisting techtree mod. Downsides: the name, icon, cost and position of the node in question are pre-set and cannot be changed. You can only make it show up by putting something into it, no more, no less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t currently remember the names of these nodes off of the top of my head.
