If you have one craft close to the camera, that the camera is focused on, and another off in the distance, the other craft off in the distance could be out of focus. \n\nBeing able to do something called a \u0022rack focus\u0022 (where a narrow depth of field is either moved closer or further from the camera during the shot) in the game would be really cool for film makers."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T01:36:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However I would like to know what kind of other shaders you guys would like to see in the game, eg other shaders for Kopernicus or stuff like that.\n\u003E \n\nis it possible to see eclipses from the ground?

It does distort objects like the ones you get when looking at a hot street in the summer casuing the effect of a Fata Morgana. A blurry effect like used in the DoF is not what is happing.\n\nThat\u0027s actually the only reason why Hubble was put into space: to get away with these distortions. However science advanced and nowadays earth based telescopes can not just reach the same clearness of Hubble\u0027s pictures, they do even exceed them by using adaptive optics which corrects the distortions of objects. That\u0027s also why no further optical space telescopes for visible light like Hubble will be realized: they are not needed anymore. Hubble was the first and will be the last one of this kind. The next telescope James Webb will be an extremly sensitive infrared telescope where they need to get away from earth\u0027s heat and the atmosphere as far as possible, as such wavelengths don\u0027t make it through (atmospheric window). And even then these wavelenths are not blured by the atmosphere, they are just absorbed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-11T01:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2016 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tekener**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T01:42:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah seasons might be a bit more complicated...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However I would like to know what kind of other shaders you guys would like to see in the game, eg other shaders for Kopernicus or stuff like that.\n\u003E \n\nI would like to see a shader that would let me do a proper gas giant being mostly gaseous with a small core.

I haven\u0027t messed with in a a week\u0027s or so. I kinda just gave up on it and I\u0027m sticking with my bread and butter,  which is textures lol\n\nI want to use collision fx because it has biome colored dust that kicks up which would add to the realism. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-11T17:26:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2016 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T19:14:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Galileo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And here is a look at the gas animation stuff \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E \n\nI was never really a fan of that as the noise movement looked very much like standing waves rather than transverse if you get what I mean.
