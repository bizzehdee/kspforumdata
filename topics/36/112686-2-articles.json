I know some of the other TAC and Life Support mods do. (See point #2 above)  \n\nXenon-powered 3m magnetoplasmadynamic engine - Wouldn\u0027t this be redundant, since we have xenon powered plasma engines which are 3.75m?  \n\nGigantic cupola cockpit - I\u0027m not sure about this one. A cupola that size would might be too futuristic for Kerbodyne Plus. KP has kind of a near future feel similar to the film Interstellar or harder sci-fi. I try to avoid super advanced tech. I feel that\u0027s the niche this mod fills, since B9\u0027s large parts are mega futuristic and KW Rocketry is mega realistic. So, that said, I\u0027m not opposed to the idea it would just have to be modified. The major flaw as I see it, has to do with glass, radiation, and temperature differentials. Unless we decided to chalk the design up to unobtanium, how would we justify a huge glass canopy? This is why there are so few, and in general, tiny windows on the ISS.   \n\nLastly, as for the internals, I\u0027m thinking more like Dragon v2 capsule or ISS, less space hotel.  \n  \n![E33yB4z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/E33yB4z.jpg)  \n\nThanks for the suggestions AJ, I really do appreciate it!
