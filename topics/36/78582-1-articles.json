In Mode A, only a small amount of D3He fusion pellets are consumed, and liquid fuel/hydrogen is consumed to generate high thrust but relatively low isp. In Mode B, the engine burns fusion pellets exclusively for high ISP but low(er) thrust.

Each engine I\u0027m building offers something unique, but will also have limitations. For instance, the aerospike is a bit better than stock LV-N when in liquid fuel mode, and its OATS system gives it thrust comparable to the stock aerospike but with better ISP. It will require expensive FuelRods in addition to the fuel and/or oxidizer, which means I\u0027ll need to model a fuel rod container to refuel the thing with. I\u0027ll also learn ModuleManager so that I can change the stock LV-N to use just liquid fuel- if you look in its config file, even Squad says it\u0027s not supposed to burn oxidizer too. Now that I think of it, the LV-N could use the MultiFuelSwitcher module I created...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Supernova is a powerful engine for sure, but it will indeed be rather heavy (30mt at present, I might up that to 50mt given that we have Heavier Rocketry now), its FusionPellets fuel will be even more expensive than FuelRods, and the engine generates a lot of heat, which means I\u0027ll have some heat radiators to work on as well in addition to the ones on the pellet tanks. I can see a single radiator module with folding radiators that\u0027s big enough to meet the reactor\u0027s needs. That will keep the part count down (I hope). Following Porkjet\u0027s lead, I\u0027m combining functionality in the parts I make- in my case, so I can keep that part count down and avoid stuffing the build tabs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a third engine in mind that is simpler than the other two, called a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#nswr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enuclear salt-water rocket\u003C/a\u003E, that consumes Nuclear Salted Fizzy Water (NSFW \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). It offers both high thrust and high specific impulse, but it cannot be used in Kerbin orbit below 200km, it\u0027ll kill any kerbals 2km behind its exhaust plume, and any vessels within 500m of the exhaust plume will be vaporized (if I can figure out how to make ships spontaneously combust). Even scaled down it might be too OP for the game though, so the NSFW engine is on the back burner as I contemplate building the 2.5m \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#ntrsoliddumbo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDUMBO\u003C/a\u003E engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, fuel costs and engine costs will be high, but I plan to integrate parts into the upcoming karbonite mod that\u0027ll let you mine planets and convert materials into nuclear fuels.

And, I see how to add different exhaust plume effects and sounds based on different fuel types, so I\u0027ll be exploring that and updating the engine to take advantage of that research. What\u0027s really cool is that PartTools supports particle effects, so I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s how I can make exhaust plumes and other effects. If I can find a sound clip of the Shuttle SRBs lighting off, I have some ideas on how to tweak that noise.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a teaser image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spellflight.com/KSP/FusionWip5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FusionWip5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T01:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phers","CreatedById":67094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T08:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike the Supernova \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E quick question for you though... are you going to make the parts work with tweak scale? this would allow people to scale the parts to their build needs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T15:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELike the Supernova \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E quick question for you though... are you going to make the parts work with tweak scale? this would allow people to scale the parts to their build needs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use Tweak Scale, but I can add your request to my todo list.

Anyway, I\u0027ve created the liquid flame and hydrogen flame effects. These effects are used in NTR mode. According to the NASA document, the engine mixes plasma from the reactor with hydrogen propellant and pushes the ionized result out the back. I\u0027ve tried to reflect that somewhat in the exhausts but also kerbalized the engine. I have some bugs to work out of the module I wrote, then I can post the update.
