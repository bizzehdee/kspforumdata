I will have to build a thermal rocket engine too. As for the reactor housing, your the second person to say something about making it glow... the reactor housing keeps all of that kind of stuff contained so vents wouldn\u0027t be very... containment minded, however it did give me another idea and since I have to build an emissive layer anyways I think it wont be too much of an issue... the Pipes for the molten salt heat exchange could feasibly become hot enough to glow with heat similar to the engines. The water not so much because it would be steam, that is under lower pressures but making that one pipe glow a low orange I will look into.\u003Cp\u003EI know that visually this reactor is fairly boring, very little effects and that is kinda how these things are if there running safe you know? I am trying to come up with stuff to add to it that will give it a bit more of a kick, and make it less like the vanilla parts trust me it was originally just a 2x1 hull piece. The generator just has been upgraded from blank hull to a hull with a warning sign. So I am getting ideas as I go and you all helping me by throwing out ideas is defiantly helping! For the generator, I am thinking of having an animated part that spins outside of the 2x1 hull piece a little bit. The idea here is to have just SOMETHING on it that is doing something because really a generator house is mostly going to just have a big huge electric motor in it that is being spun by a turbine to create electricity instead of consume it. But I will think of something interesting, I promise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh right, wasn\u0027t even thinking of KSPI, I was just thinking of it as a generator in general. In that case what you\u0027ve got makes perfect sense. I was thinking the glowing could be rationalized as hot metal or something - it\u0027s pretty illogical, really, since a radiator would be something that PREVENTS things from glowing hot red, but mostly I just thought it would look neat - whatever you decide on will be cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T08:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ accidental: yeah the funny thing about making done things is the realization that in reality functionality trumps form... I guess that\u0027s the appeal of Victorian era steam punk, it\u0027s pretty and highly functional in the realms of better steam tech. I mean if this was like a steam powered nuclear reactor there would be tons of wacky bits and glowing bits.... steam punk in space.... that\u0027s a band, a game, and a movie name all rolled into one... anyway that\u0027s how out would look neat, or if it lacked a containment unit it would be filled with a bunch of neat things but it would irradiate everything near it in a very bad way\u0027 and that isn\u0027t good.
