I put a small 0.9375 or 1.25m Probe core with identical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank and 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports (2 Identical Docking ports) on the Front of whatever module I am getting to the station.   I dock with it attached.   Make certain everything is stable, Un-dock and Back out.  Separate the baby probe, and then with just the Aft-half of the tug, re-dock.   I end up with a less complex 2 part tug rather than having to install something like IR (as Jimbodiah has done.)   Sure it is a few steps... But I don\u0027t have to worry too much about balance and the same tug setup works for all the station modules or fuel tanks I want to deploy.  Most of my tugs have been based on a SSTU 1.25m-x-0.5 front tank with 2x 1.25m DP-01 docking ports and SSTU or RLA 5x \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports (x4)   4 tiny Pioneer Solar panels from BDB complete the front half of the Tug.   The Rear half is often the BDB/ETS Aardvark Tug with the SSTU 1.25m DP-01 port.    Most of my lateral docking ports are 0.9375m instead of the 1.25m (I re-scaled the DP-01 to do this.)   Most ships I dock with my space station end up with a 0.9375m Nose connection.  This includes the Aardvark Resupply vehicle, Apollo Blk III/IV/and V and Agena based probes and resupply vessels.      \n\nMy stations tend to be based on the DOS/TKS group of parts.

Other than adding a Tank/Structural fuselage part with a docking port on each end to dock the Shuttle (or SpaceX Dragon with it\u0027s 90degree port cover... etc etc etc)  Is there a suggestion to allow a space-plane to dock with the COS/DOS parts?  I am having too many collisions due to the docking port on the station being nearly flush and the space-plane/shuttles are RECESSED.

Alternatively you can take an MFT-A tank, set it to Stuctural (no resource) and clip it into the station to make a passageway/tube with the port at the end. This is basically a radialy attached structural part then, but can come in very handy if you need to stretch out further than the port-extention will go. \n\n![sstu_radial_01.jpg](http://jimbodiah.com/ksp/sstu/sstu_radial_01.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-11T23:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2018 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-11T23:41:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My stations tend to be based on the DOS/TKS group of parts.

But it\u0027s been rattling around in my head and I need to get it out so..... You mentioned a few posts back that fuel tanks are basically simply because all their available volume is basically used for fuel.  Crew components like space stations, on the other hand, are more complicated because the available volume isn\u0027t all used for one thing.  So that got me thinking.  There are basically 4 things that use a station parts volume: Crew Tube, Equipment, Habitation and Storage.  I figure, for the most part, everything you might find in a space station will fit into one of those four areas.\n\nThe \u0022Crew Tube\u0022 is easy.  You\u0027d have a \u0022shaft\u0022 of empty space running down the length of the station part so that crew could move from one end of the part to another, and access most everything in the part.  The \u0022Crew Tube\u0022 would have a \u0022static\u0022 diameter set in the cfg file just like the top/core/bottom diameter of the part.  So as an example, if we look at SSTU-ST-COS-M\\* with a 4.5m diameter and 6.1m length, we\u0027d have 72.38 m3 of usable volume (91.23 from the part - 18.85 for a 2m diameter x 6m long \u0022Crew Tube\u0022 leaves 72.38 m3).  It would also have a bass mass of a similarly sized, service module style fuel tank and a 0 CrewCapacity.\n\nThe last three (Equipment, Habitation and Storage) would be set in game as you\u0027re building the part  \n\nYou\u0027d use a slider for Equipment which represents everything from lab equipment, control stations, guidance computers, exercise equipment, etc.  For every kg of equipment you add with the slider, you use up some portion of the usable volume (0.005 m3 / kg, for example).   \n\nYou\u0027d also use a slider for Habitation which represents sleeping \u0022quarters\u0022, living space, lavatories, dining space, etc.  This slider would add CrewCapacity in exchange for usable volume.  For every CrewCapacity you add to the part, you use up 5m3 (for example) of usable space.  \n\nWhatever usable space is left after setting the Equipment and Habitation sliders would be Storage (i.e., fuel, life support supplies, etc). \n\nIn this way you could use the same part to recreate the Unity, Harmony and Tranquility modules of the ISS.  All are basically the same size but each had very different internal setups.  Unity is basically all equipment with some storage.  Harmony has crew \u0022quarters\u0022 with some equipment and some storage.  Tranquility as some habitation space with a fair bit of equipment but lots of storage.  You could also use the same parts to recreate Mir and ISS components like Kvant-2 from Mir which had lots of equipment and Zarya from ISS which had lots of storage.\n\nI\u0027m assuming the hardest part would be getting the two sliders to work together.  If you set the Equipment slider to 100%, you couldn\u0027t have any Habitation space, for example.\n\n\\*I\u0027m using basically real world scaled parts.  I\u0027m assuming you would have started there, then scaled things down for Kerbal size.  I\u0027m also assuming that 0.1m is used for the \u0022skin\u0022 of the module.  So if SSTU-ST-COS-M has 4.5m diameter x 6.1m length dimensions, then volume would be calculated based on a 4.4m diameter x 6.0m length.  Finally, I\u0027m basing my measurements on the core part with no caps.  Any caps you add would follow the same rules as the core but it was simpler to example this way."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T18:01:07Z","Content":"The current stations parts consist of a hab space and built in equipment.

However, from my viewpoint it appears to be an Awful lot of work that requires some specific standard that doesn\u0027t exist anywhere in game or the Real world for that matter (Mass vs Volume trade off ratio.)   If Shadowmage were to put the (and I am ball-parking this here) 100\u0027s of hours of effort into a coding change for it, everyone would pipe in \u0022But Experiment X doesn\u0027t mass that much,\u0022   \u0022I loose too much/too little volume when I slide the slider,\u0022  and my favorite \u0022But this part is made out of Unobtainium-57 which has a much lower SFG than standard CrazyOnesStructuralAlloy so my station part should have a lower empty mass\u0022 (ok so the alloy names are made up by me but you get my drift right?) \n\nSo to simplify what I am saying (and hopefully this will give you a different viewpoint to think from for your ideas,)  There is no way to standardize a mass-volume conversion that would leave most people even content (let alone keep more than a few people happy.)   There would be a lot of work to make just a few people happy and the rest of the players not to want to use the parts at all (in my opinion.)
