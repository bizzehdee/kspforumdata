If you want to cut memory usage just delete one of the planet systems the mods ads, or particular planets.

Also made Mana\u0027s oceans light up on the night side.\n- Remade other moons of Keelon so they look a lot more stockalike and cool.\n- Modified Corolet and other dwarf planets textures. Corolet now is a smooth blue comet.
