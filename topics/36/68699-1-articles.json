Sure they\u0027re useful for other things, but for gently curving surfaces, domes, meteoroid shields, etc. they don\u0027t tessellate well at all. So I created a hexagonal version. It\u0027s about the same size and has pretty much the same properties, but it lends itself a lot better to this kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

This is a small surface-mounted engine that functions as an RCS thruster (including SAS functionality), but uses Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer the same way normal rocket engines do, allowing it to take advantage of a much higher thrust and specific impulse as well as not require special fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOWNLOAD: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/HexPlate%20and%20RCSEngine.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/HexPlate%20and%20RCSEngine.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T22:38:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to complain, but your bipropellant rcs thruster can run if it has just liquid fuel or oxidizer, and thus is kinda overpowered if you have a spaceplane that makes orbit ether fuel heavy or oxidizer heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the only way to fix this would be using a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAO","CreatedById":30795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis it possible to have the shunting engine have the fx and sfx of a normal engine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T00:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ Only with a plugin.
