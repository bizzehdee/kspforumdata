Also, why does the part name have spaces in it? I\u0027m pretty sure that will prevent modulemanager patches from being applied to it, which could be an issue.\n\nUps.... Well that\u0027s fixed now =P\n\n\u003E \n\u003E maccollo, here\u0027s a PDF for help with the Exploration Upper Stage. I love me some PDF files so here\u0027s one that pretty much gives the dimensions for the EUS. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E [http://www.spacepropulsion.org/uploads/2/5/3/9/25392309/spaceaccess2014-25.pdf](http://www.spacepropulsion.org/uploads/2/5/3/9/25392309/spaceaccess2014-25.pdf)\n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re doing a great job so far!\n\nNice! I was actually going to move on to the upper stage nex. The RO core engine works fine at the moment. It\u0027s the upper stage that\u0027s really missing from the package now, and I\u0027m going straight for the EUS, not that puny under-powered ICPS. Who in their right mind puts a 30 tonne upper stage on top of a core that\u0027s over 1000 tonnes XD?\n\nAnyway, I released update 0.2 with the core stage, so you guys can have a look at it if you want to. One little interesting result from having the hydrogen and the oxygen tanks seperate is that thing rocket is really, really easy to fly. You have to try really hard to flip it over!\n\n\\*edit\n\nCurrently the tanks have no resource, only realfuels tank definitions, so they wont work without realfuels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T16:08:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T16:01:00Z","Content":"Cool, I\u0027ll try it out! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOh, and if you want to offset the Center of Mass, you can use the following parameter in the part.cfg: \n\nCoMoffset = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 where the 2nd 0.0 is the height.
