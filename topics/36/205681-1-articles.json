The science containers have a \u0022collect all\u0022 function but no way to move particular items out of the container. It\u0027s a science black hole. It would be nice to have a mod to remove one item (I\u0027d call it \u0022science popper\u0022) but it probably wouldn\u0027t be easy to add a button on the science review window. An simpler way would be to add a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E function to collect science only from sensors and crewed modules - anything that does not have a \u0022collect all\u0022 function itself.\u00A0 Or just modify the stock \u0022collect all\u0022 this way. Then there would be zero UI changes. There\u0027s already a transfer function, so the stock collect all function isn\u0027t needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-21T11:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried working with Ship Manifest?
