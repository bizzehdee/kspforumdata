If no - maybe You should try? ;-) I have no personal experience with their team so far, but my vast IT experience kinda makes me ask this question.\n\nICPS - should- have two upper nodes; the far-upper one is intended for use by non Orion stuff.. it generates an auto-fairing. The lower of the top nodes, which is slightly inside the geometry, is intended to be used with the MSA adapter. It should also have two bottom nodes (with auto fairings); one for 3.75m fairing, and one for 5m fairing.\n\nSame thing with the CM; it should have two bottom nodes. The lowest one comes with an auto-fairing, and is intended for use on other 3.75m stacks. The internal one is intended for use on the SM. -- I couldn\u0027t really find any better way to deal with allowing multiple configurations for these pieces; it was either add double nodes and allow player choice that way, or duplicate (quadruple?) the pieces to accomodate every option.\n\nRegarding bugging Squad to fix their stock bugs -- from my previous experiences with attempting to get bugs fixed in games that only effect mods, I\u0027m going to pass. Coming from Minecraft modding, we created an entirely community driven API and series of stock-bug-fixes, as the devs were unwilling (or unable) to make an API or fix the bugs themselves (see Minecraft Forge). It really sucks that companies that advertise the modability (heck, they have an Add-Ons link on the main game menu!) of their games so heavily are so unwilling to fix problems in their code to help out the modders that help sell their games. However, from a developer standpoint, \u0027if it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it\u0027 is the general rule; and if it works in stock/vanilla, they generally don\u0027t consider it broken and are unwilling to devote developer resources to fix problems that only effect external mods (even if it is a legitimate problem and easy to fix, such as the animation layering). Squad -might- be better in this respect; but still likely a waste of my time to try and have them fix their bugs.\n\nRe- Orion interior; Yep, I already have every image that I could find on the web (especially that one... was one of the best images that I could find of the controls). If you note the cockpit panels from the IVA preview screenshots, they are eerily similar to those in the image \\_Augustus\\_ has posted (minus the MFD panels.... which are present now, but did not make it into those screenshots). I went for \u0027close\u0027 rather than mimic the real one exactly; as I needed it to still be usable, hence it needed things like altimeter and speed gauges that the real controls do not have (theirs are all done through the MFD panels... which will be non-functional in the stock IVA); and the real layout is still under development as near as I can tell.\n\nThe current MFDs I have now are just a placeholder / blank display... no image or interactivity, and will probably stay there for the \u0027stock\u0027 IVA. I will investigate adding in RPM or other more interactive props for alternative IVA setups.

So.... hopefully will be able to add USI-LS to the list of supported (recommended?) mods soon. (And hopefully I\u0027ll finally be able to add it into my game... been holding off on bases and stations for weeks now).\n\u003E \n\u003E ...enough rambling from me... back to work....\n\n Sweet! The IVA was quite usable.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe my humble ISTQB FL can be put to use wih that activity too? :-D \n\u003E Do You have a test plan, or at least some description of what it consists of (so I can deduce what needs to be tested and how)? \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I wonder if retro-rockets can be added to Ariane V side booster, that is, P241. I don\u0027t know if it has them and what are their parameters, but if I\u0027ll hear \u0022yes\u0022, I\u0027ll try to dig that info up (can be tough - that\u0027s no NASA).\n\n Hmm. Retrorockets. Thinking must be done about that."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:38:30Z","Content":"Few updated renders of WIP stuff (scroll past the IVA previews...):\n\nUpdated previews of upcoming Lander Core part stuff; still -very- early in the development phase...

A single one (or small cluster for larger pods) can be used as part of a pod-only ascent stage, but there will also be engine clusters made specifically for each of the Lander Core sizes (2.5 - 4 engines, 3.75 - 8 engines, 5m - 12/16 engines (tbd)).\n\nI will see about packing up a **testing** release of the CM-IVA and SM-Solar Panel module later this evening.

It is a slight performance hit compared to a static interpolated module, but is likely still more optimized than running the 4x stock modules that the part currently uses. And the part count saved compared to a stock vessel still far outweigh the minor hit from the procedural drag cubes.\n\nOn another (semi) good note; I have a few ideas regarding setting up the SCA adapter to properly shield the SM from the airstream. It would require writing another plugin/expanding the SSTUTools plugin, and the SCA would require a custom module -- but it would likely make the whole stack a bit easier to launch (less top-end drag is always good). Could likely apply a similar concept / module to the BPC to shield the CM from airstream on ascent and give some non-hardcore-game purpose to that part.\n\nWill likely be working on the LifeSupport fix over the weekend, more dev work on the Lander Core stuff, as well as doing a bit of playing/testing (hopefully...busy week next week, and tons of r/l stuff to do this weekend as well...).\n\nI\u0027ll be heading out on vacation later next week (wed/thurs or so), so I will try to have the IVA and solar panel stuff all wrapped up for public release before then. So, this weekend will be an excellent time for testing, as it will give me a few days to fix up and re-test before it is needed to be finished. Of course, if it is still horribly broken I will hold off on public release until after I return from vacation; not a fan of rush-released stuff from others, and don\u0027t really want to contribute to that problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:30:59Z","Content":"Updated test release of SC-B stuff;\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/SSTU-Dev-06-12-15](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/SSTU-Dev-06-12-15)\n\nPlease let me know if you run into any issues regarding the solar-panels (or IVA).
