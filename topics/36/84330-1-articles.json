This is truly a wonderful looking ship. However I have to agree with the consensus thus far it does look a little too big. I don\u0027t know if its the pictures and the angles you have chosen but, from what I have seen it looks too big. The other thing I recommend is adding little things to the outside to make it pop. Some textures, logos, greeblys (little non useful things and pieces) to add accent and scale. The textures look a little too plain right now. I understand this is a WIP progress and I apologize if you have more planned. However like I said this looks wonderful and I can\u0027t wait to play with. I think what you do need to focus on is the scaling it does seem quite large. If thats what you are going for then leave it exactly the way it is.
