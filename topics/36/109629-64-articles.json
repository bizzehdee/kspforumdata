I need to edit it in the modeling program but have been so busy.\n\nAerodynamics have been tricky and has been the biggest issue here.\n\nIt has been modified so much to correct it and I feel it is mostly ok.\n\nIn order to get it right we can do 2 things.\n\nI can make a patch which modifies its aero. My best guess.\n\nthis means downloading patches and getting feedback from users for a better new version. \n\nOr if you are willing you can adjust it to how you think it should be or what works better.\n\nthats if you are willing to edit the configuration text file.\n\nI usually dont have much time to actually play ksp unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T08:39:54Z","Content":"Aerodynamics have actually been really good if you ask me. I haven\u0027t run into too many issues except the inability to roll or yaw much during launch without veering way off course. And while I have to agree with Stevehead on the approach and landings being a bit difficult since the shuttle bleeds off so much speed, the two things I mentioned aren\u0027t major issues for me. I\u0027m just really glad I can use the Shuttle to do awesome things like this:![WShfbbz.png](http://i.imgur.com/WShfbbz.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicy Larry","CreatedById":148876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T13:53:56Z","Content":"Just downloaded this mod and it\u0027s great but i have no option to open and close the cargo bay doors of the space shuttle is anyone else having this problem?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:43:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just downloaded this mod and it\u0027s great but i have no option to open and close the cargo bay doors of the space shuttle is anyone else having this problem?\n\nHi there.\n\nmake sure you have firespitter mod installed.\n\nI included a small file size version with the mod.\n\nThis controls some of the animations."}]}
