I\u0027ve been trying to do some playing in my free time over the last week or so and I\u0027ve managed to build a station which now crashes the game 100% of the time as soon as it enters physics range when I try to rendezvous with it, something that has made me quite angry at the memory issues of this game. I really need to try and figure out why my install remains so heavy on memory usage, as it would seem that LOD \u002B ATM on aggressive, while a great improvement, are still at the mercy of some other memory hog that is keeping me running on the edge of stability at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you may be on to something when you suggested it might be non-part textures, as temporarily removing RSS from my install cut about 300-400 MB out of both the working and commit memory allocations. That being said, I got a similar, though smaller improvement upon removing FASA, which should be almost completely managed by LOD, leaving me to wonder if there is an issue with sheer part count rather than just textures. In addition to this, it seems that highly complex models have a tendency to eat up memory quite rapidly, leading me back to the idea that part models may be an issue as well. The FusTek parts, for example, add about 300MB of used memory when you add one, but then if you delete it and add it again, it actually adds \u003Cstrong\u003Eanother\u003C/strong\u003E 150-300 MB, leading to a situation where I\u0027ve been able to crash the game in the VAB with a high degree of replicability just by adding and deleting the same station part several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also has me wondering if IVA textures are controlled by LOD. FASA has several highly detailed IVAs so if their component parts are not managed by LOD, that may also explain some of the memory use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027m finding quite odd relating to what I\u0027ve said above, is that often parts in the game will generate much more memory use than their models and textures should. Again using FusTek as an example, though this applies to FASA, KWRocketry, and many other mods, the actual folder for the entire mod is only 12MB, but then using even a single part in the game garners memory use of as much as 300MB. This can\u0027t possibly be a texture issue, so where else could all of that extra memory be coming from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Sorry for the rambling post, I\u0027m a little tired and a lot frustrated right now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Going back and testing on my dev install which has far fewer mods has shown me that this issue is neither with LOD nor with FusTek in the examples above, but rather somewhere else. On that smaller install, I can add / remove the parts many times without issue. Short of going in and testing each mod in my install, is there any way to figure out where things are going wrong from the logs?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-13T16:13:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2014 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T16:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beetlecat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beetlecat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EConfirming this is still in 3.1 -- curious, the ALCOR uses pngs for the IVA graphics.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI converted the ALCOR textures to tga and it fixed the black parts.
