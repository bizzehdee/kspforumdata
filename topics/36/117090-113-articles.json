The primary fuel/rcs/battery split on the SSTU parts is already pretty good, and UI\\_ChooseOption actually makes switching a large number of options quite easy and usable.\n\u003E \n\n1.)  Resources available in any specific part will be able to be setup in any number of ways;  you can add specific resources at the config level, or add entire sets of resources at the config level, or specify it as \u0027generic\u0027 where it will have access to all pumpable resources.  So if a specific container might be intended for \u0027dry\u0027 goods only this will be doable.  There will be pre-configured \u0027resource sets\u0027 that cover the majority of cases (dry goods, fuels, liquids, construction stuff?); these are mostly intended as a convenience when setting up a part with many potential resources.  \n\n2.)  Yep, already done (or planned).  See the screenshot on the last page; that is what those fuel type buttons are for.  Only..you can also combine them/customize them.  Want an LFO mix..but then a bit of MP and EC?  simple... press the LFO button and then slide the MP and EC sliders a bit.  Want to pre-fill with proper ratios of TAC-LS supplies?  Simply press the \u0027TAC-LS\u0027 button (or whatever it ends up being called).  Also want some MP in that tank?  Press the MP button (or slide the MP slider); your TAC-LS ratios will not be disturbed.  New fuel types can be added through config nodes and will automatically be added to the GUI for parts where those fuel types are applicable (e.g. their potential resource list contains all resources for the fuel type).  \n\n3.) It will all be ratio based, so the ratio for an LFO preset will not be changed when you add/remove other resources using the sliders or ratio input boxes.  I wan\u0027t to figure out a way so that you can just use the buttons to increase the proportional ratio between various preset types.  Want a 75% HLOX mix and 25% LFO mix?  Hit the LFO button x1, and the HLOX button x3....  and then you can still add some extra EC or MP without disturbing the LFO/HLOX stuff.  \n\n4.) The complexity for 95% of uses will be mitigated by still having the basic \u0027Next Fuel Type\u0027 controls on the basic part right-click menu.  All the old \u0027Fuel Type\u0027 stuff is not going away; you\u0027ll still be able to simply cycle through pre-setup resource groups for common fuel types.  But if you want to open the GUI to customize things?  Well... now you can (or will be able to).  What is changing is that I\u0027m not going to be making up a thousand different resource groups to cover every potential combination of resources.  So if all you want is a fuel tank... very little will be changing on the UI front; there will just be an extra button at the bottom of the GUI you\u0027ll have to ignore (or patch the configs to disable the button)  \n\n5.) This allows for a well defined system for splitting up of a part into separate internal containers that might be applicable to different types of fuels.  For example the MUS parts where a certain percentage of volume is intended to be dedicated for MP and EC.  Currently I hack around this with special code in the MUS module... and it is painful to work with and error prone.  Or perhaps you have a cargo craft that has \u0027dry\u0027 and \u0027wet\u0027 storage areas.  Or a Command Pod with a small bit of integrated storage for various supplies.  \n\n6.) I did mention KIS integration, right?  Yeah.. no way I\u0027m going to try to code that into every single modular part; but if I have a single module that does the interaction?  That I can likely figure out how setup and deal with.\n\nIn the end... I\u0027m not doing this for the users.  I\u0027m doing this to save my sanity when trying to setup various \u0027utility\u0027 type containers (e.g. the SC-C-SMX).  I\u0027ve struggled for three weeks to think up what kind of resource swapping I wanted on it for the default distribution.  No single set of resources would be \u0027perfect\u0027 for every need; nor could I potentially plan out pre-set resource sets that would be perfect for every need;  nor do I even know what my \u0027needs\u0027 are (no clue what mod-set I\u0027ll be playing with next or what resources it will use); the only way to do it is to let the user select their resources from -all- of the resources available.  If all I were ever planning on doing was more fuel tanks... the existing system works fine for those.  But I have lots more plans than just fuel tanks.  This also saves me from duplicating all of the resource handling / fuel type handling code in every module that I write, giving me a nice unified interface for all \u0027modular\u0027 parts that deal with resources.  This will be needed with the upcoming module and model-switch enabled parts, and is what is going to enable the LC-POD parts to be added back into the mod.\n\nAnd as usual, this will all be config driven so you can further customize the presets, fuel types, resource-sets, container types... everything.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E in MFT/RF/RO you literally need to put a engine under a tank, then right click on the tank and click a button to auto-fill, I fail to see why it is complicated... the only complicated parts I see are the realism parts (ullage, ignitions, locked thrust etc... which mage said he wouldn\u0027t include) and the GUI if you want to put anything other than fuel for the engines (although it is pretty easy to get used to)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E even if you want to split as in your example, 95% LFO and 5% Mono, you can set in the GUI the 5% mono manually (math needed) and then right click on the tank to fill the remainder 95% volume with LFO  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I do however think that if the GUI allows for setting a percentage and a specific value that would be pretty neat, like, I could set manually 1k MMH and 1k NTO, or set it automatically to 2, 5, 10, 17 or 25% of the tank volume for MMH and NTO  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: now that I looked closer at the pic (my monitor is 2m away from my face) I see that the percentage option is already there, sweet (but a option for a specific ammount could be useful ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022))\n\u003E \n\nWell, there will be no \u0027auto fill\u0027 button.  You will need to use the \u0027Fuel Type\u0027 buttons (either in the part menu or the resource GUI), which will do the same thing.  I\u0027m not going to mess with trying to figure out what engine it is supposedly attached to (fuel flow logic is fubar\u0027d and I\u0027m not going to try to decipher it), and this feature doesn\u0027t make as much sense when there is only a single ratio per fuel type;  I\u0027m not trying to replace or duplicate RF.  This doesn\u0027t preclude one being added in the future, but it certainly will not be there for the initial releases.\n\nNo, there likely will not be any controls for specific \u0027units\u0027 of fuels.  Or at least I haven\u0027t thought of a way to allow that to work with the ratio based setup (would like to have a \u0027units\u0027 input box as well... but unsure how to decompose that back into a ratio cleanly)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T17:09:38Z","Content":"Sounds good.\n\nI was a bit worry about the new interface.
