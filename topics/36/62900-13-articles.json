By default nodes take 1 day per 2 science that they are worth (I wanted it to take time, but still be somewhat short, since vessel build times are also pretty short). You can upgrade the rate like you can for normal build rates (I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve actually discussed that yet on here, but next update lets you upgrade build rates and buy additional rates to build more ships at once). The node unlock rate is exponential, following a 1 day per (2^(upgrades\u002B1)) science pattern, meaning 2 with no upgrades, 4 with one, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 etc. I will likely add some more control over the rate in later updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlocking them is a little weird because of game limitations. When you unlock a node you get an upgrade point to spend and the amount of days it will take for the node to become available is displayed. The node itself will appear as if it is unlocked already and further nodes can be unlocked. When you reopen the R\u0026amp;D screen all of the in-progress nodes will appear locked again until KCT actually unlocks them. If you rebuy the node it will take the science and give a message saying that the node is already being researched and will return the science. Because the screen doesn\u0027t update, it won\u0027t appear as if the science was returned, but closing/reopening the screen or buying another node will make it evident that it was returned. You can use this to research nodes that are dependent on the node currently being researched though. Currently all in progress nodes research at the same time and same rate. It doesn\u0027t care about dependencies (but may in the future, requiring that all prerequisite nodes are fully researched before adding progress to further nodes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that pretty much fully explains how they work in the current implementation. Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions about this or any other features, either already released or in-progress \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T16:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does have a minor safeguard as they start in order they are clicked, so even if only by a second the first tech should unlock first.

Download link is in the OP. The changelog is pretty non-trivial (aka, the largest it has ever been for a single release, though the PR4 series had a lot of changes overall) so I\u0027ll try to break it down into smaller sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary focus of this update is enhancements to the build list, the biggest of which is the ability to upgrade build rates (now measured in Build Points per second, BP/s) to build ships faster and to unlock additional build rates. In career mode you unlock Upgrade Points every time you unlock a tech node or you can buy them for 250 science (the tech node option is cheaper until the very end, the separate purchase option is intended for after the tech tree is complete). In Sandbox you start with a default of 30 upgrades (the tech tree will give you 44 in stock, so it\u0027s mid to late game) but you can change this number in the Settings (there\u0027s two options, in the game settings section you can change the number for the current game, in the global settings you can change the default amount for new sandbox games)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrading is done through the Upgrades screen, accessible from the Build List while in the Space Center scene ONLY. This has three tabs: VAB, SPH, and R\u0026amp;D (or just VAB and SPH in sandbox mode). In VAB or SPH mode you will see all of the rates listed and if you can upgrade any of the rates a button will appear with the amount the rate will change when spending an upgrade point. This goes from 0.05BP/s per point and increases for later rates (0.1BP/s, 0.15BP/s, etc) because secondary rates are not as useful as a really fast primary rate. Secondary rates cannot be increased faster than the next highest rate (rate 2 can\u0027t be higher than rate 1, rate 3 can\u0027t be higher than rate 2, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional rates can be unlocked this way, allowing you to build multiple ships at once. By default the primary rate is 1 BP/s and the second rate is 0 BP/s. Upgrading the second rate to 0.10 BP/s will cause a new rate (Rate 3) to appear at 0 BP/s. Once Rate 2 is upgraded to 0.2 BP/s, Rate 3 can be upgraded to 0.15 BP/s (and thus three ships can be built at the same time). This sort of unlocking of additional rates can proceed onward to, essentially, forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe R\u0026amp;D tab contains only two things that you can spend points on, Research (science earned from building ships) and Development (how quickly tech nodes are unlocked). By default, Research is at 0 science per 86400 build points (1 day at 1 BP/s) and increases by 0.5 science/86400 BP with each upgrade (linearly). This feature is OPTIONAL and can be not used by simply not upgrading it. Development starts out at 1 day per 2 science points the tech node is worth (for a fairly in depth description of how tech node unlocking works, please see the previous page of this thread). The rate is exponentially related to the number of upgrades (1 day per 2^(upgrades\u002B1) science, aka 1 per 2, 1 per 4, 1 per 8, 1 per 16, and so on). This feature is also optional and can be disabled globally in the settings. Any in progress tech nodes can be viewed in the Tech section of the Build List and you can warp to complete with tech nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe build list itself has seen several improvements, visually and functionally, in order to work with the new build rates. Times are given for the current rate and estimated times at 1BP/s are given if ships aren\u0027t building. A new * button opens up a smaller window next to the build list which contains advanced functions, such as Scrap the current ship, Rename, and Duplicate. View is currently non-functional and will only change the scene to the correct editor. I\u0027ll get that working for next full release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA major change that may not become obvious is that the ghost ships have been removed as I have written my own loading code, so ships aren\u0027t preloaded in the space center. Supposedly this has made the mod run much smoother, according to one bug tester.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a majority of the new features, check the changelog for a more comprehensive list of everything changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBugfixes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed the bug that made the tracking station go haywire, thanks to Kalista.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed how parts were being tracked, so only once per vessel now like I had intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed bug with launching from tracking station not removing the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed bug with Warp to Complete and low orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to thank JeffreyCor and Kalista for doing bug testing throughout this release.
