Find the repo to be forked on GitHub.  ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs) )  \n\n2.)  Click the \u0027Fork\u0027 button in the top right.  It will create a fork under your user-name/account.  ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs#fork-destination-box](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs#fork-destination-box) )  \n\n3.)  Create a new branch for your PR.  This is done by clicking on the \u0027branch\u0027 dropdown and typing in a new name.  \n\n4.)  Select your new PR branch as the active branch using that same dropdown.  \n\n5.)  Browse through the repository in the browser and edit files as needed.  \n\n6.)  When done making edits hit the \u0027New Pull Request\u0027 button (next to the branch dropdown).  Once done with this screen the PR will be sent to the parent repo of the fork.  \n\n7.)  If you then need to make more edits to your PR, select the branch of your fork, and make new edits.  They will automatically be added to the PR.\n\nThe forking step might need to be redone after each update to the parent repository -- I\u0027m not sure how to synch forks through the website API.  So after your PR is accepted you may need to delete your fork and re-create it for the next PR.\n\n(Most of those steps are a bit easier when using the local version of Git, but there are some features that are simply not supported through the web-api)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Was this a planed thing to make the inflatable HABs dependent on \u0022rocket parts\u0022 ..because im reading through the past pages and i cant find anything about it.

They have been like that for several months (requiring RocketParts as a resource for in-flight inflation.\n\nAs was pointed out this is used as a \u0027kit-out\u0027 mechanic, lowering the amount of mass the part has at launch time but requiring extra infrastructure to bring the module fully online.\n\n-- Thinking on it, this might be another good option for the in-game settings.  Toggle to change between requiring resources for inflatable module setup or allowing inflate/deflate at any time.  If enabled the same mechanics would be used as are currently seen; if disabled the modules would have a constant mass, be inflatable/deflatable at any time, and would not require additional kit-out resources, but would be at their maximum mass even during initial launch."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T17:33:15Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give that a go tonight (github glop).\n\nI originally included a in in the description about the tonnage of rocket parts needed to \u0022fit out\u0022 the interior for use.

The \u0022Nose\u0022 selections don not, however, include any of the, well, nose parts---meaning none of the streamlined parts you might use for radially mounted booster tanks. The \u0022Mount\u0022 options include those parts that you\u0027d generally think of as nose parts (nosecones, basically). If the nosecones are meant to only be on one side, I\u0027d assume the Nose would be the right side.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was going to post a github issue on an odd \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E thing, but it seems to have self-resolved. I will wait until I can replicate it for a github. What happened was that the HAB parts were all showing translucent on the inflatable part of the part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. They were fine when launched---then fine after returning to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they showed as properly opaque. I will try later (leaving soon for dinner), and see if it happens again before posting to github.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The ratio adapters are nice to have. 1:2 seems like it might not be super useful for 2.5m parts, the 2:3 (up by 1.5X) seems like what you\u0027d mostly use for 2.5m parts, since the only 5m parts (1:2) would be tanks... of course we haven\u0027t seen where you are going WRT huge tori ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) . Only posting this observation in case you decide to pear down options based on size. 1.25m parts would obviously nicely scale 2X to 2.5m, but 2.5m needs the 1.5X scale up (3:2) for 3.75 where the other hab parts all live far more than 2X.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another part-sorting observation. The stock MPL is under category = Science, once more finalized, is that where the COS and DOS lab parts will reside? The stock hab part is in category = Utility as well, so to match the hab parts would go there I guess... here is observation/discussion bit: seems like some more of your station parts should have the same \u0022probe core\u0022 functionality as the command pods and DOS parts. I would add \u0022Command\u0022 to the HAB-B/C 1 and 2 parts as you have for the DOS (they have solar and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, after all, they seem self-controlling).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is a *great* update!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have seen the transparency in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but not after launch. Also, the inflatables require \u0022rocket parts\u0022 to inflate. This is to represent the need for supplies to \u0022fit out\u0022 the interior. So if you inflated them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, then they launch inflated. If you want to inflate after launch, attach a tank where you have used \u0022configure containers\u0022 to add rocket parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Note: It might be nice to add Rocket Parts as a standard choice (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, EC, MP, etc) for Fuel type in the MFT tanks and COS parts.\n\u003E \n\nHAB transparency in editor -- known issue.  Not quite sure what is causing it, only happens on non-root parts when pulled from the editor part list (alt-click cloned parts do not exhibit it, and it goes away on return-to-editor / revert).  Likely going to need to add some additional cleanup on the textures/material setup for those parts / modules.\n\nNose modules -- not sure where you are going with that.  What parts are lacking \u0027nose\u0027 options?  Pretty sure the MFT-A should have all of the nosecones as \u0027nose\u0027 options.\n\nAdapter ratios -- if you see any specific parts/options that were missed, please let me know ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  The StationCore modules should be fairly well situated with adapters though (should all have the proper ratios for their top/bottom diameters).  The MFT parts are a bit less filled out, but should have most options on them.\n\nCategories -- I would prefer to keep all of the ST modules in the same category; sadly stock lacks anything suitable for \u0027station modules\u0027 in general.  So, yeah, will likely be moving them around a bit (though not until I\u0027m done testing things; I hate hunting through part categories for stuff, is why everything defaults to the \u0027Pods\u0027 category when I make new parts).\n\nRP as a fuel type -- Really not fond of adding single-resource \u0027fuel types\u0027.  The fuel types are supposed to be reserved for fuel combinations with specific ratios or commonly used fuel types.  Single resources are simple enough to add thorugh the GUI.  That is, after all, why I created the \u0027customize container\u0027 GUI and handling system.  I\u0027ll give it some thought though, might be a decent change.  Will probably have to wait and see how often I need to use RocketParts/etc during my next playthrough.  Either way, simple enough to add/change if/when deemed necessary.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I just threw this together so I could remember what parts held what numbers of crew:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-A1: 4 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-A2: 6 crew\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-B1: 6 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-B2: 9 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-B3: 6 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-B4: 9 crew\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-C1: 12 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-C2: 18 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-C3: 12 crew  \n\u003E \n\u003E HAB-C4: 18 crew\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I also wrote sample HAB boilerplate descriptions, as a model for what should be put there, since the other stats are auto-populated by presumably cfg values, and the crew doesn\u0027t show up (since it\u0027s not crewed until deployed).

It should already have two fairings -- the \u0027side panels\u0027 which cover up the solar panels and can be ejected manually, and a set of lower fairings which connect the SM to the stage below it which are only ejected when the SM decouples from the stage.  So you should be able to \u0027disable side panels\u0027 on the SM, deploy the solar panels, and it should keep the lower fairings/mounts (as seen in my forum avatar; the side-panels are removed, but the lower fairing is still in place).  The lower diameter on the fairing should even be adjustable for use with different lower stages.\n\nWhat you are suggesting is -theoretically- possible.  However it would require finding some sort of expert at procedural mesh generation -- just getting flat/cylindrical panel geometry generated was hard enough, no way I would want to try and make any sort of truss arrangement procedurally."}]}
