Yes a mm patch would be all good if too big.\n\nAlso I will be uploading my 1.7 today with enterprise. It has no rcs or the other features lile the others and has a engine cover\n\nThe landing gear I hvaent found a way to make it one way but I can make it have a time delay of something huge.\n\nDo you have blender? That way you can open the centuar and the orbiter and see if they fit in eachother\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E i don\u0027t know just make it have the more bright colours and such and it will be fine ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI will work on it...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![YDXaTos.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YDXaTos.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"PatrickTeu","CreatedById":145601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:05:40Z","Content":"I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m so excited!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:38:34Z","Content":"This mod just keeps getting better and better!
