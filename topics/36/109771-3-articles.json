If not, are you planning on integrating it with Karbonite at all?\n\nWhy would this be integrated with Karbonite? Kethane/Karbonite/Karborundum/Ore are all fantasy resources, magical unicorn poop as it were, and do not fit into a \u0022Real\u0022 system. I\u0027m assuming the stock scanning system can handle pretty much everything we need plus we get the benefit of doing this in Real Solar System, so resources will be where you expect them (water ice on Mars\u0027 poles, atmospheres will have the correct percentages of resources, etc...) Furthermore, most ISRU concepts harvest resources from a planetary atmosphere since those resources are *much* easier to access, don\u0027t require nearly as much processing and equipment, and don\u0027t require literal strip-mining to achieve anything substantial. In other words, resources scanners are pretty useless.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t neglect the stock, please. Kerbol system is quite playable with FAR, RT, RF while RSS seems to be always under construction.\n\nMy problem with the stock system is that any resource definitions are up for interpretation and will vary widely. For instance, I don\u0027t think Laythe should have atmospheric oxygen at all, much less an ocean; the only reason it does, IMO, is to give people another place to fly planes and do wacky Kerbin things off Kerbin. However, the main point of contention is probably Laythe, and possibly Eve, most of the other planets will be pretty easy to come to a consensus on and should be easy to include.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So... You are about implementing PSA/VPSA units? They look almost the same except for not being able to output liquified gases.\n\u003E [http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html](http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E Molecular sieve membranes (filters) on the other hand, despite being much lighter, are not the way to go for ISRU systems due to their limited life cycle.\n\ntbh I haven\u0027t really looked into it but I assumed there would be some way to separate the cryogenic process from the extraction process. Thank you for the reading material.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yep. Though I wouldn\u0027t call C-class \u0022water-rich\u0022. They have SOME and that\u0027s much better than nothing. Abusing C-class asteroids for fuel will call for implementation of CO\u002BO2 engines IRL, as carbon is much more abundant in them than hydrogen/water (oxygen is plentiful in ANY type of asteroids).\n\nRight, just saying it\u0027ll be easier to stick with C-type asteroids to begin with.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just give me some descriptions or sketches or photos of what it should look like. Modelling is comparatively fast and easy... what can\u0027t be told about texturing...\n\nI imagine most of the parts will be made to fit inside service bays or cargo holds, but in general radial parts that wouldn\u0027t look too out of place tucked somewhere on the spacecraft would be fine. I think this will have to wait until I/we finalize the part configs and masses.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Blender is recommended. Most sane controls I ever saw in 3D-editors\n\nSorry, Lightwave is much easier and intuitive for me to use. Blender is totally bass-ackwards from what I\u0027m used to and the fact that I can\u0027t simply dot some points and lathe an engine bell is troubling to me (it\u0027s much more of a process in Blender, last time I tried). ofc, I\u0027d use probably use Blender to import and finalize things for KSP, but I haven\u0027t really gotten that far since I don\u0027t model much anymore.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Answer is simple: heat. Exothermic processes produce heat, endothermic processes consume it. Electrolysis is more \u0022physical\u0022 process than \u0022chemical\u0022.\n\nRight, the question is more how does the converter/extractor handle waste heat for a given process. Is it used to continue the reaction, how much escapes, does any get turned into electricity, etc...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hm-m-m... Can Regolith converter heat production values be negative? If they can - it may be used to simulate endothermic reactions.\n\nThe stock system handles heating. I think some code might be in order but it appears to be a linear heat production scale.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a hard one... Stirling engine or thermoelectric generator may use that heat, but only part of. Most heat will just dissipate.\n\u003E A good idea, however... Abusing stock heat conduction mechanics to generate electricity. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYep. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Insanitic","CreatedById":121952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:25:08Z","Content":"I want to help in the development of ISRU for RO and RSS, since I really want something like Karbonite except per reality.

There are three easy ways to do engine bells in Blender I think of immediately:\n\n- vertex-sculpt from cylinder after hollowing it by boolean modifier (fast and easy)\n\n- grow from circle by extruding regions (moderate time and effort)\n\n- twisting curves that should match inner and outer walls (extra fast but you\u0027ll need good imagination... or blueprint)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The stock system handles heating. I think some code might be in order but it appears to be a linear heat production scale.\n\nLinear production is fine IF it can be negative. Endo/Exothermic reactions are pretty linear themself in terms of heat production/consumption per unit of mass reacted. It can be a problem with varible mass and stock system, but we can pretend that reaction chamber is comparatively small and always 100% fed. Then exothermic reaction steadily produce constant amount of heat and endothermic one steadily consume constant amount of heat - fully stock compatible.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E just one suggestion then... please try to avoid silly names as karbonite or kethane for resources.\n\nThat\u0027s the main point people try to write such mod.

There are also plenty of near-future realistic applications for remote sensing of resources such as identifying subsurface water reserves in advance of a potential lunar or martian base (less for drinking and more for fuel production, as I understand it).

Comparing to that Kerbol system is kinda plausible.\n\nHave you met Principia? It\u0027s coming along nicely and should play even better once Unity 5 hits. StupidChris has also found some very interesting things regarding how the Kerbal model is built, we may eventually be able to replace Kerbals with Humans. I probably won\u0027t, I kind of like them, but KSP is well on its way to having a very realistic total conversion in all regards, most especially now that we have more stock systems that actually help rather than hinder. It\u0027s alright, you don\u0027t have to agree with that sentiment, but I do, and staying focused is what moves that total conversion forward."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:53:15Z","Content":"Principia... That would call for development of some VERY powerful ingame instruments to play with. There is absolutely no fun to fight against real n-body physics without MechJeb to help or reworked patched conics calculator at least. A border between playable game and boring scientific project with plenty of calculations is not so wide...\n\nReturning to the previous question. Why do you think that gas giant satellite may not have free oxygen in atmosphere? Ok, for lifeless worlds it\u0027s almost impossible... Ok, Laythe is too far from Kerbol to recieve enough light for photosynthesis... But we are playing with aliens! Alien biology! Why can\u0027t we for example have radiosynthetic algae that uses local radiation to power CO2 conversion? It\u0027s plausible. Some species of real world microbes have much wierder biochemistry. \n\nSame about EVE oceans. Noone says that they consist of water. With such THICK atmosphere and so close to Kerbol Eve must have the same \u0022greenhouse\u0022 problem as real Venus, so... molten lead for example is one of plausible components to form Eve oceans."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T15:55:19Z","Content":"@Dr Jet - I think his point (and I agree) is that while such conversations are interesing, RealISRU is not the place for those conversations."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:00:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @Dr Jet - I think his point (and I agree) is that while such conversations are interesing, RealISRU is not the place for those conversations.\n\nThen let\u0027s discuss modeling equipment for reactions already included in mod.
