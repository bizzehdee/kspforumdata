Is this accurate, or is that part still needed? With the renaming of it\u0027s associated module with the suffix of \u0022OLD\u0022 and the more recent commenting out of the module in the part config, I\u0027ve been wondering what the point of that part is for some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I put a module in a few of the parts for local testing which implements the JSIPartUtilities module called \u0022JSIPartComponentGroup\u0022 and set it up to allow toggling of the stack node on the wheel parts. From what I can tell, from the sample configs I used from the ERS rover system, if the user has the mod installed then the stack nodes will start out disabled with the option of enabling them in the context menu for that part. If the user does not have the mod installed, they\u0027ll have the stack node enabled as it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better way for handling this might be to make it a global option, but we\u0027d need to implement our own node toggling code. I\u0027d like there to be an option to keep the nodes around, since I\u0027ve found them very helpful in my designs, but I can understand that they might cause problems with others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third option for the nodes would be to include an optional MM patch that, if the user enables it (renaming the file extension from... say... .txt to .cfg), would add a stack node to each part, otherwise leaving it blank. I might even know of a way to add the stack node to each part with a single patch by copying the value of the attach node, but I\u0027ll have to do some MM syntax research.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s there for the hitch to hitch to.

It\u0027s still there for no good reason. Yet. The hitch simply does nothing without the eye model to hitch to, though. Well at the moment, anyway. The last major hurdle to overcome with the hitch is orbits outside physics range with vessels packed.

It\u0027d sure make it easy to toggle on and off per user. We\u0027d just add that option to the editor setting-menu configuration. One thing that would need to be taken into account however is that it isn\u0027t the node itself being turned on or off, but simply it\u0027s visibility to the user. If a user attached some of our parts using a stack node, then turns them off to attach others by radial attachment, then launches the craft after our code has disabled the nodes that were still being used, you could have issues with the cohesion of the parts in flight. We simply want to make them invisible and, in the editor only, non-functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be nice is if the hitch could be made to work off of the same model.

They\u0027re not spooling up wasting fuel when you\u0027re at a comfortable power level, a good handful of solar panels (or an RTG hiding somewhere in the belly of the beast) can keep you topped up, and they have an ability to go into a manual over-ride where you can force them to run at a constant rate to make full power (like if you know you\u0027re going to be sending a lot of data home from your Science rover and want to avoid the whole \u0022Not enough electric charge to send data\u0022 hiccups. 100% power, manual override, and you won\u0027t run out of juice.) or to save the last gasps of fuel for when they\u0027re really needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe APU also has the advantage of having, at least to me, a more aesthetically pleasing look to it.

Just things I wish for sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, I had an idea a while back and I keep forgetting to mention it. Your rover body is pretty good (not counting the super oversized texture of course, which really needs to be resampled or something. I\u0027d hate to see it simply resized and loose details) but it\u0027s pretty limited as far as it\u0027s size. I was thinking, if it could be separated into three parts (a front part, a middle part with the cargo bay, and an end piece) then it could be made to any size needed for someone\u0027s rover needs, and different middle pieces could be made to suit different needs then. Sorta like a simplified version of the other rover bodies you were working on a while back. If the cargo bay portion lacked end pieces too, then the cargo bay could be stretched to suit the user\u0027s needs. You could even provide half-length portions and such. The great thing about all this is that since you\u0027d simply be cutting up the model you should be able to use the exact same texture for all the parts, thus reducing any need for extra texture memory consumption. I don\u0027t want to add this to the next release obviously, since we\u0027re rather close, but it would be something to add to the to-do list for afterwards. I might even tackle it myself if I ever learn how to do unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T16:37:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
