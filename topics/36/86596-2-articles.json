You can cobble together a wind direction/strength thing with a KAS rope, some Firespitter air brakes and an IR free rotator, a wing in place of the air brakes would also work I guess but the higher drag on the airbrakes made me use them.

Very creative on your part, I\u0027d love to see more iterations when they come up, but thing is, the wind shows up backwards on your arrow, this is probably caused by the shape the airbrakes make when you open them and how wind doesn\u0027t like going inside that little cavern you make under the brakes, it\u0027d much rather prefer to go over the brakes than under them. Try having the brakes on the front of the arrow instead, see how that works out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T11:46:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 11:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by silverfox8124\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETiredness.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox8124","CreatedById":125032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate!: the coordinate system that kerbin uses isnt matching as it should be, im working on getting the wind to work as it should, but for now please bare with it while i get a patch ready. ~SilverFox8124\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxjetterxx","CreatedById":37766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T23:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe automatic weather does not seem to work, is this on purpose/is it not implemented yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox8124","CreatedById":125032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T23:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@xxjetterxx: Sadly, no, the automatic wind feature was a thing, but since the code overhaul of 0.0.2, I\u0027ve removed it\u0027s functionality for now.
