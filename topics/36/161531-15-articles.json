[(18 / 32) = 0.5625 --\u0026gt; 56.25%]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the base ISP for Water is 47.14% that of Hydrogen alone, whereas the base ISP should only be 41.2% that of Hydrogen with Hydrazine, like we discussed before... This means that the same amount of energy into the same mass of propellant will add less to the Thrust produced than with Hydrazine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking ALL of this together, we get the following calculations for the Thrust multiplier...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we find the relative energy released per kg of propellant for Hydro/LOX (the portion that reacts) compared to Hydrazine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(324.274 / 414.2) / 0.5625 = 1.3918\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a realistic LOX-augmented NTR only reacts approximately half of its Hydrogen with Oxygen. This reduces the relative energy released per kg of propellants flowing through the NTR as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.3918 * (18/20) = 1.2526\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is as only approximately 90% of the fuel-mass flowing through a LOX-Augmented NTR in Hydro/LOX mode reacts. That is, if you pass 20 kg through in a second, 16 tons of it will be Oxygen that reacts, 2 tons will be Hydrogen that reacts, and 2 tons will be Hydrogen that remains unreacted...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we find the relative increase in Thrust of Hydro/LOX vs. Hydrazine based on the base ISP and using the following equations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPower = 1/2 Thrust * Exhaust Velocity\u003C/strong\u003E --\u0026gt; Thrust = 2 * Power / Exhaust Velocity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 * 1.2526 / 0.4714 = 5.315\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 * 1 / 0.412 = 4.854\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(note that the raw values above are completely meaningless, except as a relative standard of comparison)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the Thrust multiplier for Hydrazine should be 91.34% (4.854 / 5.315 = 0.9134) that for Hydro/LOX, or 1.977 * 0.9134 = \u003Cstrong\u003E1.806\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe values for steam (gaseous H\u003Csub\u003E2[//sub]O) come from the following table, by the way:\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mrbigler.com/misc/energy-of-formation.PDF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Csub\u003Ehttp://www.mrbigler.com/misc/energy-of-formation.PDF\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Csub\u003EConclusions:\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003E- The base ISP multiplier for Hydrazine in a Thermal Rocket should be 0.412\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003E- The Thrust multiplier for Hydrazine in a Thermal Rocket should be 1.806\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003E- The effective ISP of a Hydrazine Thermal Rocket is 74.4% (0.412 * 1.806 = 0.744) that of Hydrogen alone, at a significantly higher Thrust/MW...\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003ERegards,\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csub\u003ENorthstar\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LucidPixels","CreatedById":100619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T03:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe work you have done with this mod is fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to disable/remove the \u0022soot\u0022 mechanic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T06:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe data we\u0027re using already comes from atomic Rockets, no?

Threadsinger was right before- we risk alienating our players by doing so. I think players can decide from a roleplaying perspective how to justify controversial technologies if they really want. I\u0027ve used Orion Nuclear Pulse rockets in KSP before, for instance- and it\u0027s enough of a challenge to figure out how to get one of those far enough off the pad that it doesn\u0027t vaporize the Luanchpad in a miniature thermonuclear explosion without having to worry about a Science penalty for the radiation release on top of that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo all the veteran KSP-Interstellar players out there watching from the sidelines, I can promise you we really haven\u0027t changed that much in KSP-Interstellar in the direction of added difficulty.
