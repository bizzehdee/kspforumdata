Low priority I think.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually more complicated...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a procedural fairing base, or more specifically, an interstage fairing adapter. You stack a cargo bay payload on top of it, stack the rest of the ship above it, adjust the fairing shape to fit, lock the fairings shape, turn off the internal struts and take off a fairing (or rather, a fuselage, so it doesn\u0027t decouple when you don\u0027t want it to) piece. That\u0027s your cargo bay wall -- three will be walls, one will move to be the door. So you try to put an Infernal Robotics hinge between the fairing piece and the segment of the fairing you want to be the door, while locking the other three fairing segments with struts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now you need to prop the other three fairing segments up with cubic struts, because the hinge has a nonzero height and the door sticks out. But the struts don\u0027t have the same height as the hinge, so they don\u0027t match. And they stick out of the sides themselves, defeating the whole point of having a neat looking cargo bay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still possible to do it, but it\u0027s so annoying to edit that I just gave up. What would save the situation is a part that has two sets of nodes in a specific position, one above the other, so that the top ones would serve to attach the fairing pieces, while the bottom ones would be spaced just far enough from them to stick the hinge on so that the four segments still match. And to avoid requiring me to attempt to precisely position the rest of the ship on structural elements attached to the back of the base where the fairings attach, it would need to have a floating top node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...never mind, I\u0027ll try doing it myself, though I guess I need to find a stock model that is a perfect cylinder first to work from...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4 - Easy as well, you want me to stick to the same yellow/white stripy color or try to find something else?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same yellow-white stripy color with a different bumpmap would look nice, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T22:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe iva works just fine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VXuF1Rh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VXuF1Rh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i5Y6AXc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i5Y6AXc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T22:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bs1110101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bs1110101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe iva works just fine!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavball orientation seems off, though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T22:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mihara\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mihara\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENavball orientation seems off, though...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s half of why i want it as one part, because of that it\u0027s very hard to fly like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T22:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bs1110101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bs1110101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe iva works just fine!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022snip\u0022 alt=\u0022snip\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022snip\u0022 alt=\u0022snip\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to fix the navball problem, you need to leave the cockpit centered under the shell and stretch it to where the cockpit pokes out how you want.
