They\u0027ve been designed to use\u00A0RPM and as such are fairly interactive, but I\u0027m curious as to some subtler points, namely lighting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did figure out how to light the interiors, and for the most part its desirable to have them lit, but,\u00A0since I usually do that last, I\u0027ve done a lot of testing with them dark. This has made for some beautiful reentries/sunsets/sunrises/night flying, and I\u0027d love the ability to toggle the lights rather than choose. I\u0027ve not seen this done elsewhere, but if anyone has any information on the subject I\u0027d appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T13:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight look at ALCOR,\u0022Advanced Landing Capsule \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50272-104alcorquotadvanced-landing-capsule-for-orbital-rendezvousquot-by-aset-21072015/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50272-104alcorquotadvanced-landing-capsule-for-orbital-rendezvousquot-by-aset-21072015/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has a light you can turn on in off in the pod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Balto-the-Wolf-Dog","CreatedById":17192,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T01:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the thread\u0027s fairly old by now, but I\u0027ve come up on a variation of the objective and keeping it in this thread might be helpful to future googlers, redundancy of posting the same thing again aside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alcor uses a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Prop-modules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJSI function\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0called \u003Cem\u003Eintlight\u003C/em\u003E to bind a light to a part trigger much like that used in the internal camera switch stock\u00A0function. In general it\u0027s very useful, but in my latest effort I decided to go a step further and bind my interior lights along side an emissive texture, which also means binding them to an animation.

Unfortunately I don\u0027t seem to be able to actually get at the animation I made. I suspect that has something to do with my setup of JSIVariableAnimator, as though the page claims it can be used to animate ancillary objects in the cockpit it also seems to specify that the function looks for the animation on the \u0022prop it lives on\u0022, and I haven\u0027t figured out h ow to change that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T04:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T05:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222470863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131167\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458781876\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217192\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Balto-the-Wolf-Dog said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe function looks for the animation on the \u0022prop it lives on\u0022, and I haven\u0027t figured out h ow to change that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can get around it by making the prop the light as well as the switch.
