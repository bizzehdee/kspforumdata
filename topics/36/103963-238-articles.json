I have more info about it, and I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s related to the disappearing clouds.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The magic altitude that causes this is 160km. If I\u0027m in map view when my craft ascends past 160km, when I return to craft view I get the effect you see in my screenshot in the linked post. However, if I am in craft view when I ascend past 160km, then it works as it\u0027s supposed to. When I do get this effect, it\u0027s necessary for me to leave the craft and go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to make it go away.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The disappearing clouds seems to be related to using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E jump to ship functionality. When I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E to jump to ship from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, if the craft is above 160km I end up with no clouds. However, if I use the tracking station to get to the craft, the clouds are there. I\u0027m mostly bringing this up because the altitudes are the same, even if the mechanic is different.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Latest KSP, up to date linux with up to date nvidia drivers.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s more of an annoyance than anything since I now have complete workarounds for all the things I mention here, but I thought you might like to know.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, and a few posts before the one I link I left a couple of eye-candies for you.
