Instead of giving priority to practical things, giving squared, exact dimension, free-to-build plots for everyone, this time, there is a big focus on your idea, on what YOU would like to build, rather than technical specifications. There will be completely different types of plots and districts, so if you wish to build for example a skyscraper headquarters building, you will get a small plot in the business district, on the other hand if you want to build a warehouse complex, you will get a more spread out plot in the industrial district.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since KSP is a game of immense scales, from walking around/EVA-ing to flying interplanetary ships, I think we should take that in account and create areas with different detail level. What I mean is that we should have detailed \u0022hotspots\u0022 around the city, like, the city hall, or the campus or train station or the art gallery or some other interesting areas that you can walk in and walk around, while make some areas less detailed, just meant for driving around, while some with a pretty blocky appearance just meant for flying around and making the whole city look \u0022complete\u0022 from distance. So I think the best way to implement this is to ask people, or see how detailed they can make buildings and depending on that they have an area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that we need is modular objects, such as street furniture (billboard structures, streetlamps, signs, etc) that can be scattered around the city or static ships around the bay.
