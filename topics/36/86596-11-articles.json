But one problem I see is that ksp still needs to feed it(the simulator) values. As this simulator isn\u0027t exclusive to ksp anymore, in fact, with the newly developed simulator, and enough knowledge, you could fill it with your own data (Even real word data) and it would go through it\u0027s calculations and simulate it. All ksp is needed for, is it\u0027s values. I am also working on an interactor which takes ksp values and feeds it to the simulator, whilst also displaying information to the user and doing any ksp related things that need to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSO: Thank you Gaiiden for all the rep comments you\u0027ve made, and thank you to anyone else who gave me rep comments as well!
