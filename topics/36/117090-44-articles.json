While you maybe able to work around it, make it easier on yourself and don\u0027t incorporate a heat shield into the model. Taper the edges and keep it empty to put a stock or other shield for now (or make your own, up to you). Incorporate it later when you figure out how to make it work, perhaps when 1.1 comes out when it might be a lot easier to deal with. What\u0027s another part to this series? While I know you are going for a one-part process, it might be nearly impossible to include every system into one part. You could make a heat shield with various texturing, like you done with the tank to change material styles. Just my opinion on the matter, it\u0027s entirely up to you."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T18:16:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Shadow, since you have made an Apollo, could I suggest for 0.9.0 lander rework to have a Direct Ascent version of it (for launching on board of Nova) and the martian lander version too? no need to be an exact replica though, just a similar concept ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E ![aa51ef1269282ef5397f2c56f9476cca.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/aa/51/ef/aa51ef1269282ef5397f2c56f9476cca.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nWhere\u0027d you get the 3d model pic?

I haven\u0027t found a way to fix the stock coloring, but I did locate a way to basically just undo whatever it did; it comes at the performance hit of resetting the material color for a second time that frame.  The actual impact should be negligible though, as the point where it is being set is prior to any draw calls being issued, so it boils down to just changing a couple variables that I\u0027m pretty sure would be re-uploaded to the gfx every frame anyway.  Still makes me sad that I have to ~~work~~ hack around stuff like this, but ohwell... moving on for now.  At least NathanKell and a few others were kind enough to help me with the rest of math behind KSP thermodynamics, so I could get the actual thermal stuff figured out.\n\nThe uhh... more good news?:\n\nTweaked the heatshield on the SC-A-CM to perform quite effectively for mun/minmus return velocity, while still leaving a decent margin for higher-speed returns (uses 275 of 450 ablator).  Returns from standard orbital velocity are about as tame as they should be.  All of the heat-shield variables/etc have been exposed in the config for the SC-A-CM, what is shown there are the default values for everything, so feel free to tweak them accordingly.  I already explained a few posts/pages back what they all do.  Have not yet tweaked the SC-B-CM heatshield, that is on next-weeks TODO list while reworking the pod.\n\nAnd now for the... better news ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) :  \n\n(Nope, sorry, no bad news tonight)  \n\nI\u0027m going to package up what I have as-is, as the code-side fixes alone are worth it (the SM model is just a bonus ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ).   Keep in mind the SM is **not finished**; I actually have even more texture work done, but would need more time to do all the spec-masking, etc... so that stuff will wait for the weekend.  This is mostly a release for the improved heat-shield code and the fix for the editor lag.  \n  \n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.24-pre3](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.24-pre3)\n\nP.S.

I probably won\u0027t get back to it until next week, but there is some initial progress.  Will have an all-new texture, higher-resolution if I can pull it off (to match the texture scale on the 2.5m pod), and feature all of the built-in-goodies of the other pod.\n\n![3281a16e-a40b-11e5-9887-8510476799ca.png](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1503399/11856039/3281a16e-a40b-11e5-9887-8510476799ca.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T03:14:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Shadow, since you have made an Apollo, could I suggest for 0.9.0 lander rework to have a Direct Ascent version of it (for launching on board of Nova) and the martian lander version too? no need to be an exact replica though, just a similar concept ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nLoL... my original concept for the 5m lander pod looked almost exactly like those.

While other part mods kind of lack that unique feel of what landing on the Lunar surface would be like in the near future,what you\u0027ve done with your lander core package is, by far, the best idea ever constructed. While the ALCOR pod is currently one of the more popular pods, you still have to build a landing system for it and that takes a lot of parts. Next is the Apollo LEM, which has been used numerous times to do these types of missions. \n\nAll the while, I think landing on the Mun is an adventure, after that, the role changes to colonization, in which your cargo ship comes into play. Slap it together, configure it for whatever you want it for, fill it up with your favorite base parts and send it on it\u0027s merry way. In other words, you don\u0027t need to re do anything with your lander core in my opinion. Spit and polish when 1.1 comes out. Give it more gold foil/brushed aluminum look and blam-o, done and done.\n\nNow with all that being said, there is nothing wrong with another Apollo lander. They are just so hard to replicate, Too many wild angles and lines to be efficient to do in a game type environment. When you could be spending that time with what you already done. Make a smaller version like you had planned in the image of your lander core series and get to making things we really could definitely use: station parts, base building parts, sat package and rovers (love rovers). This is just an opinion of mine, it probably will vary with everyone else\u0027s opinion and yours to, Shadow.

I\u0027ll d/l those pics though so I have them handy, never hurts to have more resource material.\n\u003E \n\nSounds great, I think the martian lander will benefit a lot if it is done after all the base stuff, mainly because the descent stage also was intended to be used as a habitation pod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAs for LEM, even though I suggested it I kinda agree with lynwoodm, LEM would feel more like a bonus, but the main reason I asked was because it would use far less parts than the FASA one, and speaking of FASA, Shadow, I think contacting DannyTX, Frizzank or NathanKell (Frizzank handed FASA to him) could help on the LEM regard ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\nEDIT: [@davidy12](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143411-davidy12/) have fun: [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/441493569693987355/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/441493569693987355/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T12:32:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T12:52:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds great, I think the martian lander will benefit a lot if it is done after all the base stuff, mainly because the descent stage also was intended to be used as a habitation pod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As for LEM, even though I suggested it I kinda agree with lynwoodm, LEM would feel more like a bonus, but the main reason I asked was because it would use far less parts than the FASA one, and speaking of FASA, Shadow, I think contacting DannyTX, Frizzank or NathanKell (Frizzank handed FASA to him) could help on the LEM regard ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: [@davidy12](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143411-davidy12/) have fun: [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/441493569693987355/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/441493569693987355/)\n\u003E \n\nThere are a couple more out there.
