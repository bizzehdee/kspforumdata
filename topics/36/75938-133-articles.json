Actually, it\u0027s headache inducing. I understand maybe 1% of what you just said. I\u0027ve looked at other mods that are doing this same thing that I\u0027m trying to do and they aren\u0027t doing anything different than what I have in my code, and they seem to have absolutely no problems. So, why am I having problems and how do I fix it? I\u0027m really not interested in knowing what all the inner workings of these things are right now. I\u0027m looking for a solution to the problem. If I can see the solution, then maybe I can make sense of it. I learn best by seeing a working example and disassembling \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Eto see what makes it tick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m still confused as to why this has anything to do with appButton. In the latest attempts I\u0027ve made locally, the code between the brackets of the button\u0027s \u0022if\u0022 statements doesn\u0027t even ask for appButton at all. Why would an independent button within a GUI window be dependent on an AppLauncher button? The only connection between the two is that appButton launches the GUI window. It simply makes no sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind, this isn\u0027t a solo creation here. If something has been done wrong in here from the start of this whole class, then it\u0027s been a collective screw up. The first iterations were copied directly from BDArmory, after which I stripped a lot out and rewrote a few things to be specific to our mod. Aqua attacked it then to try and make things actually work, where I tend to hit things until they stop moving and then yell at them until they live again.

Unfortunately, it seems that Awake isn\u0027t working quite right because I\u0027m getting absolutely no log entries at all. Strangely enough, the GUI will still load up but now the toggles are stuck in the \u0022true\u0022 state \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E the button no longer causes a nullref. Is still doesn\u0027t do anything though. So, I\u0027m really just confused now as to why my log entry isn\u0027t working when it\u0027s fired off whenever Awake is called? Cause right now is looks like Awake never happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: So, I decided to put another stop between the button click and the activity it produces by starting a new method I called CloseGUI() in which I stuck a bunch of log entries for the state of \u0022appButton\u0022 and even attempted to make a local copy of appButton in the feeble attempt to tie into the proper instance of it. No luck there, and I still have no idea why the GUI spawned from the currently active and not-null \u0022appButton\u0022 would launch inside of a copy of the class which is supposed to be garbage. Anyway, the button no longer nullrefs on me, and I can now close the GUI from it using that middle-man method I made, but I still cannot reset the \u0022appButton\u0022 to the grey texture, nor can I get it to save the settings from that button. at this point I think I\u0027m going to have to scrap the idea of having the \u0022appButton\u0022 icon lit up while the GUI is active. If it returns to grey when the mouse leaves it, and doesn\u0027t bother to do anything while the GUI is loaded, then none of this should be a problem at all. There\u0027s still something whacky going on in the background with multiple instances of the class being loaded at the same time, but I can\u0027t do anything about that right now and there are no examples of this happening to anyone else in identical situations so there\u0027s no hope of finding a fix for it right now. I\u0027ll let you all know if it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the back of my imagination right now there is a possibility of separating the appButton itself and the GUI stuff into separate classes in which I could add public booleans to track the states of things and simply have the appButton part of the code check the update cycle to see if a boolean in the GUI class has been set to false, indicating that the GUI is no longer open and the appButton needs to be updated to match. But, I have no idea what sorts of problems I would be opening up in the process of doing \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 2: Okay, I think I\u0027ve finally hit my limit for the complete bovine excrement that this program is giving me right now. I stripped out all attempts to control the texture of the \u0022appButton\u0022 from the GUI or anything that is called from or on the GUI. No more nullrefs. Since adding another method between the button and the action it\u0027s told to do worked before, I simply reworked the method to save the current state of the config when called. Now, however, instead of sorta-working like it was before, I can\u0027t get the toggles to function anymore. They won\u0027t toggle, and the button no longer works again. So now I have a completely non-functional settings menu. I\u0027m fed up with this. I am doing nothing different than everyone else with the same GUI settings window is doing, but for me it simply won\u0027t work at all. The more I try to fix it, the more broken it gets. The more I start to understand why I\u0027m getting a particular error, the more it starts not giving me the same error when it\u0027s supposed to! I feel like I\u0027m battling a sentient entity that exists only to screw up my every attempt to make this thing \u003Cem\u003Ework!\u003C/em\u003E I can\u0027t fight this any longer.

Symmetry is always an issue in the various editors. For parts that are meant to attach horizontally, you have to use a radial attachment method for symmetry to really work correctly. If the parts you\u0027re attaching to are not themselves attached in a radial symmetry then you will end up with your new part symmetrically attached only to the part you\u0027re attaching to, instead of the entire craft as you would expect. Stack node attachment is completely optional since there is a key you can hold down (completely stock functionality here) that will force the editor to ignore the stack nodes. I forget the exact key right now, but it\u0027s one of the modifier keys (shift, ctrl, alt) that does the trick. I have fiddled with the idea of adding an optional module into the parts that would, if the other corresponding mod was installed, all the user to turn off the nodes temporarily while editing them in order to make it easier, but I\u0027ve been a bit too busy to experiment with that lately. The issue you are experiencing is due to the interaction between stack nodes and how the SPH symmetry conflicts with stack nodes. Unfortunately, I am unsure how one sets a series of stack nodes to be friendly with symmetry, especially in the SPH. when using surface, the editor automatically flips the part to appear correctly on the craft, but it doesn\u0027t know what to do with the Stack nodes because originally they were meant only for attaching hull pieces together end to end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, on some parts where the stack nodes are set up and aligned correctly, symmetry can work rather well with symmetrical attachment. For instance, the ERS rover body can do it rather well and without any of these quirks. However, there are also parts which are not meant to be used with parts like these and they don\u0027t work well with symmetry as you\u0027ve discovered with those trusses. It\u0027s still attaching to the same node on either side, but it\u0027s not accepting that the part should be flipped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it\u0027s not the stack nodes on the wheels that are the problem, and they were added to these parts for a reason that is still quite valid. This does not mean you \u003Cem\u003Ehave \u003C/em\u003Eto use them to attach these parts, it just means that they are available when rover bodies are made specifically for rover use and provide nodes for wheel placement, such as on the ERS and a few others out there in the cloud somewhere. My best constructions using symmetry in that way was to first make a single instance of the entire construct that will be symmetrically attached to the rest of the craft, then I pick up that entire construct, from the part that will radially attach to the craft, and activate the symmetry then and reattach it. I then copy the construct from that same attachment-part and create as many copies as needed. This usually eliminates the issues that come from individually trying to attach each part in full symmetry. Also, for the control problem, keep in mind that horizontally aligned crafts have not only a forward and backward, but also an up and down. If your probe is not aligned in the exact correct direction in relation to both forward/backward \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E up/down, then you could have issues with the steering being flipped with the acceleration and such. However, I have not actually seen anything like A/D being swapped with W/S since the functions behind those keys are completely different. The former set controls turning direction, while the other set controls movement. It\u0027s not the same as translational movement in space using RCS, where the different keys can swap based on the orientation of the control unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the issue with the inverting track moving backwards, that is something I remember experiencing a long time ago with the old DLL that came with RBI. I\u0027m unsure what the real problem was, but I suspect it had something to do with the orientation of the part in relation to the control part of the craft and the orientation of the root part of the craft. Sometimes, if the root part is not the controlled part, and the root part is not in a standard orientation, you can experience strange control issues that don\u0027t make a lot of sense. I have personally had issues with my gimbals on the back of a repulsor craft using gimballing jets to control my steering being reversed in flight due to my control pod technically being angled straight up. Unfortunately there aren\u0027t a lot of known fixes for these incidents. the causes are numerous and the fixes are unique to each situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T21:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EY\u0027know, the fact is there was a lot of crud being sent my way that made absolutely no sense and I did not appreciate it, so apologies are not on the table at all.

It\u0027s only replacing their startup page. it\u0027s a bit of a struggle to help them when the terminology is all wrong on their end. Really annoying, but I have to find a way to descend toward their level to help them effectively. If I try to tell them to click on a series of buttons that could be in a different location based on how large the window is on their specific monitor size with a specific screen resolution, assuming they haven\u0027t accidentally gone into full screen mode, they will get confused very quickly and be unable to follow the directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, based on what he could see in my code and on the level of the questions I was asking, I would think that the response could be geared towards the questions I am actually asking about. I mentioned that I based my code off of another mod, which I named, and that I could find no different between the two source files other than the context of the implementation (I don\u0027t need the same options being toggled as BahamutoD needs) which is different for every mod, obviously, since we all want to use our own GUI layout and whatnot. The answers I was receiving were of the type that asks a relatively uneducated person to contemplate concepts that are way above his/her level of understanding and then letting that person know that they are not as smart because they couldn\u0027t do something really simple in response to the higher degree of knowledge they were being asked to contemplate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I still could not solve the problem no matter what I copied from his posts because none of it was written into the context of the code I was trying to fix. I need a working example to work from in order to make sense of it. That\u0027s why I use other mods as examples. If the exact same thing works for BahamutoD, then I expect it to work for me. I could not see the difference, and I expected that someone would take what I was providing and, if they were unwilling to give a working example in the context of this mod, at the very least they could show me what the difference is between the two implementations. Instead, I had to grapple with a situation that made absolutely no sense to me, and when I expressed that, I was provided with more of what I could never hope to understand which does not help at all.

Lets just set this aside and start working towards the future now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lo-fi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lo-fi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s cool, all looking good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had some changes to merge, which I had to merge with Gaalidas\u0027, and then I guess you had to merge yours in. All builds, runs and operates smoothly! Nice one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if you saw that we got some answer to my question about GetModuleSize()? Nothing amazingly helpful (in the interface), so I guess the workaround is to set values in the config and pass them back to the editor that way. What an absolute pain :/ Unless there is a way to get data on the proto vessel size when the part is first created... Though that could get messy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfig updates are the biggest thing now. What an \u0027orrible job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was researching how KSP does all this itself, I also looked at other mods which try to determine the size and mass of objects in flight. I didn\u0027t come up with anything too useful, but the mods I was researching are Vessel Viewer, Mechjeb, any mod with a landing aid or an auto-gimbal system (km_gimbal and it\u0027s various versions). Looking at those might give you some hints, though doubtful it will supply and fixes for this problem directly. My only real thought on all that is that Vessel Viewer seeks to find out what the size of the craft is so it can scale it\u0027s view properly. I find myself wondering how it deals with this problem when displaying tracks and scaling the view properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
