But only Friction is similar to what it would be on the Earth\u0027s surface and Solar wind would be replaced by real wind.\n\nThe Truss is made up of Helix shaped parts that interlock and when folded down lie both above and below but inside and outside of each other.  Much like a standard chain can fold up into a small package.   The Guide rails compact down like an old fashion (1970s old fashion) rabbit ear telescoping antenna.  The Helical chain parts are Connected to the Solar array on the inside,  The Telescoping Guide rails are attached via cables on sliding rings, to the outside of the Panel.     A Motive force is applied to the telescoping guide rails (not certain WHAT this force is but it could even be some form of intert gas or a worm gear and electric motor given how minute the opposing forces can be.)  The guide rails extend pushing the end cap out that is also attached to all the above parts.  the Central truss starts to follow and like a lego block locks in place when properly extended.\n\nOver simplified and I am CERTAIN given the lighting that this was done on the Dark side of the planet (Sun opposite) and with the array pointing at earth for minimal solar wind activity and maximal boost from Gravity."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T21:57:25Z","Content":"It could always have a small component of required \u0022rocket parts\u0022 to deploy.
