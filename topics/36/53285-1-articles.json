As such, there could be an onboard \u0022Heater unit\u0022 that converts EC to heat if needed, but you can also use heat that is produced (in a reactor for example) to heat it. The efficiency of the chamber is also directly related to its temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Sabatier Reactor converts CO2(g) \u002B 4 H2(g) -\u0026gt; CH4(g) \u002B 2 H2O(l). The pyrolysis reactor then converts CH4(g) -\u0026gt; C(s) \u002B 2 H2(g). The complete reaction is then CO2(g) \u002B 4 H2(g) -\u0026gt; 2 H2O(l) \u002B 2 H2(g) \u002B C(s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Bosch Reaction outputs CO2(g) \u002B 2 H2(g) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00E2\u20AC\u2122 C(s) \u002B 2 H2O(g). Same reaction in 1 step instead of 2, perhaps different amounts of needed and waste energy (heat), but same basic principle.

MFS is probably the biggest one. not sure whether RF should be required or not. I would have to study the necessity of KSPI (and its heat mechanics) in more detail to determine how critical it is. To some extent I do agree with you that the number of mods that you add allows you to incrementally increase the difficulty of the game. However, that can very easily be done with other things as well. I am not going to try to add G-force mechanics (DRE), Probe control (RT2), or realistic flight mechanics (FAR). If you want to add those, be my guest.
