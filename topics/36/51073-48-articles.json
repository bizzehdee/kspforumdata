Speaking for myself (since I haven\u0027t talked to Mihara about it), we\u0027d have to recompile SCANsat RPM so it\u0027d work with it ... but that might break SCANsat RPM for anyone using the \u0022official\u0022 SCANsat. It\u0027s a bit of a tough situation - I don\u0027t want to maintain two versions of RPM with a single DLL linkage being the only difference, and I definitely don\u0027t want to link only to the recompiled SCANsat, since the link to it is buried in the SCANsat thread, which means dealing with support issues when people don\u0027t know about it and come here asking why SCANsat doesn\u0027t work with us. If SCANsat development really has stopped (which appears to be the case), the best situation would be for someone to pick it up (the license permits this, IIRC) and release an \u0022official\u0022 SCANsat Continued that includes the Toolbar integration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my best guess would be for either danmy to come back already, or for someone else to take it over and make SCANsat Continued (with danmy\u0027s permission, of course). Users of the \u0022official\u0022 SCANsat would need to be notified of the new release either way.. but then, it\u0027s no more than they would normally do to check for updates to their mods - check the forum threads. So... where do we go from here? If the people who have successfully recompiled the dll to fix this are willing to share it, do we have an \u0022community hotfix for toolbar integration\u0022 of sorts? Or do we wait for danmy to come back and tell us what we can do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
