You will discover the Kerbal\u0027s history and build their future through a series of quests that will take them to the ends of the Kerbol System. Resource management, creativity and a love for challenges are required!\n\n* * *\nThe Kerbals once formed a vast civilization that spanned their entire planet. Simple-minded yet technologically advanced, they saw their home as their playground and never dream of going higher than the sky. \nOver the course of millennia, they drained their planet dry. They faced an unprecedented crisis. The Kerbals turned to forming vast arcologies from vegetal fibres, sustaining themselves from lab-grown products and building bunkers to face whatever disaster lay ahead... but while their efforts focused on the growing dangers they faced at home, a looming threat grew from far beyond the horizon.\n\n**A Gamma Ray Burst.**\n\nMillions of light years away, a massive star collapses to form a black hole. The energies released as gamma rays converge into a random point in space... \n\nBusy, overworked scientists on Kerbin detect a pulse in the readings of gamma-ray telescopes. Short and harmless, it is ignored. \n\nMinutes later, the \u0027true\u0027 burst blasts the entire Kerbol system with billions of yottajoules of energy. All life is extinguished on Kerbin\u0027s hemisphere instantly. The atmosphere bursts into flame and the oceans rise as titanic walls of steam. \n\nIn the last instants before the thermal wave engulfs the planet, the bunkers are locked down. \n\nYou command the Kerbals that re-emerge a hundred years later. \n\nThe planet is devoid of resources, and these survivors have little tools at their disposal. All technology has to be scavenged from molten wrecks. You have only one option: **head up, and beyond**.\n\n* * *\n\nExciting stuff, right? \n\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s more to expect:\n\n-Custom planetary positions (Minmus)\n\n-Part mod compatibility (KAS, KIS, EPL, ect)\n\nWIP:\n\n-Custom planetary resource availability\n\n-ROCK/MKS colonization\n\nDone:\n\n-Putting parts in custom tech tree\n\n-Custom missions\n\n-Custom tech-tree\n\n-Rebalanced part cost\n\n-Rebalanced resource cost\n\n-Custom career rewards\n\n-Custom pop-up messages\n\nFuture implementations:\n\n-Story missions\n\n-Side quests\n\n* * *\nCurrent Tech Tree.\n![ImaLNLh.png](http://i.imgur.com/ImaLNLh.png)\n\n* * *\nFile distribution:\n{Rock}\n\nMediafire link\n\nKerbalStuff link\n\nPlease download these and add them to your GameData:\n\n[Custom Barn Kit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121100-1-0-x-Custom-Barn-Kit-1-1-1-%28May-27%29-No-instruction-leaflet-edition)\n\nMod integration: \n\nNear Future Technologies (electrical, propulsion)\n\nMKS/OKS\n\n* * *\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nCreative Commons 4.0 Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n\nCC BY-NC-SA\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T15:41:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TruthQuark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:06:01Z","Content":"Well, so much different from what we talked about in the other thread, but...

The player starts off with more money than usual, but there are none of the usual ways to gain money (silly part test contracts for example). The only way to gain money, and thereby afford fuel, is to mine your own or complete story missions. And guess what? The story missions are near-impossible without a way to get fuel from outside of Kerbin.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, if the player is smart, they will attempt to learn ore extraction and refinery parts early-on, so that they can get around this problem. Although, it goes without saying, the fuel will be expensive.\n\nThe resource gathering parts are on the 3rd node from the start, so the player will have to deliberately avoid them with an intent to lose the game if they don\u0027t want to mine other worlds. \n\nFuel is very expensive and now represents 80-90% of a rocket\u0027s cost.\n\nAnd yes, you can lose the game.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E hmm, and how will be the combatibility with other Mods? (Especial Partmods)\n\nThere will be built-in mods, and compatibility with several other mods right from the start. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds great if you can pull it off.\n\nMuch appreciated.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just wondering if that\u0027s the intention of the mod - like there\u0027s only so much resources left that you have to squeeze the sponge on Kerbin until you can get equipment to minmus.

However, this turned out to be much more complicated than I could manage.\n\nThe current solution is to simulate resource scarcity by giving the player limited funds, and expensive fuel. Combined with limitations on how to gain funds, the player will have to spent most of the early game devising a fuel-efficient and cheap way to haul ore from other planets. Good strategies include getting the most out of the early-unlock spaceplane parts, and using lightweight drones. Later in the game, they\u0027ll get access to electric engines from Near Future Propulsion, but they require new fuels and different extraction set-ups.\n\nBy \u0027strategy\u0027, I mean that the player will have to organize their progress and build around their current \u0027fuel capacity\u0027 to advance in the game. In sandbox, you can do pretty much whatever you want. In Career, funds, science, reputation quickly become superfluous after completing a few contracts and unlocking the last tech nodes. In this Strategy mode, you have to be austere and calculating all the time, trying to gain enough fuel to complete missions defined by the story. \n\nIn abstraction, the story missions are efficiency objectives. You can reach that efficiency by building better, lighter, more capable rockets, or flying better, or setting up mining installations with the least number of flights... that part\u0027s up to you."},{"CreatedByName":"tuckjohn","CreatedById":91927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T00:17:23Z","Content":"**I have a few further questions:**\n\n1. Are you planning to have buildings that the player can build though-out Kerbin, changing their effectiveness based on their location?

If not, I think that it would be really neat to have that, as hard as it would be to program(I\u0027m an hobbyist Unity coder).\n\nI plan on using Kerbal Konstructs to set up several \u0027discoverable\u0027 bases on Kerbin and beyond. They\u0027d have their own \u0027recovery factor\u0027 that determines how much funds you get back from recovering fuel tanks full of fuel. \n\nFor example, if Ore had a value of 6 funds/unit, dropping at the easy-to-reach equatorial KSC would get you back 3 funds/unit, while dropping it on a hard-to-reach polar research facility that survived the GBE with better equipment would get you 5 funds/unit. \n\nFor the moment, I\u0027ll focus on using Kerbin Konstructs and KerbinSide to tweak the recovery rates and KSC position as required. Then, I\u0027ll create duplicate KSCs elsewhere on the planet and beyond. For the moment, there\u0027s only one global recovery rate (which you define with the \u0027funds recovery\u0027 slider while creating a save), but I\u0027m sure there are more options to be had.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. May I take a suggestion from earlier about a simulated economy, and suggest that you add other companies that make fuel that you have to buy secondhand, but at a much higher price then what you would pay then if you made it?\n\u003E While that sounds like a great idea for something like a Kerbal Oil Tycoon game, it doesn\u0027t fit the post-apocalyptic future the Kerbals are trying to build their way out of in the ROCK project. For now, I\u0027m explaining the funds recovery as a global yardstick for how efficient your current industry is at converting recovered resources into available fuel.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 3.

That was my initial idea, and it required too much work. \n\u003E \n\u003E As for upgradeable facilities, it might be possible to allows level 2 and 3 building to have better recovery rates and allow for cheaper fuels."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:59:17Z","Content":"Severe troubles with the tech tree.
