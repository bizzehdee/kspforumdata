Basically both situations need to be tested thoroughly.

If i then edit it while building applying inventory again sometimes increases the buildtime.. It looks like what happens is when you apply inventory to a build it removes the inventory by 1 for each part as expected, then when you edit the craft it looks in the inventory for the items, sees none because they\u0027re already being used for the craft in production, then makes the build time based on inventoried craft.

ScrapYard itself won\u0027t slow down much, except maybe during scene changes (I might be able to fix that if it becomes a problem). I don\u0027t think Flight will slow down much if at all since that would be affected more by the number of ships active (which increases save size) but I don\u0027t think increased save size will affect Flight.

This list is designed to be highly configurable.). Right now there\u0027s no UI, just a button that when pressed goes through all the parts on the vessel in the editor and sees if there are any exact matches in the inventory, minus the ModuleSYPartTracker. If there\u0027s a match, the part tracker gets copied onto it (therefore the ID and times recovered are updated on the part), and then on build those parts are pulled out of the inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*\u00A0Through the ModuleSYPartTracker module applied to all parts upon creation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, if you\u0027ve got a part that uses tweakscale to go from 1.25m to 2.5m and you have the 2.5m version stored in the inventory, if you have the regular version on a vessel in the editor then applying the inventory won\u0027t do anything. But if you use tweakscale to make it 2.5m and then apply the inventory it will pull the part out of the inventory. That means that if you can\u0027t recreate the part in the editor, you can\u0027t get it out of the inventory right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on making a UI where you can see all the parts in the inventory and \u0022grab\u0022 one of them, turning it into a part stuck to the cursor with all the right modules applied. So if you\u0027ve got parts with some upgrades but not others, you could still use the old version (in theory). I have a few designs in my head for that: A) Alt\u002BRight click a part in the part list on the left to see a new window pane with the list of all the forms of that part in the editor (click a procedural tank and see all the different ones you\u0027ve made, click one of those to make a part with those dimensions appear), or B) in the right click menu on a part in the editor, press a button to see a list of all forms of that part, then click one of those and it will automatically apply it to that part (resizing and such), or C) press the ScrapYard button to open a new window where you can see every part in the inventory and click it to make it appear in the editor. I might do a combination of all of those. Or I might do A with a little symbol next to the source part in the part list if it\u0027s got forms in the inventory, with a special category that only shows parts in the inventory. I like A since it works nicely with stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-05T02:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixed several ScrapYard bugs, some of them decently major.

Another is\u00A0that you could change a part after applying inventory and it would still \u0022count\u0022 as being from the inventory (fixed by checking at processing time and once a second in the editor that the parts are valid configurations). TweakScale and Procedural Parts seem to be working as expected, but the SRBs in Procedural Parts aren\u0027t because the dry cost is getting set too high (I\u0027m pretty sure\u00A0that\u0027s why).

As of right now you can\u0027t blacklist parts, but that is something I\u0027d like to add.\u00A0I might also add an option so you can right-click a part in flight and set it to not be added to the inventory on recovery since that\u0027d be easy to add. Partial discount is harder, especially on a per-part basis. I might try to come up with a general way of allowing modules to set that\u00A0and then someone could make a small mod that allows that, but I\u0027m not sure the creation of that small mod is something that should be in ScrapYard, just the backing code that allows for it to function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223046899\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002262900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494072155\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150041\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thunder175\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, thunder175 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen some odd behavior in my current save.
