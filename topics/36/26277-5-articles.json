However, that design was made after they figured out that the American public was not going to be happy about an Orion ship taking off from the ground under atom-bomb power. Too much fallout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, the bomb size was constrained by political reasons, not by engineering reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they made it lofted by the bottom two stages of a Saturn V rocket. Since plutonium is expensive and massive, they scaled the bombs down to only 1 kiloton. This is all the thrust you need for that altitude. But for a ground launch, 1 kiloton makes a thrust to weight ratio of 0.55 (thrust of 3,500 kiloNewtons). Too little to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I knew that Jeb was going to want to take off from the ground, I made the mod use 5 kiloton pulse units (designed for a 4,000 short ton ship). These have a thrust of 80,000 kiloNewtons, as you can see in the part.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is not enough, the 10,000 short ton Orion was to use 15 kiloton pulse units. That will give you a whopping 400,000 kiloNewtons of thrust. That is enough to transport an entire Mun base in one trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it is also enough shock that it might shake the ship to pieces. I haven\u0027t actually tried it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, one can play with the part.cfg file to make the bombs go off faster than 1 per second. For instance, if they go off at a rate of 2 per second, your thrust will be doubled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have to figure out how to make the nuclear bombs more like a resource.
