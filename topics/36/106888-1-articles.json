Kind of disappointing as I know there\u0027s more than one mod out there with parts that would have benefited from allowing radial cross-feed. I guess that will still be dependent on plug-ins. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:52:56Z","Content":"Fuel and oxidizer never cross fed from radial parts afaik and I don\u0027t see anything about it in the changelog.
