On the engines, you toggle the interstage node, and there it is when you grab a part to attach. The tanks also have this option... and I cannot see if it does anything. In addition, some of the \u0022enable\u0022 buttons are confusing. If I see an \u0022enable\u0022 button as active/clickable, I assume that whatever it is is *disabled* right now, and I would hit the button to enable it. If I see the disable button, I assume it is activated, and might need to be disabled. If things are in fact the opposite, then I think the button should not say \u0022enable,\u0022 but \u0022enabled,\u0022 and if you click it it then says \u0022disabled.\u0022\n\nBTW, it might be nice to have a flat-bottomed version of the MUS tank (or at least a non-green texture option for the minimal mount).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T18:07:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T20:44:41Z","Content":"Render of the RD-0110 turbopump; probably one of the most detailed turbos I\u0027ve done yet... and still a bit left to do on it (GG output to verniers):\n\n(yes, it is one massive manifold mesh...)\n\n![aYJDYui.png](http://i.imgur.com/aYJDYui.png)\n\nEdit:\n\nLink to resources:\n\n[http://www.rocket-propulsion.info/resources/articles/AIAA-2005-3946.pdf](http://www.rocket-propulsion.info/resources/articles/AIAA-2005-3946.pdf)  (page 5)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T20:45:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T21:00:09Z","Content":"And it will all be hidden behind a shroud? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T04:23:25Z","Content":"With a bit of... persistence...
