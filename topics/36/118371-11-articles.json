Up until now, almost all well-made cinematics totally exclude interior shots due to their difficulty to pull off, which really limits the ability to develop a story around the characters. Being able to film inside will increase the diversity and quality of stories, and it\u0027ll help me with some of my more long-term ideas! If I may make a request, seeing as the mod is still fairly early in its roadmap, would it be possible to create the possibility to free-IVA, without a Kerbal being attached to the camera? Otherwise there\u0027s a potential issue of a Kerbal always being missing from the scene, in order to get the shot. If this is not possible, I\u0027m sure we can work around it. We\u0027ve been working around many other things for a long time now!\n\nKeep up the amazing work! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"pedro16797","CreatedById":156159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T14:29:57Z","Content":"Hey [@pizzaoverhead](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/26349-pizzaoverhead/) how is it going?
