The larger dish is an ordinary RADAR altimeter. The angled thingy at the top is another RADAR sensor that measures wind speed. The other small bits are different sensors. To acquire elevation data, ERS 1 and ERS 2 were used in a tandem configuration with one satellite following the other a short time later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you can see this is quite possible with more \u0022fun sized\u0022 sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BFGfreak","CreatedById":57395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T10:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about something that deploys like a solar panel and possibly set up so that it automatically orients itself with the celestial body it\u0027s currently in it\u0027s SOI for?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damny","CreatedById":78621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T10:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell..not to happy with the textures still...but if yall want to play around...I got 2 part done....ish=P\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I like the way the MapTraq looks on your screenshots, but to be honest, if you just \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.livewallpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sci-fi-digital.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ere-use\u003C/a\u003E some \u003Ca href=\u0022http://flyawaysimulation.com/images/downloadshots/15357-fsx-fokker-60-standard-panelzip-47-nav-com-panel-ltn.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epictures\u003C/a\u003E you found on the internet then I don\u0027t really want to re-distribute it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T13:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I downloaded both from CGT...a website used commonly by 3d artists for building asset library.....you can find several other mentions of the same site on these forums, esp in modeling\u0026amp;texturing subforum...but whatever...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phuzz","CreatedById":71882,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T13:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just pick a good looking part of a SCANsat map and use that as the texture.
