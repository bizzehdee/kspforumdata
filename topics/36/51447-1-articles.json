You don\u0027t have any way of altering the looks. The first three coordinates determine the position of the emitter (where the effect starts) and the second set of three determines the angle that it projects (where 0=0 and 1=90, so a 45degree angle would be .45).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a bunch of pre-made effects, and they can all be merged together, so maybe you could experiment with several effects and see if one works best for you.
