It\u0027s like the scatterer adds more and more \u0022white light\u0022 the farther the terrain is.  But scattering is not \u0022light addition\u0022, it\u0027s just \u0022light deflection\u0022. It is at its strongest intensity when there is a lot of light, and the scattering gets more dim near sunset/sunrise, and totally absent in night.  \n\nMy idea is that the scattering must be some kind of \u0022transparency gradient\u0022. The farther object will be overlapped by a fully opaque color (this color must be the color of the \u0022far\u0022 sky), then the overlapping gradient color becomes gradually transparent when the terrain gets nearer and nearer to the observer.  \n\nSometimes in the summer I observe that far mountains gets totally invisible because there is a lot humidity in the air. So the terrain very far gets the same color than sky. In a very dry day, we can see the mountains at their real color because there is no scattering (no humidity).  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![tkQmhC6.png](https://i.imgur.com/tkQmhC6.png)\n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-28T02:31:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2021 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by JeanRenaud**"},{"CreatedByName":"JeanRenaud","CreatedById":176915,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-28T03:29:01Z","Content":"Well maybe it\u0027s the sky that is too dark.
