I will be breaking out my slow-boat Alternate History based RO parts in this thread. The two primary items which will be covered here are Eyes Turned Skyward (in conjunction with the main ETS thread), as well as my own person pet project, which is a reimagining of the STS. ETS will come in bits and pieces, as I have time, and my STS might be a little more of a concerted effort, although I\u0027m not sure at this point. Modeling on both is in progress.\n\nSaturn-IE/F/G\n\n![TyMaZV5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TyMaZV5.jpg)\n\nMy little pet STS project is based on the HG-3 engine, which, in our timeline is a derivative of the J-2, which lead to the creation of the SSME. This speculates on a rational, expendable booster based Space Transportation System, to meet both NASA, and Air Force needs in a cost effective manner. It will include vehicles from the late 70\u0027s to the present day. The 6.7m Saturn IV-B is used as the basis for the common core diameter, UA1207 boosters as the primary solid during the initial production run, and something like the STS SRB as an upgrade in the 1990\u0027s.

As E of Pi had mentioned, they didn\u0027t go into how the actual tank construction may impact the appearance of the tank. Based on the stated fuel mass capacity, and the height of the stage, a non-common bulkhead seemed to be the baseline calculation. So while it doesn\u0027t look identical to some of the diagrams on the wiki, it should now be construction accurate.\n\n![OrAnDNN.png](http://i.imgur.com/OrAnDNN.png)\n\n![OqjwaAd.png](http://i.imgur.com/OqjwaAd.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:16:51Z","Content":"Awesome!
