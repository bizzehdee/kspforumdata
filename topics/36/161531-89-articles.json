Excellent stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things I\u0027ve noticed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. While resource generation/accumulation occurs in the background, consumption does not. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware of this already, but it does mean that in some situations (particularly fusion reactions), you can get pretty much unlimited fuel out of a reactor as long as it\u0027s not your active vessel. I\u0027m not even sure I want this to be changed, as it\u0027s saved my neck quite a few times!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I had some real issues using the warp drives. Not operating them in-game, but getting the correct models to work. Some of the attachment nodes in the models are inverted (attaching items to the top of a 2.5m WD results in the attached item being stacked underneath the node). Some still use the regolith resource conversion module (no longer included in USI mods as it\u0027s now stock). There are two folders for warp drives, one in the electrical folder and one in the engines folder, and even using the supplied patch some still appear in the \u0022Experimental Rocketry\u0022 Tech node. As I use USI\u0027s Warp Drive, I eventually got frustrated and deleted both folders and stuck with the USI WD. The resource consumption is off, but the effect is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I made use of Hydrolox quite a lot instead of plain Hydrogen, and when electrolyzing water with the ISRU Refinery I appeared to get twice as much Hydrogen as Oxygen. As far as I\u0027m aware, the yield should be about 8 parts Oxygen to 1 part Hydrogen. This caused me a little confusion when attempting to refuel Hydrolox and ending up with a large oxygen debt, but not too much bother as clearly, Hydrogen can be used instead \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch and Tech was a little ambiguous, and there was some confusion over what tech nodes upgrades which components to what degree (if that even makes sense). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, what did I do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I made a Mk2 SSTO with a fusion turboject, that only exploded once or twice, and came in VERY handy for transporting urgent, small amounts of resources or kerbals to/from the orbiting station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fusion powered thermal rockets, with Hydrolox to blast into orbit and Hydrogen for the rest of the way, helped take care of most of the logistics within the Kerbin system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More fusion powered thermal rockets to capture Asteroids, to mine for Karborundum and other resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027ve finished the tech tree, I\u0027m using the Outer Planets Mod so I still have a lot of exploring to do, and lots more KSPI stuff to experiment with \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up I\u0027m going hunting for resources (including antimatter) around this new system, and probably setting up a remote base or station in the best spots.

Exces Oxygen is a bigger problem than excess Hydrogen which can be used for many applications.

Landed in a hotspot (off center but definitely in it) with a refinery \u002B empty tanks of every Uranium resource I could find, started mining and nowt happened. What resources does the miner extract (or what is it meant to), also I can\u0027t get uranium tetrafluoride ammonolysis to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to be able to mine and convert replacement reactor fuel in situ, any plans to overhaul this system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try using the appropriate MKS/OKS drill part in the meantime. I think they use the same CRP uranium resource but happy to be corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cosmonauth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cosmonauth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eas you can see, there are two cargo bays.
