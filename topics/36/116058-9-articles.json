I was finally able to export normals as DXT5\\_nm from GIMP and Kopernicus seems to like them, so I\u0027ve made some incredible progress on the promised solar system. I\u0027ve also changed the star\u0027s name, it is now named \u0027Kobalt\u0027 because it is light blue.\n\nI\u0027ve already got a basic version of a dwarf planet and three gas giants, the giants being clones of Neidon from OPM but with diffrent maps so they\u0027re far from done, but at least they work. One of the giants already got a set of moons, though one of it\u0027s moons is still unfinished, while another might be removed from the final mod because it doesn\u0027t show up.\n\nI\u0027ve tested three of the moons and the dwarf planet so far, all were landable. However, I did notice a strange bug when attempting to land on an asteroid moon with an SOI of 24km: all planets, including my own, just shot out of their orbits. I also had OPM installed, and even those planets left their orbits. Only Neidon, Plock and the giant whose system I was exploring stayed in their orbits. I was able to solve it by warping myself to another planet with Hyperedit (I\u0027m using Hyperedit to get to the new moons right away so I can test them).\n\nSo, either my mod is making the game unstable or Hyperedit and Kopernicus do not like each other. I\u0027d guess the latter one, for Hyperedit can also change a planet\u0027s orbit which might conflict with Kopernicus. I\u0027ll just hold my fingers crossed and hope the issue goes away when I remove Hyperedit from my game..."},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T23:43:20Z","Content":"Galactic Neighborhood Alpha v0.0.4\n\nDownload\n\n[TABLE=width: 100]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center][![5IdGJ3n.png](http://i.imgur.com/5IdGJ3n.png)](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/releases/latest)\n\n**@GitHub**\n\n[![devBuild-%40GitHub-lightgrey.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/devBuild-%40GitHub-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/archive/Development.zip)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[**report issues here**](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/issues)\n\nChangelog\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]\n\n    [B]v0.0.4[/B]- Now Requires Kopernicus 0.4.0- Added compatibility with RSS- Added compatibility with Sylandro\u0027s Planet Warehouse- Added compatibility with finalizeOrbits- Binary systems can now be removed from the GN stars (optional)- Rearranged folder structure- Preparing to add compatibility with rescale mods.- Automatic generation of BrightnessCurves for all stars- Automatic generation of powerCurve for all stars- Increased barycenters\u0027 radius to 61 meters- Fixed Cloud compatibility for OPM system\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T00:40:20Z","Content":"Planet suggestion #2!\n\nA brand new planet pack called Kronkus. \n\nLooks fairly well made, but I haven\u0027t tried it yet"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T07:22:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Planet suggestion #2!\n\u003E A brand new planet pack called Kronkus. \n\u003E \n\u003E Looks fairly well made, but I haven\u0027t tried it yet\n\nI think this is the gas giant MrChumley designed to keep company to his other planet (Asclepius) so it will be an easy addition.\n\nI\u0027ve just sent a pm to him to be sure."},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T10:50:03Z","Content":"I found several in-development packs you should try to add when they are done : The Urania Planet Pack (For Kopernicus) and the Kerbal Outer Bodies expansion."},{"CreatedByName":"The White Guardian","CreatedById":148627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T14:29:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I found several in-development packs you should try to add when they are done : The Urania Planet Pack (For Kopernicus) and the Kerbal Outer Bodies expansion.\n\nOh?
