I\u0027ve run a few craft with EC as the only resource being used, but it tends to eat up a TON of EC no matter how you configure it. I only tried to take one of those engines (made to simulate a Star Trek style impulse engine running off a warp-core reactor as the only fuel source) and make it use only half of the EC and the result was an engine that provided miniscule thrust and required, literally, an infinite amount of EC to function. Since \u003Cem\u003Einfinity \u003C/em\u003Edoes not actually exist, I had to scrap the idea. However, if you instead consumed EC into a generator that generated a miniscule amount of another resource with an extreme efficiency rating at the same rate the engine wanted to use it, you could simulate an engine using EC as its only resource without requiring the supposed infinite EC to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the repulsors being used as engines, i don\u0027t think that would work because they are actually reacting to the surface under them, along with all that gravity mumbo-jumbo (There is no gravity, according to one theory. The earth just \u003Cem\u003Esucks.\u003C/em\u003E) To repulse horizontally, you would need a wall behind you to push against. However, if one were to attach repulsors as an angle behind the craft, and pulsed the repulsion field between high and low settings rapidly, you might produce a sort of \u0022wave\u0022 effect that could move a craft forward. If you also made inverse-repulsors that could pull you back towards the ground just enough to keep the craft at its current height but low enough to not counteract the repulsors from levitating the craft, then you could permanently set the angled repulsors to a higher setting and the constant fighting to repulse the craft to a higher level than the rest of the repulsors are set to would cause the craft to continually move horizontally to relieve the pressure. This could, theoretically, be used to keep a craft from sliding sideways while moving, and possibly even be used to slow/stop a craft. This could also have the effect of creating the ability to steer a repulsor-supported craft without slippage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theory behind this is actually possibly today with normal wheels and hydraulics, as far as the propulsion is concerned. If you have a vehicle which is restricted from moving vertically, and has an angled set of wheels in the back that are made to push downward, the vehicle will attempt to roll one way or the other to relieve the pressure (yes, I know it\u0027s more complicated than that, but this is very basic). If that restriction in vertical movement is at the back of the vehicle, and there is less restriction near the front, then the craft will attempt to roll that direction. Not very useful out in the world, but if we had repulsors in the real world, one could possibly generate a form of thrust simply by repulsing at an angle on the back, and pushing downward just behind the center of that repulsion reaction, thus creating something similar to when you squish the sides of a straw with water in it. The liquid moves to escape the collapsing space in the directly with the least resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as far as I can make out, if the repulsor was not set up to only lift the craft vertically, but instead attempted to push the craft in the opposite direction of the repulsor plate (pointed down, craft moves up) then you might be able to create all of this without making individual parts for each purpose. I figure with regular wheels and a small engine on the back pointed upwards, you could get the same effect by raising the back suspension and throttling up. Of course, that would be very inefficient for a friction-based system like the wheel, and with repulsors you might be better off with some small engines on the back and some RCS stabilization systems pointing every other direction. Even if you didn\u0027t use repulsors for propulsion, it would be awesome to be able to use them for stability by angling them outward from the center of the craft, similar to how a roman archway supported the center stone the craft would settle into this \u0022pocket\u0022 between the inward-pushing repulsors. You\u0027d simply have to input more energy into the repulsors to maintain the same height as you would with vertically aligned repulsors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, inverted repulsors is something I\u0027ve been toying with the idea of for a while now... ever since I discovered the squid-system mod a long time ago, before I even heard of this mod (in fact, before it existed.) EDIT: Squid was/is an \u003Cem\u003EImpossible\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003EInnovations\u003C/em\u003E mod (I think) which provided alternate versions of stock wheels which, when the squid was activated, would attach to the surface it was on and keep all wheels firmly attached while driving. I hated the visual effect associated with the activated squid system, but it certainly worked. It was built with landing on low/no gravity bodies and staying landed. This was before we had claws or even asteroids, but I believe the system would have worked on them too. END EDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Huh. I think you hit a nerve or something.
