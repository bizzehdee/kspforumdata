I had to write a little plugin to turn the lift of the wings to 0 when stowed. I have written the plugin in such a way that different kinds of movable wings are possible, I just need to set the lift for both configurations of the wings. It also wouldn\u0027t be a stretch to add other variables to the plugin for any type of part, so long as that variable is in a cfg already.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T21:48:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by electronicfox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:42:58Z","Content":"Does it take alot of SAS to keep the bleep level and just love the parts great job indeed ![screenshot0.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/UFO/screenshot0.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nEDIT- LOL after posting and looking at the picture guess, I could have checked the weight of the cockpit and the engines maybe cockpit weighs more."},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T01:31:38Z","Content":"The Main wings don\u0027t have any lift..."},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T07:27:49Z","Content":"They work fine for as far as i can tell.
