These parts will not be available in the editor anymore.

Just as trivia, I think a .version file is useful even if it\u0027s just in the package and not online anywhere -- not AS useful, granted, but it still allows AVC to register the mod in the list of mods and let you know when you update KSP that you are still using an old version of the mod, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"daltonater","CreatedById":152634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T18:29:18Z","Content":"I have noticed that its a bit of a pain to attach the new leg wheel parts, but ah, cant win them all.

Configuration: rotating hub, radial attachment point, some structural fuselages for distance, desired KPBS part (attached by its top node to have the floor pointing outward). Apply symmetry as desired.  \n\nBeside planetary bases, for this use it is very nice to have crew parts that are designed to work in an environment with gravity (even though the artificial gravity has no actual gameplay effect).  \n\nA minor issue with this setup is that while the centrifuge is spinning, the IVA meshes seem to ignore the motion of the parts they belong to. But I suspect this is a stock bug - I\u0027ve seen the same happen with stock IVAs when a long craft wobbles significantly. (The IVA stays put at its original position, while the exterior of the craft (visible through the window) wobbles around.)  \n\nThanks for the great mod!"}]}
