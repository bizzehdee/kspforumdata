I am in a brand new game, so doing the things like \u0022launch a vessel\u0022. I\u0027ll build a rocket in the VAB, do simulate and see the contract complete. I end the simulation, then schedule the rocket for completion but contract stays completed.\u003Cp\u003EA first guess is since things like that, and the altitude records, are handled as \u0022Achievements\u0022 maybe that is throwing a loop on things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take a look and see if I can figure anything out on my own before asking for any more info. It\u0027s strange to me that it\u0027s having issues, since the contracts are saved into the save file, which the simulations copy upon starting and overwrite upon completion. I\u0027m about to fire up KSP and see what I can find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Cannot reproduce.
