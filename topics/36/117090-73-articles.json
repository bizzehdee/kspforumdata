While I would -love- to implement it, I would need to know that RO could handle it appropriately; and as this requires creating a dummy/duplicate-fuel type, and RO is....particular... about fuel types, my current methods would not work due to stock limitations (unless someone can tell me how to make an SRB engine -not- consume all of its fuel; I need a fuel reserve for the jettison engine) (for example, RO breaks the BPC auto-jettison feature due to these issues).\n\nI\u0027m not completely done working on it / thinking on it yet though, so I may still find a way to cheat and let it work properly.  Or just let RO use standard decouplers/etc if they don\u0027t want to deal with dummy/duplicate fuel types.\n\nEither way, it will -not- be part of tomorrows release;  I\u0027ve got my hands full with just exporting all the models and doing up the configs (and the data-model changes... see the warning below).\n\nCOM Offset -- as blowfish points out is it mostly unrealistic to adjust the COM of the part -- the COM is set by the distribution of mass, which for an SRB/LRB (and indeed most parts) is mostly physically unalterable.  The one place where this -might- be realistic is in some command pods where the crew can re-arrange gear and/or use a sliding-balast setup.\n\nEither way, the new MSRB\u0027s will be \u0027perfectly\u0027 balanced as far as COM goes.  I have built them, and the module/plugin, in such a way that the center/attach/grab point of the SRB -will- be its COM, and thus you should get nearly-perfectly-straight separation when using the RBDC with a non-offset attachment setup (e.g. just slap the booster onto the RBDC, and it -should- be good).\n\nAlternatively, if/when I add the thrust differential control to the RBDC this will be much easier to setup (though may require some trial/effort/testing or an external tool such as RCSBA to get precise setups).\n\n**WARNING - IMPORTANT :**\n\nTomorrows release will likely break **-everything-**. \n\nI\u0027m in the process of reworking how I store information about various models (height/volume/diameter/nodes/etc) and texture-sets in favor of a more generic, efficient, and capable system.  I had wanted to wait until the 1.1 update to do this (as I would be breaking everything anyway), but I need some of the new features to even get the Modular SRB\u0027s working effectively (mostly texture-set related stuff). \n\nTexture set data will now be stored on per-model basis, so that modular parts where only some of the models have texture sets will work properly, and will allow for different texture sets to be used for each model variant (without duplicate/empty entries).  This change will likely break any existing texture-swap enabled parts (or at least their texture sets will revert to whatever the new default is).  This change is necessary for modular parts where only some of the models have texture-swapping (e.g. engine-mounts where only the delta-iv and shroud types have texture-sets, and nosecones/adapters where the new SRB nosecones will have different texture sets from the existing nosecones even though they will all be usable on the same part).\n\nModel names will now be a more descriptive, as they are all being stored in the same in-memory list, by name, which needs to be unique.  For example, the generic mount has changed from being named \u0027Generic\u0027 to \u0027Mount-Generic\u0027; adapters have been renamed similarly (and multicouplers have had the \u0027:\u0027 removed to fix some module-manager incompatibilities).  This change will break MFTs, Engine-Clusters, and Modular Upper stages that happen to be using any of the effected parts (which is going to be nearly all of them).\n\nModel data is now stored in a set of .cfg of dedicated to this purpose.  Parts that have information such as volume/height/mass/cost/tech/nodes etc stored in their part .cfg file will have this data moved out to the ModelData file (e.g. the MFT tanks, ModularUpperStage parts).  By only storing this information in a single place it cleans up and simplifies setting up new models for use in various parts -- merely setup the model definition once, and simply link to it in the parts .cfg file.\n\n**DO NOT EXPECT YOUR CRAFT TO SURVIVE THIS UPDATE.**  That is why I\u0027m warning you all about it -now-, rather than with the release tomorrow.  This should give you time (or at least fair warning..) to backup your game, remove any craft using SSTU parts, and be prepared to rebuild them with the new release."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T23:57:18Z","Content":"Regarding realism in changing the CoM...

And I\u0027m not familiar enough with the RO/RF fuel stuff myself to know where to even begin setting up the fuel types/densities/etc properly.  No offense was intended, you and Jose seem to be doing an outstanding job on the configs, even with my crazy developments and changes.\n\nIf there are multiple similar-density solid-fuels (or really any fuel; volume doesn\u0027t matter too much for those parts, as long as the fuel-mass is proper...i.e. can fake it if needs be) it shouldn\u0027t be too much of a problem to set it up that way.  That is pretty much the entirety of it -- one \u0027main\u0027 engine module with a main fuel type, and a secondary \u0027jettison\u0027 engine module with its own fuel type.  This ensures that the jettison engines always have a fuel reserve, regardless of if the main engine has been activated or not.\n\nLet me know if you need any help/insight/pointers on getting it set up/fixed up/whatnot; if nothing else I will work on it myself next time I\u0027m working through RO configs."},{"CreatedByName":"stratochief66","CreatedById":59541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T01:42:57Z","Content":"I should be able to figure out the boost covers myself, i was looking at the code just now.\n\nAll the new part breaking changes in the next release, I would definitely appreciate if you could make a pull request on the RO repo to help us adapt to that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T02:14:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 27 minutes ago, stratochief66 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I should be able to figure out the boost covers myself, i was looking at the code just now.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E All the new part breaking changes in the next release, I would definitely appreciate if you could make a pull request on the RO repo to help us adapt to that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nAbsolutely; although I expect the changes to RO patches to be minimal -- its more that it will break existing (in-flight or saved) craft due to plugin-side variables changing and possibly not initializing properly and/or reverting to the new default values.\n\nWill know more tomorrow sometime; I\u0027m just now getting into working on making the changes... work -- testing things in-game and getting all existing stuff back to working state."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T18:57:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **WARNING - IMPORTANT :**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Tomorrows release will likely break **-everything-**. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **DO NOT EXPECT YOUR CRAFT TO SURVIVE THIS UPDATE.**\n\u003E \n\nOh great!

Length increments are determined by the segment-length for that model (2.5m, 3.2m, 5m).\n- Auto-decouple/jettison motors are NOT yet working\n- Texture-sets/swapping is NOT yet enabled (for any of their models/mounts/noses)\n- Mass stats do not yet take into account the fixed-motor mass for a diameter\n- Nosecones and nozzles are fully WIP, not even the geometry is done, and certainly not any textures. They are included for initial prototype testing/fitting only, and will likely all undergo substantial changes.\n- THE MSRB PARTS ARE WIP AND MIGHT HAVE BREAKING CHANGES BEFORE THEY ARE DONE.\n\n![U9OVmKN.png](http://i.imgur.com/U9OVmKN.png)\n\n![xcSQ12X.png](http://i.imgur.com/xcSQ12X.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T01:06:26Z","Content":"AWESOMENESS!!! \\*Goes to build new SLS rockets\\*. \n\n[@Jimbodiah](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152759-jimbodiah/): SSTU J-2X clusters are broken."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T01:09:05Z","Content":"I think a lot of things are broken with the new update ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)    I\u0027ll make some new ones tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T01:34:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 25 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think a lot of things are broken with the new update ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)    I\u0027ll make some new ones tomorrow.\n\u003E \n\nCool.  \n  \n[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/): Will the old SRBs eventually be deprecated?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T02:04:30Z","Content":"Mage, these things look awesome!!!!
