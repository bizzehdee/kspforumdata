The fire limits prevent you from firing if you are trying to aim at something that is outside the range of motion of the turret. Since you set yours to not be able to yaw, it will never be in range unless you put your mouse exactly within its plane of motion. Turning off fire limits lets you fire it even if your mouse is not within the range of motion. It\u0027s useful for any fixed turret, or like in your case, a turret fixed to one axis. I made it automatically free the limit when both axes are set to zero, but I guess I need to make it happen when any axis is zero.

I thought it was a fun idea so I gave it a shot and ran into the dilemma of whether or not the slow projectiles would carry the initial velocity of the moving vessel or just spawn at the location of firing and only have the muzzle velocity and direction from that spot (which is how lasers work in most scifi games). The problem with the first was that you would have to have lead your target by a huuuge amount because of the slow projectile velocity. The problem with the second was it was very easy to be moving quicker than the muzzle velocity of the projectile, so after firing forward, it would be moving backwards relative to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N00bst0rm","CreatedById":117934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T00:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan somebody give me the download link for the tracks mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T00:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBahamutoD, do you plan on exploring the niche of electric weapons a bit more?

Why not make the nukes not really \u0022insta-kill\u0022 except for kerbals and low crash tolerance parts. Structural parts such as Structural plates or anything with high tolerance should be able to withstand a nuclear blast (And also the KSC buildings, given they are supposedly designed to be strong and handle rockets inside of them). High structurally tolerant parts, when flying or not really bolted down to the ground with a craft (On the ground of course) with high mass should go flying off into the air. As with high structurally tolerant parts \u0022bolted down to the ground\u0022, i mean parts attached to vessels with high mass on the ground would not fly off and would protect anything from a nuclear blast, This could be interesting because somebody could make some kind of nuclear bunker made out of structural plates and it could protect anything inside it from a nuclear blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if i look like a fool.
