Prior to 0.21, these namespaces were blocked from loading and any attempts to access them would result in a security exception. KSP.IO was provided to give modders much of the same functionality, but in a sandboxed form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 0.21, these namespaces are no longer blocked and can be used again. However, we still ask that you continue to only access files within your sandbox. This will not be enforced, but it will make things much easier when we move to the new mod management system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
