Fixing that got me RCS, but the rear thrusters appear to be firing perpendicular to their actual orientation. The makes attitude control problematic to say the least, particularly during OMS burns.\n\u003E \n\u003E During initial ascent, she really doesn\u0027t want to pitch over, and max-q gets way higher than the real thing, even with half-throttle (lower than the actual engines could throttle) set at launch. I saw max-q of 50,000 pa. Maybe too much thrust in the SRBs? After SRB seperation TWR is right about 1.0 so that seems right. \n\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of SRB Sep, those things go nuts at separation. usually banging into the ET, with a lot of rotation applied to them. I looks like the nosecone rockets are way to powerful. I know the real things separate while still producing a small amount of thrust so I experimented with that with mixed results, even right before they burn out with less than 5% rated thrust they still try to outrun the orbiter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*edit\\* I\u0027ve been going through the numbers and the SRBs are overpowered and way too light. The SRBs weigh half as much as they should and have a good 10% extra thrust. As a test a set them to half thrust in the VAB to get a 1.5T TWR and that resulted in a much more reasonable ascent, still with a crazy separation though.\n\nI haven\u0027t forgotten about this, but hard to find time to edit.\n\nif anyone can make some good changes I will be hapy, and update this"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T15:39:23Z","Content":"I\u0027m having problems with the crawler as far as control... if I put all the tracks on straight, the support stick out on the right side and it looks weird, but I can drive straight, but I can turn.
