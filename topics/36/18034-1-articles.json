Selecting a part on either table and double clicking moves it from one column to the other. Multiple selections are supported of course. The buttons on the lower left are \u0022Add part\u0022 which opens an Open File dialog, \u0022Remove Part\u0022 which can be used to delete a part from the file system permanently ( once it\u0027s moved to the Available column ) and \u0022Edit Part\u0022 which will eventually bring up a part editor dialog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other tabs are a work in progress: Missions will show the contents of persistent.cfg and provide editing capabilities, Plugins will show plugin information and Inventory will be a more detailed view of parts. I also plan on a Ship tab to manage installing ships and comparing ship part lists with installed/available parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t worked out how I will distribute it yet, I wrote this mainly for myself and my kids.

It\u0027s my understanding that Squad wants support programs to follow the same rules as plugins and parts, specifically have a license and distribute source code. I set up a github account and have started setting up the respository for the code, however I\u0027m stuck behind a restrictive corporate firewall at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on the plugin version problem right now. The plugin DLLs are in PEF (portable executable format) which isn\u0027t natively supported on Mac OS X ( obviously ), so I\u0027m having to roll my own methods of decoding a PEF file to get at the version information. Then I can start doing interesting stuff like de-conflicting plugins that come from different part distributions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the github repository is live, I\u0027ll post over in \u0022Tools \u0026amp; Applications\u0022 with a formal announcement.
