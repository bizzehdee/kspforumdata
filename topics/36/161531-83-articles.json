Second, due to the high core temperature, the fuel flow will be low, too low to overcome the static presure of the atmosphere. THe noozles are optimized foroperation in zero atmospheric presure.

You can now safely use a thermal generator, direct energy converter, magnetic nozzle and therml engines at the same time. The Electric generator can take as much as possible and thermal/magnetic engines can only take what is left. The smal helium and hydrogen reseviors serves as an indicator of the produced fusion ash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll fusion process create nuclear ash, most of the time, only He4 but some are more usefull, like Trtium Catalyzed D-D Fusion, which produce Helium3. As you should know He3 is incredible usfull when you need to maximise electric output with D-He3 fusion. For a complete list, look at the reaction table on the OP.
