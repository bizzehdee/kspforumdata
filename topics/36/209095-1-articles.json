So what is this \u0022rescale\u0022 parameter? is it stock or something you did? Just curious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a few minor issues...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI noticed 2 BB8 files in the GonkArm folder... maybe misplaced? There were many droid texture warnings when KSP loaded but the arm looks OK.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen placing the arm\u00A0in the editor, the part is offset from the cursor a lot so it\u0027s difficult to place it where you want it, especially when holding ALT for node attachment. I managed to do it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe attachment node is just very slightly off center\u00A0from the axis. It might cause some\u00A0torque when pushing asteroids but it\u0027s not that bad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen right-clicking the arm (in the editor), the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E leader line is\u00A0pointing nowhere near the center of the part. It\u0027s coming from a point way down in the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen hovering the mouse over it, it highlights green when the pointer is not actually over it. It is OK in the axial direction but the highlight radius is about 1.5x the real radius. If that\u0027s the only issue it\u0027s not bad but I wonder if the collision mesh is also too big and there could be krakens.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the main issue I see is the length... it\u0027s just way too long to move asteroids around on the end. I want compress it to about 10% of it\u0027s present length so it\u0027s similar in shape to the stock klaw. Any idea how to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help you can give me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-26T16:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203523-krazy1/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022203523\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203523-krazy1/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Krazy1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi. Never expected you to rescale it to such an extreme, it is no wonder that the game had trouble getting all the colliders correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrescaleFactor is a stock parameter. 1 is the mesh size, 2 is twice the mesh size, You made it 650 times bigger, The game couldn\u0027t cope and that is why it is all mucked up. The BB8 and BB8E dds files are the texture files that the model uses. Main and emissive in this case and are meant to be there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry setting rescaleFactor to 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will see about throwing together a klaw sized one for you and contact you in a PM with a link.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
