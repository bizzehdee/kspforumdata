I do know of another similar bug that lets you build craft with parts you shouldn\u0027t have access to (because you finished a contract with that part). I may actually allow that, since I think you should still be allowed to use the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimulations: I prefer using in-game time for the simulations and feel the benefit of restarting a simulation is mitigated by the fact that you can\u0027t make changes to the craft at all.

I found out how to override the KSP launch button while rewriting the editor GUI. Pressing it opens a small window where you can choose to build or simulate. Building won\u0027t ever kick you out of the editor because you may want to build multiple copies of the same ship or continue working on other vessels. The point of KCT is multiple missions at once (and when you have multiple rates you may be building multiple ships for one launch window. Getting kicked out of the VAB each time you add a ship to the list, then having to reenter the editor over and over is not fun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may look into some integration with EL after release.
