Secondly, the Science Power Module was cancelled nearly 5 years ago. Any pictures you\u0027ve seen of the ISS with that on it are severely outdated. Here is a picture of the ISS on orbit, as taken by the crew of the STS-132, the second to last space shuttle to dock to the station, back in 2010. The only difference is the AMS module on the S3 Truss, and the ELC-3 on the P3 Truss.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, the Science Power\u003Cstrong\u003E Platform \u003C/strong\u003Ewas canceled. SPMs, on the other hand, are still very possible. They\u0027re part of the OPSEK project, which may be assembled docked to ISS. Oh, and FGB-2 will most definitely launch. Just give it some time, it\u0027s already built and only needs to undergo some cleanup/repair work. Two of it\u0027s parts are already up there, with the Rassvet module.

Minor ones, mostly. I\u0027m currently in (slow) process of building the ISS using the CSS, for testing purposes. So it\u0027s nearly working, should be ready for release. When an actual upload is coming is up to BobCat. If I find no real bugs with the ISS during construction, I\u0027m gonna pester BobCat about releasing the update. I\u0027ve also added an NFP-derived radiator and solar panel for the ISS (already launched the latter, but not the former.
