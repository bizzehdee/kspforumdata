(I get about 2800 m/s from Minmus surface to LKO and back; you could throw in some Aero braking to shave that a bit on the way down.). With no LV-Ns ~35% delivered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting your construction station 700 m/s above LKO (about 3/4 of the way to Mun) would get delivery up to maybe 70%. Of course that would make it 700 m/s farther away from Kerbin for its other deliveries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay wise it depends on what you find fun. I like getting funds from missions and will use the Davon supply module to get things delivered into Kerbin orbit. (Costs more than would pay to do it by hand, but avoids the tedium of repeated supply launches).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, you could use a supply shuttle to move between Kerbin and Minmus SOI combined with the Orbital Logistics module from MKS/OKS to make delivering fuel from Minmus a lot less tedious (although you would still end up using a lot of fuel mass to get the deliveries made.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks! I think I\u0027ll have some sort of orbital cargo ship to go between Minmus and Kerbin, since I also want to deliver Rocket Parts manufactured at the same site. The base is built with MKS, so I may use the logistics modules (assuming you mean the inflatable storage modules, right?). I also try and use USI\u0027s Freight Transportation mod, although I think part of the problem is that honestly I\u0027m really bad at building efficient things like that. Takes a lot of trial and error! Maybe I\u0027ll look for some advanced tutorials on YouTube. I\u0027ve got the whole TWR and Delta-V thing down, but clearly I\u0027m missing something, hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Floppster","CreatedById":92677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T14:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way of increasing the range of the particle collector or is that hard coded?

I just need to know if there is anything specific I need to get started working with karbonite code - specifically what is your setup, what do you use, and what exactly would I be importing and modifying in my own branch? I guess I\u0027m just looking for a basic how-to guide to get started and setup.

That is something internal to ORS, doesn\u0027t have anything to with karbonite itself. So you would have to go get the source code for ORS and change it there, and from what I have read making those textures transparent is allot harder than it sounds, FractalUK was saying it would take a significant amount of work to get it to do that. So good luck, if you can do it you are awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hevak","CreatedById":122200,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T23:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there is no more scan sat integration for this?
