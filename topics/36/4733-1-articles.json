We started stealing... um borrowing... without asking... or returning these parts to mass produce and so far success has followed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would remind you that all the parts involved in this... part belong to C7Studios. Except the lead. That belongs to the nuclear reactor shielding in the Vehicle Assembly Building. But shhhhhh. Noone need know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese provide a nice way to hold down your custom launching stack when you are tight on fuel. They reduce the acceleration time by allowing you to keep the main tank fueled until you drop the stack so you already have power built up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS IS NOT A FUEL TANK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU DO NOT WANT THIS ON YOUR SHIP AFTER IT HAS LAUNCHED\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHESE WILL EXPLODE ON CONTACT WITH THE GROUND\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU CANNOT STACK THEM SAFELY (still)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rockboy3970","CreatedById":12374,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-23T19:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould this be here?

I just needed something to hold down my accelerating rocket while it was in prelaunch - proignition stage. Tanks with the fuel replaced with lead seems to work.
