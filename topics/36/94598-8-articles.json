I do have a question about thermal mechanics though, i started a career when waste heat was not working so i have a number of ships in the middle of missions without proper heat radiation. I have my warp plugin settings set as: ThermalMechanicsDisabled = True however i am still getting waste heat. I have started putting radiators on my missions launched after the update but I wanted to disable this until they all return. Do you have any suggestions as to why this doesn\u0027t disable? do i have to edit a save file or put the plugin setting file in my save folder?
