It\u0027s decisively simpler than making all parts of propellant and can be done virtually anywhere by \u0027just\u0027 heating feedstock to a high temperature (in a process called Molten Regotlih Electrolysis). It also doesn\u0027t require any inputs except energy. Conversely making both oxidizer and fuel out of ore or even water is quite complicated (taking into account all requirements that accompany off-world manufacturing) and energy intensive process - to such an extent that even known papers about it seems to not get past theoretical stage (G. Landis and others). For now the most advanced in testing, simplest and reliable technology assumes making only oxidizer part of fuel. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELower processing speed\u003C/strong\u003E - the most advanced MRE ISRU designs currently tested (on the picture above) are able to make about 10t of oxidizer a year assuming continuous operation (on the picture above).In comparison a small stock ISRU is able to churn out the same amount of oxidizer in an hour (0.55 unit/s * 5 kg per unit * 60 * 60 = 9.9t). Therefore my mod is going to rebalance small and normal ISRU\u0027s LOX production to about 28t and 160t per Kerbin year (1.2 and 6.6 jumbo tanks accordingly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncreased weight\u003C/strong\u003E - in reality MRE regolith\u0026gt;oxidizer making system (so ISRU\u002Btanks\u002Bpower source) has a weight efficiency of about 5-7 (measured as a weight of oxidizer production per year divided by ISRU system weight). Therefore meeting production quota above (28/160t) would require much heavier ISRU units. Again I\u0027m happy with approximation to reality so the mod make small ISRU weigh 2t and large 8t. Moreover large ISRU is much more efficient so there is a reward for bringing larger ISRU to the planet\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELower technology requirements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E- by moving tech requirements earlier the main difficulty is moved from researching the technology to actually making it work. So the player would need to send and ISRU system in advance to produce fuel (so similar to assumptions of some current MARS/Moon missions). It should create interesting situations when player can utilize ISRU before upgrading science compound in a career game. Therefore with careful planning he can extend the range of lower tech rockets and reach further planets so the gameplay could be more interesting in early career compared to late game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:10pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEnergy demands \u003C/strong\u003Efor small isru remain unchanged at the moment.

Still my main issue is the op-ness of LV-N compared to other engines. So for now I\u0027m stopping dev of this version of the mod and moving to something a bit different (vintage rocket type mod - simulates space exploration to 2010\u0027, so probably no LV-N at all (by design, harder gameplay and more in-line with current designs like mars direct etc) however more refuelling options and more efficient high-tech (or high-toxic) engines that reach about 450isp (or even 500isp) in the end game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T16:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nworking on custom tanks for the new vintage rockets mod; going to do a lot of conceptual work so tanks are consistent along with all the piping and stuff.
