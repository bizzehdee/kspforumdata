Basically I\u0027m doing (yet another) engine parts pack. I\u0027ve got it working fairly well, and I think balanced too. But it seems that new models and textures will be the real hang-up. If anyone is interested in lending a hand I wouldn\u0027t turn them away.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What I really need is a re-paint of 2 fuel tanks, and at least a re-paint of 3 engines or some guidance in getting the files into GIMP and back out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Or, if someone can point me to a guide on how to combine 2 or more stock meshes and textures in the .cfg. I have had some luck in making some more distinctive engines in-game by putting multiple parts together. If I could find a way to do this in the .cfg it would probably serve for the short term. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks in advance for any help you might provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T18:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know this feel, I\u0027m trying to get help with that thing too, whats the new resource?

Prior to that, I only had experience making graphics with a paint program. I barely knew what a vector was. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust over 3 months ago I had a brainstorm much like yours and wanted to make some parts. I began designing a few parts, learning how to texture them, make animations and write my own .cfg files. Now, my parts pack has over 40 parts and is well over 20,000 downloads and it\u0027s still going. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I still consider myself a noob at modding, I look back at the first parts I released and realize just how far I\u0027ve come and just how patient the fans of this game are. They\u0027ve tolerated some really horrible parts, some bad designs, some ugly textures and still... encouraged me throughout my learning process and continue to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best advice I can give you is... dive in. Make your own parts, your own .cfg and when you\u0027re ready, which is the stage I\u0027m at now, your own plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027ll warn you, it\u0027s not easy. Documentation is almost non-existant and you\u0027ll be digging for every scrap of info you can get. Search engines will become your friend and this forum your mentor. And, if your mod becomes popular, you\u0027ll be juggling lots of balls trying to balance what you do know, what you want to learn, what your audience wants and a forum thread full of comments, questions and ideas. Your free time will become engulfed with modding. I haven\u0027t fired up my \u0027game\u0027 copy of KSP since I started this journey. You will give up a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can safely tell you that once you see your parts in someone else\u0027s YouTube video or other modders begin making parts based around your parts and your ideas... all the labor, effort, pain, aggravation and disgust... suddenly vanish and you realize that you have become a KSP modder. It\u0027s a good feeling. A really good feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you luck gents.

I think I have the mod roughed out. I\u0027ve reconfigured existing parts to make 3 new engines and 2 new fuel tanks, added a new propellant resource. Only 2 of the engines are tri-propellant, the other is a gap-filler intended to fill what I see as a gap in the stock thrust range. I\u0027m considering pushing out the mod as just .cfg files for now, as it seems like it will take me quite a while to learn to even re-paint existing models, let alone build new ones.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
