After a ton of work (and a LOT of patience from my modding partner WaRi), we are pretty much code complete with the core features. This has been an absolute blast to code!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the rundown on how things work. Some slight variation from the video, but not much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The probe when attached determines the asteroid composition. This is critical, gotta do this. What it determines is the presence of three kinds of rock: Frozen, Basic, and Enriched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Jaw converts mass into rock (plain rock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Probe automatically converts a tiny amount of plain rock into one of the special kinds of rock (frozen, basic, and enriched) based on the asteroid\u0027s makeup. Makeup is tied to the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The converters take the specialized rock and turn it into stuff (fully configurable) such as ore, minerals, water, karbonite, etc. based on type. Yes, someone could cheat by moving a bunch of rock, but the type makeups are so close, and the cost so heavy that it would not be very possible. Plus you\u0027re stuck converting all three types whether you like it or not (if you try to move simple rock). So in the end, pretty much not worth the trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The Karbonite converter can also convert plain rock into rock dust. This is fuel for the mass driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe last two bits I am working on are the tank to hold rock dust, and the mass driver engine itself. The mass driver engine will be a higher thrust lower ISP ion drive, but not nearly the thrust of a traditional rocket engine. Basically in the same neighborhood as the nuke. Worthless in atmospheres, only work in a vacuum, and run off of rock dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post whatever I have done tonight - no promises on the mass driver, and I am pestering WaRi for a bit of model work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T03:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EDEV RELEASE IS UP! \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch the video... see the notes above.
