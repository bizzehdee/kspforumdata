Like most people I\u0027ve dabbled with making mods (me with little success) mainly due to a flat idea, but thanks to the inspiration from \u003Cstrong\u003EJcogs Nostromo\u003C/strong\u003E, I decided to make my first proper mod a similar theme, the U.S.S Sulaco. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I couldn\u0027t really call it Weyland Corp, for copyright purposes, but you get the idea. I\u0027m also pretty sure the Weyland Corp. did not make the Sulaco, as it was a Government commissioned vessel, but those are the fuzzy details we\u0027ll ignore for now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This is pretty ambitious for me, I know it\u0027s going have alot of hurdles but I\u0027m eager to learn and keep up to date with the new additions. If there is anyone out there that is also a fan of the Alien movies and vessels and wants to come aboard, by all means let me know. I\u0027m ok with the graphics side, what\u0027s really getting me is all the attachment node coordinates and so forth, but I shall persevere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis model was originally created by D Proctor, I managed to get it some 10 years ago! it\u0027s been sitting on my hard drive waiting for a purpose, until now. The biggest challenge so far has been dumbing down the vectors. I have broken it into manageable parts, and now it\u0027s just getting it into KSP, which is going sort of ok.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESorry for not using spoiler tags, I tried but they don\u0027t seem to work..\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo Section is still way too detailed, it needs to be sersiously cut down (without comprimising the detail too much)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=66EE_50752C8B\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=66EE_50752C8B\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drop ship will be the second project I try and tackle after this. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe master plan that most likely will take me forever, is to have the drop ship as the actual kerbal pod, and it drops from the\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESulaco and leaves it in orbit, but has a docking clamp that allows you to re-attach and fly the sulaco elsewhere. Ambitious, yep.. I am fully aware of that and expect alot of failure along the way!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe texture I am trying to keep simple, it\u0027s a stock 512x512 69k texture that I\u0027m laying on pretty much all the pieces that are visible in flight. The picture above, the red parts indicate the textured sections, the other sections are still under construction. The main fuel tank is also the only part that currently has been imported - I am making sure each part works perfectly before putting it all together. I have checked out the Nostromo in depth and thanks once again to jcogs, I have learnt a hell of alot about simply putting such a large ship into the game. I will be using alot of other mods to get it all to work, but will thank all those people when I actually get it working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=BD4C_50753011\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=BD4C_50753011\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for reading, I will be updating this thread regularly! And once again, if anyone is keen to come aboard you are more than welcome, I am barely scratching the surface making mods.
