You land all your MKS modules, have a nice cozy surface setup for your Kerbals to be self-sufficient food wise. Then you add more drills, karbonite processing, and soon enough you land the big Mk3 modules and start off-world manufacturing. Add a Launch Pad to the mix, and your computer lags itself into oblivion every time you switch to your \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EK\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eetroit\u003C/em\u003E outpost... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s take the other approach. You land your ships after a nice survey on a nice spot on Minmus. You build a surface outpost, but you realize that this is such a sweet spot you hit resource-wise, you want to build your fleet of kolonization vessels from there. So you send your tunnel boring machine up, and hook it up to your base. Soon enough, \u0022empty space\u0022 gets created and associated with the tunnel boring machine part... When you get up to a certain point, you can transform this space for storage, like in ART, but you\u0027d also have the option to \u0022Equip Bunker\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you click on the part\u0027s menu \u0022Equip Bunker\u0022 and a UI shows up to offer you a list of available MKS modules you can add to your underground facility, the underground space required, and their cost in RocketParts. If you click on \u0022Add Module\u0022 then the RocketParts and Empty Space gets deducted from the tunnel boring machine\u0027s resources, and you have access to the added module\u0027s functionality. All the underground modules would share the resources, so if your underground facility has storage for 3500 Machinery, 300 Spareparts, 5000 Karbonite, and so on, your underground Colony Control Center, Biolab, Refinery, Fuel Refinery, Aeroponics, Repair facility, etc. would share it, so if you had modules needing a total of machinery greater than 3500, their operation would proportional to the available Machinery parts stored in the underground part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour huge Minmus sprawling (and lagging...) industrial complex on the surface would now mostly be underground, and from the surface you\u0027d now have a couple of solar panels and lights, your tunnel boring machine\u0027s surface access structure for EVA egress by Kerbals, and a FlexOTube linking your tunnel boring machine to a LaunchPad module on the surface. We\u0027re talking less than ten parts having to be rendered, but with the full functionality of hundreds of parts linked precariously by KAS tubing... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Your underground facility could then grow to hosting hundreds of Kerbals, if not thousands, without any hit on graphic rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great news is you\u0027d now have much more convenience in using your outpost for manufacturing and trade. You\u0027d still need to build a surface outpost first with MKS, set up drilling parts, set up some manufacturing prior to building your underground facility, but once you start building underground, you could drill mine shafts, increase production capacity, increase workspace and living capacity, add more food and oxygen production, as long as you ferry Kerbals to move into the bunker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon enough, you could then take your surface modules, unlink them and move them elsewhere to start another facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the gamaplay balancing, a few notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Community tech tree node required to build underground living spaces should be at the very least Off World Manufacturing or Self-sufficient Outposts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drilling underground space should take some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding facilities should also take some time, similar to building vessels with Extraplanetary Launchpads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There should be an \u0022happiness\u0022 penalty, hence a productivity hit, to living underground... Maybe keep track of how long Kerbals have been down there to justify doing crew rotations, provide a bonus for doing some rover derbies on Kerboldays with your Kerbals, etc. (aka Sundays \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To limit infinite digging from a single tunnel boring machine, the total volume available to excavation should be limited. As a ballpark figure, let\u0027s say no more than 1/100 of the ground volume available, because you need to keep ground above and below your tunnels if you have multiple levels, and to the sides too, so it is a safe value. Also, half of the physic\u0027s bubble is open sky, the other half is ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We do not want underground facilities to overlap, so let\u0027s prevent them from being closer than 2.5 km (physics range) from each other. If they are, the option to \u0022Dig\u0022 on the part\u0027s UI should not be available, or not activate with an error message saying \u0022Another tunnel boring operation is nearby\u0022 ... something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Digging in low gravity is probably easier than on Eve or Kerbin, so maybe the available space should be restrained by the body\u0027s gravity... Ie: you can dig a lot more deeper without collapse on Gilly than Minmus, on Minmus than Duna, on Duna than Eve, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The tunnel boring machine part on the surface, to conserve mass, would increase in mass as digging progresses and resources get assigned to it.... Those 10000 Machinery parts are no feathers. However, it would be ridiculous and quite possibly bug inducing if we end up with something weighing 300 000 tons landed... so maybe a workaround would be needed, I don\u0027t know yet. It depends on how Unity would handle such large figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The process of fitting out an underground facility should require a number of high-level engineers in the tunnel borer. (Level 4 to dig, Level 5 to add equipment). That would also preclude spawning too much bases early in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try to hack together a proof-of-concept with Module Manager and a few existing parts...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T21:15:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cairan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdd the idea for 5-star engineers requirement\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear RoverDude,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to poison your release threads.
