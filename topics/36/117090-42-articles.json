Yes, I could mangle it through code, by breaking the thrust transforms off of the model, repositioning the model, and re-parenting the transforms (requires tracking the exact position and angle relative to the model, which might be different for each model; and you still can\u0027t change the # of transforms, so a 4-port will always be a 4-port).  The problem is that it requires 1:  More code, and 2: more models.  I have enough code and models to take care of already, don\u0027t need to add more anytime soon.  I\u0027m also not convinced on the need for this -- these RCS ports are intended for use on prebuilt parts, where any RCS-arm stuff will already be present and built onto the model (e.g. I do not plan on releasing these RCS ports as individual usable parts; they are intended for me to use as a development asset, to allow for consistent-looking RCS models across the new parts).\n\n-Maybe- at some point in the future I\u0027ll consider this, as I was already considering making a \u0027pre-welded\u0027 set of RCS ports (e.g. all 4 quads in a single part, with adjustment to set the diameter/spacing of them).  At that point it wouldn\u0027t be too much more effort to add the movement/swapping of the mounting arms into the code (would make the arms completely separate models from the quads, so that the transform adjustment does not even come into the equation; just reposition the base model to be correct relative to the arm).  However, these are not planned for anytime soon, if at all.\n\nBasically, no, I will not be having swappable RCS geometry for their initial use cases (where they will be pre-built onto the Service Modules, and used to replace the stock RCS on the modular upper stage parts).  I might consider it in the future, but that will be many months out."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T21:38:44Z","Content":"Screw IVAs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Just need the parts ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nWhy hasn\u0027t Angel released those parts in a mod?

I just kind of \u0027guessed\u0027 at some initial stats.  It probably is a bit light for all the amenities that it has,\n\nYep, the top/interior node (with the decoupler) is intended to be used with the upcoming service module.  However, the SM is not ready yet.  The lower node is intended to be used for... other... setups, and you have to use your own decoupler; the lower node will also have an auto-fairing on it (just like the SC-B-CM with its two node setup).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-13T01:27:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T01:37:13Z","Content":"Yeah I edited the config.

As far as the IVA goes, I can do it for me on this pod and no, i will not complain if something goes wrong. I always back that stuff up anyways.

There is a how to guide on how to do that, except I\u0027ve been messing around with the diffuse textures on the inside and it actually makes a difference, if you are going for the \u0022Pimp My CM\u0022 thing. I\u0027ve done it to all my other 3 man pods that look similar.

For right now, at least until 1.1 comes out, I\u0027m thinking of using mainly the engines from this pack because they are so freaking gorgeous. The other parts are beautiful as well, but the ram limit is hitting me hard, and those are the things I want the most. I seriously can\u0027t wait for the 64bit update... I can finally use all of the wonderful mods I\u0027ve found and wanted without having to take them apart piece-by-piece to stay under the ram limit. Depending on how I prune my mods in a few days I may actually be able to get most, if not all of this mod installed. \n\nKeep up the stunning work, Mage!
