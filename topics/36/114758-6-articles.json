Odd.\n\nOh, how far does the kerbal clip through the roof? Until it hits the ground or somewhere in the middle? Also when climbing up to the roof, does this happen when the kerbal steps on the roof itself or also when walking on the extended sections? I suspect that the separate collider for the top is slightly too thin for the physics engine in some configurations. (In the middle of the module is a separate one to disallow attaching things on the parts where the module extends.)\n\nI experienced this weird thing with the EVA once too, somehow the focus went to another part and not to the kerbal EVA\u0027ed. I\u0027ll have an eye on that.\n\nMaybe also related to that, has anyone experienced weird behaviour when switching to and from IVA\u0027s? Sometimes the IVA button does not work for me, and also sometimes it switches to a kerbal in a part that does not have an IVA...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T07:56:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nils277**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:57:18Z","Content":"He/she drops to the ground and walks out through the hull.
