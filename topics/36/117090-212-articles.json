I am fairly certain that looking trough spinning windows would not feel well too.\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s dependent upon the rotation rate, I imagine. I suppose you could put a camera near the torus, and pipe in fixed video in real time to LCD \u0022windows\u0022 pointing in the direction that the came is facing., as if you are standing on a fixed deck with star trek style artificial gravity. This could trick you into forgetting the rotation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-14T16:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2016 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"}]}
