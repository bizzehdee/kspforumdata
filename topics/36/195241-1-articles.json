This is Paul Furio, the Senior Manager of Engineering at Intercept Games. We\u0027re well underway developing Kerbal Space Program 2, the followup to the smash orbital physics hit game developed by Squad. We\u0027re looking for a talented engineer with graphics expertise who can help us bring the visual polish to the next level, across a variety of platforms. If you consider yourself a GPU Shader expert, have experience shipping games on desktop and consoles, are a team player, and are interested in working with cutting edge technology, we\u0027d love to speak with you! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://boards.greenhouse.io/taketwo/jobs/2160984\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApply today online!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T03:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223813449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195241\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593711590\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205409\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbalChiefEngineer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/2/2020 at 10:39 AM, KerbalChiefEngineer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003Ethe smash orbital physics hit game developed by Squad. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve heard of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSarcasm aside, good luck with the search.

Even though a good handful of the community would be great fits for some of the listed roles over at Intercept they may not have any professional experience although they have had years of experience producing amazing content here for KSP and other games at an amateur level.
