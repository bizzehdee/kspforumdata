Still model not correct.\n\n\\* Messed with Sarvin\u0027s rings. Nlw they are Waaay more detailed. Made them wider too look more like Saturn\u0027s rings.\n\n\\* Remade Sarvin texture to look even more like the original GP2, trough some more advanced image editing tehniques. NovaSilisko would be proud!\n\n\\* Remade Daphy entirely so it looks more like a puffy ball of fluff with some cracks here\u0027n there, like it was originaly supposed to.\n\n\\* Eeloo now orbits Sarvin.\n\n\\* Messed with Fonso\u0027s surface to make a better transition between ScaledSpace and PQS view.\n\n\\* Added custom HD ground textures for Daphy, as a test. They might be implemented for all the other bodies added by the pack if it performs well in testing.\n\n\\* Remade Manai\u0027s rings so they look cooler and as detailed as Sarvin\u0027s.\n\n\\* Remade Manai lava textures to look better.\n\n\\* Remade textures for Faz crystals (BTW unlike regular boulders they seem to work perfectly fine!)\n\n\\* Messed with some of the dwarf planet textures to ma,e them more unique.\n\n\\* K\u002B 2.4 release might only have Manai and one more moon rotating around Keelon, with the others still in development.\n\n\\* Started a partnership for new hartbreaking epic EVE cloud configs.\n\n\\* Prototiped proceduraly generated asteroid textures for Sarvin\u0027s captured asteroids.\n\n\\* Corolet has a new proper comet tail via Kopernicus Expansion.\n\nCheers and stay tuned! The better testing gets, the faster the update will come!\n\nBut here\u0027s a question:\n\nDo you want science and full career intergration in this update, or should we hold science for next update? With the ammount of new futures in this new update, science and career intergration would hold back the update even more, and I\u0027m realy eager to get you guys a stable version.\n\nThis and the fact that the Kopernicus Overlords say that we should have a stable version first, before we have the mod in Add-on Releases. The thing is that... once upon a time... we had a stable version... ;\\_;\n\nAND WE WILL!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T19:13:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by amarius1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sphinx2k","CreatedById":149242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T17:43:33Z","Content":"i would appreciate a bug fix version first.

Perhaps a moon with an icy blue oxygen atmosphere that is fully covered in snow, with huge cliffs, canyons and mountains? Since Keelon is designed after GP3 (though the gas planet was later turned into a desert planet), it\u0027s kinda like a Uranus analog, Jool being Jupiter (Joolpiter) and Sarvin being Saturn (Sarvurn? Satvin?), Keelon would be some sort of weird Uranus analog. The moon described above would be a Kerbalized Miranda analog."}]}
