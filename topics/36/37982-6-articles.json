When i get these part into KSP and we start testing everything out I think the we will be able to gauge where I need to make the changes. And if the high poly models will be usable, if they arent at all Ill adjust and make the changes. I have no issues with the extra work, Im a student and all of this is a learning experience for me. The bottom line is I want to get the most accurate SLS that the game can handle but still be playable, if that means having two versions of some of the parts so be it, no skin off my back more practice for me. My computer is not a good computer to judge performance though I\u0027m Running 2 6 Core Xeon Processors with 64GB of ram and 4 gigs of Graphics memory. Which isnt much use when it comes to this game but its going to be hard for me to judge how well my mod will perform on more realistic computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks CapFlyer for your response and I think building both parts high and low poly versions is going to be a reasonable compromise, and it will make everyone happy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Actually, I think that polycount isn\u0027t the most important thing here.

But I believe you\u0027re right I think the issue with geometry comes with part counts when there are tons of collision meshes interacting with each other, if you have poor collision meshes it can bog the game down.

For example, the RC1 of the ULA pack had an overcomplicated mesh on the Atlas V CCB, it lagged the VAB whenever it was moved, but actually flew fine.

Im posting here the 512, 1K and 2K maps, though a lot of the detail in the 1K and 2K maps are lost in the rendersize but you get the idea. Let me know what you think and if you want to see any changes. Still working on the pipes and what not, but its coming together. Also there are no normal maps yet so this is just straight color map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E512\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C6UBDJk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022C6UBDJk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zkJCLEk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zkJCLEk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8yCigD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U8yCigD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T04:42:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 04:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stevincent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
