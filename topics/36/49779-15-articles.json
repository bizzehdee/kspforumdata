Just before 2nd stage burnout (Ap should be 200-220km, you could tweak it), disable autopilot and drop the nose to the horizon. Engage 3rd (\u00222\u0022) stage just before MECO. After jettisoning the 2nd stage, remember to stage again to activate 3rd stage gimbal and jettison it\u0027s engine fairing. After you pass the Ap (stage still burning), pitch up slightly (5 or so degrees) so that Ap stops to rise. Cut off the 3rd stage when Pe is at the altitude you want it on.
