The core of the mod is, of course, Stevie\\_D\u0027s IXS Enterprise parts, but it also adds several models from KSP Interstellar in order to give more flexibility when building your WarpShip. However, WarpShip itself is not all that compatible with KSP Interstellar and the parts generally do vastly different things. WarpShip also uses quite a bit of code from the USI Alcubierre Warp Drive by RoverDude and Helaeon.\n\nIf you are upgrading from an earlier version of WarpShip, you should delete your old GameData/WarpShip directory or there will probably be issues with textures.\n\nThis mod *probably* won\u0027t break your saves but it is a WIP so I can\u0027t and won\u0027t guarantee anything.\n\nThings I need to work on next:\n\n- More testing and debugging\n- Continue to work on game balance\n- Add new parts that do crazy things\n\n[Download link](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/773/WarpShip)\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/sparkletwist/warpship)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![bYkCHMr.png](http://i.imgur.com/bYkCHMr.png)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E ![5MdvfVR.png](http://i.imgur.com/5MdvfVR.png)\n\n\u003E ![LWxd8jL.png](http://i.imgur.com/LWxd8jL.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **If you aren\u0027t careful about the bubble size, this is what will happen...**\n\u003E \n\u003E ![sJvcaIll.png](http://i.imgur.com/sJvcaIll.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![XA68mqSl.png](http://i.imgur.com/XA68mqSl.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Command Module\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Command Module\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Main Hull\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Crew Habitat\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Mobile Science Laboratory\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Holding Tank\n\u003E \n\u003E - IXS Fuel Tank\n\u003E \n\u003E - Alcubierre Warp Drive\n\u003E \n\u003E - Warp Drive Enhancer\n\u003E \n\u003E - WT-01 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster\n\u003E \n\u003E - WT-02 Quantum Vacuum Thruster\n\u003E \n\u003E - Advanced Science Pod\n\u003E \n\u003E - Advanced Sensor Array\n\u003E \n\u003E - Antimatter Collector\n\u003E \n\u003E - Develocitizer\n\u003E \n\u003E - Jool Gas Collector\n\u003E \n\u003E - Xenon Concentrator\n\u003E \n\u003E - Plasma Reactor\n\u003E \n\u003E - Warp Plasma Tank\n\u003E \n\u003E - Zero Point Generator\n\u003E \n\u003E - Communotron 99-99\n\u003E \n\u003E - Enhanced Inline Stabilizer\n\u003E \n\u003E - Mk3 to 3.75m Adapter (Xenon)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Clamp-O-Tron 3.75m Docking Port\n\u003E \n\u003E - Spacedocks\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWarpShip is a standalone mod, but it borrows extensively from:\n\n- Stevie\\_D\u0027s IXS Enterprise ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92816-NASA-IXS-Class-Warpship-and-Spacedocks-For-KSP-I-and-Stock-KSP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92816-NASA-IXS-Class-Warpship-and-Spacedocks-For-KSP-I-and-Stock-KSP))\n- USI Alcubierre Warp Drive Warp Drive ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798-1-0-Alcubierre-Warp-Drive-%28Stand-alone%29-v0-2-0-2015-04-27](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798-1-0-Alcubierre-Warp-Drive-%28Stand-alone%29-v0-2-0-2015-04-27))\n- KSP Interstellar ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-%28Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp%29-Version-0-13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-%28Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp%29-Version-0-13))\n\nI am simply giving credit where credit is due; none of these mods are required to use WarpShip and in fact will probably clash with it.

If you just included the entire Firespitter plugin, people could just install the new version themselves if something breaks in the plugin.\n\nActually, protecting users from things breaking is why I did it this way: the Firespitter code that I\u0027ve used works with my mod and does what it needs to, so I can just leave it there and let it do its thing. If later versions of Firespitter end up having changes, improvements, or bugs or whatever that would break my mod, this way nobody has to worry about that.

The mod is still a WIP so I\u0027d rather not have multiple different downloads to worry about. That said, the overall mod is not a huge download so you could always just delete all of the parts except IXSCommandModule if that\u0027s the only part you wanted. You\u0027ll still need WarpShip.dll to make the doors function, unless you change it back to using Firespitter by editing the cfg file.
