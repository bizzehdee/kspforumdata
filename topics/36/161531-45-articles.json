I had some plans to create a jump start button (using Electric Power from Batteries), but I haven\u0027t implement it yet. One thing I could do I add some special charge ability to the Omega. It would consume a large amount of Electric Charge until it has enough power to jump start the fusion process. This way you don\u0027t need large amount of batteries. You could charge it if you could generate sufficient amount of power. FOr example the Omega has an output of of 500 MW. To start it, it would require 25 MW. If you have 2 GIgantor Solar Away, it would require 25000 KW / (2 x 24.4 KW/s) / 60 = 8.6 minutes to charge it. Of cource that would be assuming a 100% Capacitator efficiency.
