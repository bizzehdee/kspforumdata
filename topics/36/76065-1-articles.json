However, it is known than the current script attachnode system is bugged and KSP throws anyway any result that isn\u0027t size 1 and just uses size 1. At least, that is my understanding. This bug is supposedly going to be to fixed in 0.24 (I saw Greys mention it). So I\u0027m guessing that if it\u0027s bugged with defining it Unity, it\u0027d also be bugged if attempted to alter in script. I\u0027m further guessing that if that bug is fixed in 0.24, then a plugin might be able to be written. Again, I\u0027m just guessing here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
