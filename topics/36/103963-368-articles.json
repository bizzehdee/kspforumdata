Results are okay but often produce faded or bleached colors that differ quite a bit from the original color. When using HDR or tonemapping through other post-processing mods, scatterer still does this simplified blending, so the results aren\u0027t as good as they could be.\n\nTrue HDR is not supported in Unity when using MSAA, however since I\u0027m ditching that with the new depth buffer approach, I decided to give it another try.\n\nI explored the topic a bit before and the results were always inconclusive. This is still the case, it looks a bit off, the contrast looks a bit weird and I can\u0027t put my finger on what exactly is wrong. However I noticed some small improvements and wanted to share with you these screenshots and see what you think about them:\n\nLeft is regular, right with HDR and tonemapping.\n\n![P85Uvel.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/P85Uvel.jpg)\n\nHDR one looks softer and slightly more balanced somehow but not a big difference overall\n\n![1uvj4Cj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1uvj4Cj.jpg)\n\nColors and gradients on the godrays look more natural here, notice the soft runway lights also\n\n![aGmMVA4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aGmMVA4.jpg)\n\nThe blue color of the atmosphere seems better preserved, the contrast looks unnaturally strong though\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-23T00:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2021 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-23T01:10:08Z","Content":"All the images on the right look better IMO.

I wasn\u0027t sure which project I should notify, so I\u0027m posting in both threads.\n\u003E \n\nI tested KWP when it was first released and didn\u0027t have this issue. At first glance it looks something is wrong with the KWP .dll, maybe a corrupted file? I\u0027m not sure what would cause reflection to throw an exception when simply checking the type.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-29T08:16:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2021 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T12:51:29Z","Content":"Fixing a small pet peeve of modders:\n\n![ivXssix.png](https://i.imgur.com/ivXssix.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T18:21:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fixing a small pet peeve of modders:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![ivXssix.png](https://i.imgur.com/ivXssix.png)](https://i.imgur.com/ivXssix.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nAwesome.

Sorry for the random post out of the blue, but I\u0027ve been trying to get an update for Spectra pushed to address the rainbow clouds in the main menu, and I was curious if I could share my findings with you.\n\nIt seems the rainbow clouds are tied to these five variables:\n\n![uHKskT7.png](https://i.imgur.com/uHKskT7.png)\n\nMessing with these variables does some... interesting things to the main menu.\n\nPreserve cloud colors\\* = True (Main Menu)  \n![wFYLa6q.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wFYLa6q.jpg)\n\nPreserve cloud colors\\* = False (Main Menu)  \n![vBofvRI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vBofvRI.jpg)\n\nAs you can see toggling Preserve cloud colors\\* to False from True, significantly deadens the rainbow effect on the main menus, as well as strengthening their colors a fair amount (notice how the small clouds over the ocean are much brighter with it set to false).\n\nThis would seem like a solution to remove the rainbow colors by simply leaving this value set to False, however doing this completely removes the sunsets from the planet:\n\nPreserve cloud colors\\* = True (Map View)  \n![tr4Y509.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tr4Y509.jpg)\n\nPreserve cloud colors\\* = False (Map View)  \n![ezBLyVM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ezBLyVM.jpg)\n\nThis gets even more unusual when you start messing with the actual number sliders. You can actually get the sunset colors to return if you mess with the values with Preserve cloud colors\\* set to False, though it begins to mess up the main menu again.\n\nImproved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E integration settings (Map View)  \n![Yqhreuh.png](https://i.imgur.com/Yqhreuh.png)\n\nImproved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E integration settings (Main Menu)  \n![K3aEjpI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/K3aEjpI.jpg)\n\nThe main issue I\u0027ve been having is that the main menu clouds seem to follow different color rules than in flight.
