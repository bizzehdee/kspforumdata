More importantly, it should be usable to perform the Sabatier Reaction outside of an atmosphere- allowing one to keep the ISRU refinery in orbit of the planet/moon (Duna in particular, obviously) and simply launch the CO2 into orbit to be reacted with LH2 stored there (possibly harvested from local water/ice, or shipped from Kerbin for mass-leveraging...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECO2 is trivial to liquify (boiling point -57 degrees Celcius) and even to store as a solid (melting point -78 Celcius, that\u0027s what \u0022Dry Ice\u0022 is!)\u003C/strong\u003E Its boil-off is nearly insignificant in the -40 degree ambient temperatures of Low Earth Orbit, and it may actually require some *HEATING* to prevent in from freezing in interplanetary space (which can easily dip below -100 degrees Celcius). So I can think of no reason it should NOT be a harvestable/storable propellant, in fact \u003Cstrong\u003Ein real life, it\u0027s the easiest resource to harvest and store of all the resources utilized in KSP-Interstellar so far!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBy the way, CO2 should have the the following efficiency, ISP, and Thrust values compared to Nitrogen:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThermal ISP:\u003C/strong\u003E 79.78% of Nitrogen (actual ISP and Thrust values vary by Reactor Core Temperature) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElectric ISP:\u003C/strong\u003E 2465.56 s (based on molecular mass, once again 79.78% of Nitrogen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlasma Thruster Efficiency:\u003C/strong\u003E 82% (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rpi.edu/dept/phys/Courses/PHYS4210/S10/EightGasEpsValues.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E*EXTREMELY LOW* dielectric constant at low pressures and temperatures\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-30T02:05:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2015 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micheal rosen","CreatedById":114796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T02:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, ive been doing more testing, and looking at the configs everything is there, the upgrade module is correctly typed into the config file for the part, but i dont know much about this stuff so that might just mean absolutely nothing. and it turns out nothing else is upgrading either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T02:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFreeThinker,\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little more background on why Carbon Dioxide should DEFINITELY be usable as a plasma thruster propellant, as well as a thermal propellant.

There is already precedent for different cryostats requiring different amounts of electricity based on the temperature they need to keep their contents at: a Helium Cryostat requires 8 kW of power whereas a Deuterium/Tritium Cryostat only requires 5 kW!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A 2.5 meter Nitrogen Cryostat requires even less power for its volume, as it has 8 times the volume (I incorrectly thought you had set the volume to only be 4x instead of 8x before, based on a PM you sent me... Turns out the volume was increased 8-fold as it should be, and is correct...) but only 4 time the surface area. As a fuel tank in space this means two things: the heat load on the cooling equipment is less due to having fewer square meters of surface area per liter of volume, and the heat load is also reduced due to the tank having walls twice as thick (a fuel tank in space is a pressure-vessel, and has a \u003Cstrong\u003Elinear\u003C/strong\u003E relationship between volume and tank mass *despite* the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESquare-Cube Law\u003C/a\u003E- this is as a larger vessel has relatively greater stresses on its tank walls, which must thus be proportionally thicker...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you combine these three factors (thicker walls, relatively less surface area, and a higher operating temperature), you find that a 2.5 meter Nitrogen cryostat has approximately 3 times the power requirements (by conservative estimates- the actual requirements are even less) of a 1.25 meter D/T Cryostat (which requires 5 kW). \u003Cstrong\u003EThus, a 2.5 meter Nitrogen Cryostat should only require approximately 15 kW to operate\u003C/strong\u003E (this is a *little* less than 4 times a 1.25 meter Nitrogen Cryostat, due to thicker tank walls and the fact that we rounded up from the 1.25 meter Nitrogen Cryostat\u0027s calculated power-consumption of 3.9185 kW...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you intend to maintain the *SAME* relationship between cost and volume as with a Deuterium/Tritium Cryostat\u003C/strong\u003E (which costs exactly 4958 Funds when empty), \u003Cstrong\u003Ethen a 1.25 meter Nitrogen Cryostat should cost 4958 Funds\u003C/strong\u003E (the Liquid Nitrogen is so cheap as to be negligible in cost- a full 1.25 meter cryostat\u0027s worth only costs around 1 Fund...) \u003Cstrong\u003Eand a 2.5 meter Nitrogen Cryostat should cost 39,664 Funds.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlthough, frankly, I think given the significantly higher operating temperature of a Nitrogen Cryostat, the fact that Liquid Nitrogen Cryostats are a common sight here on Earth (as a biologist, we used LN2 all the time in some of the labs I was in...) and the fact that it doesn\u0027t need to deal with Hydrogen-embrittlement (like a D/T Cryostat does), the Nitrogen Cryostat\u0027s cost should be *significantly* lower than that...
