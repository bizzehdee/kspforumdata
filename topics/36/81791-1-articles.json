A mission will only get one or two shots per item, and if you can\u0027t retrieve the ship you only get a few pitiful points from transmission... I want to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking at doing three things now: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne: Reduce the curve. Just because I took the temperature once doesn\u0027t mean that taking a temperature on that entire planet should be nixed forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo: No more one shots. Look, I get it, it\u0027s a nice idea, but it means I have to make ships almost entirely out of goo and science kits. No.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree: Reduce the transmission penalty on some science. I get it; you can\u0027t learn everything about say, a rock sample or atmospheric sample without the sample right there in your hands. (or a flask or something.) But transmitting a number about the TEMPERATURE shouldn\u0027t lose a lot of value, as it\u0027s just... well, a six digit number at most... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] I\u0027ve managed to make two and three work; now all I need is help making the first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo accommodate people who might not want the goo/kit to be rerunnable, I broke it up into two .cfg files.

If you have researched the item in question, simply carry out the mission as instructed. Testing an item on the lauchpad doesn\u0027t really need the item connected to anything other than a command pod. Connect the item to a command pod. Launch the vessel. Right click the item to test and select \u0027run test.\u0027 Then recover the vessel. Job Done. Full Refund.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen doing the high altitude record missions, only go to the altitude specified and return to the ground. Recover the vessel. There are a number of these missions one after the other at increasing altitudes. Then do the escape the atmosphere then the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring each of these missions which require a flight, it is possible to do some science. Take two of any science experiment available. Perform one at the apogee (highest point) and one when you land. If you are smart, you can try to land in a different biome each time and so get more science. Don\u0027t forget \u0027crew reports\u0027, \u0027eva\u0027s\u0027 and \u0027surface samples\u0027 when landed in new biomes on kerbin still add science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollecting Science is and should be a repetitive process. The thing that changes most is ship design. As you get more of the tree unlocked you get to build better ships and get more science equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a new bit of science equipment? See if you can get a mission which will allow you to use it twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin has biomes. As does The Mun and Mimnus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to get most if not all of the tech tree unlocked, using only The Mun and it\u0027s great many biomes. Mimnus will fill out the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen exploring planets it is more fun to have all of the science equipment available before you go. Even though you may not need the data, it is still fun to collect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently when playing, I tend to challenge myself by accomplishing a grand mission using poor tech. Usually just after I have a docking port and can haul some fuel into orbit so that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have landed on Duna several times and wished then that I had more sciece experiment with me. But what ever I take to duna, I will sometimes take six of the same experiment. Three for duna, and three for ike. In each case the same experiment can be perfomed in high orbit, low orbit, and on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore often I will only take three of everything and just do Duna and return. It is very difficult, sometimes, to take six junior science kits. Three can be challenging enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the goo or the science kit has been exposed to a celestial body, exposing it to another would invalidate both experiments.

No. These digital babies are precise and lock their data in. Sure they will give at-a-glance readings but they only memorise one.

I would advise against doing such a thing if you are an idiot as changing some parts will break your save. I would also advise against doing such a thing if you are smart as the struggle in the beginning can be most rewarding and a great mental exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often wish that the developers would add resources as the logistics would be most entertaining.
