Also fixed a scaledspace bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2 (2014-08-22) Made it mostly compatible with Planet Factory and any planet packs that come with it; it might still bug out if there\u0027s too many large stars/black holes. Also fixed some bugs with orbital parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2 (2014-08-23) Modified rotation periods. Tidal locking is now possible. If a satellite is close enough to its primary it will become tidally locked. If the mass ratio between the primary and the satellite is low enough, the primary can also be tidally locked to its satellite (like Duna and Ike).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2.1 (2014-08-24) You can now re-randomize the planets multiple times in a single save. When you start one up, go to the tracking station and look at the planets, and pick a different random seed if you want a different planet configuration. It will use the previous configuration as its starting point, so after a few tries you can get very different planets. (Still working on fixing that bug, but you don\u0027t have to start multiple saves now.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2.2 (2014-08-25) Fixed the save bug. Now the mod will start with the default planets whenever it is called on to randomize them. (Default meaning stock/RSS/PlanetFactory/whatever planets you already have installed). So there shouldn\u0027t be any more Duna\u0027s with 10 g\u0027s of gravity etc after multiple randomizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2.3 (2014-09-08) Kept Kerbin the same mass and radius as in the stock game, so only the other planets/moons have their radius/mass changed. Larger planets/moons now have lower eccentricities and inclinations. Moons are slightly further away from their planets to prevent SOIs ending under their physical surface. Planets orbiting the sun are slightly further away from each other. The mod shouldn\u0027t activate for a save that\u0027s already in progress (more than 5 game minutes played), but only for new saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2.4 (2014-09-21) Fixed a bug with the random system being overwritten by the default system when switching back to the space center screen.

Another phenomenon observed in real-life is that less massive gas giants often grow quite large in radius, especially close to their sun. Gas giants more massive than Jupiter on the other hand are generally not that much bigger, because the higher gravity causes them to compress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocky planets are generally considered to not be more massive than 10 Earth masses (aka Kerbin masses), although there is one extrasolar rocky planet that weighs as much as Neptune (aka 17 Earth masses).

I second the idea of following the rules we\u0027ve discovered via Kepler and all the other extrasolar planet surveys.\u003Cp\u003EAlso when two bodies orbit each other as close as some of those I\u0027ve seen in these pictures, they\u0027d be tidally locked. Is there a way to force that in the mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to allow for that. But there is a limit since the mod works with whatever planets are already present in the game. Right now, gas giants and stars don\u0027t change radius (and in most games there\u0027s only a single gas giant which is Jool). All the other planets can have radius increase or decrease by a factor of 2 (more than that and the terrain will start looking funky). All the planets can also have their density increase or decrease by a factor of 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on tidal locking and rotation right now. It is possible to force that for close orbiting objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess in the future it might be possible to just make planets from scratch using the Kopernicus mod and then make a solar system entirely with those planets (kinda like Space Engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Finished tidal locking mostly. If a satellite is close enough to its primary it will be tidally locked to it. If the mass ratio between the primary and the satellite is close enough, the primary will also be tidally locked to the satellite (like Duna and Ike).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T13:57:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by metaphor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Larrt_M","CreatedById":104021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T14:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you please add version numbers to your downloads.
