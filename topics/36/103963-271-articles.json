I think you got some of the bigger issues already, but anyway:\n\n- Black volumetric clouds on some bodies when using clouds with color. (I havent noticed this with stock but i have with OPM and GPP. Probably something with kopernicus)\n- White Caps not showing near the vessel when splashed down.

I\u0027m sure he has his thoughts on this as well.\n- The halo issue for some Mac and linux gets reported A LOT. lol\n\nI cant think of any more pressing issues at the moment, but like i said, others will chime in im sure.
