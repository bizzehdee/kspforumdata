You could control a torus somewhat by adjusting the counter-rotation, and precess it, though.\n\u003E \n\nSolar indestructibility -- technically they should have the same impact resistance of whatever part that they belong to for panels that have colliders (although I think a stock bug prevents the part from exploding; see the \u0027single collider only will trigger explosions\u0027 stock bug I reported...like a year ago...still not fixed).  -Thermal- problems are on the TODO list to clean up/look into (they should be able to burn up).  Technically the panels should also break under extreme wind conditions, the same as the stock panels (unless I broke that code recently...).\n\nThis are physically unbreakable for a few reasons: 1.) until/unless there is a stock way to replace solar panels, they should take a lot more than a sneeze to break them; a kerbal brushing one on EVA should not make it break.  2.)  It would be bad for performance to add colliders to many of the solar panels; the way they are rigged many would require 20\u002B colliders -each-.  3.)  On parts with multiple integrated solar panels I haven\u0027t found a clean way to only break 1 panel out of a set; currently it is all-or-nothing.  4.)  There is no way to \u0027repair\u0027 / \u0027replace\u0027 a single solar panel on a part that has multiple integrated panels.\n\nSo, to fully answer your question:  part intentional, part stock bug, and part \u0027haven\u0027t found a better way to handle it\u0027.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did anyone mention Icarus?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![icarus_1.jpg](http://kerbal.nl/icarus_1.jpg)](http://kerbal.nl/icarus_1.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![icarus_2.jpg](http://kerbal.nl/icarus_2.jpg)](http://kerbal.nl/icarus_2.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nI intended to fix up that solar-panel shading/lighting weirdness over the weekend (second image).

Just batteries. It was a new career, and I was aiming to send an unmanned mun probe. Of course the stock tree is absurd to start with, but I figured that with SSTU, I\u0027d try making a tank full of EC... 1700 is not enough, lol.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not a complaint about SSTU, it\u0027s stock power use. Seems like I should be able to have a probe last more than 2 days.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, the SSTU probe core needs this new line that stock has in 1.2:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         ****        hasHibernation = True\n\u003E \n\nOn the note of probe-core EC use in general -- yeah, it needs a balance pass.  Pretty sure the CM\u0027s/SM\u0027s are all using the same ec/s setting.  As discussed on the issue tracker, this will probably come along with a set of part-upgrades to enable greater probe-core functionality (perhaps increasing the EC/s use as the capabilities are increased).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Stock deployable solar panels (and all deployable parts) actually have custom handling for collisions.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed.\n\nEventually I would like to be able to handle broken panels/wheels/legs/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E-blocks/etc -- but I\u0027ve got a lot more going on in my PartModules than the stock ones do, which greatly increases the complexity of such features (notably, support for multiple sub-parts in a single module).  Its certainly doable, but I can\u0027t take the same simple approaches that stock parts do, and have a lot more inter-connected details to manage.\n\nOn the solar panels, the first problem to solve would be -- how to create colliders for such complex panels without resorting to gobs of smaller colliders?  Next would be how to keep the deployment animation for the parts from being able to impart forces to the craft? (e.g. you should not be able to launch yourself by extending solar panels).  Those are the main reasons that panels don\u0027t have colliders. \n\nAfter they are solved, adding in some collision callbacks to break panels/disable meshes wouldn\u0027t be too hard; keeping track of what is/not broken would be a minor difficulty, but solvable.  Code to repair the panels/parts isn\u0027t too hard either (just more UI controls on already busy parts)."}]}
