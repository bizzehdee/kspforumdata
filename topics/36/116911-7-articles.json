I\u0027ve re-done the textures so there are no z-fighting, and the blue stripes doesn\u0027t get interrupted by the decouplers. The upper stage is now devided into 3 pieces, avionics, payload adapter and RD-843 engine. All the models for the upper stage are new, as well as new textures.\n\nIn short, I\u0027ve re-done and upgraded most of the parts for the launchers that have already been released. Ariane 6 and Delta III upper stages have been split into tanks and engines, instead of combined, and each of the engines have new models with animated nozzle skirt extentions. I\u0027m hoping to use BDAnimationModule to have the nozzle skirts extend when activating the engines through staging."},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T17:26:00Z","Content":"Simply stunning work.

I\u0027m also aiming to make them look as close to the real ones as possible. I\u0027ve made textures for the panels, that to me look pretty much identical to the real ones. The ones in Lionhead looks a bit too cartoony for my liking, but they still look nice.\n\nAnyone want IVA for ATV btw?

To give you an idea of scale, Zarya for example is about 12.5 meters long with a diameter of just over 4 meters. ATV is roughly 10.27 meters long, by 4.48 meters in diameter. So if you were to slap all the modules together, you\u0027d end up with a pretty big station ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T19:03:57Z","Content":"he dimensions of the completed ISS will be approximately 356 feet (109 meters) by 240 feet (73 meters), or slightly larger than a football field.

So LiquidHype\u0027s ATV would be huge compared to it. But its possible that someone rescaled the ISS mod to be real size (I seem to remember a RO module manager script makes at least most of the parts real scale, but could be wrong on that)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T20:51:22Z","Content":"Ok, so, liquid\u0027s tuff is more geared toward ro rss?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSpeaking of...i need to make an RSS/RO version of the game"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T20:53:44Z","Content":"His stuff is readily compatible with RSS/RO because of their scale, but I think his main focus is rockets with their correct dimensions, but in the stock-scale KSP system.

I may be wrong on that\n\nThe launchers originally was only configured for RSS only (with stock fuels), but after quite a few people wanted to use the real scale vehicles in stock-size KSP, I decided to add a separate folder to the mod with configs for stock.\n\nMy main focus is RSSRO, but I need to configure each of the launchers for RO, Real Fuels, Real Plume, ETC and various other Realism Overhaul dependencies first. Making the launchers compatible with all these dependecies will take a little bit of time, so for the time being I am focusing on pumping out a few launchers that will make it to LEO and GTO just fine in RSS without RO. Once Vega, Delta III, Ariane 5 ECA \u0026 ES, Ariane 6 A62, A64 \u0026 PPH are all done, I will start configuring them for RO with all of its dependent mods.\n\nThe next update will of course include the two Ariane 5 versions, but also a whole host of changes to the already released launchers, such as new/updated models, better textures, upper stage engines with extendable nozzle skirts, various cfg clean-up and other tweaks."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T22:18:55Z","Content":"Ok, i think i might point felbourn in this direction for his later project alexandria episodes"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T23:56:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m waiting for the Ariane 5 to launch Rosetta.
