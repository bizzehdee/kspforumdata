They experimented with all sorts of contraptions including lawn chairs. In the end they settled on using the same seats as those used on one of their fighter jets. Murica Corp. originally intended for the KSO to have fully functioning zero-G ejection seats (one of the contract stipulations by the KSP). Unfortunately the KSO\u0027s airframe was designed by VEG Design Group, who was adamant about cutting holes on the roof of the flight deck in order for the seats to punch through. After much lobbying, KSP and Murica Corp. were eventually convinced to drop the ejection seat idea and instead install a fast escape system. The seats were then converted to have fully functional survival equipment (first aid kit, oxygen and nitrogen canisters, temperature control, and High-G auto-inclination system).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post more pics of everything tomorrow when I finish up more of the flight deck.

If you didn\u0027t have any indication of this out-of-view direction at all you would first have to guess where it is by rotating so that the compass spins so that the heading to the target is visible. You would then have to guess whether to look down or up to find the target on the ADI. So really you need indication of out-of-view directions on at least the ADI gimbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T13:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin the stock navball uses north as its reference point.

It will be able to work well, and it should be easier to use than the navball. To further aid orbital manoeuvres there will also be the orbital display mode that will function as a replacement for the map view. Docking is a different matter, and there is a display mode dedicated to it which will include a video feed from the onboard docking camera. Also remember that there are 6 MFD displays in the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-12T19:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2013 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T19:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll fine and good, and very fancy and nice, but I just happen to like the navball.
