From my understanding, antimatter can be found at bodies with strong magnetic fields. Strong magnetic fields make deep atmospheres possible. So whenever a planet or mun has an deep atmosphere, it must have a strong magnetic field. This can be used directly to derive the availability of antimatter at a body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T22:20:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T21:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore or less right.

It would still provide superior Isp at significant higher thrust than anything in the game (except for antimatter). Also with the engine Overheating gone, you need significantly less radiators. Some would call that Overpowered. But the last thing I want to support is an engine that can rule them all. If it can operate in an atmosphere at all, it should only do so in atmosphere without significant amounts of oxygen, like Duna or Eva at which it should be usable with increased power consumption proportional to the atmospheric pressure. There are many options to get a Vista into space, using conventional rockets, boosters, radially attached thermal nozzles, or build it in orbit or on a mun with extraterrestrial launchpads.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T13:45:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course someone can send or build Vista in orbit, but with Magnetic Nozzle and Quantum Vacuum Thrusters, you don\u0027t need fuel...
