I was just wondering if it would be possible to stop scatterer from trying to overwrite sunflares while within atmospheres, or at least limit the effect to the specific bodies where it would make sense. For example, I\u0027m using Astronomers Visual Pack, which adds ablation effects around Moho. While within this cloud, sunflares completely disappear, which really takes away from the effect of being so close to the sun. Thanks for anything and sorry if my post makes no sense, I hardly know what I\u0027m talking about here...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-24T22:49:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2020 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by RyGuy\\_McFly**"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-24T06:59:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/2/2020 at 10:40 AM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E On 7/2/2020 at 4:56 AM, It\u0027snorocketscience said:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Is anyone else having issues using Scatterer in 1.10?

For Kerbin I found \n\n    rimBlend = 20\n    rimpower = 600\n\nWhich is much higher than the spectra settings, so maybe that is the correct one to change back?

It\u0027s simple, you are seeing the scaledSpace planet. Due to blending considerations, scatterer will apply the effect either in local or scaled but not the two at the same time, so when the clip plane of the local camera \u0022eats\u0022 the local scenery, it eats the scatterer effect with it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To fix this, there are 2 solutions:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1) As proposed by [@Phineas Freak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146521-phineas-freak/) [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip161-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00540-17032019-fixed-tsunami-bug-11/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3583670), we can increase the far clip plane. This is a good solution but also has a downside.. You see when we increase the gap between far and clip plane we \u0022spread\u0022 the depth buffer precision even further resulting in potentially more z-fighting artifacts and blurrier shadows.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2) A second solution is to simply deactivate the PQS and switch to scaledSpace before reaching the altitude where we reach the far clip plane limitations. The issue with this is that we switch to scaledSpace sooner and so, we have less details to look at, at low altitude. Here is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E Kopernicus patch I made (very quickly) to switch to scaledSpace earlier, I tested this on 6.4x rescale and it seems to be fine, although the transition could be worked on:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     @Kopernicus:FINAL:NEEDS[Kopernicus]\n\u003E     {\n\u003E         @Body[Kerbin]\n\u003E         {\t@PQS\t{\t\tfadeStart = 40000\t\tfadeEnd =   50000\t\tdeactivateAltitude = 50000\t}\t@ScaledVersion\t{\t\tfadeStart = 40000\t\tfadeEnd   = 50000\t}\n\u003E         }\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3.2x rescale the values probably don\u0027t need to be as extreme.
