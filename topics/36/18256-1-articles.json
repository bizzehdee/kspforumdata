So if you try and copy and paste parts from one vessel to another, it\u0027s likely that the parts will intersect and try to occupy the same space.

(Keep note, this will be what the persistence file will be putting up after the rendezvous) Peel off the module that you\u0027re sending up this round. Then remove everything under/above the command module. I added an ASAS and Remotetech computer so that I could later deorbit the launch vehicle. Atop that, add the decoupler. Build the fairing shroud around it. Make sure your stages are set. Multiple times I\u0027ve had this throw my launches off. Build the rest of the rocket. Remember to use fuel lines from the outer two stages! (like the Falcon 9 Heavy) Once you perform orbital \u0022dock\u0022 go to the VAB and peel off all the modules that you haven\u0027t already sent up. Launch this craft, before PhysX hits it, go back to the space center and then edit the persistence file. Copy all the \u003Cstrong\u003EPARTS\u003C/strong\u003E (not the entire ship) on the launch pad and replace the parts on the already orbiting ship with these. Delete the craft on the launch pad and the pieces you were adding to the ship in space. Then go back to space and deorbit the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T03:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*sighs* You guys just can\u0027t quit can you?
