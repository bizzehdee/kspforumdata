Also, display issue only, it still ticks down 1 minute every 60 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m getting that old silly thing with the M-EXP\u0027s radiator attachment nodes causing the radiators to be misaligned when attempting to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the values being what they currently are, reactors equipped with active mode radiators and sandwiched between BLOK Heat Insulators reach temperature equilibrium only above their nominal operating temperature. This causes a reduction in Ec/s output. The M-EXP sits at 47/50 Ec/s, the MX-4 at ~307/400 Ec/s. I did not test the bigger reactors due to lack of working active mode large radiators (see further up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo right now the recommended set of conformal radiators is insufficient for their matching reactors. Either the nominal temperature is set too low, OR the passive heat exchange between radiators and reactor must be inhibited. The reason for stabilizing at high temperatures is that there\u0027s a significant flow of conductive flux from the radiators back to the reactor. I suppose they must have this high conductivity to work in passive mode during testing, so if the choice is made to go with active mode radiators, their stats could be adjusted to inhibit passive conduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reactors really take a loooong time to spool up now. Might be too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m also missing an indicator telling me how far along in the ramp-up process it is. Imagine a new player who\u0027s never used one of these before, he just sits there and watches the Ec/s number climb for three hours. He has no idea where it\u0027ll stop, or how long he\u0027s supposed to wait for it... How about drafting the \u0022status: 100% load\u0022 indicator for that job? I assume it currently is set to show how well the reactor still runs with a damaged core, but that shouldn\u0027t be a problem. It can do both at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Slight confusion in regards to the power setting. Right now, it instantly responds to player changes of the setting via a simple division of the power output, which implies that it\u0027s a throttle for the power generator. But it also changes the core lifetime, which implies that it is a throttle for the reactor. If it was a throttle for the power generator, it shouldn\u0027t change core lifetime; if it\u0027s a throttle for the reactor, it shouldn\u0027t respond by instantly dividing the output. It\u0027s especially confusing during ramp-up, where it takes the same amount of time to ramp to 30% as it takes to ramp to 100%, depending on your power setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect that the aim is to have the long ramp-up time be a motivation for the player to not constantly switch it on and off, but at the same time give the player a tool to control their power production and uranium drain. I think that could be implemented in a more immersive fashion, though. Tying into the above suggestion with the status field displaying the power-on ramp, how about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave two ramp timers, a slow one and a fast one. The slow ramp can stay at 2-3 hours, the fast one would be more like one minute (to traverse the entire spectrum from 100% down to minimum 30% or vice versa). The slow ramp is the power on/power off process, as it is now, and it gets displayed in the \u0022status\u0022 field. It is the definitive limit of how much power the reactor can produce, and therefore constrains the upper bound at any given time. The fast ramp is tied to the power setting slider. It is not a divisor to the current reactor status anymore, but rather an actual throttle that\u0027s constrained on the upper end by the reactor status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: I set my reactor to 50% power setting and then press start reactor. After reaching 50%, I throttle down to 30%. After reaching that, I throttle up to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Current system: reactor reaches 50% output after 3 hours. I can then throttle down to 30% instantly. Following that, I can throttle to 100% instantly, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Proposed system: reactor reaches 50% output after 1.5 hours. Then it takes about 20 to 25 seconds to throttle down to 30%. Finally, it takes another 20 to 25 sconds to throttle back up... but only to 50%, because the slow ramp timer still contrains the entire system at that point. It\u0027ll take another 1.5 hours to get all the way to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...I\u0027m not sure if I actually explained this well or if I only succeeded in confusing everyone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E If you have questions, ask!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETODO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- doublecheck all electric engine numbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more electric engine heat testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more reactor with passive radiator testing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- toy with heatpipes, insulators and conductors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Stumbled on some more active mode radiator weirdness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When attached to normal parts, all radiators work actively and cause negative internal flux in the parent part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When attached to a reactor, only the GR-EXP and the GR-4 work.

I\u0027ve been contemplating a simpler option for reactor heat, which largely disregards realism in favor of straightforward \u0022stockalike\u0022 gameplay that syncs well with the vanilla heat system and encourages creative heat management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReactors would be given a high maxTemp (e.g., 2500K, matching the LV-N) and heat production (enough to exceed 2500K without good heat dissipation). This would create a need to protect the spacecraft from the heat generated by the reactor, by either (1) installing a full complement of radiators (which are purely passive heat sinks) to keep the reactor cooled to a temperature safe for nearby parts that have lower maxTemps, or (2) get by with fewer radiators by carefully regulating the flow and dissipation of heat through the rest of the spacecraft using insulators and heat pipes. Radiators could be buffed to compensate for the high heat production of the reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of this setup is that it would not require anything new in terms of game mechanics. No need for users to attend to new concepts like nominal and critical temperatures. Max temp is all that matters, just like re-entry and the LV-N. No need for a new interface; part temperatures can be monitored using the stock interface.
