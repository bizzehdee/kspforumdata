Human nature is such that most uphill struggles will be abandoned, and so your brilliant idea will never see the light of day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart small, my first ksp mod was a really dodgy fuel tank, and then some still useful animated flotation devices for small pods. It was these small things that lead to the ability to make ever more complex mods, sadly from a noobs point of view there\u0027s no insta mod app, there are no shortcuts, and those you do find may end up biting you in the rear later on, you just\u00A0 have to put in the time. a lot of time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately there\u0027s not a better modding community anywhere else, with few exceptions\u00A0 the modders here will gladly offer words of wisdom and advice, and in a lot of cases proper useful help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in summary, start small, take your time, and eventually your life support system may become a reality, instead of yet another dev thread dead end,.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and welcome to the wonderful world of modding\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
