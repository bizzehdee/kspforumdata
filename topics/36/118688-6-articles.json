This means they can produce a significant amount of electric-charge power when idle. The amount of power will be no where near the power delivered by a generator, but it will be enough to run life support and help cool the fuel tanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my current release, I have the thermalpowerefficiency at .0001, which would work out to a theoretical max of .2 MW...
