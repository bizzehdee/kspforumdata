If two people launch at the same time, you\u0027ll end up with a huge explosion on the launch pad/runway. There could be a system that does not let you spawn f another craft is on a launch facility, but then that one person that always tries to annoy everyone would just sit on the launched constantly. So, maybe a time limit for being in the spawn areas, and then your ship gets blown up/catapulted away, causing much hilariousness? I\u0027d personally go with the second option... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there will be such a system.
