Biomass in the greenhouse drops to ~10%, the oxygen to ~30%, and the CO2 rises to 100%. However, it stops there. Since the CO2 is full, respiration stops. It should continue until all biomass and/or O2 is depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERevert Flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Turn on lights and extend greenhouse panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Timewarp. From what I understand, with light, CO2, and water, the Biomass should grow and produce more biomass and oxygen. However, only respiration occurs until it hits the 100% CO2 wall again. EDIT: Light works like electricity. If you time warp too quickly, light production falls to zero and only respiration occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Activate the IR lights. This should cause the seeds to germinate and increase biomass and oxygen while depleting CO2 and water. Biomass increases, but all other values remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERevert Flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Turn on lights, extend greenhouse panels, and activate the IR lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Timewarp. Biomass increases, oxygen and CO2 change correctly, but water does not change. Once biomass reaches 100%, respiration begins and oxygen, CO2, and water change as appropriate until the C02 wall is hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes from these experiments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Respiration should continue after CO2 reaches 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) All values should hold fairly constant once biomass reaches 100%. In that case, growth should be equal respiration. Instead, respiration continues at full rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a lot of the issues are caused by either mistakes setting the effects of each arrange of buttons, or in flaws in how KSP handles resource depletion and generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Possibly no way to fix it, but the light resource does not play well with timewarp. Maybe increase the amount from 10 to 100 or 1,000?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my last task, I cannot harvest seeds. Using the same setup as above, with the lights off and panels closed, I tried activating the seed harvester. I get... biocake? Reset, tried the biocake harvester, same thing. I can\u0027t figure out where nets me more seeds. Me being dumb, or a bug?

By increasing the rate at which the compressors compress oxygen, you could maintain the correct ratio of gasses in the atmosphere while making the production of fuel a viable option.
