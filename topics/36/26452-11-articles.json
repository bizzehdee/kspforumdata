When the explosives are detonated, the geophones record the sound that passed thru the ground from each explosion. The geophones are designed to pick up low-frequency (around 10-240 Hertz) sound waves that travel thru the ground, while being nearly \u0022deaf\u0022 to any sound that passes thru the air. By manipulating the data recorded from the geophones using a computer, the geologists can make a map of the location of different mineral strata underground. These computer programs can be quite complex from a mathmatical point of view, but the basic principal allowing it to work is that the speed of a sound wave in rock depends on the specific type of rock the sound wave is traveling thru, and the sound wave \u0022bends\u0022 when it meets a boundary between two different kinds of rock, just like how the path of a beam of light bends when it meets the boundary between water and air, or air and glass, or glass and water, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar technology is Ground-Penetrating Radar.
