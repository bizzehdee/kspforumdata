Unless you have a really specific reason (I have not looked at the source code yet) to have put it as an inheritance of the ModuleEngines, you should really try to put it as a different module which can be added with few changes to new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good place to start would be looking at any conditions that can be checked easily. If temperature is a failure condition, it is really easy to check the part temp. Another slightly more complicated condition could be if the part is radial or in-line.
