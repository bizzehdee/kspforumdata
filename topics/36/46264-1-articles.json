Here is a picture of my prototype and how it is bigger than the final version that I have planned. I am using a larger version to prototype with so that it is easier to work with.

The printer thinks it\u0027s moving the printhead over a piece of paper while it\u0027s actually moving the ball under the print head. It would probably take a lot of trial and error to get the programming right, but other than hand painting it I\u0027m not sure how else do do a sphere or hemisphere.

My system needs three of the suckers but they are cheap as chips if you get them from China (hehe... pun unintended). Connect them up to power and an arduino which supplies the driving signal and it is fast (which is what I was aiming for).

These new motors I got though have decent torque which helped and the new drivers allow me to microstep at 1/8th rate which lets me have better control.

Then uncage and away we go. Same thing will be used for the Pitch, Roll and Yaw rate needles. That\u0027s the easy part thank god. Then there are the error needles which will be done the same way.

I\u0027m curious, did you consider external? I know there are some serious drift problems with that arrangement, but it would probably be an awful lot easier to run. Three sets of driver motors, each driving a wheel, and each wheel has small free spinning wheels at right angles to the main drive wheel\u0027s axis arranged around it\u0027s rim (Think a series of rings threaded onto one big ring). It simply attempts to roll the ball within the drive cage, and when one axis is driving, the small freespinning wheels allow it to spin in those directions.

Working out how to link the data to the needles was the first thing I actually got working. In fact 95% of the design I am using is what is in the real thing so I\u0027ve just had to adapt for what hardware I could lay my hands on. Using wheels like an upside down mouse would have so much drift and lack of calibration lock that it would be next hopeless and would have needed cleaning a lot and would have eventually stripped the paint off the ball due to drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current design I am using is solid. One of the test models I have built has ran for over 6 hours with a capsule tumbling in space (went to bed and left it too it heh)... when I tested for calibration when I woke up I found that all but the roll was still spot on. The roll problem was just due to a overbind on the gearing (ie the gears were pushed together too much). What is even cooler is that the ball was linked to my LAN in the living room and KSP was running on my PC in the bedroom. Using the Arduino LAN adapter has been easier than I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t done any more work on the current build in the last week because I am waiting for some specially cut gears as I\u0027m replacing the plastic ones with metal for the final prototype now. Should turn out ok (I hope lol). I\u0027m going to leave the current ball transparent so that others can see the innards working when I get around to doing a video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, what I really need is a CNC machine to make cutting my parts easier and more accurate. One plate that I cut and spent ages on looked perfect but the one motor mounting hole was off about a degree and it meant that the motor was straining at the gear meshing (which is what messed up the roll data as it caused slip). As the motors are using 1/8th stepping it means I have got 1600 steps per revolution so it\u0027s a slow creep of losing one step every few rev due to friction... but it adds up. Re- zeroing was easy though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill lots of work to do... Got to work out the final painting method that I am going to do the sphere surface with. I\u0027m going to get the eggbot and do some mods so that it will handle an engraver bit better and have a better pen up/down method that the floppy arm they currently use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and my new Xbox will be arriving in a couple of weeks so I can see that eating into my building time too... I know it\u0027s not as powerful as the PS4 but I just can\u0027t handle Sony controller layouts and Xbox has all the exclusives I want (Titanfall, Quantum Break, Halo, Forza etc). Japanese games feel weird to me (like Metal Gear Solid games... the voice acting is like they are on some real heavy psychedelic drugs or something). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not giving up on this Nav Ball project. In fact it has already let me design my flight simulator artificial horizons (which are easier to make than the Space versions as they only have two axis).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
