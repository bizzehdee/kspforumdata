I know there\u0027s been a lot of adjustment to introduce local frames of reference to do away with floating-point krakens for things far out from the universal origin point, and I believe that when you\u0027re unpacked that frame is very local to your current ship. When you pack up the ship while warping on the ground, it maintains that shifted reference frame and takes special care to avoid unpleasant ground-ship interactions. When you are in the orbital frame, though, it doesn\u0027t anticipate ground interaction (because, really, who would?) and doesn\u0027t take precautions to avoid them. It\u0027s using the less precise planetary sphere of reference to describe on-rails orbital vessels, which can cause a slight jump in the ship\u0027s position. Not noticeable in orbit, but when you suddenly shift half a centimeter into the ground it\u0027s VERY noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE!!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Para-Sci Jump Drive is now officially compatible with KSP 1.0.2!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, unfortunately, not the major update I\u0027d planned but instead a small compatibility patch.

Admittedly I have not read all 27 pages... yet, but in the process I though of ideas for features that might go well with your mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had not thought of the jump beacons, but its a great idea. In the way I was thinking about it, you could enter an orbit for the jump with a UI along the lines of hyperedits orbit picker; however, there would be a decent chance that you missed and your orbit got messed up. You would then have to have an adaptable craft to fix what ever went wrong. Now if the beacons are the accurate way to pull off a jump, then this non-beacon way to jump could have a really high, cascading failure rate. So you would succeed maybe only half the time, and half the time something would go wrong. When it wrong, half the time it would go wrong by a 25% deviation in your orbital parameters, and half the time it would be even worse. The next halves in the cascade would be 50% and 100% deviations, and the last half would be to switch your orbit parameters onto another body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea was to include an unfocused jump capability. The idea would be to perform (an optionally quicker, lower EC charged) jump that would take you to a completely \u003Cstrong\u003Erandom\u003C/strong\u003E place in the system. I think this would be a cool way to end up in a random situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, when I was imagining it, the electrical charge the drive needed to store would be quite large, something like 1 million EC, but would build up over time.

How is that supposed to work? I don\u0027t see how this mod supports that. Seems you have to have the jump drive for the ship to be capable of jumping to a cyno.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T19:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarcAlain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T15:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that is true.
