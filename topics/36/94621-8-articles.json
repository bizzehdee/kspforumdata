Ferram4 told me that an issue can be caused by per-part FAR module initialization being fired before geometry of surrounding wing parts takes shape, making occlusion checks performed there return erroneously negative results for parts that should actually be shielded. I have made this impossible by refactoring the way FAR modules are initialized - now that is performed only after every single part takes shape. Some people have reported it has improved improper stalling in their designs, so the solution was at least partially correct.

They were just pure white and changing the material type did nothing. The leading and trailing edges looked fine though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly idea I have is that the texture was not loaded correctly because my PartModule encountered an error at some point. Might be a conflict with some mod, enable verbose logging and check the log available from the debug window for any errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve faced similar issue earlier. For me it was somehow connected with KSPAPIExt.dll. I thought that a single instance for all mods using it will be good and removed all but one. I was wrong. Reverting it fixed the issue for me. Could suggest also just to re-install the latest version of the mod. Also, I\u0027d suggest not to switch the focus from the application when loading it. Especially, when the application is in fullscreen mode. It doesn\u0027t like GPU context losing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bac9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bac9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s weird. I have only one idea left: maybe colliders I request are not created by Unity immediately and are postponed to the end of an update cycle or to the next update, which can make FAR occlusion checks called immediately after I construct geometry fail. I have added a coroutine delaying those calls by few update cycles, hopefully that will solve the issue. If not, well, something very strange is going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m mostly sure that it can be my fault in providing \u0022investigation\u0022 results.
