It is still WIP and not nearly done.\n\nThis work is licensed under: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nSource: It\u0027s only .cfg files ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nNew\n\nI have implemented all the changes I wanted for Karbonite and KarbonitePlus (Karborundum). Changes mostly are just maxTemp rebalances or fixes. All drills and converters now have the engineer bonus, and have had their stats rebalanced to reflect that: power consumption has been increased a lot, and the larger converters and distillers can process a lot more Karbonite than the small ones. The larger converters only have \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BE the efficiency of the small converters though. The small parts have 1 on 1 mass conversion.\n\nOre is removed, and the Karbonite ground resource got the same values as Ore previously had. \n\nKarborundum now also is on Moho.\n\nI also added Karbonite and Karborundum contracts. They can be used without having installed KRS, the folder in which all the changes for Karbonite and Karborundum are. I also added a file that \\*should\\* add contracts for Karborundum mining on Moho (This one needs testing!)\n\nLastly, I have made a small pack that repurposes the stock parts to mine XenonHydrate (RadialDrill), store it (LargeTank and SmallTank), and convert it into water and XenonGas (ISRU). XenonHydrate can be found beneath icecaps (Poles on Kerbin and Duna), on Eve, on Vall, on Eeloo and occasionally in asteroids (25% chance). The reasoning for all this is that a requirement for the Hydrates to form in real life is extreme pressure and presence of water. But pressure can be created by depth, so I just chose everything with ice, or in Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s case, anything with a high atmospheric pressure that has a surface (sorry Jool).\n\nVery important!\n\nThis all hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been tested. There is a 99.99% chance that something, somewhere, did not go as it should have or that something is unbalanced. \n\nMajor areas of testing: resource spread, asteroid mining and contracts.\n\n(Especially the Moho Karborundum contracts, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not certain if ModuleManager is doing what I want it to do).\n\nFuture plans\n\nVery likely to be done:\n\n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Rebalancing of all Karbonite parts to match the new values if needed.\n\n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Adding the engineer bonus to all MKS converters and drills.\n\nWhat I would like to accomplish:\n\n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 A contract pack for MKS\n\nDownload\n\n [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ise2s4rq1rozdr/MEI%20Pre-Release%201.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ise2s4rq1rozdr/MEI%20Pre-Release%201.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T21:11:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FunnyBunny14**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:33:52Z","Content":"First off IMO don\u0027t know anyone would use a plugin if there is something close in stock has, I would drop Karbonite and MKS plugin and set it up all for stock but thats me and why are you removing them ? \n\nAnd this is just a rough shot here \n\n    @PART[KA_Drill_125_01]:NEEDS[Karbonite]{\tminimum_drag = 0.2             // this all just being added or are you changing ?\tcrashTolerance = 7\tmaxTemp = 2000 // 3000\t[COLOR=\u0022#FF0000\u0022]@[/COLOR]MODULE                           //  is this one just being added ?

This makes for a more interesting combination than stock. It also generally is better when running a modded game due to for example the distillers, that allow you to make other resources. \n\nThe reason for removal of the stock parts is that the balance is completely different on them, and they would also become obsolete after all these changes.\n\nAs for the code: \n\nThe minimum drag is just being changed (because it was higher than the maximum for some reason). The temperature and impact tolerance are also just being changed.\n\nWhat exactly did did you mean with all the blue values?\n\nI\u0027ll try using the @ for MODULE and INPUT\\_RESOURCE tomorrow since I don\u0027t have time right now."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:51:29Z","Content":"If you are changing things be sure to add @ and the blue if your not changing any of it you don\u0027t need it in the patch you could have just used \n\n    @MODULE[INPUT_RESOURCE]\n\n and then your changes and isn\u0027t really anything that you couldn\u0027t do with stock and drop all the MKS plugin and covert them parts to stock but hay it\u0027s your game you play it how you want ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT- And yes I did use Karbonite but see no need in it now."}]}
