If mods can achieve this through the more restrictive KSP API, surely the game itself can do it too. In principle, large parts of the stock game can be internationalized like a mod, but some things are hard-coded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGet modders thinking about internationalization concerns.

I\u0027m mainly interested in the more internal config-replacing components. ModuleManager-like syntax could be very useful for specifying which pieces of a config need to be mapped to language keys, but for language strings themselves I suggest using a different format. Config nodes have issues with escaping values (and since this has been on their bugtracker for a long time, I don\u0027t imagine it\u0027ll be fixed any time soon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kotysoft","CreatedById":105380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T19:23:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m not a native speaker, but I understand what is the difference between \u0022localization\u0022 and \u0022internationalization\u0022 as Majiir said before.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to clarify: I have no any programming skill, and don\u0027t know how hard is to call text to a compiled program from a simple text file, but for example, Sixteen Tons Entertainment made it, and working well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Take a look on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.emergency4.de/en/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEMERGENCY 4\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s easily scriptable language structure \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://files.amalon.hu/ksp/temp/us.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD ZIP 8.1MB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E(Cutted for smaller size and to avoid licence problems, just left some \u0022sample\u0022 things inside)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look inside the compressed file, all of their fonts are in editable DDS files and you can modify it easily if you want additional special characters or acutes.
