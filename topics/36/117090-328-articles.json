Generally it runs afoul of the ability to exploit it.  In order to prevent exploits a very complex system would have to be put into place to limit the min/max offset for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E based on the current fuel type(s) selected and the current tank geometries.  Which is really only viable for simple fuel setups, and breaks entirely when using the tanks for complex resource sets.\n\nCertainly it would be doable -- but it is far easier to just use two separate tanks when you need a specific \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E.  IOW its not worth it for a part count reduction of 1 (as the largest use of this ability would be for shuttle-alikes, which generally only need one fuel tank).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/31/2018 at 6:11 PM, Starwaster said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It does duplicate those buttons.\n\u003E \n\nHmm.. probably not a good option for the default configuration then.  Those parts are busy enough without adding duplicate unnecessary buttons to them.  Might be something that could be added to an optional patch set.\n\nReally though -- I\u0027m fine with the status quo.   I didn\u0027t really have any problems with it in my most recent playthrough -- but of course, I\u0027m one of those players who has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E do node burns for me, so loss of direct control only really impacts docking attempts (and yes, I did have to wait 1/4 an orbit during a RV on the back side of the Mun in order to regain control before docking due to loss of connection; next launch was some very high Kerbin relay sats, and had no further problems).\n\n**General development update:**\n\nNot much recently.  Between work, real life, and more work, my dev time has been close to zero the past few weeks.\n\nHave started working on the iterative portion of the ModularPart rewrite.  The initial development has been \u0027done\u0027 for awhile, and now it is onto the not-so-fun \u0027launch-KSP, test thing, close KSP, fix thing, re-launch KSP\u0027 cycle; which is also a big portion of why development has slowed down (most of the time that I can devote to development is when I don\u0027t actually have access to KSP, and have to code things \u0027in the blind\u0027 as it were).  So at this point I probably have a couple weeks worth of cleanup to do on the existing code (read:  probably only 5-10 solid hours of work, but it will take me at least a couple weeks to find that much free dev time), before I can go on to actually \u0027finish\u0027 things.\n\nIf/when it is finished though, is shaping up to be a fairly major overhaul to the fuel tanks (and most other modular parts).  Standard cylinder fuel tanks will be getting all new models \u002B textures to go along with the new module (much higher texture resolution as well; from ~64px/m to ~128px/m).  Have recently rethought how the tank meshes and textures will be put together, resulting in better use of the UV space and more \u0027modular\u0027 appearing textures (which means better looking tank models when multiple sub-models are combined).  The new texture layout will also allow for seamless \u0027paneled\u0027 textures like those on the COS parts (which will be one of the new options when all is said and done)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T19:57:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 41 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **General development update:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not much recently.

It actually works now, and properly loads and positions the main models in the part (nose/upper/core/lower/mount).  It properly validates the current model variant(s) and their allowed model combinations, and positions and scales the models properly for their chosen slot (e.g. a nosecone on top of a 2-1 adapter gets scaled to line up with the adapter).  Overall this will allow for a much wider selection of model variations, especially if/when more non-standard models are added (e.g. truncated cones for N-1 type fuel tanks)\n\nNext up is working on the \u0027layout\u0027 support for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and solar panel options.  Not only will the user be able to select the specific model for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/solar, but they\u0027ll also be able to select the \u0027layout\u0027 for each -- 2x, 3x, 4x, etc.  And the fun bit is that the layouts can be specified on a per-model basis.  So within a single part you might have a specific solar panel that has 2x and 4x options, another with 2x and 3x, and yet another that only supports 4x (same with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, with separate selections for upper and lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E).  Currently working on developing the best way to specify this information in the part config, as well as how to load the data into the part/model-modules, and ensuring that only valid layouts can be used for any specific model (e.g. if the solar model is changed, but the current layout is invalid, select a valid layout for that solar model).\n\nAlongside the \u0027layout\u0027 work will also be the \u0027module-slot-parent-module\u0027 support -- this will be a bit of code that links the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and solar modules to other specific modules in the part -- e.g. the solar module could be parented to either the upper, core, or lower, with a UI slider to choose what its parent slot is (same for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E).  The allowable slots themselves can be configured in the overall part config, but are global for a part and not model-specific (e.g. if one solar panel option is allowed upper/core/lower as valid parents, the same is applied to all other solar options in a part)  (has to be *some* limits to the configurability, or else I\u0027ll never finish writing the code...).  While the solar/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E parts will pull their scale data from the current CORE scale, their positioning will scale based on what model-slot they are parented to -- this is to ensure that they are properly \u0027mounted\u0027 to whatever model is in that slot.\n\n*If* I can keep poking away at it, I should likely have the plugin code side of things finished up in a week or two.  Have been able to make pretty good progress whenever I\u0027ve had a few free minutes, so hopefully that will keep up.  Still going to have a few days/weeks of config fixing/rewriting after that, along with another week or three worth of updating of tank models and textures.  Might start working towards test releases once I get to the updating-of-models stage; would like to get at least a couple weeks worth of testing done on the updated plugin code and it seems like it would line up well to coincide with the timing of the tank model reworking."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-07T00:46:53Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBr2kKAHN6M?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nClearly SpaceX is using Textures Unlimited.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-07T00:47:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2018 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nittany Tiger","CreatedById":123570,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-07T15:18:45Z","Content":"Not sure if I missed this on the original post, but it would be nice if there was a direct link on the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
