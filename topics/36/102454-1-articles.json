I somehow inspired myself when making a comment somewhere a while back saying something along the lines of *\u0022...Because the numpty who installed the accelerometer on the pod couldn\u0027t be bothered to connect it to the CAN bus\u0022*.\n\nThe keyword here being CAN bus. I want my ships to have one. Partially because I like the concept, partially because it\u0027d be a nice project to learn the KSP API.\n\nFor those not aware of what a CAN bus is, think of it as a form of network made for inter-device communications on a scale much lower than ethernet and the likes. What it does in it simplest form is allow electronics to communicate with each other without having to implement, for example, a full TCP/IP stack. It is found in many, if not most, modern vehicles, cars being the most familiar application. For those not yawning themselves to death this far down the paragraph, feel free to read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus).\n\nSo, the question now is: What would a CAN bus be used for?\n\nMy rough ideas would include:\n\n- Auto-grab science from instruments, similar to what [Science Containers](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90678-0-90-Science-Containers-v-08-2) does, but with some alterations/additions/modifications.\n\n- Inter-vessel communication, allowing the above to be done wirelessly with nearby (physics range, I would guess) vessels. \n\n- Vessel remote control, not having to focus on that vessel to control it. I remember seeing a mod for this, but i can\u0027t remember its name. It\u0027s not important anyway.\n\nWhat else would a CAN bus be used for in KSP? I\u0027m especially after what could be achieved by letting parts local to one craft talk to each other.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware that most, if not all, of what is mentioned above already exists in one form or another through other mods, but think of this mainly as a training exercise than a mod idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T13:17:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:17:14Z","Content":"There\u0027s also this topic\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113260-WIP-Elektronics-Logics-and-electronic-circuits](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113260-WIP-Elektronics-Logics-and-electronic-circuits)!\n\nAnd my proposal for the proximity sensor.\n\nDo you think some kind of cooperation could be an idea?"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:26:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s also this topic\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113260-WIP-Elektronics-Logics-and-electronic-circuits](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113260-WIP-Elektronics-Logics-and-electronic-circuits)!\n\u003E \n\u003E And my proposal for the proximity sensor.\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you think some kind of cooperation could be an idea?\n\nWhile the electronics-mod is a lot more detailed than the scope of what i want to achieve, the proximity sensor is certainly something that could be useful for this. In fact, most types of sensors would be useful, so that a controller node can act on sensor input.\n\nAs for cooperation, it could be an idea, but I believe I am curently lacking in ability to keep up with any form of cooperation at this point due to:\n\n I\u0027m still just getting into KSP modding (I\u0027m more of a linux dev, and android dev, so perl and java are my primary languages).\n\n\u002B I have very little time on my hands (too many kids, too little elbow room, can barely hear myself think during daytime)\n\n= It would be faster for you to just do it yourself rather than wait on me to catch up"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:32:55Z","Content":"Not me, I\u0027m very strong in the visualizing department and logic too (can build a moving machine inside my head in seconds, textured or wireframe, fly myself through).\n\nBut the syntax of both maths and programming languages always makes me wanna cry.

Also, I consider it unrealistic to have something as simple as a CAN bus trying to compensate for transmission-delay when going interplanetary.

LiPo decays if charge is stagnant, and Lead\u002BAcid suffers if left without charge for extended periods of time. I like it. Not directly related to my original idea, but realistic batteries sounds both fun to do and use. Makes Eeloo probes more challenging."}]}
