You know, I\u0027m on a RAM diet because of freezing problems.\n\nI suppose it would be hard to decrease the RAM usage. The mod already uses DDS textures and e.g. all the gangways already use the same texture (as well as all the containers and a few others). The only way i see for now is to delete the IVAs or the emit and normal textures for the parts. You could also try to decrease the resolution of the textures with e.g. GIMP, but i think KSP already takes care of that when the settings are set to low.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Alright, I\u0027m starting to get this monstrosity to work, but shouldn\u0027t the Airlock allow Kerbals to exit the base?

If it\u0027s happening when allowed # of Kerbals in the part is being reduced due to retracting the habitat space, then it kinda makes sense that anything specific to that Kerbal, as in taking up the same slot as the Kerbal as far as the code is concerned, is going to be lost along with the allowed slot that the Kerbal could inhabit. What you would need is some way to export all of the Kerbal\u0027s belongings that are not held within the individual Kerbal\u0027s own inventory (backpack or whatever, I\u0027m not *that* familiar with the inner workings of these mods honestly) into an external (or programmatic equivalent within the same part\u0027s modules) container. No clue how you would go about making this happen though. best practice would be to empty the part of any containers before doing anything that would change the # of Kerbals the parent part can contain.\n\nIf that\u0027s not the issue, then disregard and continue as you were.

This bug is already filed by KospY and will probably be fixed or at least will be removed once i added all IVAs.\n\nThe second one is way harder.
