I use it to make sure that everything will works as expected. That\u0027s why i noticed that we don\u0027t have vacuum chamber at our space center. I think it would be a great extension mod which you can access from the VBA and the SPA with one click. This would add a frame for the pre flight testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeatures:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nvacuum chamber without air\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nstatic testing\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nfall testing(for zero gravity) - you are able to drop things from the top of the chamber and the camera would follow it. During the fall you have zero g and you can test. To avoid crash imagine that things are hanging on cord and it stops the things just before crash.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nvibration test\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(if you have ideas, leave it in the comment)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI have question\u00A0for the modders, because i\u0027m haven\u0027t modded anything to the ksp yet (i did it for other games, like arma).
