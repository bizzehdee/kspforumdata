So with my limited understanding of module manager, I\u0027ve decided to make copies of some stock engines, but with methalox instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027ve picked the Dart, Rapier, Poodle, Thud (for variety) and the Rhino. So far, this is just an simple replacement of isp values and fuel types. I was wondering about mass and thrust, but I didn\u0027t find data on methalox engines\u0027 thrust (mostly because none are in production yet). Elon Musk claims the Raptor engines will have more than twice the thrust than the Merlin 1D with a smaller increase in volume, but says nothing about the engine\u0027s mass. My first thought, at least regarding gameplay, is that the engines should have a bit less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E counterparts, or else they\u0027d be overpowered (better isp, better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E in exchange of bigger tanks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, I\u0027d like to give their exhaust a more blue hue, but is that possible without Real Plume? Also, it may also be cool to make the stock engine\u0027s fuel switchable instead of adding different, identical engines, but I don\u0027t know how to do that or if it\u0027s possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if there is interest or someone wants to improve upon this, here\u0027s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch.
