I think the vessel crashing, perhaps with a mod interaction but perhaps not, is causing the issue. If it is an interaction issue, and JeffreyCor\u0027s list is correct (as in, those mods aren\u0027t the issue) then it looks like it\u0027s only custom biomes, editor extensions, or final frontier, as those are the only other mods that are common between the two cases. Which makes me think it\u0027s probably just with KCT (but the chance of someone seeing it with just KCT installed is slim, since it\u0027s unlikely anyone plays with just KCT, even my dev environment has other mods). I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s a side effect of loading the ships in the Space Center scene, which I just finished writing new code that doesn\u0027t do that anymore. If either Kalista or the other user (I don\u0027t know if he wants me to mention him, since he PMed me and we\u0027ve been talking that way) are willing to try out a very in-development version to see if the bug is fixed, let me know.It likely has its own bugs to deal with, but knowing whether or not the changes I\u0027ve made fix the problem would be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eachievments mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustomBiomes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadlyReentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorExtensions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineerRedux \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhancedNavBall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceduralFairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigaro Global Navigation Satellite System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkOS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissionController\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDockingPortAlignment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinalFrontier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersistent Trails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise Node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple Part Organizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustom Tree Loader\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Kolonization System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
