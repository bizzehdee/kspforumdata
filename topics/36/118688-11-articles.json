I don\u0027t know if that is the only problem. Looking at the list of installed mods, they are all available off of CKAN (I think). I would recommend backing up your gamedata folder (to a zip file) and re-download and install all of your mods (one reason for the zip is that for the ones with internal settings files, you can go back and Copy-paste your settings right back in). That should get rid of that, at least, if not everything else. I recommend CKAN, as that makes it easier (if you do not already use it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECKAN still thinks RealFuels conflicts with IFS (I think). What I have done is install everything else including the dependencies of Realfuels, using CKAN, and then I did a regular download \u0026amp; install of Realfuels (its dependencies are managed by the same who does RealFuels, and they update in tandem, so I know when to check).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoahAldritt","CreatedById":153128,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T05:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat...is really weird.
