As such, the geometry does not line up properly, and the windows are occluded by geometry faces.\n\nNothing can be done about it until new IVAs are created (which will require someone stepping up and saying they want to model/create IVAs, as I have no plans to do any IVAs for any more parts until.... well.. who knows, but a long time from now)."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T20:18:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My bad ... that\u0027s what I get for trying to post while half awake.  But I don\u0027t see anything that suggests a reason for the crash - usually there\u0027s an exception at the end of the log or something.  Maybe on Mac OS X, Unity crashes before it can log the exception (just guessing since I usually only see logs from Windows).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To test if you\u0027re running out of memory, you might try installing [GC Monitor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=83821) and see if your memory usage is above ~3.5 GB right before the crash.\n\u003E \n\nOk so the problem keeps persisting. Just tested it again a few minutes ago. I put just the soyuz together and I wanted to test the LES. I pressed launch and boom the game crashed. So here is my log for that [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcybc65bdg6owx6/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcybc65bdg6owx6/KSP.log?dl=0) I fully acknowledge it could be my computer. It just seems interesting to me that the game is fine before I install SSTU and then after it just crashes. \n\nAlso here is my Unity player.log maybe there is something in there.
