After a bunch of testing though, it would seem that it\u0027s actually decouplers in general that are extra wobbly. All but the new SLS size were the focal points for wobble. The SLS decoupler actually uses a line in it\u0027s .cfg \u0022phyisicssignifigance = 1\u0022 and that stops it wobbling with anything heavy on top of it. Adding that to other decouplers seemed to have the same effect on them. I have chosen not to add it to mine for the sake of balance. I\u0027m pretty sure that I\u0027ve gotten any wobbliness down to stock levels, so just be careful when putting big engines behind these tanks, they may be smaller than 2.5m but they do have significant mass compared to 1.25m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-03T06:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2014 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Orionkermin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
