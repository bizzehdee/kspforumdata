If you download v0.09 and just copy over the NapHabV1.mu file, it should be able to fix it. (to be safe, make a backup of your save folder in case something goes wrong).

Sure it\u0027s not from another pack?\n\nThe geometry isn\u0027t much more hi-poly than most part packs out there. [This thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128264-35-million-triangle-part-a-theoretical-discussion/) has some great info on how poly-count effects KSP performance. The TL;DR is that number of parts in a vessel is far more important than part poly-count. Not just in the obvious \u0022well duh, more parts, more polygons...\u0022 way, but in that poly count isn\u0027t as tasking on the GPU as part count is on the CPU. Reducing tri-count won\u0027t help much. As it is, KSP add-on authors are concerned for some reason that any cylinder with more than 24 sides will melt GPUs. I digress.\n\nFirst, run on a clean install and see if the issue persists. Also check your debug menu for null reference spamming. \n\nThe textures in CxAerospace *are* 2k though, and the UV mapping is good, but could be better I suppose. The pack is still small, and it is good to leave texture space on texture sheets for future expansion. 2K textures could cause performance drops, and if you\u0027re not wanting to run half-res textures, it\u0027d be nice for [@cxg2827](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57380-cxg2827/) to throw some half-res textures out there, but probably not too important at the moment. There are also normals maps applied, and they can be a drain, but unless cxg2827 wants to model each individual panel division, metal crimp, and bolt, normal maps are pretty much necessary for fidelity."}]}
