On one side I am happy Mike that you are doing something with the current shuttle but on the other hand I am a little bit pissed cause you are putting the things from my gifs which will be in the new shuttle, to the old one. So I think there will be no need to have two same shuttles with the same things. No offense and as I said I am happy that you are doing something with the current shuttle. I just think there should be a better communication flow about this. do not take it as offense just my 2 cents.\n\nOK first off I LOVE your work and I am happy to see it released.\n\nsecond, you never replied to my help requests and as I said before I am doing this work just until you release yours, and maybe see what can be added and what works.\n\nI DID say this was unofficial so no need to be pissed.\n\nand if you follow the post I am simply adding requests. I like modding and I like the shuttle so...\n\nAnyway your model (I think) is already underway and will be soon released by dragon (hopefully). he did say it will be better and different than this old one\n\nI thought the ET doors might get your attention, I can see you have been following the thread\n\nwhat else from your gifs have I taken that it doesn\u0027t already have? I just look at the real thing and wonder what I can add...\n\nanyway you have no need to even be bothered by this old one because you know yours and DECQ and Dragons one will be so amazing!\n\nand if you don\u0027t understand my PM messages just say.\n\nhope we can still be mates\n\nyours,\n\nMike from NZ"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T15:23:23Z","Content":"BTW, I would be okay to organize stuff.

Autism is ruling here lol.\n\u003E Wy don\u0027t we (the ones working/adding on/to the shuttle) unite via some kinda communication tool (steam i.e.) and create something great all together?

Is there any guarantee jovzin that when your model is completed that we will get a release from dragon anytime soon? This loyalty to dragon confuses the hell out of me. We made a mistake 5 months ago with raidernick. He began working on updating the CSS and everyone all but pushed him off the project because he couldn\u0027t stand people asking questions about Dragon. Now we have another incredible modder working on this project and again we are referring back to dragon. Until he shows his face or releases a substantive update sometime this year we need to work with the people who are currently doing an amazing job. Mike and Jovzin lets just take a step back and agree that you guys had a miscommunication and lack of communication. From here on out you need to work together both of you have done an amazing job and together you can create an amazing orbiter.

It could lead to the best shuttle you can get. I have to be honest and Mike worked his arse of and pleased many people already so I know for sure he can do this on his own if he wants (and he has the right to do so).\n\nFollowing this thing a bit I think the conclusion is that both guys favour to work alone on their projects where Jovzin unfortunately is dependent on someone who doesnt seem to make any progress. So thats a \u002B1 for Mike as he is a one man band.\n\nSo I say this: bring on the competition and may the best shuttle win ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T17:14:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alright I need to put my 37 cents in on this.
