It will be up to the user to position the thrust transforms where they want them.\n\nHad to spend most of last night migrating to VisualStudio, as apparently MonoDevelop had some hard-coded system assembly references that was preventing proper compilation of the plugin when it contained the code for adding editor-part groups. Probably a good thing in the long run, as VS is much more powerful, I\u0027m already familiar with it, and I have a full Professional copy from when I was in school (not that it really matters for KSP development).\n\nI guess I\u0027ll just throw this out there --\n\nWhat would you guys rather have done for this weeks update -\n\nRadial Booster Decouplers?\n\n-or-\n\nLots more work towards engine clusters?\n\nEither one will require quite a bit of coding, modeling, and texturing. I could likely get the radial decouplers finished and working by the weekend (perhaps aside from final texturing). For the engines, if I spend all week working on them I can likely get something \u0027usable\u0027 by the weekend, though models/textures would be nowhere near finished (plugin might be close at that point).\n\nAnd, as to the radial decouplers specifically -- my current feature-set is:\n\n[h=3]Features:[/h]\n\n- Has scalable and movable geometry to form a surround ring for the booster\n- Can additionally use mesh-switching to change the mounting type between ring and basic attach-point\n- Has included SRB-based jettison motors.\n- Can move thrust transforms for the jettison motors along with the visible model; hopefully to allow positioning into realistic positions for the jettison motors.\n- Can adjust amount of jettison fuel / force in the VAB (Need to find a good way to do this, currently it is just the stock force, thrust, and fuel sliders).\n- Everything triggered as one action through staging - no special functions to learn. Use it just like any other radial decoupler.\n- Works properly with MJ/KER dV calc, and for MJ auto-staging\n\n[h=3]Requirements:[/h] \n\n- Custom plugin to manipulate the model and thrust transforms. Could be a very short/simple module, as it is basically just moving around/repositioning/rescaling some already existent transforms/game-objects.\n- If mesh-switching capability is added, it increases complexity/dev time quite a bit, but still fairly simple all-in-all.\n- Need to investigate why stock was removing thrust transforms from the model when it was activated. Might need to manually re-parent thrust transforms to visible mesh objects (as if they are unparented, they get deleted)\n- Needs custom model(s) created (geo/ao/uv/tex)"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T16:16:55Z","Content":"I vote SRB separation because that seems the closest to finishing, leaving the remaining time for the engines ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T17:21:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cluster selection through plugin (bigger pros/cons in **bold**):\n\u003E \n\u003E **PRO**\n\u003E \n\u003E **1.)

Will likely stick with either box or simplified mesh colliders (8-12 sided cylinders/cones).

So, while I might not ship 3-inline/4-inline/super-large clusters, there will be absolutely nothing stopping you from making them yourself -- it will be fully supported and doable (with my engines, stock engines, or even other mods\u0027 engines). You don\u0027t need to know modeling, texturing, or any of that... just need to setup the actual layout definition, and create the part config -- the rest is handled through the plugin.\n\nLet me state that again (for others\u0027 benefit, because people keep asking for specific layouts) -- **YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN ENGINE CLUSTER LAYOUTS, YOU DON\u0027T NEED TO BOTHER ME FOR ANY SPECIFIC DESIGNS.**\n\nI will ship an initial selection of prebuilt layout definitions for most common/historic layouts, but will not have all engines available for every layout. If you wanted to enable a specific layout for an engine that was not currently enabled, see below. You can also use any existing model in KSP for the mounts; so if you have a favorite stack-adapter or other mods\u0027 pre-built engine mount that you want to pre-fill with engines, that can be done as well (pretty sure I saw a Saturn-V lower stage/F1 mount from some mod).\n\nFor example, here is the MM patch I used to create one of the F1 engine clusters:\n\n    \u002BPART[SSTU_ShipCore_ENG-F1x1]:NEEDS[SSTU]{    @name = SSTU_ShipCore_ENG-F1x5    @title = SSTU - SC-ENG-F1x5    @description = SSTU - SC-ENG-F1x5    @mass *= 5    @MODULE[SSTUEngineCluster]    {        @layoutName = FiveCross                MOUNT        {            name = BigShroud            scale = 1.25                    }    }    @MODULE[ModuleEngines]    {        @maxThrust *= 5    }}\n\nExmple definition for the engine mounts (this was for a S-V styled lower-stage mount)\n\n    SSTU_ENGINEMOUNT{    name = BigShroud  //name referenced by the engine cluster module    modelName = SSTU/Assets/SC-ENG-MOUNT-5   //model to load.  This can be literally anything    verticalOffset = 0   //correction factor for the mount, to place its top at 0/origin.  The top node for the original part is a good value to use.    singleModel = true  //if true, only a single mount model will be used;  if false, the mount model will be duplicated and rotated for each engine in the cluster    height = 1.6   //the height of the engine.  Used to determine how far to offset engine model and attach nodes    fairingTopOffset = 0    //how far from the top of the part should the fairing start at?  this would be for mounts that include some full-stack-sized geometry at the top (E.g. SC-B-ENG3 mount, or similar)    fairingEnabled = false  //should the auto-node fairing be allowed for this mount?  defaults to \u0027true\u0027    defaultSize = 5m  //information only , not used by the plugin; this is so -you- know what scale to specify in the engine cluster definition}\n\nAnd the entirety of the layout definition for that engine cluster:\n\n    SSTU_ENGINELAYOUT{    name = FiveCross    POSITION    {        x = 0        z = 0        rotation = 0    }    POSITION    {        x = 1        z = 0        rotation = 0    }    POSITION    {        x = 0        z = -1        rotation = 90    }    POSITION    {        x = -1        z = 0        rotation = 180    }    POSITION    {        x = 0        z = 1        rotation = 270    }}\n\nA simple 3-inline cluster would be defined as:\n\n    SSTU_ENGINELAYOUT{    name = ThreeInline    POSITION    {        x = 0        z = 0        rotation = 0    }    POSITION    {        x = 1        z = 0        rotation = 90    }    POSITION    {        x = -1        z = 0        rotation = 180    }}\n\nPretty simple, eh? The layouts are based on a 1m scale. Whatever positions defined in the layout will be scaled by the engineClusters mountSpacing value. Rotation values are applied to the models KSP-space Y axis (standard lengthwise axis for engines/most parts). When per-engine mounts are used, the same spacing and rotation is applied to them. You could even define the layout in the same file as your part (for custom layouts), or though MM patch.\n\nI\u0027m mostly settled on the one-part-per cluster setup, so I\u0027ve skipped past the need for the investigatory testing, but I do appreciate the offer (I know firsthand how busy modding can keep you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)). There were just too many issues to work around trying to do dynamic swapping of the # of engines. Doing a single-part-per-cluster also opens up a lot more opportunities for per-part variation and customization.\n\nAye, seems likely that I will be making the Radial Booster Decoupler the focus for this week. It is something that I\u0027m fairly certain I can get -done- by the weekend. And I\u0027ve still got some things to think through on the engines before I go too much further (like how best to manipulate the fairing stuff).\n\nSo... any preferences on the Radial Decoupler geometry? I\u0027m thinking that I\u0027ll likely be making two sets of geometry for it; the full ring style, and something more resembling the stock radial decouplers. Should I include some geometry for the jettison motors? I can, but I\u0027m unsure how well it would scale, or how good it might look for certain uses. Perhaps I\u0027ll put it as a mesh/geometry variant as well."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T18:38:08Z","Content":"I would vote for adding a mesh variant for the decoupler with a nosecone with separatrons at the top, and the separatrons (that are already modeled in the SRBs) in the bottom, then you would attach the SRB with a flat top to the bottom of the nosecone, so it can always be at the same position given a certain height config ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nthe meshes for these are already there, so nothing new to be modeled ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n@engines: already planning a few configs for RO ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nbtw, the only Saturn V mounts I know (there might be more) are from KW (comes with engines), FASA, DECQ\u0027s and DennyTX\u0027s...

Nor would a nosecone be applicable to every booster. It will be mostly what I posted yesterday; a top \u002B bottom attach point both with thrust transforms (both movable) \u002B a central attach point (where the physics attach/where the actual joint is located). As I stated earlier, it will be up to you to put the thrust transforms wherever you want them to be located. If you want them in the nosecone, great... slide the booster or decoupler around until it is in the nosecone.\n\nThe engine mounts/shrouds are already separate meshes. And optional. And switchable. And scalable. And defined entirely through config (patchable). And they vertically position the engines automatically based on your mount selected/its config. You can do whatever you want with them. Change them to new models, not use any models, scale them bigger/smaller. The procedural fairing (SSTUNodeFairing) is optional as well. And configurable on a per-mount basis (for enabled/disabled/position offset). So yes, you will be able to use whatever you want for the mounts, just as I said in my previous post.\n\nBasically I\u0027ve tried to make it a functional engine-cluster welding tool (as normal part-welding with engines fails miserably). There is no way I can do all of the different engine layouts that people have been requesting (just not enough time in the day; not with having to work, sleep, have a life, etc). So, I\u0027ve given -you- the power to do it yourself (or rather, -will- give you that power, as soon as the coding is done).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E cool, thx for the throughout explanation, \n\u003E engine stack code is looking awesome, \n\u003E \n\u003E and yah 2 box colliders per engine is perfect:)\n\u003E \n\u003E As for the radial decoupler I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re making them as a separate parts (not integrated into boosters).

In case of not solid boosters this would help with reusability (so just a tank, engine, decoupler with a probe core and some optional radial parachutes:))\n\nYes, they are a separate part. A replacement for the stock radial decouplers. Should be usable on any SRB or LRB, or anything you want radially attached with jettison capability. They will have sliders/buttons to adjust the height of the separators/attach rings. There will also be a slider/buttons to set the scale of the attach points/rings (as if I use a ring-shaped model, it will need to line up with the radius of the booster). The thrust transforms will move with the attach rings, so you can essentially set the locations for the separation motors (the rings/mounts are mostly just there for visual cues of where the separation motors will be located). Of course, it will still only be physically attached in one place, in the center (due to KSP joints/tree structure), but you\u0027ll be able to adapt the decoupler to fit whatever booster you are making.\n\nAt this point it looks like I will be making two separate parts, one with rings (like in the SS posted yesterday), and one that more resembles the stock decouplers -- because I don\u0027t feel like writing yet-another-mesh-switch plugin just for two models, and because of the very special model setup needed for these restricts use of the existing mesh-switch plugins and vastly complicates trying to do any kind of mesh switching. Both will have configurable height / thrust transform locations.\n\nProbe core -- certainly possible, but that is more of a config/patch thing that you could setup yourself.

The new IVA shader will be a massive time-saver for creating IVAs, and cut down on texture use (depending on how it works). I\u0027m very interested to find if the same/similar process could be done with the other shader setups as well; the only reason most of my textures are unique/per part is because of the shading/AO maps. If I could just use those in a smaller/grayscale texture (srsly, I don\u0027t need 1024x for AO bakes, 256x or 512x would be fine for most larger parts), it could seriously cut down on texture use -and- increase how fast I could get parts created (being able to share textures would be... F()#@$^ AWESOME!).\n\nI have a -dev testing- release available for some testing on the prototype (S)RB Decouplers. If you are interested in providing feedback on those, let me know and I will send you a link (its just set up in dropbox, so pretty easy to copy from). Looking to get some feedback regarding general layout, usability, and probably most importantly the thrust transform locations and orientations. I need these parts to work for any reasonable use case.

So shouldn\u0027t the engine get that sweet sweet red hot glow around in the green circle rather than the red one? The little bottle neck is what gets hottest in real life, as the gasses are closest to their hottest.\n\nSome neat reference I found~\n\n![971651fs1.jpg](http://www.nimr.org/systems/rockets/971651fs1.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-29T03:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2015 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by VenomousRequiem**"}]}
