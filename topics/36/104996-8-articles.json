Have you thought about making a version of the CBM that would fit seamlessly with SHDI/Mk1-2?\n\nEssentially I love using the CBM but the thing about it is that in order for it to work on the Mk1-2 pod (when used in conjunction with SHDI\u0027s pod cover) I either have to offset the pod cover itself or put something under the CBM to raise it up, because otherwise the pod cover ends up making kraken bait with the service module. Not really a big problem necessarily (because it isn\u0027t hard to just offset the pod cover and maintain looks on the pod itself) but it would be cool if there was an actual CBM variant that accounted for this already.\n\nI also would love to see an integrated parachute version, but i\u0027m not picky ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T03:52:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nI\u0027ll might give it a go eventually\u0027 date=\u0027 but it would be a very low priority part since I am now going to tackle the ISS truss parts.\n\nAlso,\n\nNew update is out on Kerbal Stuff.
