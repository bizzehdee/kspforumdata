I wrote it from scratch in Swift, and aim for it to fill the void of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI on macOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was briefly mentioned in this\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/191024-ksp-version-mission-patches/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKSP Discussion thread\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0a few months ago, and now I\u0027m finally properly introducing\u00A0it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how neuCKAN looks so far (version 0.0.1). Although it doesn\u0027t look like much, it took me 6 months to get to this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228dfIFzx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.73\u0022 height=\u0022662\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8dfIFzx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs shown in the screenshot above, the software is very much incomplete. It\u0027s still very early on in alpha development. Functionally, it\u0027s able to install mods that are not hosted on spacedock (there is a weird bug with spacedock\u0027s links). As little as it currently does compared to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I have a very ambitious plan for its future.
