(and so people have somewhere to ..... about stuff not working)\n\nThe Convair (Gen Dynamics) Nexus, a post Saturn design (that was never built) to send massive payloads into orbit. ([http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/nexus.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/nexus.htm))\n\nSo far I\u0027ve uploaded a working set of parts for the base 164 foot (at half scale) Nexus that was designed for orbiting a 1 million pound payload, and then returning to earth.\n\nThere\u0027s some placeholder textures wrapped on these now. Most are just texture swatches applied over the UV maps, but the first decoupler has an operating normal map, even if it is a bit unrelentingly black.\n\nThere\u0027s enough adapter/decoupler to connect from the nominally 150 foot (halved to 75f=~18m) all the way down to 3.75m aka size 3 parts.\n\nAlso to 5m and 7.5m or 60foot. \n\nThere will be (but isn\u0027t yet) secondary stages in 120foot and 70foot with some big gas core nuke rockets. These, again, will be large parts, for pushing other large parts across space. Not technically part of the \u0022Nexus\u0022 but part of the development work done under the auspices of the nexus project. There\u0027s a multitude of designs, so not all will be represented. Clamping fairings suitable to loft an Orion WILL be among the parts, as that\u0027s why I started this thing in the first place. \n\nAnd a second equivalent mod will eventually be released as full size. Once this is working and once the hanger extension mod works or has an equivalent.\n\n![ls4MRIx.png](http://i.imgur.com/ls4MRIx.png)\n\n![DGarPP1.png](http://i.imgur.com/DGarPP1.png)\n\nDownload from Kerbal Stuff; [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/781/Super%20Heavy%20Boosters%20Historical%20-%20Nexus](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/781/Super%20Heavy%20Boosters%20Historical%20-%20Nexus)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T03:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TiktaalikDreaming**\n  \nupdates"},{"CreatedByName":"wreckingangel","CreatedById":143821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:54:43Z","Content":"First of all thank you very much for this mod, I am always happy and a little melancholic when I see mods from the golden age of space travel, not to forget that it would lower the part count for heavy launches drastically. \n\nOk now some feedback:\n\nIt would be nice to have a place to put in a probe core.\n\nThe main engine looks like a multi engine aerospike, but they point straight down instead of alongside the main cone.\n\n![6-aerospike_engine_after_test.jpg](https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/includes/projects/rockets/data/news_2008/images/aerospike/6-aerospike_engine_after_test.jpg)\n\nLike this\n\nA fairing would help a lot with testing crafts (and for playing around ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) of course) I am not on a ksp capable computer for the next days, but I will try to upscale a stock fairing.\n\nI found a rendering of the nexus on projectrho.com \n\n![ConvairSuperNexusDiagram.jpg](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/artgallery/ConvairSuperNexusDiagram.jpg)\n\nHere is the webpage of the artist:\n\n[http://william-black.deviantart.com/gallery/48294645/Real-Designs](http://william-black.deviantart.com/gallery/48294645/Real-Designs)\n\nI will continue playing around with this mod next week, I really like it.\n\nTanks again and keep up the good work"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:46:43Z","Content":"Is it a massive truncated aerospike with integrated Airbrakes?"},{"CreatedByName":"TiktaalikDreaming","CreatedById":136290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T22:03:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E First of all thank you very much for this mod, I am always happy and a little melancholic when I see mods from the golden age of space travel, not to forget that it would lower the part count for heavy launches drastically. \n\u003E Ok now some feedback:\n\u003E \n\u003E It would be nice to have a place to put in a probe core.\n\u003E \n\u003E The main engine looks like a multi engine aerospike, but they point straight down instead of alongside the main cone.\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/includes/projects/rockets/data/news_2008/images/aerospike/6-aerospike_engine_after_test.jpg](https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/includes/projects/rockets/data/news_2008/images/aerospike/6-aerospike_engine_after_test.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Like this\n\u003E \n\u003E A fairing would help a lot with testing crafts (and for playing around ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) of course) I am not on a ksp capable computer for the next days, but I will try to upscale a stock fairing.\n\u003E \n\u003E I found a rendering of the nexus on projectrho.com \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/artgallery/ConvairSuperNexusDiagram.jpg](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/artgallery/ConvairSuperNexusDiagram.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is the webpage of the artist:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://william-black.deviantart.com/gallery/48294645/Real-Designs](http://william-black.deviantart.com/gallery/48294645/Real-Designs)\n\u003E \n\u003E I will continue playing around with this mod next week, I really like it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Tanks again and keep up the good work\n\nWell, when you get to it, the fairings are now included, down to 7.5m diameter. 7.5m was the biggest fairings I had from the FASA pack, so that\u0027s where it became useful for me. I do intend a bunch of smaller fairings, and probably some \u0022down to pattern of N times 3.75m diameter parts\u0022 fairings.\n\nProjectrho, William Black, and myself are all getting our info from Mr Lowther\u0027s [http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com](http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com) and I am aware of their work. Making things function in KSP is a different beast than making a 3D model (although, there\u0027s clearly related work). And that\u0027s why the engines currently face directly down. I originally ([http://i.imgur.com/BA6qghy.png](http://i.imgur.com/BA6qghy.png)) had them facing along the plug. This introduced some issues in KSP that I\u0027m still looking at correcting for, but I basically wanted to get the thrust numbers and direction correct before revisiting the angles for the rocket nozzles. I DO want to go back to that, in my opinion it looks awesome. But KSP thrust direction is the same as the visual effect direction, independent of any other bits, so there\u0027s issues with this. :-)\n\nOh, and the new heat shield with integrated retro rockets now also has integrated probe core functions.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it a massive truncated aerospike with integrated Airbrakes?\n\nThat pretty much describes the Nexus booster.

They also provide reality braking stopping power, just like KSP\u0027s aerobrakes.\n\nAnd there were between 4 and 12 of them. \n\nSo, to model this, there\u0027s 12 shell parts that can be either a plain outer shell or a flap. There were actually two types of flap as well, the other being pretty much the whole side panel. I have that modelled in blender, but not moved over to Unity yet. So it\u0027s just plain panel or the shaped aerobrake so far. I wanted to get the pistons working before fiddling with more than one flap type.\n\nThe aerospike/plug system used 60 rocket nozzles instead of 10 or so, so there was less need to approximate a match to the cone using flattened nozzles. The aerospike is hollow because it\u0027s massive (with the weight to go along with that), and in an atmosphere, air passing through the hollow cone would help to provide a partial barrier and make the truncated plug act like a much longer spike. I don\u0027t have any firm details on the air flow through the cone on the Nexus, and I don\u0027t know if that was part of the design, but it seems to match. It seems like the saner way to build a very large aerospike.\n\nAs I said before, I will be re-angling the rockets. I want to get the visual effects right, then after I have that, run some maths on how much that angling (in my estimation of how KSP works) will affect the thrust, and see if that holds true or not. Then adjust total thrust again.\n\nThe control rockets are in blocks of 6, each block has 400,000 lbs thrust, which is out of step with William Blacks notes, so I\u0027ll need to double check my numbers. Maybe it was 400,000 lbs per nozzle, which would be 2.4Mlb, and about the 8M he\u0027s assigned to the controls. He\u0027s been commenting on my dev work over in the G\u002B KSP group, so I\u0027ll bug him as to where those numbers come from. \n\nOf course, this is KSP, so you can add as many as you want, so 3 at a minimum to be able to angle any which way, and up to as many will fit. they\u0027re normal rockets though, so they suck a bit at low altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:17:47Z","Content":"So is this a SeaDragon on steroids?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:22:20Z","Content":"So what exactly is the purpose of something so massive, is it to loft entire interplanetary missions in one shot, put multiple refineries worth of fuel into orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:30:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -info snip-\n\nDoing some number crunching on the data I found, the control rockets should output 2,000,000lb thrust per block, which is ~333,333lb thrust per nozzle (but that doesnt matter because they\u0027re so comparatively small that one effect \u0026 thrust transform will work).
