And I agree with his assessment. Having too-fine of control over some tweakables does make it more difficult since it is more hassle to get the right ratio (rather than just , and with the granularity of the modification seemingly dependent on your KSP screen resolution (per-pixel sliding of the bar), there may be situations where it is impossible to perfectly balance LF to Ox because the correct number you need is some decimal you cannot choose because one pixel too short or too far makes you straddle around the correct value. It\u0027s also annoying to have to fiddle with pixel-level precision on the bar (I get enough of that in trying to place parts, I don\u0027t need more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also ran into some instances where these fine-grained adjustments do not propagate properly across symmetry. Example, I have a rocket with twin solid boosters, one per side. I tweak the solid fuel amount in one to say 2505.43/3000 (because I cannot get it to adjust to a round number), the other ends up with 2500.27/3000 for some reason. I go to adjust the second one to match and now the first one is off. The two never get in sync. The result is that the twin boosters produce slightly different TWR on launch (gets slowly worse with time due to offset being larger fraction of total mass) and slightly upsets the balance of the rocket. Worse, one booster burns out slightly before the other causing a LARGE upset in craft attitude on ascent, usually unrecoverable in most situations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squelch","CreatedById":115992,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T09:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal situation would be for the user to be able to enter exact values directly into the text field which is a fairly common method when combined with spin buttons and sliders.
