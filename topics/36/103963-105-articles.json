Thanks.\n\nThe .021 version is good also in that it seems to load faster than .0191 (which was the previous one that worked correctly for me), or is at least much better at hiding the loading delay. It seems that with .021, pop-in of the scattering effects at scene changes occurs much less if at all, which makes me happy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nOn a side note, on .0215, I\u0027m getting the glitchy \u0022half planet clouds\u0022 in orbit with the new EVE (the issue mentioned and screenshotted by visivante [some pages back](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00215-05122015-ocean-shaders-get-them-while-theyre-hot/\u0026page=103#comment-2310913)), but on .021 this glitch does not occur. Posting this in hopes it may help in narrowing down the cause.\n\nThe same version observation applies to the sunflare being rendered in orbit even though it is well behind the lithosphere, but I think this issue being new in .0215 has already been confirmed by others.\n\nFinally, as another data point for an already reported bug, for me the ocean fails to render if the craft (actually camera?) is higher than ~20m from the sea level (as per the stock altimeter), and even then most of the screen area covered by the ocean renders as black. Playing around with the settings (including m\\_resolution) had no effect. KSP 1.0.5 Linux 64-bit, OpenGL, NVidia. Just throwing this out there, because the maximum altitude seems unusually low (I\u0027ve been following this thread for a while and I think I\u0027ve only seen one report with such low altitude), as does having most of the screen area of the ocean covered by one large artifact (instead of the more common \u0022seaweed\u0022 type which consists of separate black strips).\n\nSo, going with .021 for now, although I have to say the atmo scale feature of .0215 is very nice. The new rescaled atmosphere looks excellent, especially with clouds from EVE. The darker blue region above the cloud layer (as per new EVE defaults) in the new version of Scatterer is just wonderful."},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T23:41:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Technologicat said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E .0215, I\u0027m getting the glitchy \u0022half planet clouds\u0022 in orbit with the new EVE (the issue mentioned and screenshotted by visivante [some pages back](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00215-05122015-ocean-shaders-get-them-while-theyre-hot/\u0026page=103#comment-2310913)), but on .021 this glitch does not occur.

I mean, I didn\u0027t even bother trying the mod out until 21 because as pretty as it is, a stable and consistent play experience is far more valuable to me than the extra visual effects.  KSP is super fun to play but what it lacks in graphics, it lacks double, maybe triple in soundscape.  I have more mods for adding sound to the game than I do visual improvements at this point.  To me, Collision FX has done just as much to improve the visuals as EVE or Scatterer but it most certainly gets nowhere near the recognition, and it adds much needed audio to boot!\n\nI think I may have drifted a bit there.  The atmospheric scattering in 21 seems to work to a degree that means I can leave it on without experiencing horrible experience thrashing bugs, and while the ocean shaders are nothing short of beautiful, they have a ways to go before they are good for much more than pimping screenshots.

I tried adjusting the load queue but this didn\u0027t seemt o influence it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also I love the foam effect, but when I increase it so it looks right below POV it builds up incredibly suddenly in the distance producing a white wall around you. I see there are some variables that influence the anistropic filtering for foam but I couldn\u0027t figure if these were helping or not?
