An outline-style would be more realistically doable though. I know that other tools in the past have been able to parse the craft files and/or the persistence file to offer a \u0022directory structure\u0022 type view for each part/scenario/module present in the appropriate file/node. I can\u0027t remember any names though, and they\u0027d all be older than \u0022Jeb\u0027s stash of snacks in the basement\u0022 in kerbal terms.
