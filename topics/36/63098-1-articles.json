A public market for everyone? That\u0027s kinda difficult, since a digital market does only make sense if someone the market trusts has actually control about the digital goods. CPP has, since they host the EVE servers. But KSP is a pure client game and you cannot trust the client to not cheat. So you either have to create lots of private markets that work via invite / authorization or you can only provide and somehow simulate prices without the possibility for clients to change data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane might be a problem since it has a pretty restricted license.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahd1601","CreatedById":60223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T15:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Palamedes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Palamedes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Kethane mod is brilliant..
