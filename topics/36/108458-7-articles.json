But with 1.1 out, i felt the IXS just couldn\u0027t be left stuck on version 1.0.5. \n\nI\u0027m very excited to hear you\u0027re working on a revamp! Are you redoing the models too? (any chance on a sneak preview?) \n\nI watched the modelling tutorial for ksp, but i\u0027m just not the artistic type. Haven\u0027t tried it, but i probably could do simple models using OpenSCAD. But i\u0027m just interested in keeping the mod compatible and functional. \n\nOn that last bit, i was pondering on how to better integrate the IXS with other mods and most importantly leveraging Community Resources. The EC to XM conversion feels a bit like a cheat. so i was considering the following : split functionality for drive and xm conversion between the 2 rings. i think this was already so at some point in the mod\u0027s history. Then: use the Tocamac/Arc reactor (housed in the main hull) principle to essentially make more EC out of EC from the solar panels \u002B some resource to keep the reaction going. that boosted EC is then used to power a miniature Large Hadron Collider in the secondary ring to bombard electrons into or out of a second resource in order to form the XM needed by the warp drive. so the chain would be: ec \u002B resource1 (ex: argon) = boosted ec (thinking 1.21gigawatt ;)) \u002B resource2 (xenon? uranium? Ore?...) = xm. Then the pods sitting in front of the lab and crew quarter could like be able to extract trace ammounts of 1 or 2 of the resources from space, or maybe outer atmosphere layers of planets (like what Sophia did with the jool gas). or 1 of the resources needs to be mined from a planet or asteroid, which is where one of those pods on top and at the bottom of the ship (which never got modelled)  would play a role. \n\nDo you have plans for the functional part of your revamped version? maybe we can sync the 2 designs in that regard? \n\ngrtz, \n\nDenko"},{"CreatedByName":"Denko666","CreatedById":135673,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T18:26:10Z","Content":"Mod is posted to Spacedock, CKAN option enabled. \n\nThis takes version 0.3.3 public, it is by no means finished... but it should be functional enough to enjoy in KSP 1.1\n\nShould any hiccups occur, please submit a ticket on the github page, and i\u0027ll look into it asap."},{"CreatedByName":"Denko666","CreatedById":135673,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T14:27:32Z","Content":"I find things suspiciously quiet in here,...

This has changed between 1.0.5 and 1.1\n\nThe different caps come from previous maintainers, and their functionality has changed according. One of the reasons there are more then u can place is because somewhere in the mod\u0027s history you could choose between the fully EC powered QV drive and a xenon fueled one. The caps in front could then be swapped to allow xenon extraction from Jool\u0027s outer atmosphere. \n\nThe 2 lookalike engines is just me toying with ideas i got from watching videos from NASA about alternative means of propulsion. The resource requirements will probably change in comming updates as i revamp the whole fuel/resource flow for the IXS.\n\nAs for the lights in the windows,... I have no clue how to do that, so that will take some time to do.\n\nNo warpship should ever have 2 warpdrives. There is a warpdrive ring and a warpdrive support ring. When i\u0027m done with the resource overhaul, you will need both to make the warpdrive work.\n\nSo...
