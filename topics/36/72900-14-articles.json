And KSP gives all sorts of values when you ask for longitude, so if you aren\u0027t clamping the results it gives you then you can end up with values greater than \u002B- 360. It makes it simpler to treat everything the same in KSP, so longitude is always displayed as -180 to 180\u003Csup\u003E0\u003C/sup\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T04:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce it gets loaded into RAM, the folder structure doesn\u0027t matter much really.
