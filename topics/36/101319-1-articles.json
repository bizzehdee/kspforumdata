The Space Engine part still works, so you can still use it to get textures from Space Engine. It will probably not be updated very soon, if at all. Use the examples or download some planet packs and look at how they did it.\n\nHello aspiring planet makers! Making planets for KSP used to be very difficult, but KopernicusTech makes it easy and relatively stable to make your own mod that adds planets. No coding experience is required, just editing configs. This tutorial will provide some configs for planets that you can modify for whatever ones you try to make. Since there has been no consolidated tutorial in place, I\u0027m trying to make one so that new people don\u0027t have to hunt over many threads and posts to find what they\u0027re looking for. Experienced planet makers, please feel free to correct me or to add to what\u0027s already here.\n\nOn to the tutorial itself.\n\n**Step 1.** Get Space Engine\n\nSpace Engine is a free software that procedurally generates the entire universe. You can visit stars, planets, and galaxies that humans have found and named, including our own solar system. You can also explore beyond known space to find more stars with their own planet systems, all generated by Space Engine. The most important part, though, is that you can export planet textures. You could also create your own textures without Space Engine, but that is much more difficult.\n\nYou only need SE if you want to make planets with height maps or to get textures for gas giants. If all you want are asteroids like Gilly, skip this step and the next one.\n\nGet Space Engine here: [http://en.spaceengine.org/](http://en.spaceengine.org/)\n\n**Step 2.** Find your planets and export them.\n\nYou can find planets for your pack by flying around and exploring by chance, or you can use a filter to select, for example, \u0022temperate terra\u0022 for an earth-like planet. I\u0027m not going to go into this in too much detail.\n\nOnce you have found a planet you want, hit Esc, and select \u0022Editor\u0022, then \u0022Export Planet\u0022. The information box will pop up. You want to export the surface color map, height map, and normal map. If there is an option for a specular map, you need that to be checked as well because otherwise your color map will not completely show up. The resolution is up to you, but keep in mind that unless you have a mid to high end graphics card you won\u0027t be able to export higher than 2048 (some computers will mistakenly run Space Engine on Intel graphics even if you have a dedicated graphics card. Make sure it\u0027s running on your best graphics when you export). Usually I like to use 4096 for larger planets, 2048 for mid size moons, and 1024 for tiny moons. Higher res textures will look better but will also take up more memory. For a gas giant planet all you need is the color map.\n\nHere in this picture I have exported the maps of a desert planet. Unlike in the picture, **export a normal map too**.\n\n![r74Yti1.png](http://i.imgur.com/r74Yti1.png)\n\nOnce you have your textures, navigate to the Export folder inside your Space Engine directory and copy the surface\\_bump and surface\\_diff into another folder for your mod. Rename surface\\_bump to yourPlanetName\\_height, surface\\_diff to yourPlanetName\\_map, and surface\\_norm to yourPlanetName\\_normal. The export folder only holds one planet at a time so make sure to save your textures before exporting again.\n\n**Step 3.** Set up your Kopernicus config file\n\nYour planets all need configuration files to work in KSP. The two most important, and the ones we\u0027re covering here, are the KittopiaTech SaveLoad file and the Kopernicus System file. First is Kopernicus. The sample file below has four example planets in it, one for a gas giant, one for an atmospheric planet, one for a non-atmospheric planet or moon, and one for a small asteroid moon. Copy this file into your favorite text editor and save it as YourSystem.cfg, then adjust the parameters for the planets you want to make.\n\n    @Kopernicus{    Body    {        name = TutGasGiant  //change to the name of your planet        flightGlobalsIndex = 1233  //change to any number, not too big.

You should have some textures, a file named YourSystem.cfg, and some other configs named after your planets. Install KopernicusTech if you haven\u0027t already. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109122-WIP-KopernicusTech-An-integration-attempt-between-Kopernicus-and-KittopiaTech-%280-121-02-13-15%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109122-WIP-KopernicusTech-An-integration-attempt-between-Kopernicus-and-KittopiaTech-%280-121-02-13-15%29)\n\nMake a folder inside GameData called YourPlanetPack (or whatever name you want, be sure it agrees with the file paths in the configs) and in it, put your YourSystem.cfg and a folder called \u0022Textures\u0022, then put your textures in there. Your Kittopia configs need to go inside the KittopiaSpace/SaveLoad folder.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have normal maps at this point, you can use the Normal Map Online tool to make your normal maps.\n\n[http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/](http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/)\n\nYou also don\u0027t have any maps yet for asteroid moons. Though the color is determined procedurally in game, they need a color map and a normal map for scaled space. A plain white png works just fine for now since KittopiaTech will make them for you, or you can find an asteroid in Space Engine to use as a placeholder.\n\n**Step 6.** Load KSP and hope it runs\n\nNow, load up KSP and open the debug menu (alt-f12) and go to the debug tab. Once it loads the main menu, scroll down and you should see something like this, with all of your planets listed after the stock ones. This image has my planet pack loaded:\n\n![wPuASmu.png](http://i.imgur.com/wPuASmu.png)\n\nIf the list only includes the stock planets, go back up and look for red text (errors). The most common one is that one of your texture files were named wrong. \n\nAny yellow errors \u0022PQS default not found\u0022 are okay, and this red error does not matter, your planets will load fine with it: \u0022[Exception]: DirectoryNotFoundException: Directory \u0027C:\\Users\\Brian\\Desktop\\KSP\\KTechTrial\\GameInfo\\KittopiaSpace\\Textures\\Kerbin\\PQS\u0027 not found.\u0022\n\nIf your game crashes before you reached the main menu, it\u0027s probably out of memory. Uninstall some other mods or reduce the number of planets you have or their texture size.\n\n**Step 7.** Fix ScaledSpace and errors using Kittopia\n\nLoad a sandbox game. In the tracking station or when focused on a craft, bring up the Kittopia GUI with Ctrl-P. Select your planets one by one and then click \u0022update scaled\u0022 with the export button checked. KSP will hang for a while, this is normal. This generates better normal maps, as well as a color and a heightmap. Your color map can replace the one you have (necessary for asteroid moons, optional for others) and the normal map replaces the old one. You can safely convert all of your normal maps to greyscale using Photoshop, Gimp, or Paint.NET to save memory later. Leave the transparency as is. DO NOT use the heightmap. The heightmap has all of the terrain noise built into it, which will be applied double if you replace your old heightmap with it.\n\nYou do not need to fix ScaledSpace with gas giants since they don\u0027t have normal maps.\n\nI highly recommend HyperEdit and the infinite fuel cheat to check out your planets with a small ship and make sure everything works. If it doesn\u0027t, you can alt-tab out of KSP, edit your Kittopia config, save it, then go back to KSP and press \u0022load data\u0022 with your planet selected. Remember to Update Scaled again after changing any settings.\n\nYour new files will be located in KittopiaSpace/Textures/ScaledSpace. Grab your new normal maps and any color maps you want, and replace the old textures in your textures folder. Delete the extra textures from the Kittopia folder afterward, it will try to load them and take up memory if you don\u0027t.\n\nThe other new files you will have will be .bin files in the KittopiaSpace/ScaledSpace folder. Leave them there, Kittopia uses them to load faster.\n\n**Step 7.** Package your mod\n\nTo make it easy for other people to install your mod, make a .zip folder and put a folder named GameData inside. Then, copy your DDSLoader, KittopiaSpace, Kopernicus, and YourPlanetPack folders into that folder. Putting a mod on the forums is not within the scope of this tutorial, but you\u0027ll need a license and a hosting site (KerbalStuff, Curse, etc.). Remember to say that your mod redistributes KittopiaTech and DDSLoader, and obey their licenses. Happy Planet Making!\n\n**Extra:** Ocean Planets\n\nOcean planets are hard to make. Most of the time your oceans won\u0027t line up with your color map and you\u0027re stuck with a misaligned texture. In Space Engine, export without \u0022Paint up oceans\u0022 checked. This is so the color map does not have any blue terrain. If you\u0027re having problems with oceans not lining up, this is probably because your terrain noise is higher than the depth of your ocean. One fix is to edit the height map in the image editor of your choice (not MS Paint) and selecting the oceans and darkening them. It might be easier to select the oceans if you export from Space Engine again with \u0022Paint up oceans\u0022 checked, since they will be flat on the heightmap. Once you\u0027re happy with the oceans, replace the color map with Kittopia\u0027s generated color map so it shows up correctly in scaled space.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T21:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sdj64**"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T21:25:51Z","Content":"Thank you so much!

These mods produce noise, and in your case the noise is drowning out the heightmap. Try adding them back in at the end and setting the deformities low or disabling them entirely. I do not think you can disable PQSLandControl, it breaks lots of things when you do. Just delete that line from your file. Also, this shouldn\u0027t be a problem but just to be safe add modEnabled = true to your PQSMod\\_VertexHeightMap.
