Studies show that two of the three overwhelm the third and that indicates our learning style. For me, I\u0027m visual-tactile... show me and then I can figure it out on my own by doing.

Yes, I\u0027ve read thru bunches of Unity tutorials and watched numerous videos but to this point I have found nothing that makes much sense to me. The above video did things so directly with near perfect annotation that once I got done watching I had to say, \u0022duh!\u0022... it really is easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you know of any link(s) that really break it down as nicely as the one I have mentioned above, please post.
