Probably not an all too critical problem, but my inline port offers a solution. Features:\n\n- Animated shield doors\n- Integrated switchable fuel storage (powered by [B9PartSwitch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140541-12-b9partswitch), albeit without texture switch)\n- [Real Fuels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118) compatibility\n- [Connected Living Space](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70161) compatibility\n\n[![rpmt2Bm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rpmt2Bm.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/mTKQmBS.jpg)\n\n[![4eVT5mf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4eVT5mf.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/Kxc2THX.jpg)\n\n**S2 Alt cockpit with crew capacity of 3**\n\nS2 has long been my favourite fuselage system, but it forces me to separate my established crews (such as the original Jeb, Bill and Bob trio); crew cabins help, but increase part count, so I\u0027m making a cockpit with three seats in S2 shape. It somewhat resembles the planned overhauled S3 cockpit, but shorter and without tilting nose.\n\n*Planned* features\n\n- Custom internal space\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters\n- Flag plate\n- Emissive texture for lights\n- Better window frame and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports textures\n\n![TtPJtCN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TtPJtCN.jpg)\n\n\u0022Family photo\u0022:\n\n[![PngPwxv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PngPwxv.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/fbUcUbG.jpg)\n\nInternal space\n\n[![XZmQcvD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XZmQcvD.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/vMMoXNe.jpg)\n\n**S2 engine mount**\n\nRemember the stock HL/Mk3 Shuttle-style engine mount? Well, here is an S2 counterpart: \n\n![5HwhjDL.png](http://i.imgur.com/5HwhjDL.png)\n\nIt is arranged differently though. Four attachment nodes with mirror symmetry plus a central node for launch stack/booster/fairings/another engine/whatever:\n\n![SvtV2yk.png](http://i.imgur.com/SvtV2yk.png)\n\n**S2 engine mount tail**\n\nAnother engine mount, extending farther backward and allowing to attach a tail fin (or a pair in V-shaped configuration):\n\n![gdopDWU.png](http://i.imgur.com/gdopDWU.png)\n\nIt comes with some tank space, two nodes with mirror symmetry for engines (and can accommodate two Vectors), plus, again, a central node:\n\n![HtJVxzd.png](http://i.imgur.com/HtJVxzd.png)\n\n**S2 to MK1 (1.25m) adapter**\n\nWhile it is possible to chain together S2 to 2.5m and 2.5m to 1.25m adapters, this results in a noticeable hump, and increased part count. This simple S2 to 1.25m thing attempts to remedy that.\n\nIt is symmetrical, with no heat tiles on the lower side, and comes with a modest amount of volume for fuel storage.\n\n[![2E8agls.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2E8agls.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/qezxCJ2.jpg)\n\n**S2 to MK2 adapter**\n\n![cjCY6HR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cjCY6HR.jpg)\n\nSimilar to MK1 adapter, but MK2!\n\n**S2 Decoupler**\n\n![sg3cniT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sg3cniT.jpg)\n\nSomething for that Abort button to trigger. Also, designed to be passable if Connected Living Space is used.\n\n**MK1 crew cabin with four seats**\n\nThis was not planned initially, but I always wanted a crew cabin for my small jets, and after seeing KSP v1.1 preview images I decided to roll out my own.\n\n![v9kDHa6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v9kDHa6.jpg)\n\n(redone in v0.7 because bac9 overhauled Mk1 parts in B9)\n\nComplete with IVA; four seat capacity is not a stretch, there is even an isle between seats:\n\n[![INkEz82.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/INkEz82.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/1r47XCn.jpg)\n\n**Requirements**\n\nThis pack attempts to reuse B9 textures, so at least part of B9 is required for this to work.
