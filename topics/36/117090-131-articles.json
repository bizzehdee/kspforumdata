If no new bugs pop up this week, or other changes needed, I will likely promote the current release to the \u0027stable\u0027 version.  I\u0027m not entirely happy with some of the tech-tree locations for a few parts (e.g. the F1 engine seems to be a node or two earlier than it should be), but those kind of changes won\u0027t be game/craft breaking.  I -am- pretty happy with the mass/fuel fraction/isp/general rocket-equation performance of the parts;  might be some minor nerfs coming to some things to bring them more in line with stock or other mods\u0027 configurations (e.g. zero-boil-off tank capacity and masses as compared to Near-Future/Kerbal Atomics/Cryo-Engines setups).\n\nWill also be doing another pass over the texture sets; the setup I did on Saturday was a bit of a hatchet-job, and I would like to clean it up a bit more/trim it down even further;  e.g. SRB\u0027s will only have one stock texture set, all others will be added through the optional texture pack, MFTs will only have 3-5 variants, and most mounts will have perhaps 2-3 variants.  Even debating whether or not to split those off into a separate \u0027basic\u0027 texture set pack (so would be core-mod, basic texture pack, and full texture pack);  still thinking it all over....\n\nWill be spending quite a bit more time over the next few weeks on getting the KSPWheel stuff all sorted out and working ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel](https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel) ).  Gotta have wheels and legs...things gotta roll and be able to land.  So far, so good; initial in-game tests of using the code to replace the stock system gave some very promising results (see second image and more info below).\n\nAfter all of the fun with wheels has been had, I\u0027ll be moving onto station parts (finally!)  Or perhaps finishing off the tanks, structural elements, and cargo bays?  Spherical tanks, cryo tanks, trusses, and various cargo bays would be nice to have in the short-term.  Trusses might wait until I start on the station parts in earnest;  will likely be contacting Nertea to see if I can borrow the form-factor from his trusses (hexa and octo), as I would like to remain visually compatible with his NF-Construction/Structural parts.  The models will have some differences to them, but should be visually compatible enough to not stick out too much if they are used on the same craft.  Will also be fewer parts that I need to make (e.g. adapters), as the NF parts will work fine (may still make a few adapters, to be used on the modular-structural-segments).\n\nQuick mock-up of a saddle-truss style \u0027cargo bay\u0027 that I had done a few months back (actually two short ones in that image).  These will be modular parts similar to the MFT tanks with multiple lengths available, and optional built-in end-caps.  Some of the structural/skeletal cargo bay variants will include NodeFairing modules so that the contents may be easily protected during ascent.  Other cargo-bays will use standard bay-door opening styles; some hinge style, some folding, some rotating (might even be a modular option?).  May or may-not have an end-cap variant with a deploy animation (you know... for driving rovers into and such)(or several deployable variants if I can pull it off).\n\n![2FSulLH.png](http://i.imgur.com/2FSulLH.png)\n\n**Wheels:**\n\nIn the image below I have replaced the stock wheel modules with a custom module, removed the U5 wheel collider component and replace it with a custom solution as well.  Suspension forces work, mesh animation works; input handling, throttle, steering, brakes not yet implemented (at the time of the image, but are partially/tentatively implemented now).  No twitching, jumping, bouncing... or any of the other weirdness that occurs with the U5 wheel colliders.  No exploding, or launching of craft/kerbals into the air.\n\nStill quite a bit left to be done; the friction model is overly simplistic (though -seems- good from a gameplay standpoint), and the sticky friction setup is only partially implemented (works, but with caveats); animation handling is implemented but un-tested (for landing legs or deployable landing gear).  Have not done anything yet regarding impact-tolerance or wheel/legs breaking, though as this is intended as a stock-replacement-solution I\u0027ll have to get those working eventually.  Have not yet done any dynamic-setup of the wheel parameters either.  Will likely implement some sort of a dynamic configuration \u0027range\u0027 for each wheel; obviously light wheels shouldn\u0027t be able to support multi-ton vehicles, but they do need to be usable across a wider range than a single set of spring/damper/friction values would allow (more the spring/damper... friction is already mass adjusted).\n\nWill likely go with a similar setup for SSTU wheels, though they will likely use a custom module that enables multiple wheels in the same part (baking that into the stock replacement module might be doable... still thinking on it a bit).\n\n![KGVQgeE.png](http://i.imgur.com/KGVQgeE.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T20:21:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Wheels:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In the image below I have replaced the stock wheel modules with a custom module, removed the U5 wheel collider component and replace it with a custom solution as well.

Battery level limits have always seemed overly restrictive only to ramp up so fast as to make you wonder what happened.  This is the same vein as not being able to have a ground vehicle LONG before being able to launch probes to other planets...especially when I can see vehicles driving around the KSC from the first time I enter a building.  Personally, I favor the part count reduction line of thought and prefer that as a solution than going out of your way to handicap the EC.

This will be the majority of the KSPWheel project, and is aimed at custom use by other mods own\u0027 PartModules (they\u0027ll need to write whatever advanced features they want for themselves).  Kerbal-Foundries will have their own custom PartModule for the features they want, SSTU will have its own custom PartModule for the wheel features that I want.\n\nThe other part of the KSPWheel project will be a stock-replacement PartModule.  This will be a very basic replacement for the stock PartModules that drive the stock wheels; its features will be those that are present on the wheels currently and/or were present on the wheels in KSP 1.05;  so pretty much you\u0027ll get a brake-torque slider, motor and steering invert toggles, and motor and steering enable/disable toggles, and not much else.  Legs -might- get a \u0027lock suspension\u0027 feature (if I can figure out how to do it with physics alone/in a non-hacky manner for the stock legs).\n\nI\u0027m intentionally -not- designing the \u0027ultimate wheel part-module\u0027, for the simple reason of different people wanting different features and having different expectations for the model hierarchy and setup.  So stuff like traction control, adjustable spring/damper/ride height, multi-wheel-collider support (for tracks), repulsor type setups, dynamic steering adjustment, more advanced animation integration, etc... will all be features that individual mods\u0027 implement on their own.  There is nothing stopping someone from implementing your suggestions, but most will not be part of the stock replacement PartModule that I\u0027ll be writing for the project.  Some may be part of the SSTUWheel module that I\u0027ll be writing, but it\u0027ll be a completely different beast than the stock-replacement-module.\n\nAs long as I can get the low-level component working, I\u0027ll consider the project a success.

I use your parts whenever I can since the level of customization is unparalleled.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that its going to take more time to build a rocket/plane (at least for me) with all the variants to go through, instead of the Lego building style. but then again I quickly learn where everything is and that together with very good balanced part stats is a win.

IMHO it\u0027s the best I\u0027ve seen and I\u0027ve used pretty much every type of fuel container there is in this game.  If you want to expand that I would have no hesitation in taking advantage of it everywhere that it\u0027s present.  So with that in mind...\n\nWhat will it\u0027s effects be when running multiple fuel switches as required by some mods?  If you implement this across all tanks inevitably people will fail to read the OP/ReadMes/changelogs etc and will come asking/bug reporting that either a) they don\u0027t have their switched tanks they were expecting or b) if you ignore tanks modified by those switchers, people will come asking/bug reporting that they don\u0027t have the SSTU switched tanks.  I would volunteer now to help field those question in thread to be able to have the SSTU container model more widely available. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nAs to the second part - limited expansion to MK2/3 form factor?  This may be the best solution as it will still result in people asking (and I\u0027ll help field LOL) but there would be less of it to some degree.  Personally I want your container setup available to me *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eeverywhere.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E*  I frequently find myself pulling off a B9 switched tank in favor of one of yours because they are so much better.

And this is true for most of modded rocket tanks as well. There is a notable exeption to this: Near Future Propultion tanks. I already made a patch that add NFP fuel to your tanks. But I could see myself using a SSTU style version of NFP and NFC, mostly for esthetical reason. Don\u0027t get me wrong, your tanks look awesome. But for a Space Tug, NFC trust/tanks are looking great.\n\nFor the Mk2 MK3,  I barely use them when building planes. (OPT and MkIV when it will be updated) But I am sure others would find a use for SSTU style Mk2 and Mk3.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 23/5/2016 at 3:04 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After all of the fun with wheels has been had, I\u0027ll be moving onto station parts (finally!)  Or perhaps finishing off the tanks, structural elements, and cargo bays?  Spherical tanks, cryo tanks, trusses, and various cargo bays would be nice to have in the short-term.  Trusses might wait until I start on the station parts in earnest;  \u003Cu\u003Ewill likely be contacting Nertea to see if I can borrow the form-factor from his trusses (hexa and octo), as I would like to remain visually compatible with his NF-Construction/Structural parts.\u003C/u\u003E  The models will have some differences to them, but should be visually compatible enough to not stick out too much if they are used on the same craft.  Will also be fewer parts that I need to make (e.g. adapters), as the NF parts will work fine (may still make a few adapters, to be used on the modular-structural-segments).\n\u003E \n\nThat sound awesome. Cargo bays and reusable fairing would be great. Same with NF style trust and tanks. I am curious to know how you imagine your crewpod/habitat, will they be customizable? And also, will you do centrifuge?\n\nOn another topic, I have a suggestion, see it as a wish list from a always-wanting-more-customer. \n\nThe Rocket-in-a-Box:\n\nDo we realy have to carry a empty tank to Duna or a fully assembled trust to space? I am thinking about a IKEA kit. Basicly, If SSTU part could be either converted into \u0022box\u0022 or stored in KIS with only thier \u003Cu\u003EtankageVolume\u003C/u\u003E concidered.
