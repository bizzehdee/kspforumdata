You can then view the results on the SCANsat maps; the biome lock option can toggled in the settings menu to remove the need for ground-truthing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also an option to limit zoom map resource overlays to planets with the narrow-band scanner for ore, or the corresponding part for other resources.

Should I limit the resource overlay to when your current vessel has a narrow-band scanner, or when any vessel around the current planet has a scanner?

Module Manager configs will add special SCANsat modules to each relevant scanner part (Survey Scanner, Karbonite array, MKS antenna, etc...) and will have a field that can be changed to enable or disable the module. You can also specify the resource scanning type in the config, allowing you to use whatever part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also an option in the settings menu to delete any existing resource scanning data.
