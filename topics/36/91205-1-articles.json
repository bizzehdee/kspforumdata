Once a week I will post a SIMPLE part idea for people to work on. During that week you post your work in progress, ask questions, help others and learn how to integrate your creations in-game from start to finish. The difference is your going to post your source art (preferably a unity package) so others can learn from it and discuss how you did what you did. The whole process is open to everyone, so if you don\u0027t know anything, that\u0027s great you can learn! If you are already a pro then you can help others and show off some of your work. At the end we pack up the best of and post a download link for every one to enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeekly Part Idea: Apollo Inspired Rover base for the Rovemax Model M1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101129-Open-Source-Part-Week-Week-1-Submission-Thread%21-Status-Operational?p=1560209\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESubmission Thread: Operational\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Status: Operational And Taking Entries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules (Based off the old Open Parts Mod Week Rules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEverything is open.
