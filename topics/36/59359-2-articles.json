Many of the parts I made were more to suit my own projects and I am using IR as a supplement for those things I just can\u0027t do.\u003Cp\u003EEssentially my interest in Infernal Robotics was fairly linear. I needed a plugin that allowed me to attach things to animated objects and have them move with it - and this seemed the only solution (and appears still is the only solution to that modding issue) so for me, things like rotating VTOLS which I use on just about all my ships was where I put my focus. Sirkut pretty much did all the pistons and hinges, I just did a few rotatrons really and skinned some parts, so I didn\u0027t have that big a part in it really. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, Glad you are taking it up as the infernal parts I make sort of are really specific to my ships, and I don\u0027t really have the free time available to do everything I want, including a nice shiny stock set of IR parts that are not overblown.
