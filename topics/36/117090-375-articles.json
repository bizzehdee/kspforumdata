If I didn\u0027t need part-modules that would work on welded parts, I never would have started coding plugins for KSP.  Was actually my first bit of plugin code for KSP, IIRC -- a multi-transform capable fixed solar panel module.\n\nWhat irks me even more is that many of these modules could support multiple transforms/animations/etc with just some *very minor edits*, generally one-line type of changes, where they could still be 100% backwards compatible with existing uses.  Trying to convince SQUAD of that though has been a futile effort the few times I\u0027ve tried.\n\nAlternatively they could implement an actual API for these stock systems; e.g. an ISolarGenerator interface one could implement on their part-module.  External mods would then no longer look for the stock solar panel class, but could then interact with ANY module that implemented that interface, regardless of which mod it came from.  Of course, that would mean that someone at SQUAD actually *understood* *and used* one of the primary tenants of OO programming, which are most often lost on anyone targeting Unity (\u0027what...?

If you forget to set an action for them, you better not be in a hurry to open them once flying.\n\u003E \n\nSpecifically because I always hated the stock solar panels with their colliders, always getting broken by... random kerbals?  sneezes?  looking at them sideways?  IDK, they always broke for me from the slightest brush of collision with anything, or sometimes nothing at all (break on being deployed, or on vessel reload).\n\nSo the SSTU solar panels simply don\u0027t have colliders on the panels.  The only way to destroy one is to destroy that little knob.  (note that they still have code that will destroy them from excessive aero forces; they are not deployable wings after all)\n\nIs this the best way to fix the perceived problem?  Possibly not, but it was the fastest and easiest one I could implement (and also, at the time that module was written, in my early days of KSP modding, I did not have enough knowledge of Unity to properly handle destroying of just the panel meshes and persist that state across reloads). \n\nI\u0027ve since learned how to handle such an issue (and collisions could be enabled in the current plugin easily enough) -- but now the problem is that the original models lack colliders.  Some of those solar panels have ~100 meshes that would need to have colliders generated, added to the model hierarchy, positioned, and then imported into unity and individually configured there as well; a massively time consuming project, at best.  This also brings up the issue of \u0027100 colliders on a part\u0027 is simply bad for performance; terrible even when using primitives (cubes/spheres). \n\nTo effectively add colliders to these parts I would have to get... creative.  Enable/disable the colliders as part of the animation to minimize the number needed, or have a single/few collider(s) that \u0027scales up\u0027 during deployment that covers the entire mesh (but is not animated accurately relative to the visible panels).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m certain it could do well with a ground-up rewrite by developers experienced in building supportable, high-performance code, but there is no one to do that.\n\u003E \n\nPretty much exactly that.  KSP was started by one guy (HarvesteR), working for what was at the time a marketing firm.  From what I understand he had little knowledge of coding when he started, so the years of \u0027best practice\u0027 knowledge I take for granted, would have been completely unknown to him at the time.  Not trying to be critical of his efforts or accomplishments, everyone is new at some time.\n\nFast forward a few years and the KSP codebase has grown substantially, but was never taken through the rewrite that it should have been once the original code deficiencies were realized.  Possibly they never were or have been realized -- the issues we encounter in the modding scene simply wouldn\u0027t exist in the base code interacting with itself -- they only manifest when trying to interface arbitrary mods with each other without using reflection or compile-time dependencies.\n\nNot a problem specific to KSP either (or even game modding).  When I was doing Minecraft modding there were much of the same issues encountered regarding cross-modding interactions and layers-of-cruft style code.  I also see much of the same with some of the software that I maintain for my employer, layers of bad code covering up more layers of bad code; but as long as it \u0027functions\u0027, there is little motivation to spend the time to rework things."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-10T18:25:22Z","Content":"[@Joker58th](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178441-joker58th/) [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nangle \u0027snapping\u0027 works fine but there\u0027s another field that needs to be set which is captureMinRollDot - how close does it actually have to be to the snapOffset to be considered on target.

Essentially \u0027stock\u0027 for most intents and purposes.\n\nAfter progressing 3/4 the way through career mode, I am happy to say, that the only real issue I encountered with SSTU was, maybe, one of the MRCS blocks not persisting fuel selection properly (changed to MP in editor, did not work in flight).  Thankfully the other ship in that docking operation had functional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so it had no real impact on the mission.\n\nOne thing that I did note from a balance perspective (aside from stock tech tree still makes no sense), is that SSTU does perhaps make career mode a slight bit easier with the configurable tanks and increased selection of engines.  Really need to do some side-by-side comparisons though to see how pure-stock craft line up.\n\nThe other note that I\u0027m taking away from this session, is that perhaps some of the SSTU parts have been made a bit \u0027too\u0027 configurable.  The UIs on the tanks (especially the MUS) are a bit of a nightmare with all the various controls.  I\u0027m really not sure any other way to do it though while still maintaining the same level of configuration and keeping a goal of \u0027low part count\u0027; some sort of custom UI might be a viable alternative, but only if creating UIs in KSP was a simpler prospect.\n\nI previously had a concern that perhaps some of SSTU wouldn\u0027t fit well beside the stock parts due to the mismatch in shaders, but at this point the stock parts are just as mixed up themselves, what with half of them using PBR and half not.  The color palette used on the newer/redone stock parts is also much closer to the SSTU coloring, so the whites/blacks are a much closer match and not quite as jarring as it used to be.  Overall I felt the stock pieces worked acceptably beside SSTU (or vice-versa);  not a perfect match, but not too visibly jarring either.\n\nOverall I\u0027m fairly happy with the experience of SSTU in career mode in its current version, for use alongside \u0027stock\u0027 mechanics.  No real surprises, and decent coverage of parts to use for stock game systems.

In general I do like your approach of not stacking parts to make rockets look better and also reduce part count for physics/cpu issues.  I can understand why some might not as it also bypasses some of the early career part limitations which normally takes trade-offs and/or ingenuity to complete a mission.  There is some challenge there.\n\nI have an idea.  Take your procedure tanks for example.  Is there a way to fool KSP in to thinking there are more parts in a single procedural part but only in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E?  Say based on the length of the tank, more parts would be added or removed and be reflected in and subject to the Engineers report limitations.  Once you go to launch, the part number would be the actual parts used.  This way, your parts would fit better into career and yet still be low part counts for cpu/physics reasons when flying.  Maybe tanks would be upgraded at certain levels so that as tech advances, fewer parts per tank are needed.  Possibly corresponding to where larger stock tanks are placed in the tech tree.\n\nAnother example would be the engines.  A single engine starts out as two parts, one for the engine and one for the mounting plate.  Each engine would add to the part count from there on but again, only in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nMaybe the part count for each procedural part would show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E as well.\n\nAnyhow, just a high level idea without any knowledge if it can be done and if so, how much work involved."},{"CreatedByName":"Joker58th","CreatedById":178441,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T01:35:44Z","Content":"Here are some screen shots of my latest career.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xq1OSM1](https://imgur.com/a/xq1OSM1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T03:02:19Z","Content":"Cargo Lander with Lynx Rover.
