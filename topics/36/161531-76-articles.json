I have taken to using the \u0027ignore max heat\u0027 alt-f12 cheat until Squad figures out what\u0027s wrong with the heating model; until then here\u0027s what I know (it\u0027s easier to debug with that cheat on since you can see what\u0027s actually causing the problem instead of a giant fireball and dead kerbals which is what you get otherwise):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There is a problem mixing the stock radiators and the KSP-I-E radiators. Most of the time, activating both will cause a spontaneous overheat\u002Bexplosion of multiple parts. Sadly the Mk2 cargo bays qualify as heat radiators. This isn\u0027t always the case and is exacerbated by docking such a craft with another such craft, ie, my Mk2 spaceplane to my orbital factory, all of which are using KSP-I-E radiators and reactors and other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. Behavior with heat cheat turned off - upon docking and realigning of the camera to the now-docked combined craft, the Mk2 cargo bay (which is a radiator itself) will explode \u0022due to heat\u0022 according to F3 and the plane falls apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. Behavior with heat cheat turned on - cargo bay immediately spikes to 2x maximum temperature (using critical temp display mod). All surrounding parts immediately spike to similar temps within 1-5 seconds. Advancing time to, say, 100x for a couple of seconds clears the issue and it does not happen again upon returning to normal time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There is a problem when using \u0027Advanced Jet Engine\u0027 with KSP-I-E - it completely breaks the air breathing capability of the thermal turbojet. This is just an informative heads-up, I don\u0027t really expect this to be solved since AJE tries to rework how all air-breathing engines work, and this is just a side effect of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you accidentally throttle up a TTJ that\u0027s still set to air breathing mode, it\u0027ll flame out. Switching it to closed cycle mode and then increasing throttle will often cause it to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If you use TCA (Throttle Controlled Avionics), any time the thrust limiter for any engine (TCA balances thrust to keep you going straight) hits 0, the engine will overheat and explode instantly, even if it wasn\u0027t even hot before. Setting thrust limiters to 0 manually, with the TTJ running or not, does not cause this behavior. This also happens with thermal rockets. I\u0027m not sure if this is an interstellar issue or a TCA issue, but it does NOT seem to happen with non-Interstellar engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pvtstash","CreatedById":147688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T13:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERadial radiators aren\u0027t exactly top of line for radiators.

Unfortunately I couldn\u0027t afford the 1500 science cost tonight because I spent the 5k science last night trying to figure out which node would upgrade it - I thought I had saved first, but nope. All useful stuff. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent tonight trying to gather science in the Kerbin system (I could easily time accelerate and get it, but I don\u0027t like doing it unless it\u0027s just a few days between manoeuvres etc) by doing something rather silly. I made a science SSTO (plane) with lab (mk2 from a mod), 2 mk2 Rapier likes, and a NERV. It\u0027s a bit of a pig to get into orbit, and of course much less practical than a rocket launched craft would be. It has 6 impact probes as well and for them to be useful I need to land it on the Mun \u0026amp; Minmus. So tonight it was landing on the mun.. on the wheels.. with 4 puffs as the VTOL - just enough to kill a couple m/s after going horizontal. Managed it on my 5th attempt after mastering the action key setup for switching between engines. I was very pleased when I landed, moved the camera and realised I was on a 30 degree slope of a crater - not sure how that happened. Was sliding sideways down it too. Enabled steering and got it down into the crater. Silly, but fun.
