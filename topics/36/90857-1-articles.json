The Tracking Station could have a menu to pick a solar system to view, and only the active solar system\u0027s orbits, planets, and light source would be rendered, the rest just being stored in a save file until needed. On selecting a solar system, the Kerbolar system as seen in the Tracking Station would be completely replaced by the new system (a la Kerbal Warp Drive), the positions of the objects in it would be left in the save file, and the new system\u0027s object positions would simply be updated based on their orbital parameters and the current time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course is a much larger task than just hacking in extra stars as distant \u0022planets\u0022 the way Kopernicus and Planet Factory do presently, but if successful should be much better in terms of performance and Kraken resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note is that for a real interstellar ship, someone\u0027s going to have to make us some proper interstellar ship parts, i.e. big crew centrifuges, big lightweight fuel reservoirs, meteoroid shields, ultra-super-duper nuclear engines, etc. I suggest looking over the Space Engine ship editor\u0027s part selection for inspiration.
