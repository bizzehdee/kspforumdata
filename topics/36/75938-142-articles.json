Almost anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first off, I\u0027ve discovered something annoying. Module Manager tests the loaded configs for changes between the last cached configs and the current loaded configs. When no changes are found, it can load the patches from the cache instantly instead of having to iterate through every MM config. When our global variable file is changed and then the game is shut down and reloaded, MM counts that change even if it doesn\u0027t actually patch it ever. So, I\u0027m wondering if we need to swap out the .cfg file for a simple .txt file to contain all our globals. I\u0027ve already done this locally and am going to test that now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve added a little check for the ride height of the repulsors to turn off the repulsor lights when the rest of the repulsor is shut down. Otherwise, I got the GUI toggle working in real time \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E the action group update working perfectly. Maybe not as efficiently, since I basically created a secondary ApplySettings method. Well, I guess the \u003Cem\u003Eaccurate\u003C/em\u003E way of saying it is that I \u003Cem\u003Ere-purposed\u003C/em\u003E the ApplySettingsAction method from being an action group item to simply being a standard method that skipped the \u0022foreach\u0022 part of the other ApplySettings method, but did all the other things to update the right variables, and then referenced \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Emethod from the action groups. Either way, it works like a charm. I\u0027ll commit my changes after one more test unless you\u0027ve done it a better way, in which case I defer to your code. I\u0027m still fiddling with the light settings. Running them as vertex lights is much more reliable, but also doesn\u0027t get that intermittent on/off that you were liking about the others. They also aren\u0027t spotlights anymore, but I kinda like them better overall. It would still be nice if they could light up the ground more when running at night, so I\u0027m fiddling around with different intensity settings. In the end, an intensity based on the repulsor power (and the work required to maintain that power vs. the weight bearing down on them), and possible a fade to zero effect that played in time with the shrink/grow effect when the repulsors turn off/on would be awesome. I think the effect power for the sound needs to be given a lower clamp, or needs to be divided by less than it is now. I\u0027m still not ever actually hearing anything from the repulsors while they\u0027re running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAH HA!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Found it!

So, every time we save a different value to that config file we are also forcing MM to abandon its cache and reload the patches all over again. If, however, we change the KFGlobals.cfg into a KFGlobals.txt, both in the file name and the code, it should load up and save more or less exactly the same, but won\u0027t cause MM to take notice of it and thus allow users who don\u0027t change their mods out often to not have to re-patch every single load.

If I have problems with reaction wheels, I disable the reaction while I\u0027m roving. I\u0027ve tried to mess with mods that forced different keys on me and I just got confused because the majority of PC games make use of the same set of keys for movement. Besides, the WASD set of keys are situated in a perfect spot for quick access to the first several action group keys, the light toggle key (I remapped that one to Z like I do in most other games that have flashlights or whatnot) and X for instant cutoff of the throttle. It really makes sense to keep those keys as they are. a better way of handling control issues, in my opinion, would be to further expand on the mode-switching plugins (like the one that swaps the keys for yaw and roll when running in either rocket or plane mode). I\u0027d think a \u0022rover mode\u0022 would be great, which would suspend pitch and roll control while the craft is grounded, which would suit rovers great, but would still swap back to the previously active mode when loosing contact with the ground so that orientation can be adjusted for flight and/or landing after \u0022catching air\u0022 so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: We have success with all the previously discussed fixes I was working on related to the repulsors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T17:36:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T19:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on simplifying, moving the repulsor stuff into DustFX, then deleting RepulsorDustFX, which is mostly redundant.

With that comparison in place, we are somewhat defeating the purpose of a camera system because in that little errant area around the KSC where it flags the grass area as tundra, we still end up with a snowy effect in that spot. I think we should simply use the camera alone, along with maybe a slight modifier to brighten it a little bit, and only use the defines when the camera is turned off. I\u0027d still sample the alpha channel from the defines though, so that specific material thicknesses can be set.

I also don\u0027t understand why I can\u0027t get the pure camera color sample to show up as well as the dust color definition version. When they\u0027re both active together the colors end up horribly washed out, when the dust definitions are used alone it looks great, and when the camera is used alone it\u0027s so transparent that it\u0027s impossible to see. To top it off, before you merged everything I had the repulsor lights turning off when the repulsor was shut down, and now even \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is broken again. We\u0027re going to have to revert the merger I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: Never mind, I think I\u0027ve got it working again. Needs more testing.

As it is, we still have that buggy area around the KSC that reports as a snowy region when it\u0027s obviously green, which is why I\u0027d like to find a way to use the camera as the primary means of sampling the colors. It just ends up \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too subtle with only the camera.
