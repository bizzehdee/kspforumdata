I\u0027ve got everything set up correctly (although currently it\u0027s not recognising MechJeb, but I\u0027ve not finished troubleshooting that yet), but I\u0027ve had some pretty odd problems. Some of them vanished when I started testing to work out what did what, but one didn\u0027t, and it\u0027s a pretty big one. The issues I was having were that sometimes undocking the lander caused it to lose power to all the panels, and nothing would turn it back on. There was plenty of electric charge, so that wasn\u0027t the issue. The other problem was that sometimes undocking from within IVA would completely disable IVA view, removing the portraits as well. This is the issue that remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for clarity, here\u0027s what I\u0027ve tested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReference item: From: IVA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1-2 Mk1-2 Yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1-2 ALCOR Yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1-2 N/A No\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALCOR ALCOR Yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALCOR Mk1-2 Yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALCOR N/A No\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these configurations work now (although some of them were causing the loss of power issue before testing began), apart from the fifth. With the ALCOR set as the reference item, undocking from the Mk1-2 in IVA mode breaks IVA entirely, at which point pressing c freezes the camera in place. Ships still respond to controls, but the camera won\u0027t move. Pressing c again doesn\u0027t return control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I have my solution, but I thought I\u0027d let you know in case it\u0027s indicative of a problem. It could be something to do with RPM, or it could be the ALCOR, I don\u0027t know. For the record, my other mods are few in number: everything required to make the ALCOR work, MechJeb, VesselView, SCANsat and Docking Port Alignment to activate those bits of functionality, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement to stop things falling apart, Telemachus for external data streams and Atomic Age for a few parts, but none of those are in use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T06:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a stock bug, actually.. could you replicate it in stock?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oldwarsong","CreatedById":150763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T01:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems I have broken it.
