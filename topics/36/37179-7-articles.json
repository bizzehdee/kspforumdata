FYI: Something that irks me about some people\u0027s versioning style is the use of the points between each number as decimal points. Most professional bodies follow the [major].[minor].[bugfix] system (or something very similar), where each number is a distinct number, not a fraction or decimal. For example, KSP 0.20 (a very recent version) is not the same as KSP 0.2 (a very old version). The main advantage of this system is that you can have an infinite number of versions between major releases, instead of being unnecessarily constrained by your versioning system, for example you should not be forced (in your style) to go from version 0.99 to version 1.00, instead you can use 0.100.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T20:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZRM","CreatedById":64626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T19:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFYI: the KSC runway is 2.4km X 60.5m\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EWas that done using rovers?

FYI: Something that irks me about some people\u0027s versioning style is the use of the points between each number as decimal points. Most professional bodies follow the [major].[minor].[bugfix] system (or something very similar), where each number is a distinct number, not a fraction or decimal. For example, KSP 0.20 (a very recent version) is not the same as KSP 0.2 (a very old version). The main advantage of this system is that you can have an infinite number of versions between major releases, instead of being unnecessarily constrained by your versioning system, for example you should not be forced (in your style) to go from version 0.99 to version 1.00, instead you can use 0.100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHah!
