If for example you have a cylinder shaped part that you want to turn into a collider, the collider you\u0027d get from that mesh would be a solid cylinder (that pops you to the outside of the vessel when you try to move inside it), when what you really want is a hollow one. What you\u0027d ideally want is the difference between the external part model and the internal one, but those two often don\u0027t match up as you\u0027d expect. As a quick example, did you ever notice that one of the cupola\u0027s windows is shorter than the others? But only on the outside? This doesn\u0027t matter in game, and you\u0027ll probably  never notice it, but it affects how you would set up colliders.
