Thanks for sustaining it. Now, I have delved into the realm of NASA shuttle reports, it seems that the Orbiter was supposed to land at 88 m/s assuming 1 atm. But seeing that orbiter can loop multiple times and is almost feather like, would I change the lift or the drag of the orbiter?\n\nSecondly, It seems that the roll is requiring much more effort and is prone of rolling on top. I do roughly lower my thrust to around 78% as the real shuttles do when passing through the sound barrier, could this be the extreme lifting body lifting the main external fuel tank, when proceeding said roll over?\n\nLastly there some, how to describe it, \u0022ghost\u0022 parts in which in the VAB a part, such as wing, or engine refuses to have any parameters set for, a common fix is to delete the craft.\n\n(P.S. I could muck around with the prices of the parts, tech tree, and all of that career jazz.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T05:29:08Z","Content":"@iDisorder: Like magic aye ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T06:43:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 06:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mike-NZ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T06:42:29Z","Content":"@therag. \n\nThanks for that figure. 88m/s\n\nI am aware of the ghost parts, null reference. its because the wings are \u0027control\u0027 surfaces because they have different dynamincs and worked better. when wings are \u0027lifting body\u0027 like the stock shuttle delta wing they go mad. they were lowered to something like a quarter of the lift of the delta wings and still it acted like a glider. it could also be down to things like the base rotation or node placement of the part or rescaling.\n\nthe feather effect is horrible I know. centre of lift, drag, mass and artificial lifting/control is not aligned\n\nthe rolling over is a real issue. the wings want to be above the heavy thing. that\u0027s the ET or the orbiter body itself.\n\nI can either lower COM inline with wings or add huge torque power, but with lots of torque it will roll over so fast in space its not realistic, unless you disable torque and use rcs instead.\n\nI tweak these stats often and it works better as a shuttle shaped rock with no artificial lift basically.\n\nhowever - \n\nI have made a one piece shuttle and I am ready to do some tests. simpler calculations and easy to modify, we should be onto something good here.\n\nand for those who like to build up their shuttle every time, don\u0027t worry the standard multi piece model will be staying, but will have stats from the one piece carried over, and hope it works\n\nand the ghosting new decoupler is because a lack of collision mesh or node collider, my bad.\n\nand a side note: please don\u0027t try to land or reenter with too much oms fuel in the back. it makes a huge dfference.\n\nand I actually haven\u0027t done a full trip in this thing yet. but thank you all for testing!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n@cheech.\n\nyeah I may do....\n\nhave you had any experience with adding textures to parts in a modeling program? \n\nI can give you the new decoupler and booster to play with and check out.\n\nfor some reason its texture is sparkly in game.

Shifted the CoM more forward, close to where it is real life. And did a lot of work on the Aero with step by step testing. Result: stable launch without any roll/yaw. It flies like a brick! Stallspeed close to where it is RL. So you have to land at around 80m/s. I will send the files to you Mike when I\u0027m finished.\n\n\\*Edit: Did some more test flying. It is damn hard to land now. When you get your speed under 75m/s you are screwed. So you have to come in very, very steeply. The meatball drifts off a bit as well so it really feels like flying a brick.
