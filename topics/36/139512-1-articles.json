I\u0027m Festivejelly or Nick whichever you prefer and i\u0027m new to the modding scene. I\u0027ve watched in amazement over the years of the dedication and talent that the modding community has. A result of this is that you have all inspired me to get off my backside and start using some skills I learned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a C# developer i\u0027ve always had a keen interest in programming, especially in Unity. So I figured I should have a crack at writing my own mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe idea of this mod is that you would be able to take a sub-assembly that you have lovingly created in the VAB or SPH, and build it on another celestial body, or in space, or wherever you have an engineer with desire to build!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know other mods exist that achieve the same goal but I wasn\u0027t happy with how they were implemented.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love how Kerbal Inventory System (KIS) deals with items in the game so I figured it would make sense to make it a major component of this mod. I also think OSE workshop would be a great complement to this mod as it allows you to build individual parts out of material kits. These parts are then stored in KIS storage, which is where my mod comes in...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does it work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Planning stage\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 So first you\u0027ll need to hop into your VAB or SPH and create a sub assembly for the craft you wish to build and save it. (side note, perhaps I could also allow crafts that are not subassemblies)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 In order to create your craft you\u0027ll need to ensure you\u0027ve got all the parts. These parts will need to be stored in a KIS compliant container and be within X meters of your engineer before you can commence the build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Build!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 You eva your engineer to a site you want the craft built, right click to bring up the eva GUI and click \u0022Assemble Craft\u0022, this will bring up a new UI window allowing you to select a craft you\u0027d\u00A0like to build. Once selected a list of parts will be shown highlighted green if you have them, and red if you dont. If the parts are red you cant build the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou then click the \u0022Assemble\u0022 button and a hologram of the ship will be shown at your mouse cursor. This will then allow you to rotate it and raise and lower it etc so that it doesnt clip into the landscape when you build it. When you have chosen a suitable orientation etc and you click the left mouse button, the craft will be built and the items removed from KIS storage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is still very much a proof of concept and I will no doubt hit hurdles on the way, but if anyone would like to offer their assistance or suggestions then im all ears.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ll update this space when I have more progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T12:00:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 12:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Festivejelly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"njmksr","CreatedById":114236,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T11:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222574741\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462959922\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002237420\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Festivejelly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Festivejelly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, firstly i\u0027ll introduce myself.
