Instead you\u0027re offered a button to \u0022deploy\u0022 the collider. Clicking \u0022deploy\u0022 doesn\u0027t seem to do much, but the button changes from \u0022deploy\u0022 to \u0022close\u0022. You\u0027re also offered a \u0022download data\u0022 button, but clicking on that from an EVAed kerbal causes you to lose the data. I\u0027ve a feeling that\u0027s not working as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you keep your kerbals inside, have a lab module, and right click the collider, you\u0027re offered the opportunity to click \u0022process in lab module\u0022. Doing so always results in a \u0022not enough space for data\u0022 failure. You don\u0027t lose the data, you can still keep or transmit it, but if it never works, why is it offered?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you transmit the data, the experiment locks like a goo pod, but you can still run the experiment and collect the data. It won\u0027t let you download the data that\u0027s there. If you have a lab, you can clean the experiment. (and lose the data) If you run the experiment, collect data and hit transmit; you can clean the experiment. Takes forever and warping time doesn\u0027t help, but that\u0027s a problem with all cleanable experiments. Unlike a goo pod or bay, there\u0027s no provision to allow an EVAed scientist the opportunity to clean the experiment. After cleaning, the \u0022clean experiment [1]\u0022 button is still offered by right clicking on the lab, but the collider acts as if it\u0027s clean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETooling around the KSC with a nuke powered, collider equipped, rover I find that at each biome I get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E165 science for driving to the biome, running the experiment to 1500/1500 (which takes 4 days) and recovering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E96.3 science for doing it a second time in the same biome. (261.3 total for that biome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E56.1 science for the third time. (317.4 total for that biome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I run the experiment, transmit the data, clean the experiment, re-run the experiment, and recover I get 213.1 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this takes a lot longer than launching and driving to the desired KSP biome twice, and you get less science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECleaning and re-running without the opportunity to EVA and collecting the data really isn\u0027t worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with 32 biomes, and running each biome 3 or 4 times, you have over ten thousand science available without leaving the ground at KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinion time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the collider shouldn\u0027t work on Kerbin\u0027s surface.
