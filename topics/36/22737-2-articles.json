I finally came up with something I thought could be useful, but not overlap. From what I understand about fusion technology as it stands right now, it\u0027s not terribly accurate either, but that wasn\u0027t really the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the cfg from Hikari\u0027s Sabre engine, I learned how to make it consume fuel while not on! So I made a set of \u0022fusion\u0022 engines that constantly consume fuel (at a vastly reduced rate) to produce large amounts of electricity. Since I don\u0027t know how to make a right-click menu that will toggle the fuel consumption off/on I bumped up their vacuum-ISP and Thrust values (by a factor of 10, for now- no idea how OP that\u0027s going to end up being). Once I figure that out, I\u0027ll tone them back. But I think I\u0027ve got a decent concept, so I thought I\u0027d share. Maybe even something you could include in your official pack!
