You actually went the length of writing up demo mod files.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the first solution \u0027JetEngine3\\_EC\\_RAM\u0027 is a combination of air intake and jet engine, where the air intake generates a new resource, and the jet engine consumes this new resource alongside IntakeAir.\n\nThe second solution is to add a generator module to the jet engine that consumes electric current to produce a new resource, then the jet engine consumes this new resource alongside the IntakeAir.\n\nI really like the second solution. It allows me to impose a continuous minimum electrical consumption rate for running the jet. I wonder, is it possible to have electric current consumed both by the \u0027generator\u0027 and as propellant at the same time?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T22:27:31Z","Content":"Would think so.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWould think so.\n\nEDIT- And forgot to take off the ModuleAlternator as you can see it was set way high and it was just for testing."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:08:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would think so.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Would think so.\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT- And forgot to take off the ModuleAlternator as you can see it was set way high and it was just for testing.\n\nYeah, I made the appropriate corrections. \n\nI found out that the \u0027resource generator\u0027 module works fulltime, as in, it draws Ec even when the resource reserve is full, or if the engine is at zero thrust. Also, the thrust displayed in the VAB is not just a random number, it is exactly 50% of the value I wanted it to be.\n\nI\u0027ll return after more testing.\n\nPS: I finished making the reactors.
