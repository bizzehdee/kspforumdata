I don\u0027t know where you got that idea. But that\u0027s why I would make a separate resource to go with the community resource pack. Part of hunting down the right locations being that you need to find the right locations with water AND geothermal energy. (Or bring your own water.) Secondly, not all bodies are going to have geothermal activity. Take Minmus for example. Minmus is the size of a large asteroid, and doesn\u0027t even have the tidal stressing of a body like IO does in the real world. I doubt it has any internal heating significant enough to use for heating water.\n\nNow, the way you spoke in the above post about what you read, I\u0027m making the assumption that you\u0027re not terribly familiar with how Geothermal works. If this assumption is incorrect, I apologize.\n\nGeothermal Energy works like any other form of energy such as a coal or oil power plant. The main difference is that the heat source, instead of being man-operated furnace, is the ground itself. Or rather, what\u0027s underground. Usually, the source is geologic such as a near surface magma chamber or spreading plate boundary (See: Iceland). Water may, or may not be readily available in the location where the geothermal \u0027vent\u0027 is located. Though, given the amount of surface coverage water has on earth, it\u0027s usually not too far away. Other planets may make this difficult.\n\nAll the geothermal plant really does is drill a hole into the hot rock and set up pipes. Cold or cool water is then piped down into the rocks and allowed to heat into either steam, or at least superheated water. Said steam forces its way back up another pipe and is directed to steam turbines, which in turn, provide torque to generators. There may be complexities in the system, such as a double-loop steam cycle (where the steam returning to the plant heats a second, closed, pressurized loop that circulates through the turbines... (High pressure steam/water holds more energy per mass unit. But we don\u0027t care about that at this time).\n\nLong and short: As long as you have a supply of water, be it natural or brought with you geothermal could be a dried out, stand alone location. Current methods of course, take full advantage of the plentiful amount of water on Earth. So a lot of water is poured down into the geothermal vents to be lost as steam that doesn\u0027t make it back to the pipe (but rather, vents through the porous rock to the surface, see: Yellow Stone Ntl. Park). But I would imagine that in water-scarce settings, closed loops can and would be established.\n\nAs for cluttering the resource screen. Which one? The pathfinder resource views aren\u0027t exactly covered in walls of resources. Especially when reconfiguring a module limits it to only what that unit is utilizing.\n\nHere is code for the modified hot sping template. Please be careful if you yank it to use it not to copy-pasta directly, as I\u0027ve tweaked the breakdown settings to silly-easy for testing purposes.\n\n    MODULE{    name = WBIGeoThermalPlant    ConverterName = Geothermal Power    StartActionName = Start Geothermal    StopActionName = Stop Geothermal    AutoShutdown = false     GeneratesHeat = false //TODO: figure out how ModuleResourceConverter generates heat    hoursPerCycle = 36 //Six days    minimumSuccess = 2    criticalSuccess = 95    criticalFail = 1 //If the plant suffers a critical failure then it will break down and stop generating power.    criticalFailModifier = 0 //Each time the plant fails is power check, the critical fail goes up by this number.    repairSkill = Engineer    repairResource = RocketParts    repairAmount = 1    showGUI = false    efficiencyType = industry    harvestType = 0    planetEfficiencies = 0,0;1,1;2,0.5;3,0.3;4,0.45;5,.75;6,1;7,1;8,0;9,1;10,.7;11,.4;12,.1;13,.1;14,.25;15,.1;16,.1    INPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = Water        Ratio = 10    }\tINPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = ElectricCharge        Ratio = 5    }    OUTPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = ElectricCharge        Ratio = 175    }\tOUTPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = Steam        Ratio = 10    }}RESOURCE{    name = ElectricCharge    amount = 2000    maxAmount = 2000    isTweakable = false}RESOURCE{    name = RocketParts    amount = 1000    maxAmount = 1000    isTweakable = false}RESOURCE{    name = Water    amount = 100    maxAmount = 100    isTweakable = false}RESOURCE{    name = Steam    amount = 10    maxAmount = 10    isTweakable = false}\n\nIncidentally, you may notice that the system consumes 5 units of electricity. Well, simple: Water pumps don\u0027t run on well-wishes and dreams. And you need to pump water down to the geothermal sources. As I\u0027ve tweaked these, any unit that would handle water would need to have a powered pump. So there will be minor consumption of electricity elsewhere. What this means for gameplay terms is that you can\u0027t just \u0027fire up\u0027 a geothermal without a kickstart of power.\n\nAnd here is what I did in the Sun Burn lab to simulate it being a \u0027cooling tower\u0027.\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\t name = ModuleResourceConverter\t\t ConverterName = Cooling Unit\t\t StartActionName = Start Cooling\t\t StopActionName = Stop Cooling\t\tAutoShutdown = false\t\tGeneratesHeat = false\t\tUseSpecialistBonus = true\t\tSpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2\t\tSpecialistBonusBase = 0.05\t\tSpecialty = Engineer\t\tEfficiencyBonus = 1\t\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = Steam\t\t\tRatio = 10\t\t\tFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW  \t\t }\t\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\t\tRatio = 5\t\t }\t\t OUTPUT_RESOURCE\t\t {\t\t\tResourceName = Water\t\t\tRatio = 10\t\t\tDumpExcess = true\t\t\tFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\t\t }\t}\n\nI essentially made it so that you need to cycle a decent amount of water per-second to get full power. In this case, I forget if the units are holding true to volume, but I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s still in liters. So it\u0027s at least 10 liters a second. Steam, when I defined the resource, I defined it as regular steam for now at regular temperature and pressure. So it has a density around 0.5.\n\n    RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = Steam  density = 0.5  unitCost = 0.0001  flowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = true}\n\nNow, if some way to work it into a high-pressure, closed cycle steam system were used, I\u0027d redefine steam to be higher density. Not that the mechanic of resource conversion being used right now would really notice the difference. However, for useful purposes: [This Page](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/saturated-steam-properties-d_457.html) has information on steam at various pressure levels. 1 Bar is roughly MSL if the boiling point is any indication. (I know STP in Inches. 29.92 being Standard Pressure). If you look at the Specific heat of the water/steam on the right side of the chart, you can see how increasing pressure makes it better and better at being an energy sponge. \n\nGood times.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T02:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AdmiralTigerclaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"CajunInABox","CreatedById":152185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T11:48:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m having some trouble with the Fireworks configuration for the Hacienda.

Next release PATHFINDER nodes will be renamed PATH\\_HABITATION, SCIENCELAB nodes will become PATH\\_SCIENCE, and FACTORY nodes will become PATH\\_INDUSTRY, to make them consistent with the rest of the mod\u0027s descriptions. \n\nI\u0027m still thinking on your ideas for the geothermal plant, and have a way to simplify things. As I understand your concept, you turn water into steam via geothermal energy, and back into water via some cooling. One thing I can do after ditching the need for RocketParts in the converter is make Water a required resource. Stock converters have the ability to specity resources as required; basically, you cannot run the converter without x amount of resources sitting around. By making Water a required resource, I can abstract things a bit and not add a Steam resource into the mix. That way, you don\u0027t need another converter to turn steam into water. This is a good thing; too many converters running at the same time slows the game down. It makes me wonder why Squad didn\u0027t centralize all the converters into one thread and use coprocesses in their converter code...\n\nAlso, the CommunityResourcePack has a resource called ThermalPower. I\u0027m not sure how it\u0027s used in other mods, but a resource distribution map with ThermalPower could suffice and account for 3rd party planets like OPM. Only the Hot Springs would have storage capacity for ThermalPower, I don\u0027t want a bunch of tanks holding the stuff running around, heh. Heck, I could even make ThermalPower another required resource.\n\nSo the geothermal plant could look like this:\n\n    MODULE{    name = WBIBreakableResourceConverter    ConverterName = Geothermal Power    StartActionName = Start Geothermal    StopActionName = Stop Geothermal    AutoShutdown = false     GeneratesHeat = false //TODO: figure out how ModuleResourceConverter generates heat    hoursPerCycle = 36 //Six days    minimumSuccess = 40    criticalSuccess = 95    criticalFail = 20 //If the plant suffers a critical failure then it will break down and stop generating power.    criticalFailModifier = 2 //Each time the plant fails is power check, the critical fail goes up by this number.    repairSkill = Engineer    repairResource = RocketParts    repairAmount = 500    showGUI = false    efficiencyType = industry    harvestType = 0    //You need a minimum amount of ThermalPower to function    REQUIRED_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = ThermalPower        Ratio = 2000    }    //You need a minimum amount of Water to function    REQUIRED_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = Water        Ratio = 5000    }    //A small amount of ThermalPower gets consumed in the process    INPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = ThermalPower        Ratio = .0001    }    //A small amount of Water gets consumed in the process    INPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = Water        Ratio = .0001    }    //This reflects a net result of EC, input EC is already factored in    OUTPUT_RESOURCE    {        ResourceName = ElectricCharge        Ratio = 175    }  }RESOURCE{    name = Water    amount = 0    maxAmount = 6000}RESOURCE{   name = ThermalPower   amount = 0   maxAmount = 3000}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T17:43:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T17:42:14Z","Content":"I believe Thermal Power is used by KSPI and is a product of the various nuclear reactors.
