It has no surface which makes it impossible to hang out there, which makes me really want to do it. I want to build a floating base on or below the surface a la the cloud city in Star Wars. Obviously it has to be much smaller, but several of them connected would be pretty cool. And ultimately I\u0027d like to fly a kethane powered VTOL out there to land on a flight deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a proof of concept that you can hover below the surface. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79228-Extract-Kethane-from-Jool-s-atmosphere\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAnd the original request thread I made\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9ASTB4i.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ASTB4i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went much lower than that as well, and as you can see, it requires very little thrust. Here is an alpha build of a base. I know it\u0027s a big ol ship to get out to Jool but it doesn\u0027t matter where I land so I just have to hit the thing. The atmosphere and some chutes will slow it down.
