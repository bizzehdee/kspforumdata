Or there could be bugs in the implementation; I never could find a -clean- way to access the R\u0026D data while first entering the editor, so already existing parts -may- default to being unlimited if a craft is already in the editor when you enter it (e.g. revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, or start a craft, leave \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and return later).\n\nI\u0027ll see about doing some investigation on it if anyone else can confirm the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T17:50:59Z","Content":"Interesting.

I attach them to radial decouplers and stage them to fire with the first stage liquid engines, but they don\u0027t add any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to the stage, they only subtract their weight.  For instance a 1st stage liquid engines only goes from a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.05 to 0.60 or below once the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are added.  Thanks!\n\u003E \n\nHave a copy of a craft file?  If so, drop it somewhere and I\u0027ll take a look at it and see if I can figure out what\u0027s going on.  I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosted first stages all the time - have one literally flying on the other screen right this very moment - so I know it works."}]}
