I guess all the props from cupola dashboard can be removed with RPM and replaced with one screen and a few indicators. Some props can also be added to each other IVA, just for informational purpose. Look at how it is done in NearFuture habitats.\n\n3. Would also be good to have something like airlock in standard semicircle profile, with hole for kerbal. Like this, but with your profile and no stairs: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92064-0-25-0-Part-Fuselage-with-Deployable-Airstairs-v0-7-2014-11-01](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92064-0-25-0-Part-Fuselage-with-Deployable-Airstairs-v0-7-2014-11-01)\n\n4.
