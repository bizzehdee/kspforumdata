I am pretty sure that the patch is applied to the Oscar-B values for all 3 tanks due to the .cfg for the D \u0026amp; E tanks pulling from the B .cfg. Using the above patch isn\u0027t very desirable anyway as its a bit of a dirty blanket fix for parts that having had been given Interstellar Fuel Switch compatibility. Therefore, for the next release, would the tanks be able to have the Interstellar Fuel Switch plugin added to them so that we can choose what kind of fuel we would like to have in the tanks? Now with the Nuclear rocket-motors running on only Liquid Fuel it would be preferable to do so as to not waste tank space but emptying Oxidiser but instead utilising all the space with Liquid Fuel etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar Fuel Switch - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I found the same thing a while back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Poodmund\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Poodmund\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo get around this I currently have also installed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109885-1-0-2-Munar-Industries-Modular-Fuel-Tank-Expansion-%28BETA%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMI\u0027s Modular Fuel Tank Expansion\u003C/a\u003E but despite being a very good mod in its own right, it bloats the footprint of the parts catalog somewhat.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this was already mentioned, but the KS-25 \u0022Badger\u0022 engine has a heatproduction value twice that of a mainsail - continued usage will lead to it exploding even with four of the smaller radiators attached directly to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Looking at some other configs it does not seem to be the heatproduction value after all.
