I\u0027ve been browsing some threads in the forum about localization but almost (if not, all) of them are from KSP version 1.3. It is now 1.11.1 so I am\u00A0wondering if anything has changed at all in the process. Are the fonts and the way to change them still the same? Do I have to watch out for anything? Are there any new tools I should use? I\u0027ve translated\u00A0roughly 20% of the game and I really want to test it for issues.
