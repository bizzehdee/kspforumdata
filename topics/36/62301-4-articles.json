He is offering a standard set of tools to be use across plugins. It offers a nice set of methods and objects to manage connected areas of living space. He is taking it a step further by persisting needed data to the gamesave, using Module Manager to support other mods and part packs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I see value in what codepoet is doing, as I had considered creating a set of wrapper classes to add functionality to each of the entities he is working with. However, I didn\u0027t want to spend the time. Bravo to codepoet for doing the grunt work to create a standard set of classes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for what I think I might do with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Add a new category of Resource called LivingSpace. In it would be all living spaces as defined by connectedlivingspaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Using the same interface in SM, I would set up transfers between living spaces, IF they were connected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Further, I could add the ability to determine if one part is connected to another internally and enhance the existing Crew Transfer in Realism Mode. If they are not connected, then you are going to have to EVA. I had planned on working out the logic to do this, but codepoet \u0022did it better\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, expect better crew realism modes in Ship Manifest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowyDuck","CreatedById":103441,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T17:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds pretty awesome Papa_Joe.

But the short answer is yes. With the ability to \u0022extend\u0022 a part, vessel, etc, you can add attributes to codepoet\u0027s classes and persist a variety of data using MM. so a sanity Mod would likely look much like TAC Life support or Real Fuels.

It now sinks the OnFlightReady event to rebuild the spaces and that seems to be working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am really grateful to Papa_Joe, both for understanding the spirit of what CLS is trying to do and expressing that on this thread. Just to back up what he has said - CLS is not about providing features, it is about allowing different mods to use the same framework for deciding what is connected and what is not. So far four different modders have got in touch with me to say that they are interested in using CLS from their mods (of which Papa_Joe is one). This is really good because it means that there may soon be several different features that use this concept of conected habitable spaces that will all be compatable. I think that the worst possible outcome would be for there to be four different mods each of them doing thier own work to figure out if the science lab is connected to the hitchhiker pod, based on whether or not kerbal can fit through a shielded docking port, and reach different conclusions about this question. If such mods are encouraged to use CLS then any required config only needs to be provided once, and such incompatabilities will not occur. It is for this reason that I do not intend to add any features such as crew transfer, presurisation, sanity or kerbal relationships to CLS itself, as I do not want to discourage other modders who might want to provide such features in their own mods from using CLS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all of that, I am really excitied about the interest that folks have shown in CLS and the encouagement I have recieved both on this thread, and also from those who have contacted me off the forums. There have also been some really good suggestions, and there is nothing to stop anyone from writing mods to implement those ideas, using CLS as part of their work. Two ideas that I particularly like are the suggestion on this thread for Alt\u002Brightclick crew transfer, and also some of the discussions \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69532\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere \u003C/a\u003Eabout options for sanity, Kerbals interacting socially, and for Kerbals interacting in a \u0022chain of command\u0022 sort of way. I am really tempted to start working on some of those ideas myself, but I want to wait a while to see what others come up with. If I did do any work on those ideas, they would be released as seperate mods, not as part of CLS itself. If you are intested in any of this stuff, then encourage your friendly local modder to write a mod that does it, and tell him or her to use CLS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-16T19:02:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2014 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by codepoet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T22:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA new pre-release (v0.3) that includes the CLSKerbal class is now available to download from the link on the first page of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T22:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SnowyDuck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SnowyDuck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is looking great.

Enablking radial attachments requires a code change (not a complex one, but a change all the same). So should it be allowed? I can see that the only stock part that you would realistically use it for would the be radial adapter thing, but then you could attach other passible / habitable parts to that.\u003Cp\u003EHowever I can see there is an arguement that it is not on to just radiallt attach a big corridor into the side ot a command pod. Folk go to LOADS of effort to carefully design their command pod parts - it just seems rude to cut a great big hole in the side where the mod designer had not intended it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then on the other hand - why not?! I suppose for some parts it makes sense more than others: To radially attach a corridor to half way along a structural fusilage part makes sense, but to dothe same to the side of a Mk1 lander can seems a bit daft. Perhaps is would be possible to prvide config that says that a part will allow an attachment node into a surface attached part to be passable, withthe default setting being to disallow it. That way it can not be abused, but will be allowed in certain circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you all think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP has always had the spirit of allowing people to make their own game. I say give the developers and players the choice (a config option maybe). It goes along the same lines of how you want to play the game.

I do not want to start writting lots of mods that use it as I do not want to discourage the maintainers of existing mods form using CLS. Therefore I have decided to write a mod to uses CLS as a \u0022proof of concept\u0022 providing a feature that no other mods are trying to provide. Taking an idea that was suggested on this thread a while back, that will be to make the kerbals in a Habitable Space occasionally swap seats, or move to empty seats. This would test all the things I am interested in, and provide a little fun too. Once it is working I intend to make a formal release of both mods (CLS and seperately KerbalHotSeats or whatever I call it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping that some time soon there wil be a mod using CLS that allows for kerbal movement between parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T01:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022codepoet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022codepoet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK.

This way you can \u0022close the hatch\u0022 and then you know who is on which side of the hatch before you undock.
