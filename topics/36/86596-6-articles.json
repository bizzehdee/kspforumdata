Such update will include: Custom science module from the anemometer! thermometer \u002B barometer, a camera, clouds now moving with the wind, also with the wind; it\u0027s getting closer to being almost fully automatic! This update should be the last you all have to input the windspeed manually. Kerbals on EVA will now be affected by wind. Windspeed is now in km/h! \u002B more that I forget by now X3.

Surprise everyone! After taking a bit of a break, I got back into my mindset of modding. That\u0027s starting to make good progress, automatic wind is somewhat poopy in that it\u0027s random for now, but that will change when I get grid overlays up and running. Currently I\u0027m working on getting some cells for weather data (which will represent points of lat, long, and alt) which will be used to compare data and get a proper direction for wind, (hopefully) natural weather will occur (such as things like cloud cover, rain storms and such) and it will be on all planets with atmospheres! It\u0027ll be quite the thing to get up and going however, which means that my mod will be incompatible with 0.90 for the time being, unless I pump out a compatibility update, but it will be not much different than before, and have a few half-implemented features, or would you all rather to wait and have me make an update when I have the cells working good enough to have some decent .... going?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenV","CreatedById":10307,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T19:46:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre there any known problems with KWS in 0.90?

I have an updated version of KWS! myself (as i\u0027m the dev) and it runs just the same, it\u0027s just that things are still very much a WIP and unless I see a good chunk of people requesting an update to have compatibility, It might be a while until a compatible 0.90 KWS! comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T20:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey silverfox great to see you back and I hope you do take into consideration my advice to simply get the individual systems up and running if you ever feel a whole integrated weather system is a bit too much to handle.

It\u0027ll be a while before things really get going tbh, but I\u0027m making small steps every time, slowly growing closer to the final result. As much as we all want the entire system up and running NOW, it just won\u0027t be that way. Working on my cells gives me proper structure for weather to happen somewhat naturally, which I will then be able to tell clouds when to form, how fast wind goes, if it\u0027s raining, and plenty of other great stuff. Trust me, it\u0027ll come in due time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand the structure better.
