Few other WIP projects consuming large portions of my time that I want to wrap up or get to the next phase (fixes for TU, finishing KF texture conversions \u002B balance, custom TU patch set for stock), and then would need to take the time to actually develop this new part (or part(s) most likely).  Likely only take ~1 week for this part once it gets to the top of the queue, perhaps a bit more depending on the complexity of the models and if any variants are created.  Texturing should be simple enough / fast enough, and of course we can add recoloring if desired.  Might require some minor additions to the plugin code to facilitate interaction of the heat-shield module with an animation module (e.g. heat shield code only active while deployed), but that should only be a few minor edits."},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-23T22:39:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 40 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll toy around with the concept a bit more in-depth now that I\u0027ve confirmed we\u0027re thinking of the same thing.

And of course you have existing priorities, I\u0027m just happy it\u0027s maybe in the queue somewhere, so no rush.\n\nSeriously, I think I\u0027m losing control of these, the one I\u0027m building now has a crew of 209, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E/LS supplies for almost two years and hab time of almost 1yr/crew. And one gig EC solar without any of the 8 reactors running. I had to design a 7.5m orbital bus that will carry around 50 to make crew transfer even vaguely possible.\n\nAnyway, toward SSTU\u0027s stated primary goal, the heat shield should have a probe core, and doing so makes it literally a one-stop shop for all your heat shield needs, from bringing down giant booster sections safely to protecting all your surface-attached hardware on pod reentries. With, of course, the drawback that with its own probe core, internal mechanism, and bigger size compared to other stack size-specific heat shields, it should be somewhat heavier, deeper, and the petals will take up some surface attach real estate. No such thing as a free lunch.\n\nI\u0027m not suggesting adding parachutes as they\u0027d only be applicable to booster recoveries and there is too wide a range of required parachute power to practically fit them also within the heat shield.\n\nBut you could also move another step towards SSTU\u0027s goal by SSTUifying a couple parachute parts, one stack and one radial mounted. They\u0027d be selectable for drogue/landing, single/triple, canopy size, and number of canopy units, and support a wide range of canopy sizes with the largest being insanely big. You could add diameter increases and other option additions to the tech tree like you do with tanks/probe cores.\n\nThe first three params would affect the mass/size of each parachute unit. The last parameter would instance any number of units, like you do with some of the tanks where you can instance 1/2/3 round tanks. When set to say four parachute units, the multiple instances would look like four separate radial parachutes, but actually be just one part. And I\u0027m sure you\u0027d insist on doing something groovy like having a choice to instance them vertically or horizontally or curved to follow a stack circumference, etc. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nIf you could do that, two parachute parts total would be all anyone ever needed to handle everything from teeny probe recovery to battleship-sized booster recovery."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T01:38:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the heat shield should have a probe core\n\u003E \n\nI can\u0027t agree with the general use-case of that.  90% of the time I want a heat-shield, I already have a probe core.  You could easily patch it in yourself though, if desired, or patch yourself a second version with probe core.\n\nEdit:  It *could* include decouplers for both ends, with optional staging, and optional jettison-able shroud/fairing surrounding the stowed petals.

All of the parachutes are already positioned and scaled by the plugin code, so it really just needs some minor adaptation to include scaling of a base model, and all the fiddly UI bits for scaling and parameter setup, and their backend code.\n\nWhat has stopped me is that it is really only useful in a stack-mount setup for part-count reduction, and I rarely use stack-mounted parachutes.  There is no way to reduce part count for radially attached parachutes =\\  (I guess you could provide larger ones through scaling, reducing duplicate-part-spam a bit for larger designs).\n\nPerhaps something to think on and further develop.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-24T01:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2019 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T03:35:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There is no way to reduce part count for radially attached parachutes =\\ \uFEFF (I guess you could provide larger ones through scaling, reducing duplicate-part-spam a bit for larger designs).\n\u003E \n\nNot understanding this. I\u0027m going to put one radial-mounted parachute, one part. Instead, I place one part but it appears (and functionally there is) four radial parachutes in a vertical line or horizontally or in a square shape. Still one part, but now I get the same visual and functional result as I would have if I\u0027d put four separate parts on.\n\nFor bigger vehicles I frequently find myself doing exactly that, putting on 20 parachutes in five rows of four parachutes. Instead, you could reduce that to four parts total. As I said, last param would be number of (in this case) radial parachute units you want to place, in our example you set it to five, go to the rocket, set radial symmetry to four, place your part and the end result looks like you placed 20 separate parachutes with one click. It would sure reduce the parts count on my rockets, being someone who tries to recover most everything.\n\nAnd usually when I do this, I don\u0027t mind the size of the parachute part, as I move them just under the skin of the vehicle. I say to myself that a booster designed to be recovered wouldn\u0027t have parachutes bolted on all over, they\u0027d be incorporated into the tank top or base, and the important thing is I\u0027m carrying the extra mass. It would be perfect if the tank got a little longer as a result. \n\nWell, that\u0027s something else you could do also. Add parachute recovery capability to the Magic Fuel Tank - have a button for \u0022include 5m/s parachutes\u0022 or something like that, and then calculate the number and size needed based on the player\u0027s volume setting, then increase the mass appropriately and the length somewhat to account for the space needed for the chutes. Include the normal chute settings on the tank\u0027s context menu, and then you have to have the right number and size and type of parachutes to come out of the base of the stack at the right time. If you did that, including an option to have drogue chutes as well as landing chutes would help, plus an option to have the parachutes come out of the top or base of the stack, both can be needed.\n\nWell. except you\u0027d have to make wild guesses as to the stage mass, unless you performed the configuration of the number of chutes needed at runtime after accessing the stage dry mass. But not sure KSP allows modification of basic parameters like that after leaving the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-24T03:39:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2019 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T14:10:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not understanding this.\n\u003E \n\nBest explained through images I think.\n\nWhen you place a part as you suggest, faking cloning of radial parts, you have one real part (in red), and some clones (in blue), around a cylinder (wireframe).  KSP sees these as one part (the white disc) for drag purposes, and has one joint (on the red node).  So far, so good.\n\n![4tWdDBZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/4tWdDBZ.png)\n\nNow, lets add some aero force and see what happens.  Add a few kN of drag to each of the parachutes at their attach position, and the parts will end up looking like this:\n\n![YMcg9pp.png](https://i.imgur.com/YMcg9pp.png)\n\nOkay, so the \u0027fake\u0027 parachutes all get pushed out of position due to KSP\u0027s joint mechanics.  Perhaps not the end of the world for most parts to be offset a little bit? \n\nExcept for KSPs \u0027drag cubes\u0027.  Now the drag-cube system sees an inclined plate intersecting the part, which it dutifully calculates drag for in its inclined angle, and you might as well have put a wing or control surface there for all it cares.  The result is that now you have some odd drag going on throwing your rocket all over the place. \n\nThis happens even during ascent with the parachutes stowed, simply by the nature of the \u0027one attach joint, on the side of the part\u0027 and the \u0027disc\u0027 created by the drag cube system.  Drag pushes on disc, disc rotates around its attach joint (red node), and inclines the other direction; the result is you again have an inclined plane intersecting your rocket, throwing good aero design out the window.\n\nI know.  I\u0027ve done this for parts in the past.

But if you had a model with compartments for each canopy unit, you just make the overall model shape longer/wider by the number of compartments, and you could make the number of canopies it represents easy to see by drawing the compartment hatches on the front or with other markings to divide up the rendered model into units.\n\nSo a stack version would be easy, but you could make it even more useful if, when specifying the number of canopy units, it gave you the option to make the parachute container longer or increase its diameter. Both would be useful.\n\nSo that\u0027s all figured out now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Hopefully they will go on the roadmap somewhere also."},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-25T00:52:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You clicked the \u0027variant\u0027 slider onto \u0027sphere\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fallout of the dynamic model system, and the desire to allow for single-sphere fuel tanks.
