It doesn\\\u0027t work in angles but in Cartesian vectors. Essentially, the thrust is as such: the first point is where the force is applied (ThrustCenter) and the second one (ThrustVector) is the direction where particles would be ejected (as per Newton\\\u0027s third law of motion, all motion generate an equal and opposite force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt requires a bit of trigonometry for anything more fancy (as we\\\u0027re used to polar vectors). You need to find which side is what (it\\\u0027s either X or Z as the convention in KSP is that Y is always up, the other two can easily be found by looking at the model), and adjust accordingly. For an example\\\u0027s sake, let\\\u0027s assume that Z is the axis lined up with the rocket, and that the rocket is on the positive side of the vector. To have a 45 degrees angle outwards and downwards, your X coordinate would be 0 (as you want no sideway thrust), and Y=-Z. The value itself doesn\\\u0027t matter; as long as the two are equal the angle\\\u0027s going to be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarolRawley","CreatedById":4627,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-03T06:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, then.
