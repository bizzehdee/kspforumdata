Like a heat pump. A part may be necessary or when building a ship KSPI could just assume there is a heat pump system built in as part of the finished ship. The vista engine seems to overheat no matter what I do. I put four huge radiators on a small ship and still over heated it despite the radiators not reaching full temperature.
