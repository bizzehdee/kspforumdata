The main restriction for them is that they aren\u0027t a full MonoBehaviour and they\u0027re instead instantiated by BROKE. There\u0027s definitely a way to have both, I haven\u0027t done it before but I\u0027m betting you could write a separate MonoBehaviour and an FM and just have the classes interact with each other. Getting the particular FM instance might be slightly problematic but you could likely write a method that returns the instance.\n\nYeah, I\u0027m pretty sure FMs can do anything they want. For really simple things though, 75% of the work is done by BROKE for you and you don\u0027t need to worry about Unity at all. I imagine most FMs will either be self-contained (not super likely though) or will interact just with the KSP API (very likely). I doubt very many will need to use any further parts of Unity past the basic GUI code (and most of the GUI is handled by BROKE already). There\u0027s a slight chance that way later down the line I might make it so you can write basic FMs just with config files, but it\u0027s not too hard to write one in C# as-is.\n\nEdit: Fixed the bug with the button reproducing like mad in Beta 4.

Either way, I\u0027ve uploaded a new release that fixes a GUI bug and also includes a new FM that is a replacement for RepuationFunding. It\u0027s the one that provides a quarterly budget but has a maximum that it gives out. If your current funds are over the amount given yearly (aka, over the course of 4 quarters) then you won\u0027t get any new funds. Thus you can\u0027t get infinite funds just by timewarping. I haven\u0027t tested it for balance yet, but it\u0027s at a point where I can probably start playing with this now.\n\nI also noticed that the current FMs were set to process quarterly *and* yearly, which meant you\u0027d get twice as much (and owe twice as much) as you should each year, so I disabled their yearly updates. Yearly is just supposed to be used by FMs that *only* do things on a yearly basis rather than quarterly."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxRebo","CreatedById":158856,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T08:45:24Z","Content":"[@magico13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/) The issue doesn\u0027t seem to be resolved (entirely).

Thanks for all the detective work. I have some ideas and I\u0027ll try to take a look at them tonight. At the very least I should be able to take care of the NREs without much trouble. Hopefully that\u0027s all that is causing the excessive new quarters/years (I haven\u0027t seen that myself unfortunately, so fixing it is difficult without reproducing it)\n\u003E \n\nJust a small heads-up, in case you didn\u0027t find the time working on this yet and/or didn\u0027t find out yourself by now:\n\nThe problem only manifests if you use the \u0022Warp to Next Morning\u0022 button. Specifically, the faux quarters/years appear when KSP starts slowing down the time warp from \u003E=1000x. If the next morning is close enough that only 100x warp or less is being applied, then nothing bad happens. Other means of timewarping (KAC, KCT, manual) don\u0027t cause this no matter at what factor they\u0027re being applied.\n\nAvoiding \u0022Warp to Next Morning\u0022 like the plague, Beta 5 works absolutely flawlessly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-14T11:20:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2016 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MaxRebo**"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T02:32:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/14/2016 at 7:17 AM, MaxRebo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a small heads-up, in case you didn\u0027t find the time working on this yet and/or didn\u0027t find out yourself by now:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The problem only manifests if you use the \u0022Warp to Next Morning\u0022 button.

I know it\u0027s intended for the mod to eventually involve costs per active flight based on the type to keep contact/control with them so obvs I don\u0027t want to mess with that.  I\u0027d like to make some of these myself but may need some help/guidance.\n\n**1.  (\u002BKCT):**  Cost for every spacecraft kept in storage (already built and awaiting rollout).  Essentially a maintenance fee.  Not sure if KCT keeps track of the build points of each vessel but if it does I could see it being a cost per BP x the number of days stored.\n\n**2.  Research cost.**  Active mobile research labs cost money to run.  A check to see if a research lab is generating science (if that\u0027s possible) or simply exists and a flat charge for that.  This will help mitigate the OP of mobile research labs.  You won\u0027t technically be \u0022buying\u0022 science since you still have to staff the lab, run experiments, etc.  But it will be painful to just endlessly spam science (since this could suck away $).\n\n             **2b:  Cost for science!**  As sort of the anti-ScienceFunding (an Ippo mod) you may have to pay for every point of science you use to do research.  This represents the payroll for your aerospace engineers.  \n\n**3.  Building maintenance fees:**  Flat cost per level of buildings to represent upkeep.  This could be one of the largest costs that can eat up the budget quick since administration tends to be a very large expense for government/private organizations.  This is a good check on time warping since simply maintaining the KSC will be expensive.  The simplest way to do this would be a % of the original building cost per year (say 3-10% or whatever player wants).  This is the first one I want to do since it \u0022seems\u0022 easy.\n\n**4.  Private Space Corp Stock Market:**  An option to turn a private space corporation into a publicly traded company.  Some kind of RNG determines the state of the stock market and generates or takes income each quarter.  Reputation could modify this so as long as rep is decent it is unlikely to wipe out your budget.  Has potential for big $ but also a chance for big loss.  Essentially you gamble with your budget.  This could be taken further with the option to buy your own \u0022stocks\u0022 to reduce the unpredictability in exchange for losing the chance for big $ (I know this is not how these things work IRL)."},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T23:44:21Z","Content":"Oh, just so you know, using KCT\u0027s \u0022Warp to Complete\u0022 also triggers the \u0022erryday payday\u0022 bug."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxRebo","CreatedById":158856,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T06:57:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 19.6.2016 at 1:44 AM, theonegalen said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, just so you know, using KCT\u0027s \u0022Warp to Complete\u0022 also triggers the \u0022erryday payday\u0022 bug.\n\u003E \n\nStrange, I\u0027ve been trying this many, many times just to be sure it doesn\u0027t before I post, ~~and to date it hasn\u0027t done that even once for me...~~ well what do you know, just now it did.

I actually remembered you posting about running Beta 4 before and thought about that.  I was worried it was going to attack me randomly and was being very careful not to hit the KCT warp to complete buttons.  \n\nAlso:  It\u0027s been a bit quiet around here and now with 1.1.3 dropping all kinds of craziness is bound to come down the pipe.  Buuut I\u0027m not sure how BROKE is going to do active flight costs but I have a suggestion.  Have a separate window/GUI within the BROKE section that lists all active uncrewed flights.  I\u0027ve seen this done in Orbital Decay.  Then have it calc the flight cost per quarter (could be as easy as a base cost with distance from Kerbin factored in).  Then have an estimated cost per quarter and allow the player to dedicate funds to each active flight.  This would allow us to overpay for a flight if desired (but of course no REFUNDS).  If it depletes the amount we dedicated to the flight, it could simply disable it (similar to how Antenna Range does).  Until we fund the flight again (plus penalties!) it would be uncontrollable.\n\nA good example of this process IRL:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cometary_Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cometary_Explorer) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
