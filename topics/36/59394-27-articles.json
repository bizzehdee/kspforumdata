There are two ways a planet is seen. One is the PQS, which is what you crash into, and you also see it at low alititudes. The other is the scaled space, or how it is viewed from space. The PQS is automatically generated with no issues, however, you have to manually force the program into designing hte Scaled spacce ased of your PQS. To do this all you need to do is hit alt-9 go to your planet, hit create scaled space. This will take your computer 1-\u0026gt;5 minutes depending on how complicated your planet is. once that is done you need to go to the file where your planet is defined at 3 more files should be there. One which is the exactly named your planet name and is a bin file. The other should be planetname_map and planetname_normal. All 3 files will have an extra _ at the end. you need to rename each file to remove that _ at the end.
