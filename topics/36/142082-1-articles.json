I\u0027ve tried opening an asset file from both KSP_Data and KSP_x64_Data with no success, just a bunch of ERROR msgs scrolling up the log window until the program becomes non-responsive. Or it comes up with a negative number of assets in the file. I\u0027ve used UAE successfully before for pre-v1 asset tweaking on W7 x64.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
