Testing, packing up and uploading/posting releases is/was eating up far to much of my currently quite limited dev time (and causing un-needed stress and bugs, trying to rush things to get them done in time for a release).  So will be going from weekly to bi-weekly, or perhaps once per month.  Mostly it will be whenever I have a large enough batch of progress done and things are in a good state and I\u0027ve had adequate time for pre-release internal testing.  The exception to this will be for bug-fixing releases to correct game-breaking problems -- will still push those out as soon as they are fixed/available.\n\nThink I finished figuring out a problem with my DDS conversion utility with regards to normal maps.  Was causing some seams to show up where I had mirrored geometry... was quite weird.  Thought it was a problem with the custom shader until it went away when I used the .png image;  then tested vs. the DDS output from other conversion programs and found that they worked okay, so eventually tracked the problem down to my image conversion utility.  Apparently I was missing some filtering that would result in lack of smoothing across the mesh edges.  Sadly sorting all this out took the better portion of this weekends\u0027 dev time.  Not fond of spending my dev time making development tools -- but at least I get working tools in the end (which can/will save considerable time).  For now I have a fully functional, and intelligent, DDS conversion utility -- that will result in a fair bit of saved space compared to the other tools I was using -- this tool respects the alpha channel presence, and will only output DXT5 when an alpha channel is actually there, resulting in 50% smaller file-sizes for those images that lack alpha.\n\nBeginning work on the inflatables modules texture setup, examining how it will all look when texture mapped, and how that will play in with the animations.  So far so good, everything does about what I would expect it to.  A few things that will need to be cleaned up or handled a bit special, but nothing too concerning considering the features that are in play for these models.  Should likely have some updated renders of the nearly-finished parts a bit later in the week.  Seems likely that I\u0027ll use the same texture for all of the inflatables -- so the large inflatables will mostly be re-using the mesh and textures from the smaller ones.\n\nAs soon as I have the basic inflatables finished (models/textures) I will start working on the torus/centrifuge parts.  Might be some pretty big changes coming to those as well -- we\u0027ll see how I feel about them when I get there.\n\nWhen the torus parts are complete that should mark the completion of the initial StationCore offerings.  Always room for expansion in the future, but I will have met the original design goals as far as intended parts and functions.  The one missing bit would be a custom shipyard model... but that is going to wait a bit until I can get a chance to play with MKS and EPL again to see how they all play together now.\n\nHave been working with JoseEduardo a bit on the sidelines to figure out the functions needed for a Modular-Service-Module type part -- most everything needed is available now through the StationCore module, and will probably making some MSM models in the not-too-distant future.  These will likely be the next bits to be worked on after the station stuff is finished (or perhaps take some time to fix/finish the wheels and get the SC-E back in, as well as get KerbalFoundries working again).\n\nOn the KerbalFoundries note -- looks like I may be picking up development of that mod in the near future.  Lo-fi seems to be about done with KSP/Unity, so I\u0027ve offered to pick up development through a fork.  So... yeah... will almost certainly be needing to take time to get that mod back on its feet... which requires taking time to finish up the wheel stuff first.  Pretty sure I have workable solutions to the outstanding problems (aside from critical-damping-induced-harmonic-jitters), just need time to sit down and work on it all."},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T17:00:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly I cannot change the size as it has several design constraints in play.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.)

Separating just the inflatable mesh would be easy.  The new shaders would allow for a clean AO texture to be used, so that isn\u0027t a problem either.  Most of my concern is that I don\u0027t want to double the number of configs I need to maintain for them (initial setup, ongoing balance), nor deal with the increased editor-part-list bloat it would cause (it has already become bad enough with the necessity of different parts for the different sizes and functions of station modules; ideally all of the COS would have been one part, and all of the DOS one additional part).\n\nI suppose if there is enough interest in them (read: at least a couple more people who would want/use them) I can see about doing up the configs/models/etc for them.  Might also see if I can get the core-model switching stuff working (fun trivia -- the ModularStationCore module still supports switching of the \u0027core\u0027 model, but it is unused because the stock ModuleRCS has fits when its transforms are not present, and there was previously (probably still is..) no way to disable the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E module).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-24T22:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2016 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T00:44:25Z","Content":"Seems like an easier \u0022stock-a-like\u0022 version (less replica, more generic) would be to make an inflatable that is the core diameter of the soyuz SM, and about the right inflated dimensions as the image shown.

Yes the 3.75m modules are just rescales of the inflatable portion with new caps on them (otherwise would need a second set of textures, not really worth the time investment or memory use) -- rather than new geometry I\u0027ll be offering several texture variants on these parts to help differentiate them a bit (multiple textures will be available for all, some may come with different defaults).  Haven\u0027t quite settled on what the alternate texture sets will be... but I\u0027ll come up with at least 2-3 options for the initial selection.\n\nI suppose the \u0027good\u0027 thing about the no-cap versions (if I do them) is that I would only need to export 2 models (short, long) and can simply use scaling to get the different sizes (2.5m, 3.75m, and whatever the small size ends up being).\n\nReally don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be doing the 1.25m versions, they would have limited use, and only hold perhaps 2-3 kerbals when inflated.  1.875m might be a better candidate.  Either way they would just use rescaled meshes from the other sizes (though would have no hatch, solar, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, due to no proper scaled end-cap geometry being available).
