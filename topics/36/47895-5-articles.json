Read it in, then place cities based around that. Remember the \u0022light grid\u0022 in the pre-alpha? it was a test for generating high-resolution lights. I flew rather recently, and saw that that is essentially what night time looks like from overhead. rows and columns of light arranged in a grid with some patches missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thought I had was to \u0022chunk\u0022 the high-res map into sections and load them up as individual PQSCity blocks below the lower res mapping. Either way, the PQSCity method is good for high poly mapping with limited rendering distance as I found out when trying to make the global light map with it. I like the first method, as it would also get me to create a good algorithm for city block/road generation that I could re-use when creating cities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T14:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI find the effect much better.
