He\u0027s the sound guru ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). My answer would be yes, though. You could probably base it off the biome maps so that if you\u0027re under 8 kilometers it plays a different sound file for each biome. In that case you could probably easily do other planets too. Sounds doable to me. You might even want to shoot a PM to Ted or another developer on this too. It would be nice to see something like that in stock eventually.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T00:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"PineCone","CreatedById":151931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T21:16:26Z","Content":"Excuse me, Avera9eJoe, but you seem to have a dodo list in place of a todo list."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T22:18:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Excuse me, Avera9eJoe, but you seem to have a dodo list in place of a todo list.\n\nHa!

I haven\u0027t taken the time to learn new EVE and I\u0027m too much of a fan of both KSPRC and SVE to co-compete with Proot and NHawks17. It was fun while it lasted. It warms my heart to see you asking for it to be updated, but other people have done it better and more updated now. Passing on the torch."}]}
