I used an effect whereby the blue sky 2D layer above fades away with increasing distance to the layer. As we\u0027re dealing with such large scale the fade range is far smaller than it would be on stock KSP, as a result various visual artifacts start appearing when trying to compress the fade range (from bright blue at ground level to almost transparent by 20km). In this case it\u0027s obvious circles of darker blue that show as the fade happens. - Increasing the fade range to remove such effects also, unfortunately, increases its brightness higher than would be IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I claimed this effect wasn\u0027t possible in the first place and someone posting about it, got me trying again and ended up with this... so.. yeah I may well/probably will find a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw thanks for giving the 0.25 alpha a test, I\u0027ve pretty much entirely switched over to KSP 0.25 \u0026amp; RSS 8.2.1 due to added features in RSS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So this will be the base for the new main build\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dale Gribble","CreatedById":114698,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T17:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pingopete\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pingopete\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esomeone posting about it, got me trying again and ended up with this... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol, yeah that was me some pages ago \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pingopete\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pingopete\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eso.. yeah I may well/probably will find a solution\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYer a wizard Pingopete \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, awesome stuff as always!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astroju","CreatedById":28575,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T22:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an awkwardpost, but how do I install this?
