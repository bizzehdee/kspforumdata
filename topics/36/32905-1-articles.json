There are some movies and shows that have a great potential for a pack, such the Space 1999 - it could be made into an incredible pack (so many modules and parts). Making these provides alot of enjoyment, but at the same time doesn\u0027t allow you to explore any of your own ideas or creations. Recently I had the fortunate opportunity to join forces with \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000ff;\u0022\u003ESirkut\u003C/span\u003E, who seems to be alot more proficient in the plugin side of things than I am, so this will hopefully make a great combination where we can make unique, original parts and also provide plugin support for them.

Could you make one without the RCS and one with RCS? That should make it easier to work on, as you can work on getting the movement of the wheel done right, before adding the RCS and secondary animation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready there mate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E They are ready to go actually, ill pop then up int he first thread in about oh.. 3-4 hours when I get home form work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made the the non RCS version first, so I actually have one that does not animate and has no RCS, I also have made a few more based on that design, you know the Motorbike that Batman rides? well I sort copied that design a little bit and made something more kerbal, but still pivots on the wheels (on an angle) like the bat bike does. Sorta happened by accident I have to admit, but it was so cool that I decided to make a Tron bike out of it too, im sorta getting addicted to vehicles now, if only I could get my suspension arms working as well as I wanted, but i\u0027ll get there, it\u0027s all learning fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted the kerbal sitting inside the wheel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E but due to limitations with Unity this just is not possible. I made the Wheel centre a command chair, but even then because the chair was inside the wheel collider it proved to be very difficult to even right click on and enter the chair, so I am not sure how I will overcome the problem. I could not have any wheel damage and remove all the colliders, we\u0027ll see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless anyone knows how I can put things inside a convex collider.. back to the drawing board on that one.
