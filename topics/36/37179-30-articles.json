There is Instances data inside the part.cfg files, those contain all the data I enter when placing a part. Additionally the same date is inside the savegame in a file named KTInstances.cfg. When I change data directly in the part.cfg, stuff gets duplicated. I have not yet tried what happens if I delete the KTInstances.cfg or change it to match the part.cfg. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the strong suspicion however that having different data inside the two files is a bad idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking into automatically placing stuff neatly aligned between two positions so I don\u0027t have to line up dozens of street pieces by hand.
