around with Mk2 Expansion lately, and it gave me an idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if we could have\u00A0some Thermal Rockets and Thermal Turbojets in Mk2 form-factor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, the original source of the idea for the Microwave Beamed Power in the mod was probably the plans of the New Space startup Escape Dynamics (which, sadly, eventually went under), which basically seems to have planned on using a lifting-body spaceplane with a form similar to the Mk2 fuselage (with minimal, highly-swept wings), stuffed to the brim with Liquid Hydrogen, in order to provide more absorptive area for the microwave thermal receivers vs. a cylindrical fuselage (the entire bottom of the spaceplane was basically one giant Microwave Thermal Receiver, if I recall...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also provides more Lift, and better aerodynamics, for a lifting-ascent: which they seemed to have opted for as it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) Allowed for the spaceplane to spiral upwards over the Microwave Transmitter site for a while as it gained altitude (to reduce transmission distances), and then set up a run for speed and altitude starting up-range of the transmitters once they got as far as they could in a constant spiral (again, the goal seemed to be to reduce distances so the Thermal Receiver got as much focused power, and time to reach orbit,\u00A0as possible with just one or two beamed power array hround stations...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) A lifting-ascent allowed the spaceplane to reach orbit with less Thrust than a comparable-payload rocket: which was critical as the most expensive component of the entire system was the beamed-power ground station transceiver arrays\u00A0(with costs scaling proportional to how much power they had to aim towards the spacecraft...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this translates fairly well to KSP-I, actually: which is part of the reason I\u00A0discussed it here (all of these ideas work in KSP.\u00A0 Even the increased receiver-area of the lifting-body form factor: if you use a Mk2 Bicoupler to put two 1.25 meter thermal receivers on the bottom of your spaceplane right now...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really would be nice to see some Mk2 form-factor parts in KSP-I (especially the Microwave Beamed Power systems: which are one of the first really powerful KSP-I launch systems you reach in the Community Tech Tree...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven how much there is to add there, especially with more aerodynamic parts and the Microwave Beamed Power system needing a little love, maybe it would be best to split KSP-Interstellar into a bundle of related mods, much like NearFuture does?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould make things more manageable for players: instead of one colossal mod, they could pick-and-choosr different mods in the pack with self-explanatory names: i.e. one for atmospheric parts, including Thermal Turbojets; one for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and resource systems including the Propulsive Fluid Accumulators; one for Microwave Beamed Power; one for the nuclear reactors- which players might want on their own just for electricity generation; one for the plasma thrusters and other related electric propulsion systens; one for the really advanced nuclear propulsion systems; and one for the Warp Drive itself.\u00A0 Of course, all of these are complementary- and it might be best to keep a centralized wiki/documentation (only split into sub-sections for each mod, so players can find what\u00A0they\u0027re looking for).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an idea, anyways.\u00A0 Might

around with Mk2 Expansion lately, and it gave me an idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if we could have\u00A0some Thermal Rockets and Thermal Turbojets in Mk2 form-factor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, the original source of the idea for the Microwave Beamed Power in the mod was probably the plans of the New Space startup Escape Dynamics (which, sadly, eventually went under), which basically seems to have planned on using a lifting-body spaceplane with a form similar to the Mk2 fuselage (with minimal, highly-swept wings), stuffed to the brim with Liquid Hydrogen, in order to provide more absorptive area for the microwave thermal receivers vs. a cylindrical fuselage (the entire bottom of the spaceplane was basically one giant Microwave Thermal Receiver, if I recall...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also provides more Lift, and better aerodynamics, for a lifting-ascent: which they seemed to have opted for as it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) Allowed for the spaceplane to spiral upwards over the Microwave Transmitter site for a while as it gained altitude (to reduce transmission distances), and then set up a run for speed and altitude starting up-range of the transmitters once they got as far as they could in a constant spiral (again, the goal seemed to be to reduce distances so the Thermal Receiver got as much focused power, and time to reach orbit,\u00A0as possible with just one or two beamed power array hround stations...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) A lifting-ascent allowed the spaceplane to reach orbit with less Thrust than a comparable-payload rocket: which was critical as the most expensive component of the entire system was the beamed-power ground station transceiver arrays\u00A0(with costs scaling proportional to how much power they had to aim towards the spacecraft...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this translates fairly well to KSP-I, actually: which is part of the reason I\u00A0discussed it here (all of these ideas work in KSP.\u00A0 Even the increased receiver-area of the lifting-body form factor: if you use a Mk2 Bicoupler to put two 1.25 meter thermal receivers on the bottom of your spaceplane right now...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really would be nice to see some Mk2 form-factor parts in KSP-I (especially the Microwave Beamed Power systems: which are one of the first really powerful KSP-I launch systems you reach in the Community Tech Tree...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven how much there is to add there, especially with more aerodynamic parts and the Microwave Beamed Power system needing a little love, maybe it would be best to split KSP-Interstellar into a bundle of related mods, much like NearFuture does?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould make things more manageable for players: instead of one colossal mod, they could pick-and-choosr different mods in the pack with self-explanatory names: i.e. one for atmospheric parts, including Thermal Turbojets; one for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and resource systems including the Propulsive

reactor: that is just ASKING for trouble and an engine-failure, as well as being far harder to realize in real life than you imagine.\u00A0 Nuclear Thermal Turbo/Ramjets\u00A0work because the air

high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the mass requirements of such heat-pipes would scale very non-linearly with increasing amounts of thermal energy transferred (small pipes transferring small amounts of heat would actually be least efficient, whereas larger pipes would have a better ratio of mass to power transferred: although still very poor, and heavy)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re much better off just using some kind of electric lifting fan (such as the Banshee from either Mk2 Expansion or OPT Spaceplane Parts, I don\u0027t
