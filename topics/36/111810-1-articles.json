So I thought that a 5m tanks, and appropriately scaled SRBs could be a welcome addition for some.\n\n![kcKxCrY.png](http://i.imgur.com/kcKxCrY.png)\n\n**External Tank**\n\n![vq2t1pF.png](http://i.imgur.com/vq2t1pF.png)\n\nThe External tank will be three pieces (Nose Cone, Main Tank, End Cap). The reason for this is to allow the Main Tank to be utilized with other 5m tanks from other mods if desired by the user. I have also considered that as it seems the Jupiter rocket proposals used slightly modified versions of the External Tank this modularity would allow me to more easily incorporate the parts for Jupiter rockets in the future if I so desired.\n\n**Solid Rocket Boosters**\n\n![qrsMlIl.png](http://i.imgur.com/qrsMlIl.png)\n\nRight now the plan is for the boosters to be sized at a rather odd 2.25m. Using the scaling factor from the ET (8.4m down to 5m) the boosters come in at about 2.21m, and I felt that 2.5m might be a bit too big and that 2.25m would be more appropriate. Scaling can be easily fixed if the consensus is that 2.5m would be better. I\u0027m planning for to have the nosecones of the boosters as separate parts with their own solid motors for separation.\n\n**Space Launch System**\n\n![ZsPV0XN.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZsPV0XN.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/3dTab)\n\nThe first definite expansion of my original intention, the Space Launch System in stockalike form with a 5m Core Stage, a 3.125m ICPS and Orion, and a 5m Exploration Upper Stage. The initial full release of the mod will come with the completion of the parts necessary to build a Block 1 SLS. The Exploration Upper Stage, 5m to 3.215m spacecraft adapter, 5m fairing, and advanced SRBs for Block 1A and Block 2 configurations will follow. I am also currently planning to make the F-1B powered liquid fueled boosters that have been proposed.\n\nThose are the plans for now.\n\n**Progress:**\n\n\\* External Tank modeled and textured (in-game)\n\n\\* SRB modeled and textured (in-game)\n\n\\* SSME and Shuttle Engine Mount and OMS engines (in-game)\n\n\\* Preliminary Balancing of Shuttle Stack (Completed)\n\n\\* Modeling SLS (Completed)\n\n\\* SLS Parts In-Game\n\n\\* Initial Balancing of SLS Stack (Completed)\n\n\\* Released\n\n**Release Thread**\n\nLicense:\n\nShadowWorks is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n\n![creativecommons.org.by-nc-sa.4.0.88x31.png](https://d3rhpu6w6k3vrv.cloudfront.net/static/images/legal/creativecommons.org.by-nc-sa.4.0.88x31.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T22:34:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**\n  \nAnnounce Release"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T10:15:39Z","Content":"Good idea!

With no payload in the bay it is just barely possible to reach orbit, but you have to be extremely careful as the orbiter and tank love to tumble after SRB separation. I tried multiple things to find the cause: redesigning the orbiter, disabling all the control surfaces thinking they were somehow causing it, I even discovered that you can use ModuleControlSurface in place of ModuleGimbal (this allows you to control whether the engines will have pitch and/or roll control just like standard control surfaces, and you can control how fast they move as you may have guessed, but they cannot control yaw), but that provided no real benefit.\n\nWhen I placed a 27 t payload in the bay, however, it was easier to control after SRB separation and I was able to get the orbiter into a 278km x 235km orbit with the OMS engines. I was also able to de-orbit with about 500 MonoPropellant remaining to help control the orbiter during the descent. There was a descent amount of fuel remaining in the ET when I jettisoned it (I forget exactly but maybe an eighth of the tank), so there is room for more tweaking, and I am open to suggestions and/or advice.\n\nFor now, I will move on to modeling the SLS, so I hope you enjoy the Dev Release, and if you have any questions or suggestions please let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"Stocchinet","CreatedById":141412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T23:32:29Z","Content":"Very nice work man, jus a little question, are the SSME\u0027s auto-gimbaling?

The core stage is 5m just like the External Tank for obvious reasons. The ICPS main diameter is 3.125m. Using the image I am to model from, 3.125 happened to fit quite nicely. This also solidified the decision to make the Orion 3.125m as opposed to 3.75m.\n\nRenders:\n\nCore Stage, Interstage, ICPS\n\n![UkOD8tD.png](http://i.imgur.com/UkOD8tD.png)\n\nClose-up of the ICPS and Interstage\n\n![re5c68u.png](http://i.imgur.com/re5c68u.png)\n\nIm planning to make the three-part fairing covering the Service Module like engine fairings, if only to simplify the building process for everyone and avoid any hassle with the procedural fairings."}]}
