It will accomplish this by reading the save, finding the error preventing KSP from reading the file, giving an error message and allowing the player to fix it. The secondary goal is for it to also serve as a full save editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I can start, I need to know some basic information about how KSP reads .sfs files.
