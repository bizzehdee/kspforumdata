I love all the details to the model, and the overall look of them... except for that butt-ugly roofing shingle texture. As a general artistic design note, radially symmetric surfaces (like the top and bottom of the mount) should have a radially symmetric texture. Look at the engines, stack couplers, stack bi-/tri-/quad-adapters, and similar parts. You\u0027ll notice that the textures are either radially symmetric, or have design elements that lend a degree of symmetry. Adjusting the textures on your parts would improve the professional polish of these models. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would also be really nice if the distance from the radial mount to the stack mount node was the same between the models.

In my additions to PolecatEZ\u0027s ReStock, I\u0027ve made a crude, multi engine interstage adapter for the Thundermax tanks. What would be very nice is a good looking one that has a fairing. I would make a scaled up Kerbodyne decoupler cfg to go with it. The even larger Thundermaximus fuel tanks could also benefit from a multi engine interstage adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other part is a really tiny decoupler that just surface attaches but nothing can be attached to it. It should have as close to zero mass and drag as possible while not being treated as \u0022massless\u0022 in flight like the little girder \u0022struts\u0022. When activated it should self destruct so it leave no debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite often build rockets with engines I want to go up unlit then activate later, without having some parts drop off.

Auto staging can be set to stop below the level without a decoupler, but that\u0027s not ideal if there are higher stages that need to be auto triggered - such as having part of the ship come off to land on another body then lift back to orbit to deliver a payload then be deorbited with sepratrons. Without an extra decoupler in there, MechJeb will burn the deorbit engines during liftoff of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to have fully automatic staging with Ascent Guidance that will stick to the same order as doing it manually is to add \u0022throwaway\u0022 decouplers solely to put at least one in every level of the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the desire for a lightweight, self destructing \u0022dumbcoupler\u0022 that has the sole function of acting as a marker/trigger for use with MechJeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance.
