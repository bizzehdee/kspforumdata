My concept is to develop this mod in line with the Real Solar System as part of the Realism Overhaul, and utilize the Visual Enhancements mod for atmospheric effects. I will develop it to be fully compatible with the game first and foremost, but also for these mods. Once the Mars Analog Sim ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilization, more on that later) mod is installed, Mars will replace Duna, and the orbits of Mars and both satellites will be accurate. I am interested producing two versions of the mod, high resolution, and low resolution. This will give players the option to go with detail or performance. In the configuration file I want the user to be able to set variables for ground clutter level of detail, including rocks and boulders. The ground clutter will be important, rocks in the game are normally non-collidable, but I need them to have collisions so they make landing in certain areas dangerous and force players to seek safe landing zones. Also for the ISRU part of the mod, they are necessary for other reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModeling the planetary bodies and getting them working in-game will be the first phase of the mod, which could be released fairly soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second phase is to develop parts and functionality to conduct ISRU operations. which allows players to explore Mars in search of natural resources such as water and substances which has be made into fuel, as well as metals such as iron for construction. The premise for this part of the mod is to build on the Tac Life Support mod, which of course requires food, water and oxygen to sustain Kerbal life. I really like this because it adds more realism to the game. Recently I stumbled across a spectrometer map of Mars with overlays showing the concentration of various natural resources. This sparked the idea for this mod. What if I could use those real resource maps, and the player can overlay the resource map over Mars on the Main Map Screen so they can for example, see where high concentrations of water are and send out probes to explore and if they find a resource pile, send our machinery to collect and process it. NASA and other organizations have detailed plans for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=2\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0CCsQFjAB\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marsjournal.org%2Fcontents%2F2006%2F0005%2Ffiles%2FSandersDuke2005.pdf\u0026amp;ei=K8PGU9jJCsS3igLEh4CQDQ\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNHUJc7zh-OS7DTBjZxLrnf1XJZldQ\u0026amp;bvm=bv.71126742,d.cGE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIn Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)\u003C/a\u003E on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about how this would work in the game, and I realized it isn\u0027t very difficult at all. I would add a part called the Laser Spectrometer, which could be added to any vehicle and would scan the ground. If the laser intersects one of the ground objects which IS a resource, it would record the type of resource, location and concentration level on the Main Map. The player can then send out equipment or fly a mission to the site. This will provide a lot of Mars based game-play, and allow the player to establish a colony and to build and launch rockets from Mars. Resources will be extracted to sustain these operations without resupply from Kerbin, and there are a lot of problem solving situations that will provide exciting flight missions and keep your critical thinking caps on. For example, water is the most precious resource of all, but there might not be much water near where there are other valuable resources. So you would either have to locate the colony/HQ in a location central to many resource sites, or else have multiple sites dedicated to different resources, and then transport them to the colony over greater distances. If you don\u0027t play your cards right, and don\u0027t stockpile or plan for the future, you will run out of fuel and life support, and that would suck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to Mars and its moons, I already have all of the models and textures for the moons (found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/mars.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/mars.php\u003C/a\u003E ), but am having difficulty with the textures for Mars itself. The problem is, I have imagery from multiple sensors, the Viking color orthoimagery needs to be co-registered with the Mars Oriter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) elevation map and normal map. I have exhausted manual attempts, and I am now looking into software that performs co-registeration automatically using tracking points to align the images. If anyone has experience in this matter, help would be appreciated. Or else maybe there are all three images somewhere out there already co-registered at this ultra-resolution (at NASA) and I can\u0027t find them. :/ The color and normal maps are 23,040 x 11,520 pixels and the height map is 8194 x 4097 pixels. Yes it is beautiful, I\u0027ll upload some renders and screen shots from Unity 3D in a little while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I have the imagery registered, the project is GO! I already have everything working in Unity 3D and am starting on a detail/poly count optimized planet model with high poly density around terrain features such as valleys and mountains, and low density in flatter areas.

When humans arrive on Mars they will need to build infrastructure and develop the capability to manufacture equipment. Small additive manufacturing units can be sent to Mars to print small parts from in situ resources. Not your typical glue gun printer, this Laser Sintering process builds up layers of a part from fine metal or composite powders and melts them together with a high power laser. High tech processes allow systems such as electronics and sensors to be integrated right into a material, allowing new high tech parts to be manufactured such as engines which cool faster and weigh less. In sum, you will be able to print parts for rockets and assembly that are more advanced than their Kerbin equivalents. Many complex functions and dependencies, described later in detail. Requires powdered resource(s) and electricity. Produces parts below max size, given correct resources, (i.e. small engine requires 30 steel and 50 aluminum) or (solar panels require 50 Silicon and 5 Copper), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EADDITIONAL PARTS INCLUDED FOR MARS EXPLORATION:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWind Turbine.\u003C/strong\u003E (three sizes).

For a ground based tracking unit it no different than a vehicle, the ground is your attachment point, than you have your pan axis rigged to that, and tilt axis rigged to that. It is a three piece assembly, but nothing particularly difficult. That\u0027s at the bottom of my list currently though. I\u0027m still learning the Unity---\u0026gt; KSP end, so there is that learning curve, but once I am off the ground I catch on fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the wind, no I don\u0027t believe there is wind that has any effect in the game. Once there is a part requiring wind, such as a wind turbine, just have an algorithm generate a string of random numbers, and then randomized periods of time with zero wind speed, and a simple algorithm to determine wind direction, put the result through a smoothing filter, wa\u0027 la, fake wind force. I am sure there is a sophisticate way to do it, I am sure you could even make the wind interact aerodynamically with the game, but that is unnecessary for this purpose, nevertheless it would be a great feature but complicated to code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything I have discussed is actually fairly simple to code. Adding new classes of resources, easy. New parts, done. Configuring the parts, painstaking, but not difficult.

All the complicated sounding In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) stuff, is really just simple math and ratios, nothing complicated about it once you figure out a good system for doing so. I haven\u0027t sat down with those numbers yet. Literally everything except the Laser Spectrometer functionality is already built into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne game play angle I am shooting for is you have to set up and fine tune your ISRU infrastructure to produce at capacity, but then it all operates remotely. If you expand you resource demands, you must increase your production by adding more machines or finding new resource sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to work on designing a small proof of concept mod that demonstrates the ISRU in a really simple way, kind of a hack really.

Right now I am stitching together the entire MOLA normal map data set from 512x512 pixel tiles, a total of 2048 of them! Because the data set was not provided with a geospatial reference system, there literally is no way to automatically do it. In each column there are 32 tiles, and there are 64 columns, so the final image will be 17920 x 32768 pixels. It is worth the effort, maybe ten or so hours of work, but the result is simply spectacular! Instead of using a high poly terrain mesh, I can use a sparse distributed one, and normal map in all the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still working my way into the KSP game structure, so I don\u0027t yet understand if it is even possible to use these massive texture files.

The color orthoimagery I am processing with a co-registeration program, is the same size. How is the game going to handle that? Unity can handle it, but can KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUriah\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uriah","CreatedById":115086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T08:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Mars goes well, ALL the others shouldn\u0027t be a problem.

The Real Solar System mod got everything right, but the terrain and texture maps need much higher because the resolution is degraded by the increase in scale. If it is possible with Mars than I\u0027ll start digging for a detailed world texture in the same resolution range. One factor I was considering is that if Earth is respectively twice the diameter of Mars, the same sized texture on both planets would have different levels of detail. If I want to keep it consistent on each planet, I can scale down the size of textures on the small planets, but still, it would be nice to scale it up on the bigger planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would basically like to merge the planetary work with the Real Solar System mod, because it already has nearly everything else completed.
