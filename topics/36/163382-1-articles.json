Now, my team of modders will begin working on a new planetary system that will completely replace the stock KSP system with a variety of worlds. I have just begun work on the mod, and have no pics to share at the current time. Please leave any comments if you have any suggestions; we will gladly listen to your ideas, and they may even be implemented into the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 - UranianBLue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-18T01:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Add-on Development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
