else,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea, surprise, it\u0027s really me. \u00A0Ben, I sent you a PM months ago after you told me the thumb drive didn\u0027t arrive. Since I didn\u0027t hear back from that PM I can only assume that either I goofed it up or, it got lost somewhere along the way (like the thumb drive). \u00A0For a while, I couldn\u0027t log into the forums, my password didn\u0027t work and then... real life intervened. \u00A0On top of that, my ISP decided to upgrade their hardware. \u00A0You\u0027d think they\u0027d be nice and move all my files to the new server. \u00A0Ummm no. \u00A037 gigs of data and I live in the middle of a corn field. \u00A0Every screenshot I ever took of the game and linked to the forums was on that server. \u00A0Since\u00A0It takes me an hour and a half just to upload 500k I never got the time to move all my files. \u00A0And my ISP has a 50 gig a month bandwidth limit. \u00A0Once I didn\u0027t hear back from you, those things and\u00A0lots of others took priority. I pretty much decided that Maritime Pack was a closed issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut,\u00A0I haven\u0027t had a chance to stop thinking about this accursed mod. \u00A0It\u0027s been 10?\u00A0months since I stopped working on it and people WILL NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. \u00A0I wasn\u0027t able to take the mod off Curse so it\u0027s been up there in a half-working state and it\u0027s still getting 500 downloads a month. \u00A0Yes, it\u0027s still in the top KSP mod list (boggle). \u00A0And every time someone downloads it, finds out it doesn\u0027t work, and is persistent, they go hunt me down and send me blasphemous e-mails and the occasional death threat. \u00A0What I get for not being hard to find. \u00A0But I got some nasties here on the forums so that\u0027s nothing new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with people refusing to let this\u00A0mod die, and me not hearing back from you, a couple of weeks ago I fired up KSP for the first time in yea... 10 months... and the Maritime Pack was of course staring me in the face. So,\u00A0for the past couple weeks\u00A0I\u0027ve been... tinkering with it and\u00A0cleaning it up for 1.1 with the expectation of re-releasing it. \u00A0And then... just moments ago I found this tread while trying to dig up some old code chunks I posted on the forums way back when.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, now I\u0027m in a bit of a pickle it would seem. \u00A0You\u0027ve been carrying the torch for the past 8 or so months and I first need to say thank you. \u00A0But it appears, you\u0027ve got several guys here working on it,\u00A0\u00A0you\u0027ve been trying to dig up the old files for the sub pack it would seem, trying to resurrect this beast. \u00A0And then suddenly, I come out of the woodwork like a louse with the entire package pretty much ready to upload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s the big question. \u00A0I know you have other mods you\u0027re working on Ben and that taking over MP was something you did for the community (and me). \u00A0How utterly [p.o.ed at me would you be if I stepped back into the ring?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd before you answer, yea, I\u0027m serious.

Maritime hit pay dirt and I was still trying to keep up with all the other things I was doing in KSP. \u00A0The other problem was, I was running on a 10 year old 3ghz AMD with 8 gigs of ram, a 32 bit OS and a 1024x768 monitor and trying to do 3d modelling and run KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinances improved slightly since then. Now I\u0022m on a 64bit OS, 32 gigs of ram, 8 core 4ghz, dual 22 inch wide screens and an SSD... so now, computer wise, I\u0027m much, much better off that I was back then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo answer your question though... for now, no. \u00A0MP got royally screwed with that update, which I\u0027ll save for a later post, and it\u0027s taken a lot of tinkering to get everything working again and working as intended. \u00A0Some parts, like the dinghy, were just unsalvageable (it sinks like a rock even after I completely reworked the model) and will get dropped from the next pack. \u00A0So that means, I haven\u0027t had time to create anything new. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I did sit down and create a video tutorial (yea, with me speaking) on how to correctly build a catamaran. \u00A0The catamaran allowed me to create ships twice the size of the Clipper with only 3 parts. \u00A0The plan once upon a time was to create a CVL (light vs the current escort) using that same theory. \u00A04 parts and I can create a deck, bow, stern and bridge. \u00A0No, don\u0027t expect arresting gear or elevators and don\u0027t expect the CVL to be the next priority. \u00A0Getting the sub pack tweaked and ready is next order of business. \u00A0But, if you watched the video above you\u0027ll see me... erm... try to land on a CVE wishing for something bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut before I do anything else...

If a 500 ton ship won\u0027t sink in Kerbin\u0027s water, I had to cheat physics.)\u00A0Any STOCK part added to the sub creates a spot of massive buoyancy. \u00A0While the sub can handle a few small stock parts on it, when you get to building entire missiles, the sub simply won\u0027t sink. \u00A0As I understand it, cargo bays have the ability to place an invisible box around the cargo inside them so the drag isn\u0027t calculated into the craft\u0027s drag. \u00A0The only solution I see (as long as the sub uses Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy) is to do something similar. \u00A0Create an invisible box on a part and anything inside that box is somehow excluded from creating buoyancy. \u00A0The other idea I had there was to make the tubes a partmodule and then, check for all parts attached to x node and kill the buoyancy of all those parts.\u00A0\u00A0I THINK it can be done I just never got around to investigating it further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the BIG plans I had was sailing. \u00A0Real sailing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kyA0P/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s something I created from the Steampunk mod. \u00A0It works but the modder\u00A0cheated. \u00A0The sails are solar panels. \u00A0Instead of generating electricity when the sun hits them, they produce thrust. \u00A0That and they don\u0027t turn. \u00A0So, you always have to sail with the sun at your back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I was working on was creating changing global wind patterns and sails that you had to manage based on prevailing wind conditions. \u00A0I was in the code testing phase of that with a few simple models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I have models I worked on for plane floats with retractable landing gear (one of the last things I was working on.

What it will have is a global \u0027database\u0027 of various longitudes and latitudes. \u00A0In that will be basic wind directions and speeds. \u00A0In one spot, the wind may blow from the north. \u00A0In another, from the west. \u00A0Depending on your current location, that database is consulted and wind conditions at the vessel\u0027s location will be calculated. \u00A0The database will be randomized a bit so that every install will have unique wind\u00A0patterns. And, those wind conditions will change over time. \u00A0One day, you may find you\u0027re in the doldrums an the next day, a full gale. \u00A0That\u0027s the theory anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for hooligans, yep, I looked at their mod a long time ago and it was horribly busted.

You have so many \u0027Center\u0027s\u0027 of things and none of them are easily calculated. \u00A0Center of mass, center of lift, center of buoyancy and those are just the basics (there\u0027s lots more). \u00A0Finding center of mass is easy. \u00A0Finding the center of buoyancy? \u00A0Still beyond me. \u00A0Basically, with the sub, it\u0027s like a giant lever. \u00A0Somewhere in the middle is the fulcrum. \u00A0At each end I have ballast. \u00A0Sounds easy right? \u00A0Well, the fulcrum changes as you move the ballast around and be damned if I can figure out where it is. \u00A0It\u0027s not Center of Mass. \u00A0So, I have to keep tossing ballast back and forth and checking the altitude of the parts on each end and the dive angle to see if it\u0027s close to level. \u00A0Essentially I\u0027m moving rocks back and forth on the lever hoping to guess the balance. \u00A0It\u0027s painfully slow as it doesn\u0027t stop till it gets close and thanks to the viscosity of Kerbin water, it\u0027s even slower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ve went ahead and uploaded the 1.1 working version to Curse (I won\u0027t fall into that kerbalstuff trap again) and I\u0027ve started a new release thread. \u00A0I also got Red Iron Crown to point the old thread (which was locked) to the new one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find it here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142142-the-maritime-pack-v015-submarines/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve looked over some of the changes Ben has made and some I fully agree with, and some I\u0027m not so sure about. \u00A0So, I went ahead and put the current pack out so people have something that at least works until Ben and I can sit down and discuss what changes need to be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-20T22:36:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2016 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T22:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill be a long time before I continue developing Real Ships and WW2 Warships.

I\u0027m till torqued at him. \u00A0One of the issues I had when I started MP was that EVERYONE wanted me to make MP compatible with his better buoyancy. \u00A0When I ran into problems, I contacted him. \u00A0The response I got was basically, if it\u0027s not working now, I\u0027m not going to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s my theory. \u00A0Ferram created \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0because he couldn\u0027t fly in stock physics. \u00A0Then, he couldn\u0027t fly in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and kept crashing into the ocean. \u00A0Rather than learn how to fly, he creates an entire mod so that he can ditch his planes in the water without smashing them to bits. \u00A0Now whether this... modification is suitable for boats are not is inconsequential. \u00A0He can\u0027t fly in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E so he changes the physics of water and that\u0027s that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll pardon me, but when you create a mod like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aeronautics Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s so popular that you can change the REST of the laws of physics and either everyone bends to your will or they can get screwed...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ll put it this way. \u00A0When you look at the imgur album I posted earlier, look at the CVE and the sub-title I gave it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat explains why I built it. \u00A0So he\u0027d have a FREAKING PLACE TO LAND OTHER THAN WATER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea, I\u0027m still torqued over that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-21T06:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2016 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
