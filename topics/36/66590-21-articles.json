Started off when the guy who authored our animation plugin in US1 eventually ran out of time for modding and gave up, and I realized Paul and I were in a bit of trouble if it ever broke between KSP versions. So we decided to switch to firespitter, and discovering what it could do, planned to set up the wedges to have multiple appearances you can tweak in the VAB (with the fuel\\meshswitcher thing). This was a massive job, because every wedge had to be made with new meshes and textures, which also meant breaking the current models and re-animating them. And then re-exporting everything again through unity... enlarging the texture maps... bloating the mod... blah :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and it would be incredibly tedious for the end user too. Right clicking every wedge just to switch colors would mean you\u0027d be there screwing around in the VAB all day, and accidentally pulling wedges off trying to tweak them. And if you did that, and the attachment nodes disappeared (a stock bug), you\u0027d have to delete what you\u0027d done, remake your stack, and be back to square one.

Remove the exterior structures from the wedges and outsource them to a new part - a shroud\\cargo bay\\fairing cover. Doing this means there is a single part to customize, and by enclosing things in an aerodynamic cylinder, we finally have something that is compatible with FAR. Squad then rolled in their own heating\\aero model as stock, and I had to follow through just to keep the mod usable.

If you like your exposed structureless wedges, just don\u0027t use the part. No need to toggle anything in the VAB, and we save a ton of memory and GPU processing by trimming the wedges down to have no individual animations, and 3\\4 less of a texture map (what was used for each wedges unique structure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eBvHpm6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eBvHpm6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this means losing the unique decals each wedge had for its inner door though - we can no longer customize the structure on a per-wedge basis.
