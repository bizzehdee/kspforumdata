This way I can sort of work on new stuff in a more compact one off way. My first little pack is funny enough, a true 1.25m Gemini analogue. This won\u0027t be a replacement for the radish from HGR, but will give people an alternative if they don\u0027t want to invest in a whole new part size. This has been nice, for my comeback to modding as well, since it isn\u0027t huge and overwhelming. It\u0027s also given me a chance to get the style down that I want to move towards with HGR. The plan is to fall somewhere between stock and other popular mods, so that my parts will go well with pretty much anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is still pretty WIP especially with texturing, but it\u0027s starting to come together and I thought I\u0027d show it off a bit to see what people would say.

I actually think it\u0027s more like 1.25 judging roughly by the mu files I imported. IIRC earlier stock parts were scaled up in the cfg, but it looks like they fixed the mesh itself now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts in this thread have a different shape so maybe there\u0027s more room. Really I should have just asked OP from the beginning what rescaleFactor they\u0027re using for the part exterior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to the small stock black pod IVA though, if it were to scale, there\u0027s barely enough room to fit two kerbals, like pilchards in a can, and no room left for the seat and leg rests, etc. And that\u0027s not even taking into account the thickness of walls. I checked using that model I linked to earlier, without the helmet, legs folded to the right angle and a conservatively small head that I added myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust be aware of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the name maybe \u0022Minigemini\u0022 or \u0022Geminimini\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T18:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
