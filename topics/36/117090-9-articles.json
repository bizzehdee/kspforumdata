I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m more excited about. Core stages, or the IVA!

Likely won\u0027t get too much done texture wise this week (other than the unwrap, AO bake, and shadow/light bakes).\n\nPlayed around with them for a bit last night (the IVAs, at least the LC3-IVA). They are fairly usable in the stock configuration -- the landing view \u0027from the seat\u0027 isn\u0027t the greatest, but you can double-click on the window to view from a \u0027nose-to-the-glass\u0027 perspective, with included landing instrument cluster (speed, alt, navball). All the rest of the stock info-props are available and visible. It is about as usable as most other stock IVAs.\n\nHowever the RPM-enabled IVA is -very- usable (perhaps even enjoyable?), even for an info-nut like myself; having all of the orbital stats available is great. It becomes a bit more of an \u0027instruments only\u0027 affair, but given the functional usefulness of the MFDs, it works out quite well. I also have included a non-cheaty external camera in the pod for use as a \u0027landing camera\u0027 (e.g. it stays close to the view that would be afforded by humans looking out the windows or by a simple hull-mounted external camera). Works quite well for LC3 setups, and acceptably when the LC3 pod is used on LC5 tanks. Between the camera and the rest of the instruments, you have more than enough info for basic landing or rendezvous operations. Even the scientist station is fully equipped, functional, and usable for landing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd what I\u0027ve done so far is only scratching the surface of RPM use. I really don\u0027t have time (or want/need) to dig in too much deeper for the advanced functions (e.g. custom screen setups, more functional/clickable props, animated props) - but they do exist if someone else had the inclination to do an overhaul / update. Unity is free to download and setup, as are KSP PartTools. Those are -all- the tools that are needed to do prop-setups in IVAs, so I certainly don\u0027t need to be the only one working on them (especially seeing as how I\u0027m not even really interested in them). Yes, I will be including -basic- RPM-IVA support out of the box. But if you want more than the basic experience -do it yourself (or find someone else to do it for you, but it wont be me!)-; there is no excuse other than laziness; Unity/PartTools are not that hard to figure out, and you do not need the development assets to design an IVA (everything you need for IVA work is in the KSP GameData folder).\n\nEdit:\n\nOn the note of included external cameras -- how many / where should they be positioned? I\u0027m currently only placing a single one near the main windows of the pods, facing mostly downwards (about 30\u0027 forward from a straight downward view, the straight-down angle is still in the view). A second one is automatically included in the docking port, so there is no need for a docking-port specific camera. And of course you can always install/create a mod that adds the simple radially-attachable external camera parts.\n\nAt this point I don\u0027t really see any other camera points being -needed- in the base setup. However, if someone has any good ideas, suggestions, etc, please let me know ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T16:25:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T21:04:57Z","Content":"Updated test release is available:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.11-beta](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.11-beta)\n\nFairly big change-log.

Many things have been changed from the reference designs; because I didn\u0027t like them, couldn\u0027t make them work in KSP, or couldn\u0027t figure out how to model them appropriately.\n\nB.) Finding accurate, detailed, and consistent information (i.e. schematics, high quality diagrams) regarding many of the parts is... difficult. Various diagrams will give you different sizes/ratios/angles for the parts. Many have not been finalized or built and for the most part the available information and designs are speculation.\n\nC.) The performance of the parts in game is going to be neither real-world, nor scaled-real world. So, while you should be able to re-enact the scheduled SLS missions with these parts, that is not their intention.\n\nWith that said, yes, it is heavily inspired by and based on SLS / Orion. I liked the look of the stuff, needed a heavy command pod (and utilities), and it happened to be about the right size when scaled and gave me enough details to get started. Mostly I just don\u0027t feel like arguing with people when they say \u0027but.. SLS/Orion did \\_\\_\\_\\_ like \\_\\_\\_\\_\u0027 (colors, geometry, whatever); as I\u0027m not claiming any of this stuff to be recreations, there is no room for argument. I have no problem with feedback/info regarding making it look more consistent/similar, there are just some things that I cannot/will not change or re-implement for various reasons.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re talking about the Orion MPCV SM and whatnot, I thought it would be funny to call it Scorpio, as Scorpio is a constellation for killing the hunter Orion. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E Speaking of which, I should probably integrate the descriptions and such... That\u0027s my only real job here but I\u0027m just so... *lazy*...\n\nStill contemplating the naming; especially regarding the above info ^^. Would be nice to be able to give it a distinct name. Scorpio might just stick... we\u0027ll see.\n\nPlease let me know if you do any description updates so that I can copy them over for the next release, would be nice to have some more atmosphere on some of the parts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAfter a bit of feedback, I\u0027ve done a few quick revisions to a few of the SC-B lifter parts:\n\nAdded a 5m fuel section; this allows you to build the full 35m-fuel tank 64% scaled SLS-equivalent\n\nIncreased height of segments in SRBs to rescale the 5-segment booster back up to the 64% scale value\n\nAdded a 4 segment SRB\n\nAdjusted nose-cone geometry of the straight nose-cone to more closely match those from the shuttle SRBs; still WIP\n\n![Lv5jl36.png](http://i.imgur.com/Lv5jl36.png)\n\nWill probably be increasing the thrust of the 4-engine cluster slightly, and the 5 engine cluster substantially (we\u0027ll say they got uprated for 110 and 120%...).\n\nWill be changing the thrust and fuel quantity in the SRBs to match their new size.\n\nThe 5m fuel segment will probably just end up holding more fuel than it visibly should, as I want to keep the same end-cap for all fuel tanks (for texture-sharing/reduction purposes). Might just squish the cap up a bit on all the tanks though; still thinking on it, will probably do up some previews to see how it looks. Probably not the most important detail as the ends are often covered by payload/engines/other tanks...but still the kind of stuff I worry about =\\\n\nOn the SRBs... doughnut-skirt, or no?

However if someone has a specific suggestion, please let me know. I have no problem with giving it a name if something awesome comes up. As to the current suggestions -- a Scorpio, to me, is a piece of siege equipment (a small-ish, higher-tech type of ballista). And Triton, in my mind at least, has generally been associated with water (idk, I guess it almost fits if you equate sea-faring to star-faring/space-faring). If I were to pick something, it would probably be more from the Norse pantheon, rather than the Greek or Roman. Honestly though, I\u0027ve tossed around a ton of different possible names internally, and nothing seems to really \u0027stick\u0027. Would be good to have an official name for it aside from the model/series descriptor.\n\n**Piping** -- Hmm.. it already is rotated 90\u0027 from where the boosters should go (the setup in the VAB should mimic the renders above). Perhaps you had your boosters on the wrong side(s)? -- Anyway, I\u0027m considering putting it at a 45\u0027 offset, so that it will still be visible when using 4 boosters. May also make a second set of piping (will help hide the seams in the textures, and give me a good split for using mirror symmetry/repeated textures).\n\n**End Caps** -- Maybe. Would likely have to be separate pieces though, as I\u0027m already considering using mesh-switching on the tanks themselves to set the tank height (e.g. only a single 5m tank in the editor, right-click to get taller/shorter tank options).\n\n**Engine Mass** -- I believe I had them balanced, mass wise, exactly as the stock \u0027Mammoth\u0027 engine (or was based on, likely tweaked a bit). If anything they should have slightly -lower- mass (and thus better TWR); if engines didn\u0027t increase in actual efficiency as you went up the tech-tree, why even have a tech-tree? (unless I forgot to put the stats in the config files; should be that the 3x engine cluster weighs 20t). Hmm... looking at the configs, I must have missed a few values. Yes, they are supposed to be fairly heavy (20/30/40t for the 3-4-5 engine clusters). Probably still a bit more tweaking to be done as I finalize the capabilities of the system.\n\n**Engine Balance** -- Yes, the 3x engine cluster is intended to be used for a \u0027light\u0027 first stage, or custom heavy upper stage. As such it has -slightly- higher ISP than the dedicated lifter engines, but also will have lower thrust-per-nozzle than the others. There -should- already be a bottom node on the engine (and an auto-fairing); if not, there -will- be. Am also investigating the balance/need of a 5m 2x nozzle engine cluster for dedicated upper stage use.\n\n**Booster Orientation** -- Thx, will look into it (rather, will keep it in mind when exporting the nose-cone parts for mesh-switching), likely just exported it in the wrong orientation.\n\n**SC-B-CM Ablator** -- Huh. Strange. Right now it is using a custom ablator module with mesh-specific darkening capabilities. With no (or an incorrect) mesh specified in the config. So, technically, -nothing- should be getting darkened. If it -is- getting darkened or changed, please let me know and I\u0027ll fix it (or at least look into it) (I didn\u0027t notice in my play sessions over the weekend, but for some reason my re-entries are always at night). (this should be easy to test by removing all ablator from the CM in the VAB and launching it; as the shading is based on current/max value of ablator rather than any actual heating receieved, if it -is- blackening things, it should be fully-black with all ablator removed.) Anyway, it is -supposed- to just blacken the heat-shield mesh; however as the heat-shield is already black, I had decided to disable the shading/darkening entirely for that part.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the feedback / ideas / info ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Will def. be using some of those reference images when doing the fuel-tank parts. Might end up doing a lot of it in normal maps, but should be able to come up with something decent looking for the tanks.\n\nRight now I\u0027m working on writing up the AttachNode mangling code for the MeshSwitch module -- this will allow the mesh-switch module to move/delete/replace attach nodes as the different variants are selected. This function will be needed for the SRBs (for the nose-cone; as if I leave the attach node in place, it will create extra drag) and also for the upcoming reworking of the fuel tanks into a variant part. Hope to have this cleaned up/finished up later this evening for some initial testing; will hopefully allow me to finalize the geometry of the lifter parts this week and get them ready for texturing (and real testing, balancing, etc). Will also be investigating adding a texture-switching capability to the mesh-switch module for alternate texture use for some parts (though this will likely come later; would need some alternate textures to use before I can use the module....)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T12:48:42Z","Content":"PS: Apparently this new fix fixed the SP problem for me. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T14:39:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E PS: Apparently this new fix fixed the SP problem for me. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThat is strange, as I know I didn\u0027t change any solar-panel code, and don\u0027t think I changed much/anything else on the CM.

Still have a bit of work to do regarding repositioning parts when parts are attached to the moving nodes, but should be able to get that wrapped up tonight.\n\nAlso found and fixed a few other bugs along the way regarding mass calculation with the ResourceSwitch module -- apparently it was never recalculating the tank dry mass properly, and just going with whatever the first value was; this was likely resulting in reduced performance from any of the affected parts (LC-Fuel tanks, hollow variants).\n\nNow I just need to get the texturing and model stuff figured out for these tanks; going to be interesting trying to get a decent looking texture on such a large part."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T16:38:17Z","Content":"Well, if it does re-emerge, then resort to the good old RTG and Offset. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T18:57:20Z","Content":"Here is a -very rough- first pass at texture layout on the various tanks. Yes, I will be going with a very simple texture/paint scheme; pretty much the same one seen in all of the PR renders. Yes they have seams in the renders, as I have not yet finished the textures or even UV mapping -- there will be no visible seams in the final product (or not very noticeable at least).\n\n![6wquQeq.png](http://i.imgur.com/6wquQeq.png)\n\nLooks like I will need a total of two 1024x textures to do the entire set of tanks (for a very low 64px/m scale); one for the lower portion textures, and another for the upper, interstage, and end-caps. This gives them about half of the texture scale that I would consider \u0027minimum\u0027, and about 1/4 of what I would prefer (128px/m looks decent; 256px/m can start looking \u0027good\u0027). Sadly, I don\u0027t think anyone wants 2x4096 textures just for the 5m tanks (nor do I really want to make them...). Ohwell, perhaps I\u0027ll consider doing a high-res texture set when KSP 1.1 is out (assuming they do a 64-bit build; though that still doesn\u0027t help with a VRAM limit).\n\nI had received some suggestions regarding creating a base-orange texture as well; I -might- consider this after I get the initial set of parts created and the initial texture -finished-. Even then I would have to do some pretty major editing to the Mesh/Resource switch plugins to support allowing a second set of textures. So, consider a set of orange-tank textures to be a \u0027maybe, in the future\u0027."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T21:41:27Z","Content":"I want them now! \n\nPS: I got one nitpick/question the SLS Block IB has just the EUS, not the ICPS and EUS combined.

Will not be finished, but should be far enough along to test things / get feedback, before it gets too far along to actual change stuff.\n\nI\u0027m not quite sure what you are referring to? The SC-B-SM has adjustable size for its lower fairing, so it can be made to \u0027fit\u0027 on 5m stacks. The decoupler I made is fully procedural (LC-DC is the part name, in structural tab), and can be made to nearly any diameter/height/thickness. It should be/is possible to use just the HUS with the CSM.\n\nAnyhow, finished the unwrap and -very basic- (diffuse is stripes\u002BAO only, nrm is intertank only, no specular yet) textures for the fuel segments. Uses a total of 2x 1024x textures; The first texture is the lower segment(s) and intertank area, the second texture is the upper segment, piping, and end-caps. Will also be creating a couple of \u0027nose cones\u0027 for the 5m tanks in the vein of the Shuttle ET, these parts will also use the 2nd texture (saved just enough room I think).\n\n![5eDwa0j.png](http://i.imgur.com/5eDwa0j.png)\n\nAny thoughts as to if I should offer alternative fuel-variants for these parts? Any interest in a 5m LF only tank, or 5m LqdHydrogen tank? As I\u0027m already using mesh-switch/fuel-switch for the adjustable height, they would have to be placed as separate parts in the editor (for now at least; investigating using a more complex plugin custom tailored to semi-procedural fuel tanks, would include multiple fuel options per-tank-height, but this would be quite a ways off). -- Just had a need for some \u0027adjustable\u0027 LF and LH2 fuel tanks in my career game last night, and I think something like this would have made my ship designs much easier (and lower part count)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T19:12:54Z","Content":"Alright good to hear, also, you know I was just kidding don\u0027t you?
