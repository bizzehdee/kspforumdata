Asimov was then to return to Kerbin to refuel and rotate crew. Second mission was to capture and bring into Kerbin orbit a small class A asteriod.

I\u0027m not ultra fond of the base that holds everything together, but I\u0027ve already spent way too much time on that part and I need to work on other things if I want to have the update ready for 1.1. I worked yesterday on a new engine concept which I think is better than the old one. And with the way I\u0027m designing it, it\u0027ll have 1.25 and 2.5 versions for different types of payloads. After this is done, I\u0027ll move to the old parts as they are in a much needed refresh. The Command Pod requires new hatch and ladder detectors and I want to adjust some things in the texture as well. The living module needs new hatch detectors as well, and I\u0027m planning on substituting one of the windows for an actual hatch so that it makes more sense.

For now, I\u0027ll supply the two engines, and an adapter plate from 2.5 to 1.25 so that you can choose which variant to use. The single engine should provide you with more delta-v at the expense of longer burn times. What I\u0027m toying with is the idea of supplying a 2.5m two engine plate as a nice in between. The next engines I have in mind are a NERVA engine and a small engine similar to the Space X Draco engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T23:40:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by v1per\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"v1per","CreatedById":115406,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T03:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guys, I\u0027m still doing work.

I think the adapter plate looks good but cant really judge without normal and color map.

I wanted to give some sort of update on this project. I\u0027ve had a pretty difficult time the past few months both with health and financial issues so unfortunately this was left on the back burner. To top it all off, when I finally started working on it again, my PC died and my notebook is rubbish to work with textures. I have new parts coming in hopefully before the end of the week. In the meantime, here\u0027s what I\u0027m working on:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNew textures for all parts - I got a few new tools a few months ago and decided to test them with my parts. i think it\u0027s going to be a big improvement, and it also really speeds up the work flow for future parts. I\u0027ll post more details about it when I can show things.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdated Fuel Tank - I wasn\u0027t satisfied with how the end caps of the tank were. I used the wrong texture and it makes no sense. So I\u0027m updating it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2.5m Engine (Finally!) - After 4 designs, I finally have something that I\u0027m happy with. The last one I did looks cool, but I was having trouble building a base for it, and the texturing wasn\u0027t working for me so I started to get frustrated with it...argh. Anyway, the new engine fixes all of the problems:\u00A0Single nozzle, cryogenic, 4 turbo pumps, big bell and you can either used it with a protective shell or exposed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese will be released as soon as I have my PC working again. I can at least model pretty decently on my notebook, so that\u0027s chugging along. I\u0027ll post screenshots later.

I\u0027m a big fan of the Universal Storage mod, so I don\u0027t want to just repeat that. I\u0027m thinking more along the lines of creating a service bay that you can fit both the stock batteries and parts, as well as some parts that I\u0027ll make like food bags and things like that. Still planning.
