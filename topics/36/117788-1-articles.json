I used the Mk1-2 pod .cfg as a baseline, as my pod is close to the same size (2.5m on bottom, 1.5m on top, but a little shorter than the mk1-2 pod) but was double size so I had to set the scale and rescale factor both to 0.5. I\u0027m still playing with making the top and bottom attachment nodes be in the correct places. \n\nBut my question is - where the part is a command pod, when I try to EVA a Kerbal it gives an error about not having a hatch. I wasn\u0027t surprised at this. \n\nAnyone have any idea how I add a hatch to a part? Do I do this in unity? (page 4 of the tutorial I linked above?) \n\nDo I do something special in the .cfg file for the part? Is it something on the 3dmodel itself?"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T16:29:52Z","Content":"Hey Tjsnh, \n\nStart here: \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638) \n\nUnder Unity/Configs There is a section on setting up Airlocks (hatches)."},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T18:50:59Z","Content":"Yikes.
