I think we\u0027ll have a better idea once the configuration system is solidly underway. Some features to support the PF CE paradigm of planet creation (clone and modify) are planned, although the planets produced will still be introduced into the game through systemPrefab injection as with other Kopernicus bodies.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will actually be fairly easy to port PF planets. Just look at the configuration files - it is just a list of added or modified PQS Mods. Not too much hidden magic is happening. We won\u0027t have direct support for PF configs (I *may* write a handy little conversion script), partly to respect Krag\u0027s wishes of non distribution of PF\u0027s assets. For anyone thinking about making a Sentar expansion \u0022Kopernicus\u0022 edition, I have a feeling that would count as redistributing PF, even if the textures in question don\u0027t belong to Krag, the idea of that solar system does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T18:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
