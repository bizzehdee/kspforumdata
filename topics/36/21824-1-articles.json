However, I\u0027m having alignment problems. I managed to get it pretty well aligned when the CrewTank was attached to a mk1 pod, but as soon as I attach it to any other command capsule, it fails horribly and goes completely out of alignment. So, basically, I\u0027d like to find out if this is a bug in KSP, and multiple interiors are impossible at the current time; or if I\u0027m simply doing something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T23:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm here try this, This is my CFG edit that holds 3 and has the Shuttle Cockpit Interior\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?b9dbftnr5o2ebr3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?b9dbftnr5o2ebr3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"um3k","CreatedById":37350,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T00:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, yeah, KSP definitely doesn\u0027t handle multiple interiors correctly.
