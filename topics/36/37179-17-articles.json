I am trying to get a wharf working as a launch site. I have placed the static on the shore and marked it as launch site. The launch site shows up in the VAB/SPH, but when i launch from there the game always puts the vessels underwater on an altitude so that they \u0022rest\u0022 on the underwater terrain (Z=-20m) instead of at the Z-Level where the spawn-point is located (z=0, ocean surface).\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q52y7oA.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Q52y7oA.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greys\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greys\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s just how it works with launch sites, before KSP can enable physics it has to \u0022PutShipToGround\u0022. This is intended to prevent ships clipping into terrain and exploding, or being way high up and exploding, and in /most/ situations it makes a lot of sense and works well. It just so happens that over tha last month a lot of situations where it doesn\u0027t make sense have been found.\u003Cp\u003EStatis are considered \u0022ground\u0022, so if you put stuff under the launch site but shallow enough that buoyancy won\u0027t throw your ships into the air too much, this should overcome your issues. I believe PutShipToGround operates by colliders, so this could be an invisible mesh, or you could fake a little underwater shelf; ships will be able to hit it either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreys is correct. This is just how KSP handles putting the ships to the ground. It needs to collide with \u0022terrain\u0022 for it to be considered as touching the ground. Almost all static objects are set to the terrain layer automatically, so you should indeed use an invisible mesh or have a underwater shelf like Greys said. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snjo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snjo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IyviAni.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/IyviAni.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E That is awesome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fitzy3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fitzy3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI couldn\u0027t find it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-12-2-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more%21?p=600694\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post600694\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereplied to your question\u003C/a\u003E also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no direct tutorials for going straight from SketchUp to KSP from me.
