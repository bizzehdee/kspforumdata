(noticed under dX9, I still must check at OpenGl and dX11).\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t know if the sunflare textures will load in .dds format but you can try, the filename is expected to be .png so try converting to .dds and rename to .png and see if it works. Are the textures you\u0027re using big enough though that it makes a difference? Usually sun flare textures are pretty smooth and low-detail so I wouldn\u0027t expect the difference in filesize to be very important.\n\nFor the fade-out, I think making them smaller or bigger will throw off the \u0022shape\u0022 that you have carefully created by configuring the ghosts and all. Maybe making them fade-out in intensity would work better? What do you think? I thought about it before but decided the ghosts getting bigger and smaller while staying at the defined screen positions wouldn\u0027t look very good so I locked them and left only the flares to vary in size.\n\nFor the jittering issue, have you checked if it happens if your ship is currently orbiting the Jool system? I would expect it to happen in map view if you are orbiting Kerbin but switched the view to a far-away system, if it\u0027s the case I\u0027ll fix it next time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-12T17:47:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2016 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Proot","CreatedById":98932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T19:48:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know if the sunflare textures will load in .dds format but you can try, the filename is expected to be .png so try converting to .dds and rename to .png and see if it works.

In fact I hate the lossy quality of that format, so don\u0027t worry at all about it.\n\nYou are probably right about the ghost\u0027s resizing, it\u0027s probably much better option to do a slow and long fadeout.\n\nAlso, I\u0027ll check about the jittering issue, because I think you are right. Anyways I see it as a minor issue, so no hurry about it.\n\nAs always, many thanks for your attention!"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T22:46:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I don\u0027t understand is why you\u0027re trying to accomplish that.
