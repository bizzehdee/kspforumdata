How well they perform in RSS?\n\nThese rockets are configured to work with RSS. If you just copy the Liquidhype folder into your GameData directory you get the rockets already set up for RSS. As long as you don\u0027t use the \u0022optionalStockConfigs\u0022 each rocket will easily make it into space (and beyond) in RSS. The stock configs are only there for people who wants to use these launchers in stock KSP.\n\nThe only differences with these rockets are that they use \u0022solid fuel\u0022, \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 and \u0022oxidizer\u0022 instead of real fuels. They still have the same amount of deltaV as their real-world counterparts."},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T23:44:46Z","Content":"**Minor status update:**\n\nDelta III is almost ready for release.

My guess is actually the newest version of FAR. I did alot of testing with it in my install, which always has FAR installed, and the Delta flew just fine before I installed FAR v. 0.15.5.\n\nMy imediate though was \u0022damn you drag-cubes\u0022, but the thing is, it flies perfectly fine in the stock atmo. I think it is the voxel-model aero from the new version of FAR that is screwing things up. I might have to redo the colliders because of how voxel-model aero works. Problem with using the entire fairing as a collider is that it causes all sorts of problems with what\u0027s inside of it when decoupling the fairings."},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T00:09:54Z","Content":"**Update:**\n\n- Delta III launch vehicle added\n\n- Minor fixes and adjustments for the other launchers\n\nEnjoy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T01:04:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Update:**\n\u003E - Delta III launch vehicle added\n\u003E \n\u003E - Minor fixes and adjustments for the other launchers\n\u003E \n\u003E Enjoy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWowowoowwowowo.....
