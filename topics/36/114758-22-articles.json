I think about adding options to make a closed lifecycle or at least for some planets, e.g getting CO2 on planets with atmosphere but without oxygen or the possibility to get WasteWater from Minmus(ice) or Laythe (water?).

Which LS-Mod are you using? There are three with oxygen as a resource. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nTo calculate the capacity of the LS containers i used the Size2 or Size1 containers the LS mods provided as a reference and multiplied their capacity with the volume difference between them.\n\nWhere possible i used **Size2** with: \n\n    Capacity = (\u0022Capacity of Size2\u0022/4)*(\u0022Depth of Size2\u0022/\u0022Depth of Container\u0022)\n\n or for **Size1**:\n\n     Capacity = \u0022Capacity of Size1\u0022*(\u0022Depth of Size1\u0022/\u0022Depth of Container\u0022)\n\nE.g. for Oxygen in TAC i used the capacity of the Size2 oxygen tank with 486496.4L divided it by four for the small container and multiplied it with 1.5 because the container is ~1.7-1-8 times deepter than the TAC container. This resulted in the 182436.2L the small oxygen container currently has for TAC.\n\nThe attachment point for the gangways is a good idea, haven\u0027t thought about that until now.\n\nTwo modular storages (with four and eight places) are planned for the size2 profile ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T22:26:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nils277**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T01:13:13Z","Content":"For what it\u0027s worth, I figure that needing to *mine for ore* disqualifies a station as being \u0027closed loop\u0027 at all; you\u0027ve simply exchanged the need for external resupply of Supplies for resupply of Ore.
