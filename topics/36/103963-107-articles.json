I thought about it, but it depends on where the bug is coming from, if it\u0027s from the generation then they might go away, if it\u0027s in the rendering then nope. I don\u0027t want to get your hopes up, but since they seem different with every rebuild they might be from the generation. I have no real idea where these artifacts come from as I couldn\u0027t ever reproduce them.
