This has lines for each planet that say \u0022@referenceBody = Helios\u0022.  Is that what I change to \u0022StockSun\u0022 ?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also in the same folder is is OPM\\_AddStar.cfg, which seems to create the whole Helios system.  I\u0027d rather not have a clone of the stock KSP system---the whole point is to see other star systems ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).  So if I delete this file, will Helios and all its cloned planets go away?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, most of the planet packs and star systems haven\u0027t been updated to 1.1.x yet.  Is that a problem?\n\u003E \n\nthat should work, you should check out in game just to be sure\n\nand regarding packs working on 1.1.2 I have no idea, if the mod works on its own then it will probably work fine in GN\n\nif you find issues, try the planet pack on its own, and if the issue happens with GN but not without GN then report it here\n\nif the issue happens both with and without GN then report it on that planet pack\u0027s thread"}]}
