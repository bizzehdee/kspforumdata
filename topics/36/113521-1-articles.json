A big ship and some workers, something like this:\n\n![LTrNukd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LTrNukd.jpg)\n\nOr really, a bit more like this:\n\n![CFVGxQp.png](http://i.imgur.com/CFVGxQp.png)\n\nI think there\u0027s a fundamental problem with realistic starships in KSP, with mods that have multiple stars. They take too long to get anywhere! You time warp through a flight lasting decades or centuries, and what does the Type 1.5 civilization you left behind do? They\u0027re not mining the sun, building megastructures, or kerbin-forming planets. You can go back to the Kerbol system at any time and your satellites are still in their orbits, your Kerbals are still in their hitchiker containers, and your bases haven\u0027t expanded one bit. It breaks my suspension of disbelief.\n\n* * *\nThe Mod\nThat\u0027s where this mod will come in. The journey to another star is a special voyage. You entire civilization (and your game) has been organized behind a single purpose: build the greatest spacecraft ever built, fill it with tons and tons of the most expensive substances known - Helium-3 or antimatter or Karbondrum - and launch it on the most epic journey in history. Your kerbals wave the starship off, and then...\n\n**Diaspora focuses the scope of the game on your colonists**. Decades or centuries later, their ship arrives in a new star system. Kerbin is so very far away - your only interaction is tiny, very expensive email packets that take *years* to arrive. The home system is irrelevant, so it\u0027s not even in the game.\n\nUninhabited worlds await. Launch your construction craft, get mining, and build a new Kerbal Space Program around your new home star. And if you want, build another starship and launch it to another star! Each interstellar trip is a new chapter in the kerbal Diaspora.\n\n* * *\n\nPlanned Contents\n\n- Interstellar Navigation Komputer part. \u0022\u0027Space is big. Really big. You just won\u0027t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is.\u0027 - Doug-Adams Kerman. But that\u0027s okay, with the latest, greatest flight komputer from Bebop Rocket (and Dance) Collective. Guaranteed to keep your starship on course for decades and your crew alive (sanity not covered by this guarantee). BFR engines and planet-sized fuel tanks not included.\u0022\n- Interstellar Navigation GUI. Select a star from a list of stars you\u0027ve discovered (installed), make sure you\u0027re ready, and the mod will simulate the voyage to your new home!\n- An interstellar voyage. While you\u0027re in interstellar space, I would like your ship to live in another system that only contains stars: Kerbol and the Local Kluster. On the second pass (after the teleporting from a GUI), the trajectory will be set automatically and the screen will be locked to the Planetarium, as the game timewarps through years. Eventually, I would like to add the option for the player to fly the mission themselves, so you can do your crazy powered slingshot past Kerbol.\n- KSP without the KSC. KSC is lightyears away. Your new base is your mothership. KSC functions will be tied to specific parts - VAB/launchpad to an Extraplanetary Launchpads part, science to a lab, navigation to a dish (or an epic dish cluster part). Eventually, the main KSC Scene would be replaced with a screenshot, then a Scene of your mothership!\n- Multiplayer support. Considering how huge a starship is and how much exotic fuel you need to mine to cross light years, I think coop is a natural fit. The diaspora could keep repeating, with a new star system every month or so when the players successfully launch.\n\n* * *\n\nOther Mods\n\nDependencies\n\n- Kopernicus\n- Kerbal Engineer. Used to calculate vessel deltaV through all the stages and trip time.\n- Background processing? Used to deplete consumables over the trip.\n- Time warp enhancement? Used to warp years at a time sensibly.\n\nVery Strongly Recommend\n\nYou don\u0027t have to launch a colony. Building a [Project Daedalus](http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/project-daedalus)-style probe could be interesting. But if you do...\n\n- Extraplanetary Launchpads. Without the KSC, you\u0027ll need some way to build things.\n- A resource mod compatible with EL. Where do you get the resources to survive and grow?\n\nStrongly Recommended\n\n- Propulsion mods (Karbonite\u002B, KSP Intersteller). Propulsion is half of why interstellar travel is so hard! Good luck travelling light years on the Isp of the stock nuke. You\u0027ll probably also need a mod for stupendously giant fuel tanks and stupendously giant mining equipment to fill them up in a reasonable time.\n- Life support mods (TAC life support, USI Life Support, Snacks!). Long-term life support is the other half of why interstellar travel is so hard! Whether they\u0027re dead on arrival or refuse to work (dooming your expedition to eternal sulking), you won\u0027t want to run out of these supplies. DeepFreeze offers you the solution of kerbal popsicles. Mods like USI MKS/OKS and Biomass let you recycle life support supplies so you don\u0027t have to pack a century\u0027s worth.\n- Power systems mod. There\u0027s not enough light for solar panels between stars; you need nuclear energy. Maybe you can power your life support on stock RTGs, but The Kraken frowns on that many parts.\n\n* * *\n\nDevelopment Plan\n\n1. First the voyage GUI. Figure out how to load different Kopernicus/Kopernicus Tech configs without having to restart the game and plop your craft in orbit around the new star. Next version would simulate the voyage - calculate delta V and trip time. Next would be resources - check that your craft has enough power, and it arrives low on life support supplies, reactor fuel, machinery, spare parts, etc (or if you didn\u0027t pack enough, the kerbals all die). Either it would be calculated by the mod or some time warp enhancement/background processing would be used.\n2. Next, the KSC and VAB replacement, bundled as a required but stand-alone mod, Mothership. For the first version, I\u0027d like to find a hack that disables the returning to KSC from flight and replaces the VAB background Scene with a starry skybox. You would now reach the relevant KSC scenes - VAB, science, and astronaut lounge - from part modules.\n3. Working around the time limit. I\u0027ve never gotten that far, but apparently after ~60 years the game breaks? It seems simple enough to restart time on arrival.\n\nAt this point, I would call the mod feature-complete, and everything else is bonus.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Extensions of other mods:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Civilian Population. Hire contractors to mine fuel for you, because you\u0027re going to need a lot of it.\n\u003E - Telescope mods. Launch Kepler-style missions to scout out destinations. You don\u0027t want to end up at a crappy star! Build a solar system-spanning telescope to finally get a good look at the exoplanets.\n\u003E - Contracts pack. Kerbal equivalents of the 100 Year Starship project, Tau Zero Foundation, and the British Interplanetary Society guide you through starship construction (and give you money).\n\u003E - Extended tech tree. Another star should have an insane science modifier, so I think it needs to be balanced to feel right. Extending the tech tree with very expensive, overpowered Star Trek style technologies would give you something to spend it on...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Enhancements:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Relativity. Makes the propulsion problem way harder and the life support problem a little easier.\n\u003E - Procedural generation of systems (incorporate and expand Warp Drive).\n\u003E - A way to handle the life cycle of Kerbals over generations. Without the endless supply from Kerbin, how do you get more of the eager green creatures?\n\u003E - An extension of Civilian Population/Kerbal Konstructs that lets colonies grow into full-blown cities.  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Funds and contracts will reappear.\n\u003E     - City generation and terraforming for systems left behind means it \\*would\\* make sense to return to the home system. Better bring something rare and exotic to make it worth the trip...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]Laser light sail. Possibly the only peaceful use of a death star.\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]Rendezvous with fuel from Kerbin. It\u0027s been a proposed cheat to the rocket equation... build a mass driver on a moon and launch fuel tanks that rendezvous with the starship. Hey, it worked for exploring the north and south pole. With manual mode checked, you\u0027d have to send a tug after them (unless you have a logistics mod and part).\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]A Bussard ramjet. Other intakes are only 1.25m? How cute!\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]Honorverse-style hyperspace. Hyper limit = star\u0027s SOI. Parts for impeller nodes, inertial dampeners, and Kerhawski sails. Gravity waves are dangerous for craft without Kerhawski sails. With RemoteTech, you have their FTL gravity transmitters.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Difficulty modes:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - RoboKerbals. (Lack-of-difficulty mode.) Aka stock. Without a life support mod, Kerbals are assumed to be in cyborg bodies - that need electricity. A little mod for uploading kerbals and downloading them into new bodies could be fun.\n\u003E - Crappy star. These planets are resource poor and the star\u0027s light is wimpy. Good luck!\n\u003E - Star changed since launch. \u0022One of our grad students forgot a decimal point. He had one job!\u0022 The star isn\u0027t what we expected it to be! It\u0027s now a neutron star (radiation, comms interference), dwarf (dim light), or a red supergiant (swallowed the good planets).\n\u003E - Planets changed since launch. A moon escaped, or a moon was captured. Two planets collided, or some planet\u0027s atmosphere boiled off, or the pre-radio-when-you-launched inhabitants of the Kerbin-like world nuked themselves to death.\n\u003E - Lapped by the future. \u0022We were secretly hoping that Kerbin would sit and do nothing like they always do on interplanetary missions. But no.\u0022 A more advanced ship beat us here!  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - They are happy to let us use their facilities, if we earn it. You arrive in the system to discover cities and space stations, who give you contracts. Funds becomes a mechanic again.\n\u003E     - They wish we weren\u0027t here. As long as we stay away from [planets with kolonies], they won\u0027t shoot at us. Let\u0027s get enough fuel to keep going.\n\u003E     - [bD Armory installed.] A more advanced ship beat us here! Their technology is superior, but they have forgotten about war... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] Generation degeneration. \u0022Kids these days! They just don\u0027t make kerbonauts like they used to.\u0022 Centuries of confinement and inbreeding later, the generation of Kerbals that arrive have high Stupidity, crappy KerbalStats and have lost parts of the tech tree.\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] Life support failure. % of Kerbals die.\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] Space debris strike. At relativistic speeds, even single particles can be deadly. Your ship has taken damage. Could be mitigated by debris shield parts (using electromagnetics or oil droplets or whatever).\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] Computer glitch. We lost much of our old knowledge. Have to go through (most of) the tech tree again.\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] Fuel leak. We don\u0027t have enough fuel to slow down the entire ship! Use KAS to trim weight and make clever use of orbital dynamics.\n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*] AI rebellion! [bD Armory installed.] \u0022Our mechanical servants ran away with most of our equipment! And invented shooty things!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Alien things to discover. For fun, science, and terror!

Kopernicus planets must all be loaded at the monkey load screen and even only a few star systems worth of planets will probably max out a 32 bit install, when you\u0027re only ever going to use one system at a time. I have a functioning UI, part module, and multi-\u0022star\u0022 mini galaxy. I spent Sunday pretty much just reading Kopernicus\u0027s source and the KSP API. I hope there\u0027s some native way to unload planets or Kopernicus comes up eve with something. Otherwise, I would try to write a serializer for planetary bodies (which means finding EVERY field needed and cleaning up every single reference to them), cache the unused ones to a binary file, then reload them when needed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T14:01:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by beabop**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T16:08:57Z","Content":"Seems more like a brand new game than a mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T16:29:52Z","Content":"A conversion mod for KSP?
