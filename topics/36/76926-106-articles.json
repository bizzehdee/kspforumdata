But really, the reason i\u0027m trying to do this is because the current tank turret is huge, i suggest a smaller turret, maybe even the T-34-85. No rush though, hopefully you had a good vacation. I wish i could make my own turrets but i\u0027m not really completely grasping blender and my C# knowledge is limited to making petty loops, conditions and Console.WriteLine(\u0022HelloWorld\u0022);.

What you need is 3d modeling abilities and knowledge on how to use Unity for KSP part creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your C# knowledge is technically enough to create custom plugins, you should have a look at the KSP-Api though, as it contains everything you need to make your plugin interact with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you should acquire knowledge about making custom parts. That\u0027s easy, just copy one of the guns and mess with the values a little, edit the texture and maybe copy a module from another part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you should have a look at Blender or another 3d software. For that, I recommend looking at this tutorial: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.raywenderlich.com/49955/blender-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-make-a-mushroom\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.raywenderlich.com/49955/blender-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-make-a-mushroom\u003C/a\u003E From that you should learn how to make simple models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it gets a little more complicated. You now need Unity 4 (or 5, if PartTools is updated) and the KSP Part Tools. A little google should get you those things. In Unity, you make some KSP part project and import the PartTools package (or unzip it in the Assets folder). When that\u0027s done, import your blender model into Unity and attach a PartTools component to it. Set up a simple collider for your part, specify the filepath in the PartTools component and assign a texture with a KSP shader. Then export the mu file and you\u0027ll find it at the specified filepath. At a part.cfg, position the attachment nodes and configure the part the way you want it. When that\u0027s done, you should be good to go. Start KSP and admire the beauty of the part you just created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the hard part: Making a custom turret\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo make a custom turret, you need a gun model and a turret model.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake those or, for testing purposes, use a cube and a cylinder in your Unity scene.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd a GameObject, add a PartTools component to it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd a GameObject, call it aimRotate and make it a child of the GameObject.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd the turret and make it a child of aimRotate.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd a GameObject, call it aimPitch and make it a child of the turret.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPosition aimPitch at the front of the turret.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd the barrel and make it a child of aimPitch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPosition the barrel in a way, that aimPitch is at the end of it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd two GameObjects, call them fireTransform and muzzleTransform and make them children of the barrel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPosition fireTransform and muzzleTransform at the tip of the barrel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERotate fireTransform towards the Z axis.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdd a KSP Particle Emitter component to both fireTransform and muzzleTransform.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EImport the whole thing into KSP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECreate a part.cfg file and add a BahaTurret module (just copy it from the BDA howitzer and adjust the values).\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStart KSP and hope the part works.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice: If something doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s likely your fault (or I didn\u0027t explain well enough), except if you really tried the turret thing, haven\u0027t figure that one out completely yet.

I feel like the problem is in my distance from said target, ~12km, because when I fire a cruise missile within a range of 5km, they will track and fly towards the target. Beyond that, they either keep flying upwards until they run out of fuel and crash, or they just crash into the ground (when launched at a low angle). And when they are able to hit the target, they never fly at the altitude I\u0027ve set them at; they only behave similarly to the normal missiles and instead will directly fly at the target without regard to the landscape.\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to fix this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you are launching them from outside of your physics range.
