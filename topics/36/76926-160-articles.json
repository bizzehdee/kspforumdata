In real life modern tank turrets contain a FCS (Fire Control System). Basically, depending on the wind, elevation, target speed and movement. The FCS will generate a fire solution for the gunner and fire accordingly. But you may ask isn\u0027t that already in BDArmory due to how the gun already tries tries it\u0027s best to hit the point provided by the mouse cursor, but when you place your mouse cursor on a target for a few seconds the turret should lock onto that target and it should account for \u003Cem\u003Etarget speed\u003C/em\u003E so it will accordingly lead the locked target. To elaborate the target camera is brought up somehow from the tank turret. Then the user could tick an option that allowed locking of this kind, the user then would point the cursor into a target and the turret would lock it and lead accordingly. When the user fires the round (unless the target moves unpredictably) the shell should land right on the target. (I can\u0027t think of anything else that can make the turret locking to the target instead of guard mode or blatantly locking the craft as target. But that is how the tank FCS works in Arma 2\u0027s ACE mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor modders, allow us to disable certain options for the firing system like the leading FCS i mentioned above and the camera. So a modder could have only a camera in his turret but no FCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nickvr628","CreatedById":129848,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T13:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill we get passive IR jammers for our aircraft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T14:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat if the 3rd person locking effects looked like ace combat ones?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m waiting for those targeting pods not only becayse they will... well target stuff, but also will look great as nose cones for my gunships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nickvr628\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nickvr628\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill we get passive IR jammers for our aircraft?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to ask what is a passive IR jammer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegatoxi","CreatedById":134066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have to ask what is a passive IR jammer?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/ALQ-144\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/ALQ-144\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corovaneer","CreatedById":26202,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried modifying parts to make .50 cal guns and ammo available at the start of the career, but changing required tech in part .cfg did nothing, surprisingly.
