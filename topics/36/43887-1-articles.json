It\u0027s a feature I\u0027ve wanted since I first began interplanetary travel within KSP. It\u0027s crucial, IMO, for effectively using tools like alexmun\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33023-WEB-APP-Launch-Window-Planner\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E and one of the reasons I named it \u0022Precise Node\u0022. I still need to test the angle to retrograde (when the angle is negative, it is angle from retrograde) since I\u0027m not entirely confident with the math, but that won\u0027t take too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027d written the feature I figured I might as well go full bore and write a proper KSP mod to replace the key functionality of the mod I\u0027m using (no reason to have duplicate mods) so ... future plans include additional \u002B/- buttons, and possibly textboxes, for the delta-V stuff and \u0022multiplier\u0022 buttons for the \u002B/- buttons (so you can do 10 at a time or 0.01 at a time, for instance, but they\u0027ll be global to all buttons). Right now it only works with the first maneuver node but it shouldn\u0027t be that hard to allow you to page through nodes. And, of course, adding a hotkey to open the last edited node widget if needed (with an editor window that\u0027s always open I don\u0027t really see a need for it, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already had one inquiry into releasing this and was wondering if there were any wish-list features that people have for maneuver node editing?

I\u0027m not sure how you want to do the Numpad thing, in my opinion it would be the best to highlight one of the four entry fields (Time/Pro/Radial/Normal) as \u0022active\u0022, and make Num\u002B and Num- change that field. The highlighted field could be changed by clicking in the edit fields (text-cursor) or additionally by a hotkey.

Have to dig out that old USB keyboard for a proper numpad...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided against textboxes for delta-V since I realized it\u0027s so quick to just add more after I played around with the buttons last night. Aside from testing the angle from retrograde math (hopefully tonight), I just have the numpad controls and maneuver node paging to add before I consider it release-worthy. There\u0027s some wierdness with the maneuver node\u0027s drag widget staying open, but this is intended to be a replacement for that, so I suppose I won\u0027t worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a need for a total delta-V display? The widget also stays open so long as you have at least one node which I don\u0027t really see as a problem, so maybe I should hide it unless you\u0027re in map view?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T10:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking good!
