Low-altitude scanners will be able to show more detailed concentration levels.

The Scan-O-Matic .cfg I have installed was calling for ORS-X resources for some reason, so I put in regolith modules. Was just wondering if I need to save that .cfg I made, or if the part was being re-purposed under the new things. Oh man, can\u0027t wait for all this stuff. I\u0027m playing a heavily modded save since all the updates and I\u0027m about to start finally putting some OKS modules up in orbit.

If we are using large drills on a deposit and it starts depleting, will this affect the harvest threshold of that deposit as well?
