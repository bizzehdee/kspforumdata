Karborundum can be tweakable without Karbonite (but expensive). But if you\u0027ve got Karbonite, you can fly yourself out to Jool and gather up a mess of zeonium and karbonite (if you want to make this tedious, ensure they can\u0027t do both at the same time) from its atmosphere but you can\u0027t process any of it yet. You have to fly far enough out from Jool to start processing it into Karborundum. Or, if that doesn\u0027t appeal, you can grab K\u002B and truck yourself out to Eeloo, brave the depths of Eve\u0027s atmosphere or dive into the sun to get some Karborundum directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draft","CreatedById":72633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T00:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m... not a fan of that, honestly.
