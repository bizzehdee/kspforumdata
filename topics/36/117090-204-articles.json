And the engine cluster plugin has the \u0027transformsToRemove\u0027 field specifically for removing built-in shrouds.  That all relies on them being at least separate meshes in the model though.\n\nThe SUBMODEL setup allows for using specific meshes from any model loaded into KSP.  Check out the NearFuture truss patch that I did for examples of how to use it (GameData/SSTU/ModIntegration/NearFutureConstruction/ModelData-NF-OctoTrussXXXX files).  Was written specifically to enable use of models setup for B9/FireSpitter model-switching, but as you\u0027ve seen has plenty of other (more common) uses ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nEdit:\n\nIn short, adding even a single \u0027transform = \u0027 line to the SUBMODEL puts the model compiler into \u0027exclusive\u0027 mode where it will only load the specified transforms from the model.
