I can\u0027t find the forum post talking about it, but I do remember the steps to get it working.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, I had the same problem with MFD previously and applied the same fix. Unfortunately Probe Control Room still has the problem. Presumably it\u0027s for a similar reason, and commenting something out in DefRPM.cfg would fix the problem, but I couldn\u0027t find anything directly matching the offending bit in MFD\u0027s cfg, so have absolutely no idea what line to get rid of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mykill Metal","CreatedById":89183,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T23:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Jet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dr. Jet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe it will be better to have 3 big monitors on the wall than 1 big and 4 small? Big ones can serve as panoramic view for 3 frontal cameras, while 4 smaller monitors on the desk are enough for every other need.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse it like I do.
