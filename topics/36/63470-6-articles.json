Throwing my little rough Kerbal mesh up against the side of this rocket really made me appreciate the scale of these constructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust throwing ideas here, but the 6m parts can offer a lot in terms of Megastructure construction, while minimizing part load and thus lag. As to the actual design of these Megastructures and what their individual components will look like...is all unknown currently. I have a couple options available, the easiest is to make them some variant on the aerodynamic rocket modules, and thus easy to launch, or I can try some trickery with unfolding modules in orbit. I just don\u0027t know how nodes will react when their collision meshes are dynamically changing, so that second option might not be possible. Either way, massive orbital facilities are the most likely use of the 6 meter class. I\u0027m sure people will use them for creating impromptu cities on other planets as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo sketches on the Megastructure yet tho...
