I always run KSP with my system memory monitor open to keep an eye on use as I play and have noticed that memory does not increase while loading a page of textures while browsing the VAB. I think that that window may be describing the page full of placeholder textures rather than the full sized examples.On the other hand, the issue for me always seems to be reentering the VAB after a failed launch. Each time I return to the VAB, KSP holds onto between 100MB-250MB more than when I left it in the first place and that memory isn\u0027t released at all. That being said, I really think the best possible place for additional overhead is still planetary textures because they are always loaded, no matter whether or not you\u0027re looking at them. If we could have a way that would only load placeholder textures while not looking directly at them, or even when looking from a distance, and then load higher resolution textures as you close in, I feel like it would save a good chunk of wasted memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-04T21:09:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2014 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T22:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a memory crash.
