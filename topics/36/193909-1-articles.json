You might have heard of them. As a result, I\u0027ve become knowledgeable about the three two loosely coupled systems (Part and Core) that exist in the game along with most of the headaches and challenges that come along with them. The challenge I\u0027ve faced in the past is that these systems don\u0027t work very well for the gameplay that I want to work with, which is developing gameplay based on system level heat mechanics. In stock, this system is the \u0027core heat\u0027 mechanic, which drives drills, converters, and radiators. In my mods it also drives reactors and some engines. However, the core heat system is....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInflexible\u003C/strong\u003E, and\u00A0prone to breakage when pushed (weird temperature spikes,\u00A0 nonsensical values)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConfusing\u003C/strong\u003E, with no ingame tools to help players design ships beyond a KSPedia page\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESimplistic\u003C/strong\u003E, having little to no impact on ship design beyond enforcing the need to stick some poorly documented number of radiators on a ship\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little while ago I declared that I hated it and that I would write something to replace it and provide something more aligned with my goals and hopefully better in every way.

Spacecraft usually have to deal with a number of different thermal systems for different purposes, due to the varying heat generation requirements of various things on them. Humans make heat, electricity makes heat, nuclear engines make heat... and they tend to do so at different rates and in different ways. You usually can\u0027t just put 50 Thermal Control System (large) parts on the ship and you\u0027re all happy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SystemHeat concept will basically take this and run with it. Allocating your heat producing parts correctly between your radiators will be important, as well as making sure you don\u0027t do stuff like pipe your reactor exhaust into your life support system. Fun times!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#16a085;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Loops\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this mod, all parts that interact with the system are part of an abstract\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Loop\u003C/strong\u003E. This represents the flow of coolant through a set of systems that produce heat and consume heat. Producers might include reactors, life support processors, ISRUs, drills and that kind of thing. Radiators would be consumers (effectively the only one at this point).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach part that produces heat does so with an \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature \u003C/strong\u003Eand an\u003Cstrong\u003E Output Flux. \u003C/strong\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ethis is the temperature of the insides of the part (say, a nuclear reactor core) - any coolant coming out of the part will be at that temperature. The \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Flux\u003C/strong\u003E is the rate heat is produced by the part. Parts have different temperatures and fluxes depending on their nature - a nuclear reactor has a pretty high \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0a high\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Flux, \u003C/strong\u003Ea drill might have a lower \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Flux\u003C/strong\u003E and a lower \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, parts that consume heat have special properties. They specifically consume heat with an \u003Cstrong\u003EInput Flux\u003C/strong\u003E - a bigger, better radiator is likely able to handle a higher input flux\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen parts are connected into a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Loop , \u003C/strong\u003Ethe members of the loop contribute their \u003Cstrong\u003EInput/Output Flux\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0into it. If all the fluxes going into the loop are positive, it heats up and increases its \u003Cstrong\u003ELoop Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E. If the flux is negative, it cools down. If the \u003Cstrong\u003ELoop Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E gets too high, systems in the loop will be negatively affected, in proportion to how different the \u003Cstrong\u003ELoop Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E is to their \u003Cstrong\u003EOutput Temperature\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour job, as the spacecraft engineer, is to construct \u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Loops\u003C/strong\u003E such that they are well-balanced and basically don\u0027t heat up and .

It does make me wonder - is there any meaning in the order of connections on the loop? is there a \u0022direction\u0022 to the loop, where one of the radiators is \u0022first\u0022 - and if so, does that have some kind of effects? It seems like it doesn\u0027t, based on the description, just curious.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince distance isn\u0027t factored in (system is perfectly efficient), it\u0027s possible to assign all systems on the ship to\u00A0one loop, right? (I\u0027m going go ignore OutputTemperature for now.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen, from the quote above, what I understand is: if you put parts on separate loops, overheating part A on loop A won\u0027t affect nominal part B on loop B. But if you can\u00A0only assign a part to one loop at a time, and if you also can assign all parts to a single loop, I\u0027m thinking of a scenario and wondering how it would play out:\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYour ship has a nuclear engine loop as pictured, on EngineLoop, with exactly enough cooling (-2000kW?). LSLoop has a life support system\u00A0(\u002B1000kW) and 2\u00A0radiators (each -500kW, for the sake of argument).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne radiator\u00A0on LSLoop is\u00A0destroyed. Now the life support system can only run at 50% capacity; you\u0027re on a long trip, half your kerbals will die. Or maybe it can\u0027t run at all without sufficient cooling - however that works. Regardless,\u00A0EngineLoop is untouched.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother accident destroys the second radiator in LSLoop. Life support is inoperable, maybe, or just really, really intermittent or something. More Kerbals die. EngineLoop is still happy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut now: If you had placed all the heat generators\u00A0and all the radiators on only \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E loop when designing the craft, there would be an advantage: you \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Erun the life support if you turn off the engine, and maybe you can even run both at the same time (with the engine at 50% power).\u00A0Is that actually how the loops are envisioned to\u00A0work? If so, what\u0027s the reason for ever opting for more than one loop? Sorry if I have missed something !\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMoreover, a single loop would seem to always be more efficient: you can design a single loop to have cooling for the total number of systems that run at the same time (which is maybe \u0026lt; all\u00A0craft systems, e.g. engines and drills don\u0027t run together). But if you take the loops to the extreme and do 1\u00A0system per loop, your cooling requirements grow to\u00A0the \u003Cem\u003Etotal possible\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eheat output of all systems, not just the output of systems that run simultaneously... thus more radiators/weight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf instead each system on the ship is forced to be on a different loop, then you\u0027re just forcing the second condition in (5), effectively simulating \u0022We didn\u0027t put any valves in the coolant tube network.\u0022 Or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like I am missing some\u00A0step in the logic here, maybe, so if I am, sorry to waste time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding OutputTemperatures: I get that some parts might have higher OutputTemperatures than specific radiators could handle - just curious as to how that would play out. For example: can you just make a single loop on a craft, and add at least X number of high-temperature radiators to that loop to accommodate the \u0022special heat\u0022 produced by those parts (the abstraction of really hot coolant)?

But if you can\u00A0only assign a part to one loop at a time, and if you also can assign all parts to a single loop, I\u0027m thinking of a scenario and wondering how it would play out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYour ship has a nuclear engine loop as pictured, on EngineLoop, with exactly enough cooling (-2000kW?). LSLoop has a life support system\u00A0(\u002B1000kW) and 2\u00A0radiators (each -500kW, for the sake of argument).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne radiator\u00A0on LSLoop is\u00A0destroyed. Now the life support system can only run at 50% capacity; you\u0027re on a long trip, half your kerbals will die. Or maybe it can\u0027t run at all without sufficient cooling - however that works. Regardless,\u00A0EngineLoop is untouched.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother accident destroys the second radiator in LSLoop. Life support is inoperable, maybe, or just really, really intermittent or something. More Kerbals die. EngineLoop is still happy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut now: If you had placed all the heat generators\u00A0and all the radiators on only \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E loop when designing the craft, there would be an advantage: you \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Erun the life support if you turn off the engine, and maybe you can even run both at the same time (with the engine at 50% power).\u00A0Is that actually how the loops are envisioned to\u00A0work? If so, what\u0027s the reason for ever opting for more than one loop? Sorry if I have missed something !\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMoreover, a single loop would seem to always be more efficient: you can design a single loop to have cooling for the total number of systems that run at the same time (which is maybe \u0026lt; all\u00A0craft systems, e.g. engines and drills don\u0027t run together). But if you take the loops to the extreme and do 1\u00A0system per loop, your cooling requirements grow to\u00A0the \u003Cem\u003Etotal possible\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eheat output of all systems, not just the output of systems that run simultaneously... thus more radiators/weight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf instead each system on the ship is forced to be on a different loop, then you\u0027re just forcing the second condition in (5), effectively simulating \u0022We didn\u0027t put any valves in the coolant tube network.\u0022 Or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo where this breaks down is 4. If you placed everything on the same loop, the life support systems, that operate at a low temperature\u00A0(~300-400K) are in the same loop as the nuclear reactor, which operates at maybe 3000 K. That\u0027s bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe systems in a loop determine its operating temperature in proportion to their volume contributed - a small LS processor would contribute a low volume and probably a low temperature, whereas a nuclear engine contributes a high temperature and volume depending on how big it is. Loops want to get to their operating temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis\u00A0loop\u0027 operating\u00A0temperature determines the \u0027bad\u0027 effects on the parts connected to it. If the loop is very high temperature (involves a nuclear engine, maybe), and life support is on that loop, the life support parts will experience negative effects of overheating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does mean that the most efficient way to build systems is to have a different loop for each system of different operating temperatures. However as you point out, that\u0027s probably not the most mass efficient way to do things. This is the design trade of the mod overall - how many different loops, and with what parts, provide the best experience for your ship? Is it one loop, where you run your nuclear engine and rely on a large amount of coolant volume to not cook your kerbals during a burn and shut it down right after? Is it a pair of loops, one with specialized high temp radiators for the reactors, and one with low temp radiators for the LS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223786751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589752176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110936\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AccidentalDisassembly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, AccidentalDisassembly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: heatsinks - if heatsinks (more volume) is a thing, presumably that means \u0022lots of volume/mass of something whose temperature is raised in proportion to the heat \u0026amp; flux of coolant\u0022 (i.e. slowly heats up over time, starting from ambient).

If you have a billion times the cooling you need, that part (system) still runs at 1000k. But what exactly is the operating temperature\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eof a loop\u003C/em\u003E?

It\u0027s ambient temperature. Ambient-temperature coolant starts there, then\u00A0goes to the\u00A0reactor. The inside of the reactor is a nice, toasty 3000k - its operating temperature.\u00A0Once it achieves that temperature, its flux/heat output is 1000kW, so 1000kW of energy is applied to the\u00A0coolant, which heats up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nToasty coolant (presumably close to 3000k and a volume determined by a bunch of math related to how much energy it takes to heat this magic liquid by X degrees)\u00A0exits the reactor, then pipes through\u00A0four 250kW radiators. After coming out of the radiators, the coolant has returned to ambient temperature. If it hasn\u0027t, then the radiators didn\u0027t actually achieve that rate of cooling, presumably.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow, still on the same loop, the coolant enters the 300k part, an insanely powerful snack fabricator whose\u00A0flux is also 1000kW - applied to coolant, which then passes through four more 250kW radiators (so 8 in total on the single loop).\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCoolant is back to ambient temperature\u00A0again, and it\u00A0returns to reservoir.

Sure, the solar panel is only 30-40% efficient based on insolation, but this inefficiency is misleading - the panel also re-radiates on the rear, and is coated to reduce the absorption of energy that can\u0027t be transformed to electrical power. That gets rid of most of the excess. The end result of this is that most modern spacecraft don\u0027t need dedicated radiating hardware for their solar panels - even the ISS\u0027s\u00A0 prominent TCSes are primarily designed to radiate\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/International_Space_Station_TCS.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eto the interior\u003C/a\u003E. The real need for radiation comes from components that take that power generated and use it - whether that is for life support or other functions. That heat is usually generated inside the component and needs to be moved somewhere outside to be radiated. To top that off the inside of spacecraft are very sensitive, usually containing electronics that have a death threshold in the range of -60 to 60 C, and functional temperature ranges that are only 10-20 C wide - which incidentally also applies to humans. So overall the problem is less about getting the heat from the solar panels dealt with, but the heat from the things that use the power the panels provide.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill though most unmanned spacecraft don\u0027t have radiators - this is because overall, it\u0027s pretty easy to do thermal control without active systems - you put a heat conducting surface from your electronics to the outside of the spacecraft and the bus does the radiating. With clever design you can do this well and really minimize your total mass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaveat is when you move inwards from Earth you change this heat balance equation - but usually, you will not add cooling to your solar panels, instead you will just cant them or design your ship with an appropriate sun shield, which is more mass efficient and mechanically simpler. If you move outwards, you have the opposite problem, but you still avoid active cooling if you can, and rely on louvers or similar surfaces to help limit heat loss.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunctionally though, humans generate so much heat, what with them being complex chemical reactors that need all sorts of feedstock, that it\u0027s hard to do this passive heat rejection work. Almost all manned spacecraft have some kind of active thermal control, even if it\u0027s simply a roll maneuver. Any time you have high power electrical systems you probably need to do this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully that explains things better, I am not a spacecraft thermal engineer, but I need to deal with their decisions sometimes \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223787661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589895717\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150244\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nightside\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/19/2020 at 6:41 AM, Nightside said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283952\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nertea\u003C/a\u003E, this looks really great!

The problem that Squad faced when they designed that system was that there is a physical radiative component (ok, \u0027physical\u0027) which says that a radiator can radiate energy by the stefann-boltzmann law. This is problematic... KSP part temperatures are allowed to be so high that the amount of cooling that is provided by say, a 1500K radiator is enough for a million ships. Instead of trying to fix this, they decided that the rate of coolant flow would be a better thing to balance with, so a part can transfer X heat per tick, and that X has been calibrated to be something more realistic for a modest radiator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not going to touch the part surface temperature component of radiator-part interaction - playing with that system is a recipe for exploding ships.
