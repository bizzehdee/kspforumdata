It is heavy for the thrust and only hits max thrust at 2000m/s\u002B so it will be a long hot windup to get there I promise. In exchange for the nerfing I have returned the ability to throttle it so mush less explosions (aww) but because it is a RamJet it still won\u0027t produce thrust below about 340m/s and even then it prefers Mach 2 to get working properly.
