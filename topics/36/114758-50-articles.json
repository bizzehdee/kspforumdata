Due too downloading several mods (all compatible with 1.05) the program becomes extremely unstable. So i just deleted the module manager dll versions leaving only 2.6.13. in the folder.

I didn\u0027t realise there were so many extra parts for other mods I might have to install them all just to see them....\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E on a similar vein I know you\u0027ve shown some pictures of the base but do you have a rough idea of its footprint? Is the basic garage the same width/length as, say, the 4 way adapter?\n\u003E \n\nThe rough foodprint of the base is about Size 3 (3.75m) while the garage has a has the MK3 as diameter. It is hard so say which length the garage has. You\u0027\u0027 have to have at least one adapter at each end. (Adapter for landing legs) and it depends on how many \u0022normal\u0022 garage parts you put between. But on garage part is roughly as long as the science lab.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 31.12.2015 at 7:44 PM, daltonater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I would have to agree. I believe that a plan is in place for a now adapter for mounting to rockets during launch, which may also serve as the adaptor for use with the other base parts. All of this would of coarse take time, but we are patient.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On a very different note, I have a question to ask nils. What 3D programs do you use? I have been considering building a mod myself for a while, but I have had problems with my preffered 3D program of inventor with unwraping/texturing parts ( Im pretty sure it cant actually).\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m using Blender as a 3D Program. I really like it. And honestly any other program i know that has all the functions Blender has costs more than 1000$ ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2.1.2016 at 1:04 AM, Andem said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I solved the problem,  and it\u0027s nothing on your end.

Sorry if this was covered already.\n\u003E \n\nWhen you don\u0027t use other mods, you can delete the \u0022PlanetaryBaseInc\\Parts\\Mod\\_Support\u0022 Folder.In there you could also decide which mod you don\u0027t use and delete the folder with the names of the mods not installed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2.1.2016 at 7:39 AM, Orisi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been experiencing a small issue with the mod i\u0027m wondering if anyone else has experienced or has a workaround for;\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m trying to assemble a pretty cohesive Mun base, and have landed some modules and am trying to re-attach them to each other properly as they came as a few drops. (using KAS/KIS ofc)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So when I have to detach a 4 or 6 cargo pod, I obviously have to remove the containers first. But when I try to reattach them once i\u0027ve moved the pod, i\u0027m missing attachment nodes on the pod. I can\u0027t remember how many I was missing on the 6-pod, but the 4 was definitely missing two nodes; those closest to the reattachment point. Obviously this causes a few attachment issues so I thought i\u0027d ask if anyone else has had this issue trying to mess with bases through KAS and if there\u0027s a solution.\n\u003E \n\nA already heard of this problem a few times. I think it most often appereas when therea are multiple stack nodes on a part. Sometimes the game does not register that they are decoupled. The only solution i found was reloading (Or in editor replacing the part with the missing node). I am afraid that i can\u0027t do much on that end.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5.1.2016 at 8:18 PM, FlyingKiwibird said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey Nils, thanks for the great mod. I understand you have little time with your move and all, but i have scavenged the internets for a solution to my problem. Maybe some other people have experienced this, but my landing wheels are not working correctly. When i attach them to a landing base mounting node (not the corridors, the other parts with landing wheel mounts which should be compatible), they are always pointing the wrong way and the decoupler wont work. I always fix the legs by using offset and rotate tools, but the decoupler wont work no matter how i put them and i get an error message in the engineering report saying the decoupler is not attached correctly. If you know what this problem is, or a solution to my problem, it would be  very happy birthday for me.

(The node for surface attachment is another node). I  have to look it that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7.1.2016 at 7:59 AM, sharpspoonful said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Heya [@nils](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/49229-nils/), would adding support for Kethane be possible/pragmatic?\n\u003E \n\nI will have a look at it once the next update it made ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)"}]}
