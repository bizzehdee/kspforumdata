If the texture is missing, the model (or parts of it) will be white.\n\nYou may want to try using \u0022:NEEDS[ModNameHere]\u0022 with modulemanager in your config to check for those mods exist first to avoid any mesh or texture issues."},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:55:51Z","Content":"Thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:56:47Z","Content":"Ven\u0027s right."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:42:20Z","Content":"My Universal Storage science parts use this config:\n\n    MODEL{\tmodel = UniversalStorage/Parts/US_1M110_Wedge_ScienceBay/model}MODEL{\tmodel = DMagicOrbitalScience/UniversalStorage/USScope/modelScope\tparent = UniversalStorage/Parts/US_1M110_Wedge_ScienceBay/model\trotation = 0, 180, 0\ttexture = Scope_DIFF, DMagicOrbitalScience/ProbeScience/Scope/Scope_DIFF\ttexture = Scope_NRM, DMagicOrbitalScience/ProbeScience/Scope/Scope_NRM}\n\nThey will continue to load just fine without US installed. They are missing the exterior mesh (and they don\u0027t work because the plugin assumes that the mesh and its animations are present), but they will get loaded and can be used in the editor. I set them as unresearchable and their editor category as none by default and use MM to activate them. But this way they won\u0027t necessarily break existing vessels if you delete US (or more realistically if you move US to the wrong place or delete the US science bay part only).\n\nEdit: Yep, here is half of my US telescope:\n\n![mU1eDNg.png](http://i.imgur.com/mU1eDNg.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T19:49:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**"}]}
