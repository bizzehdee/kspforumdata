Hopefully it\u0027s possible to delete other planets and edit Kerbol to make it more like the Sun.

Escape velocities for our solar system are about four times higher than what we have in KSP. For example, earth\u0027s escape velocity is 11.1km/s... That\u0027s incredibly high, so try simply imagining the KSP rocket you would need to have to escape Earth in KSP. And you\u0027re far from being in orbit around another body, you\u0027re just out of Earth\u0027s SOI. Then there\u0027s the time factor that\u0027s ridiculous. An Eeloo transfer in the game takes about 200days? Maybe less I\u0027m not sure. But let\u0027s say it\u0027s 200 days just for it. That means at full warp speed, you have to warp for three full minutes before entering it\u0027s SOI. But then if you go to Earth, an Earth/Pluto transfer takes about 10 years, considering the New Horizons probe. Ten years at full warp speed would take you 53 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, the solar system is on a scale way out of KSP :l If someone was to ever make a replica of the solar system, it would need to be scaled down. As much as I would love it, 1:1 scale is totally impracticable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there are games that would let you do something like that. If you want to explore the solar system and such, I recommend you try Universe Sandbox, Space Engine or Celestia.
