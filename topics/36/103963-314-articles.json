Because I have no such artifacts in KSP 1.3/1.3.1 with Scatterer 0.0275 and 6.4x rescale.\n\n0.275 was last version before 0.0300 - since than Scattere became less friendly to rescaled Kerbin.\n\nYou can clearly see that planet surface is not clipped, but the scatterer effect is not drawn, something limiting (config or hardcoded limit?) it\u0027s range\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/oKF67EnAkRPPeMjm8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oKF67EnAkRPPeMjm8)\n\n![SY3gLqv.png](https://i.imgur.com/SY3gLqv.png)\n\nmore of those: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/ibTkrjipumj9hWSu6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ibTkrjipumj9hWSu6)\n\nHello [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) ! You are my only hope to upgrade my KSP install from 1.3 / 1.3.1\n\nThe only thing that stops me from doing so -  scatterer.  I cannot live without it, and with scatterer...  Each ascent to orbit is breathtaking. Literally never gets old. \n\nAlso I\u0027ve pushed up a little bit size of len\u0027s flare to make that blinding, hardlight effect - like this\n\n![JbvqlAv.png](https://i.imgur.com/JbvqlAv.png)\n\nAnd 6.4x rescale. Once I tried more or less proper scaling, I just don\u0027t want to go back to building tiny toy rockets pushing tons of payloads to orbit of tiny, tiny Kerbin.\n\nO\u0027k those are actually two things. But together it\u0027s gorgeous. Just look at those screenshots (more than 500 photos):\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/Wuv3yeAHzdGDq8P17](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Wuv3yeAHzdGDq8P17)\n\nThere\u0027s was a little bit of aliasing on atmosphere edge, but then I added quite soft KS3P config on top of it - with additional antialiasing and some blur - 0.0275 looks amazing...\n\nSpoiler\n\n![eS12jbd.png](https://i.imgur.com/eS12jbd.png)\n\n![kiEsSb1.png](https://i.imgur.com/kiEsSb1.png)\n\n![4oVLl0i.png](https://i.imgur.com/4oVLl0i.png)\n\n![5kz8N1i.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kz8N1i.png)\n\nLast photo without KS3P, but it looks gorgeous still. Atmoshere is 100 km exactly and no major artifacts in low (80-160 km) orbits. After 160 km scaled space kicks in and everything is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately post 1.3.1 versions are different story...\n\nSo, [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/), what I\u0027m trying to say - You have done outstanding job already, but I want to kindly ask you for all rescale fans here - may be something can be done to make things look like the did back in 0.0275?\n\nIf 0.0275 can be straight ported to 1.6.1 - I\u0027ll be happy already. But if you can make adjustments in 0.0540 or expose some configs to solve the problem with scaled worlds - it will be wonderful, more than I can dream of.\n\nI can provide you with packed gamedata folder with assembled 6.4x recale for 1.6.1 - just fire up good old Kerbal X rocket - it\u0027s orbit capable even in 6.4x. Or I can test things for this noble cause.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-30T18:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2019 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by evileye.x**"},{"CreatedByName":"PyjackMeat","CreatedById":72085,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-31T03:51:52Z","Content":"How do I make the sunflare of another star, like Grannus, show up?

This is a 3.2x rescale on a clean install with only scatterer and the mods needed for rescaling (Kopernicus/Sigma/Rescale etc.).\n\n![wNSQ70Y.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wNSQ70Y.jpg)\n\nSome things I noticed:\n\n- Judging from the others\u0027 screenshots, it gets progressively worse with larger rescales.\n- It is most noticeable in spots where mountains are on the horizon, and less in flat areas. It looks like it occurs around or in front of the outlines of mountains where they protrude above the spherical horizon.\n- Also most noticeable at high altitude just before the transition to scaled space. I don\u0027t see it once in scaled space.\n\nThe second issue I found is hopefully simpler, which is that changes to \u0027Post Processing Alpha\u0027 aren\u0027t reflected in scaled space. To reproduce:\n\n- Put a craft in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n- Alt-F11 and set Post Processing Alpha to 2.\n- Zoom out with the camera until it transitions to scaled space. You should see a hard transition where the appearance of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere changes back to what it would be if Post Processing Alpha were equal to 1. Here\u0027s the transition:\n\n![lIz0eJx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lIz0eJx.jpg)\n\n![vEIplZ7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vEIplZ7.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-04T09:42:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2019 09:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by BadOaks**"}]}
