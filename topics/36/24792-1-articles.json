Please seriously take no offense to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you\u0027re not going to simulate ships breaking up; which you can\u0027t under the current physics model, you also don\u0027t particularly need much of what he has already, the benefit of the Sunbeam destructive lazor is that it effects specific parts, makes them overheat and explode themselves as an exploitation of the physics. This allows you to pinpoint blow up random debris or if you\u0027re really good pick parts off of a ship with minimum collateral damage. You want a swath of destruction, given this kind of cannon nothing short of an active sufficiently powerful EM shield would prevent the utter destruction of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027re aware of the 2.5Km physics range, which can through Lazor mod be extended to 97.5Km, past this distance the object is referred to as \u0022on rails\u0022; the big problem that you\u0027re going to run into with anything more than an effective pinpoint beam is that beyond another specific distance that I don\u0027t have on hand at the moment the vehicle is on rails And \u0022Packed\u0022, when a vessel is packed, it exists as a single point of information linked to a stored format of the ship\u0027s composition and structure. if you\u0027re projecting a ray from point A, the barrel of your cannon, to point B, the packed target, no problem. In that situation the beam is purely visual, you\u0027ve selected a single target and you\u0027re dealing with it outside physics. Once you give the beam width and the ability to hit multiple things, now you\u0027re going to have to make mechanical concessions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill the beam only destroy ships who\u0027s packed points exist within the beam? That shouldn\u0027t be too hard to calculate but it\u0027s possible to have some pretty damn massive ships that would seem to dodge the beam simply because their point was outside the beam, even if a large portion of the ship wasn\u0027t. Are you going to try and force unpack ships near the beam to figure this out? that\u0027s going to be hard, maybe even impractical. And like I said, these things that are well outside the physics sphere and even outside the unpack distance, there is zero possibility that you will be able to modify the object, if you try to shot a rather large space station 400km away, and hit; you have two choices. It\u0027s all gone, or it\u0027s all still there, even if the ship you\u0027re shooting is substantially larger than the beam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be particularly hard to delete an object in space once you\u0027ve identified your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimistically, this sounds like great fun and I\u0027d love to play around with it, pessimistically I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to get around these limitations without compromising the feel you want.

Pointing the thing is definitely going to be your biggest functional trouble, if you rely on the specific orientation of the barrel to determine where it fires it\u0027s going to be nearly impossible to hit anything at a decent range, things wobble too much no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to mess around with it now, to a limited extent, it\u0027s very easy to add resources to the game, you would want to add ion charge and heat, then make your barrel a Generator type part (look at some mod power sources) that consumes ion charge rapidly to produce heat, with some particle effect shooting out the end if you can, may have to make it an engine to do that. Then make your cooling fin into a generator that consumes heat to do something. It won\u0027t actually shoot but you can put the thing together in game and see how that feels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DIGI_Byte","CreatedById":62387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T00:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid some drawings on my tablet, rough sketches and basic math\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tmaluqwuhtu5epo/2013-05-08%2009.56.31.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/s/k8chjpjxi1c0ukm/2013-05-08%2009.56.44.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/s/u065cut5bwin2wf/2013-05-08%2009.57.52.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ub5oqbrl5lpqlqn/2013-05-08%2009.57.02.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qw9sx0jxlmykz24/2013-05-08%2009.57.28.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImage 5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ve worked it out that it would take 4.15 units of heat per hour, or 0.83 heat per min that the vents would dissipate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECannon cannot fire if its heated, and cannot start the cooling cycle while its charging, so if you hit fire, before cooling, you cannot cool it down, which would result in explosions\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-08T02:52:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2013 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DIGI_Byte\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Katalliaan","CreatedById":12399,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T00:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose pictures 403 (insufficient permissions) DIGI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DIGI_Byte","CreatedById":62387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T02:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed images, problem was the wrong URL share link\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprobably hard to read the writing for the accuracy calculations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E but the lower the better, the example i used in that image was for 200km with 3 barrels have a 6% chance of miss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith 1 barrel was a 20% chance of miss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe formula works as follows \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echance of miss =\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Distance/Number of Barrels)/10)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor the display of 1.000 the number is simply /100 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if the numbers are the right way around but you would add the angle difference to the chance of miss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elike so,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Distance/Number of Barrels)/10) \u002B ((Target angle Vector - Ion tip Rotation)/distance)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T00:11:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DIGI_Byte\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DIGI_Byte","CreatedById":62387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T00:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow do you learn to code?
