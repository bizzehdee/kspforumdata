I have a tempature increasing every frame by a bit in a function which runs every frame by the if-statement in the onUpdate() function. For some reason the onUpdate isn\u0027t called even once after I load it to the editor. Also, I would like to see how I could make it not explode in the editor, which it would probably do if I would get this working. Also it should use 1 Electric matter and 20 Antimatter every second. HOW DO I DO THAT. HELP. SOrry if this post contains bad English. I\u0027m not really good at that."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T14:42:58Z","Content":"Locking this duplicate, see original thread [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125195-Help%21-Update%28%29-doesen-t-work%21)."}]}
