I want the tech tree of my mod to be about double the size of the stock kerbal tech tree. My Tech Tree will also come AFTER the Kerbals stock (which means the tech tree will be 3x the size it is now all together). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it\u0027ll work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Contracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mod starts and ends with the Contracts. Once you complete the full tech tree in Kerbal, you will begin to have the chance of taking on special Contracts. The main point of these contracts is for \u0022Futuristic Science\u0022 points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will still get currency from these Contracts, but not as much. This means you have to balance out the normal contracts and the special Futuristic ones which will net you a new form of currency \u0022Future Points\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Contracts can range from all types of things, but they will be difficult to accomplish at first and take quite a long time to accomplish. For instance a contract could be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract Example: \u0022Extensive Laser Research In Lower Gravity Environments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must land two science Labs fully staffed on x planet, and have it running consistently for x amount of years, and then bring the special report you\u0027ll recieve back to Kerbal. If you beam it back, you\u0027ll recieve half of the reward, if you successfully bring it back with a Kerbal, you\u0027ll receive the full reward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract Example: \u0022Extensive Research of the effects of continued radiation in a high intensity environment\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a probe orbit between the sun and the nearest planet, with the Science Lab doors open for 2 kerbal years. Beaming back the Report will generate Future Science depending on the strength of the tele-com used. If you are able to bring the report all the way back to kerbal, you will recieve 3x the Future Points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Tech Tree\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tech Tree after the stock Kerbal one, would require \u0022Future Science Points\u0022 AND normal science points too unlock. I may break up the Tech Tree to focus on specific equipment and Tech, and have specific Contracts giving Specific Tech points towards it. So a Contact could give \u0022Future Booster Science Tech\u0022 points, and any tech on the Tech Tree that requires that type of Science Tech can be used to unlock it. This would allow you too focus more on what you\u0027d want as well. (Though I may not do the specific Tech unless it seems to be a big thing people want). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Progression would be slow with leaps and bounds like it is in Kerbal, and real life as well. There may be stand points where your waiting for that tech contracts to finish, but then you may get a big boost of tech and unlock 2-3 things at once. Regardless it will take a long time to fully unlock everything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Tech Itself\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what it all comes down too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tech will progress as I said above, evenly. There will be no huge leaps in ability, but it will feel as though you\u0027re truly breaking through the Ice and into that Futuristic Era. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tech will consist of everything which is already in the game \u002B things that other mods add (with permission from them of course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA the start you\u0027ll only unlock a little better engines, slightly better/bigger thrusters, and ship components. Slightly bigger/better Command Modules, etc. etc. etc. However, once everything is unlocked much, much......MUCH farther down the line, you\u0027ll end up being able to build huge Star Ships, similar to the Star Wars Star Destroyers(hence the mod name). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will eventually be able to build massive futuristic ships that are able too take off horizontally like a Star Destroyer, enter the atmosphere, and then engage the main engines and shoot off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will also be able to unlock large amounts of new modules for planetary bases, and space stations, so you can truly make it something like a futuristic era would be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an idea too also incorporate \u0022Alien\u0022 like technology. Simply one of the theories behind flying discs, is that they use our planets electric, and magnetic fields to travel. Basically the planet itself powers the ship with its natural elements that the ship taps into. This could be a whole different branch on the Tech Tree, and at first you would unlock prototype parts that can barely get to the edge of space, then you\u0027d slowly unlock parts that could go into orbit, but wouldn\u0027t draw on enough power to keep going. At this stage you\u0027d need a \u0022mother ship\u0022 to transport it between planets, before un docking it and exploring that planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would eventually get to the point where the flying disk could go anywhere in the solar system by itself, but not out of the solar system ever. If/when people or the devs add more solar systems to explore, this could add a really fun spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine all that awesome tech in between? I plan for a lot of progression, and a lot of new modules and enhanced additions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Over All Goal\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Over All Goal is simple. To simulate, and make it feel as though your research, and hard work in the science field is really pushing the little Kerbals into a futuristic era of space flight. With the combination of \u0022Future Tech\u0022 High grade, advanced, and futuristic feel of new Contracts, and the slow but steady flow of more powerful components, and new components as you push the boundary into the new tech tree opening the game up to you and your imagination combing it all together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod would also enhance many mods already out there, such as the mods which add food/resources required for kerbals. With this mod, being able too build larger transport ships, would allow for larger bases to be created. With faster and more powerful engines, would also save the trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod which allows you to essentially build in space or planets, allowing for a much larger ship to be built, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Solar System(s)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to a helpful tip I was told about the PlanetFactory, essentially letting you create your own solar systems, etc. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now plan too also create a new Solar System (or 2) too compliment my mod. What fun would being able to go out of the Solar System if you couldn\u0027t actually go anywhere? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbes? What are those?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes in Kerbal right now are just about useless unless you\u0027re doing a role-playing style play to the campaign. I also plan and aim to add probe core modules, and more mechanics to probes. My over all goal is to make it, while coupled with other mods which also enhance probes, to feel much more realistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add new scientific equipment that will work or be enhanced when used with a probe. When sent too the planet, it will feed back data, such as the gravitational pull of the planet or moon. If the probe goes into the upper atmosphere (if there is any), It will also give you details of the terrain type, and if there is an atmosphere or not. (if you have the right equipment on it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something which is done before sending a rocket, as the data you collect you will be able to go back too and look at, allowing you to have a better understanding of the situation your kerbals will be getting themselves into, and how powerful the different parts of your ship will need to be to make it safely back to kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen/If the devs add weather effects and wind, it will also generate a report on the weather conditions (if any). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will give probes a realistic, and valuable commodity to your space faring fleet, other than just a fancy looking hunk of kerbal metal floating around in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeed Back\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though I fully plan on creating this mod, and I fully plan to execute it after the Contracts are released, etc. I am looking for any feedback regarding possible contracts, missions, components, parts, modules, etc. etc. etc. etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny Idea\u0027s, help, assistance, or support is more than welcome, as as you can tell, I probably bit off way more than I can chew, and won\u0027t be able to do it all alone forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know what you guys think about the mod, and any thoughts/Questions you may have.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T11:53:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 11:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T17:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E78 views and no comments D:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T17:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDibs on the Death Star....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.calbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/deathstar1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022deathstar1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T17:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould also move this to add on development.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy4422","CreatedById":27157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T18:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022frizzank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022frizzank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould also move this to add on development.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, moved\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T18:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif it had similar functionality to B9, KW, KAS, etc etc, then it would be quite interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T19:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E78 views and no comments D:\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I wouldn\u0027t be too concerned just yet, milady, give us a bit to let it sink in. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you\u0027ve got a very comprehensive plan.
