A prosperous future where Kerbals reside in private orbital habitats, fly Klingon Birds of Prey to work, and shop at Wal-Marts in low orbit!\n\nWhile curious cats pounce between star systems in search of space tuna and galactic yarn in their very own Kitty Space Program.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfS-PGsKS_E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAnd, I, having for the past few months contributed to functional areas of the mod such as space cats, IVA pillows, and some aesthetics of space supermarkets, now have permission to serve as his chronicler and resident cat consultant.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Project 1: Spaceliner**\n\n![C0C003AB1334D4A5C3CDAEA203F529CB8CD782F1](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711906876051786694/C0C003AB1334D4A5C3CDAEA203F529CB8CD782F1/)\n\nTim\u0027s first foray into the world of 3D modelling features the Banyan House luxury space residence and Eden geodesic resort dome in the spirit of Silent Running, complete with space lagoon and a bar!\n\nTo maintain the prodigious upkeep of a luxury space station, a Maersk Interstellar cargo hauler command section, and luxury passenger spacecraft from the far-off Kushan Empire are also provided. Some time later, Tim then released models of two Klingon-derived Birds of Prey, one following the original design from Star Trek, and another \u0022luxury\u0022 version made more comfortable by local Kerbin shipyards. It also has iPads on the command chairs! All are included in the below link plus the one and only six-star resort with integrated space pool and bar to ever take to the skies!\n\nUpdate 3 May 2015:\n\nThe **Walmart Space Supermarket** is now part of the Spaceliner pack!\n\n**\u003E\u003E** \n[**Download Project 1: Spaceliner**](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/228806-spaceliner) **\u003C\u003C**\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Project 2: Meow Lander**\n\n![eJhAtz5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eJhAtz5.jpg)\n\nIt is said that humans (and Kerbals) don\u0027t actually own cats. The cat is the true master of all humanity. \n\nIn the far future, humans (and Kerbals alike) made a terrible mistake of granting their pets intelligence comparable to their own by way of cybernetic implants. As shown in the\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfS-PGsKS_E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n to this thread, this allowed cats to basically, take over the KSC with absolutely adorable results.\nI mean, look at them! Intrepid feline explorers bravely setting course into the final frontier, seeking out space tuna and unraveling the secrets of intergalactic yarn... aww how adorable!\n\n**\u003E\u003E** \n[**Download Project 2: Meow Lander \u0026 Scout Cat**](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/229570-the-meow-lander) **\u003C\u003C**\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Project 3: Walmart Space Supercenter**\n\n![D20C0D9F174E4AE396EBF0685CA59B6DDE25D36C](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/719791555840651078/D20C0D9F174E4AE396EBF0685CA59B6DDE25D36C/)\n\n![BE6415CFD58AFC28A3F0DFFFA308CED523025918](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/719791555837526104/BE6415CFD58AFC28A3F0DFFFA308CED523025918/)\n\n**Spaceship parking is 10,000 kash per entry!** \n\n![B44D25799124D11C288E02BC6A47D9C74B4B1A55](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/719791555837524758/B44D25799124D11C288E02BC6A47D9C74B4B1A55/)\n\n**For all your space shopping needs!

This will be corrected in a later release.  \n[\\*=left]Newer models will feature progressively higher quality models and textures. Please be patient as Tim is learning 3D modelling as he goes! But considering how well the Kitty Space Program videos are turning out, I appreciate the sheer number of toys Tim is producing at a rate that can only be described as .... awesome!  \n[\\*=left]Cats have infiltrated KSP.
