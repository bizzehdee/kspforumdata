I\u0027m having a problem though, in that I cannot stick any items to the bottom of this booster. Is there something special that I need to do so that I can stack radial decouplers onto the booster?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you!\n\nAdam"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T12:46:10Z","Content":"could we see your config file? and maybe a pic or too?

Enabling the thing in the debug console removes this feature, to make the game function like pre-1.0. The node definition values are as following: first three numbers are location, second three are orientation, last one is size. To fix the problem permanently, as lo-fi implied, change the three orientation numbers to their negative counterparts for the node\\_stack\\_bottom, one at a time. In other words, make the line read \u0022node\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -0.45, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1\u0022. Test it. If it still doesn\u0027t work get back to us.\n\nAs for auto-fairing, I have no idea, never made an engine before, or dug into the configs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:27:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gkorgood**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T14:29:53Z","Content":"KSP now cares about the direction a node is in, and won\u0027t allow you to attach another part the \u0022wrong way\u0022 unless you turn on that cheat option.
