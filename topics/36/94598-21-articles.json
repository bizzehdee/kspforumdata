None of the other engine in KSP are \u0022experimental\u0022 (INCLUDING the NERVA- which was actually tested and tested and refined until it was flight-ready with 1960\u0027s technology), and I don\u0027t see \u0022experimental\u0022 engines as having ANY place in a space program simulation game like KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETimelines-\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E In order to add \u0022experimental\u0022 and \u0022normal\u0022 versions of the KSP-Interstellar fission reactors, you proposed moving the versions with real-life specs (similar to the Timberwind or current Molten Salt Reactor designs) to later tech nodes. However, I don\u0027t think you get just how incongruous this would be with real rocketry timelines, or those in KSP. We had the NERVA engine *even before* we had the Saturn V rocket, to the point where NERVA was proposed for use as the Saturn V\u0027s upper-stage engines. We also had the Timberwind engine designs long before Space Launch System was even a twinkle in an engineer\u0027s eyes (in fact, the program had already been shut down before SLS was even conceived). Yet, you want to move the Timberwind-like engines to an even later tech tier than SLS engines? I don\u0027t think you realize just how incredibly unrealistic that would be. It would also eliminate the consideration of the engines for many mission-plans that they might otherwise be considered for, such as an early manned Duna mission- most players running FAR probably won\u0027t try such a mission until they at least have SLS-sized parts, but will probably be impatient to get out of the Kerbin system by that point, and unwilling to wait for Timberwind-style engines if they occur at an even later tech node...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EBalance-\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E The very thing you are striving for would, in my humble opinion, be completely ruined by introducing an additional tier of \u0022experimental\u0022 nuclear engines/reactors before the Timberwind-style engine/reactor tier... Why? Because a balanced part has to have some actual USE in a game- and already Timberwind-style reactors are far more worthless than I think you realize. Not only do they produce relatively little Thrust for their mass, and have very large overall mass- thus REQUIRING a player to use them on very large spacecraft for them to even be efficient, they ALSO are *EXTREMELY* expensive compared to chemical engines. When Funds are as tight as they already are in KSP, it doesn\u0027t make sense to splurge on a nuclear reactor for a mission when it would be MUCH cheaper just to send up a larger spacecraft with more empty fuel tanks and fuel up a larger all-chemical rocket in-orbit... And PLEASE don\u0027t suggest the \u0022experimental\u0022 reactors be cheaper than the standard ones- not only is this blatantly unrealistic (prototypes are ALWAYS more expensive in real life), it would also completely eliminate the utility of the standard reactors, causing cost-conscious players to just launch the \u0022experimental\u0022 versions all the time, which completely defeats the purpose of their only being \u0022experimental\u0022 if they become the most-used version...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you didn\u0027t fully understand why I want to split up the sensan into a 2 seperate families. It\u0027s because it would allow me to balance them fulfill different functions! The Particle Bed reactors would be \u0022realsiticly\u0022 balanced as a \u0022Nuclear Tractor\u0022 with the highest TWR (by drastically lowering the reactors weight) The Dusty plasma reactor on the other-hand will specialize as a \u0022nuclear economy car\u0022 with the highest ISP (by using magnetic noozles) but also with the lowest TWR. As you you see , they are the complete opposite of each other! This I why I needed to split them up, it doesn\u0027t make sense that a maximum nuclear engine with TWR would turn into the rocket engine with lowest TWR, they fulfill separate functions, which are both intrinsically valuable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u0022experimental\u0022 is just a word I used to differentiate the \u0022initial\u0022 version with \u0022upgraded\u0022 version. In the game they are both called Particle Bed, where the first has the postfix Mk1 and the upgraded version Mk2. Initially I wanted to make all Particle Bed upgrade with \u0022High Energy Nuclear Reactor\u0022, but beside technical reasons, your \u0022historical\u0022 arguments gives me another reason to split them up in small Particle Beds (0.625, 1.25, 1.875) and large particle beds (2.5m,, 3.75m, 5m). The smaller versions will be introduced earlier (with nuclear power), but also can upgrade earlier (when the larger particle beds become available). This means it it would only require 550 science instead of 1550 science to to experience the full power of the Particle Beds with high TWR. I also have an idea of about giving the Particle Beds a configuration option to increase trust further at the expanse if ISP. The engine \u0022Trust Limiter\u0022 could be used to modify the engine core heat, thereby reducing the ISP and increasing Thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T08:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 08:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T08:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt only requires 300 Science to unlock \u0022Nuclear Propulsion\u0022 in the stock or original KSP-Interstellar tech tree. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhich is the tier it *SHOULD* be in\u003C/strong\u003E, because by that point players already are messing around with SLS engines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*ALL* first-generation fission reactors should be available at this point, as a LARGER than SLS-sized (8.7 meter) Timberwind Reactor/Engine was actually designed BEFORE anyone ever thought of SLS (which was 8.4 meters).

I guess you have never seen it working but it offers high ISP (8000\u002B) at a thrust about 3 times as high as you would using Electric Engine (powered by the reactor). This is exist KSPI functionality, you only need to add a Charged particle store to make it function.

The energy-density of Uranium is also actually higher that Deuterium/Tritium on a liter-for-liter basis, as Uranium is MUCH heavier than D/T (which are Hydrogen isotopes), so that\u0027s an advantage as well- it\u0027s MUCH easier to store a 10-year supply of uranium than D/T on a spacecraft (although at the cost of greatly reduced mass-efficiency for fission compared to fusion). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I can see some justification for making Dusty Plasma Reactors available earlier than Fusion Reactors. What I CANNOT see a justification for is making larger (2.5 and 3.75 meter) Fission Reactors available later than their smaller counterparts, or splitting up Particle Bed and Dusty Plasma into two separate reactor lines (Dusty Plasma Reactors are and should be strictly superior to Particle Bed Reactors, as they produce more Thermal Power at a higher mass-efficiency, have a higher core temperature, AND produce Charged Particles... \u003Cstrong\u003EDusty Plasma reactors are an UPGRADE to Particle Bed technology, and are actually fundamentally refined versions of the same thing, not an alternative.)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see changing the tech node, but the capabilities should NOT change.

Buffing the second-generation Fission reactors should create a more realistic balance between them and the first-generation Fusion reactors (which are currently too good/powerful in comparison) while also creating more leeway for the current first-generation Fission reactors to fulfill realistic roles without impinging on the territory of the second-gen models...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince most of this second-gen stuff is theoretical, unlike Particle Bed or Molten Salt Reactors, it will be harder for me to get you good sources on the expected performance specs. There are a few studies that have looked at what could theoretically be accomplished with Gas Core/ Dusty Plasma Reactors, etc., though- so those will be my starting point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will need to increase the ThermalPower of the second-gen fission reactors if we increase the ISP merely not to see the Thrust go down with the current equation. Which is fine, because the current ThermalPower numbers for the second-gen fission are \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E too low...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, second-gen reactors with even higher TWR *AND* Vacuum ISP values only create even more urgency for fixing the atmospheric thrust code.
