Terramax\u0027s delayed entrance into the aerospace market was due the company management cautiously observing and quietly learning from the often-hilarious failures of Kerbal Motion\u0027s products, before adapting their existing tried-and-tested products to take Kerbin by storm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe innovative repulsor units recently offered by Terramax were originally developed by a group of students and researchers at a local university, and whose start-up company was offered for sale in order to raise funds for commercialisation.
