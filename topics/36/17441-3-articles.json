Its more than possible, i think. In theory, you could build your own tower, using pieces or components, like you seen on apollo\u0027s red tower, each one will be pretty big (because of optimization and for reducing possible lags) with ladders and surfaces to walk on. The plan is what you starting you rocket\u0027s design from crawler, then add special launch platform on top, then build tower on this platform, and at last - a spacecraft to launch. So all this construction could easily drive over space center and parks whatever you need it for launch (of course, on very low speed to prevent crushing). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter parking you can remove crawler or just leave it there. And then you start another flight as bus, filled with crazy kerbanauts or passengers (if you build passenger-like shuttle or rocket) and drive them to the tower, board into ship, remove tower\u0027s boarding parts using servo plugin, and finally launch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is general plan.

For example, you could build different-sized shuttles (like modern passenger planes) with small or standart, or extented cargobay, or winout cargobay but mega-fuel tank instead. Even baby-shuttle (as i call it) with only cabin, small hull and wings. Or you want me to stop doing all this and make just 5-8 standart-replica looking parts? In that case it would be similar to CSS shuttle, so thats mean what there is no longer any reason for me to make this project and i can switch back to WoT sounds mods development, because wot fans want me very bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-12T20:36:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2012 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by quadro7f\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alex6511","CreatedById":35304,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T21:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf performance really becomes an issue couldn\u0027t you release a version thats either one part like he suggested or with even more reduced polygons?
