Heck, even make the description for the white dwarf, Blance, this:\n\n\u0022This white dwarf star has several bodies orbiting around it, including one small planet and a lot of asteroids and comets. This leads us to speculating that one of the previous planets was destroyed, and that one was lucky enough to survive. It was originally called KD 61, but we christened it Blance, as it is the Kerbal god of anomalies, bu not chaos.\u0022\n\nGranted, they only found remnants, but this is KSP, you can do whatever you want, just the way you like it.\n\nSeriously, here\u0027s the [article](http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/water-rich-rocky-planets-remnants-orbit-a-white-dwarf-star/), and make sure that whenever you make extrasolar systems you model them after real or imaginary ones (I had a crack with the HD101 system, it was a test, but we will leave it in there as more of an easter egg)."},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T20:37:35Z","Content":"Anyone there?
