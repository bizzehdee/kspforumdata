I haven\u0027t actually used this mod in a while, but I use KIS frequently and I was the one who suggested using KiS specifically for attaching the truss parts, so I *think* this should work.\n\n To do this, first make sure you put a power tool, which KIS includes and will be in its own tag on the part list, in the mk3 pod\u0027s inventory, which is also from KIS, and is found by right clicking the pod in the VAB, under inventory. \n\nThen take S0 up as you did and sit the craft where you were trying to dock in your video. Then, EVA **an engineer kerbal**, right click him/her and select their inventory and then the pod\u0027s inventory, and drag the power tool into the kerbals inventory. Right click the tool and select \u0027equip\u0027, and it will appear in their hand. Then move the kerbal next to the Z1, switch to the pod with S0 attached, and make sure that it is still. Then undock it from S0, leaving S0 by itself. It shouldn\u0027t move too much hopefully. \n\nNext go back to the EVA kerbal, hold G and left click S0, it should show up green. You will then be holding the S0 similar to doing so in the VAB; bear in mind that you will have a green hologram kind of second version which is what you place, while the actual part will remain floating by itself. You can use the R key to change between which node you or attaching by or a surface attach mode; you will need to press R once or twice to get the right node.
