But I did copy the dimensions from a google sketchup model (easy to find yourself), although the geometry is made from scratch. It would seem easier to just port the model, but the geometry was simply inefficient, what you see here is a unique geometry configuration that could have only been generated by making the model from scratch, not to mention custom texturing. However, I can still give the author of the original model credit for the measurements on release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is a real NASA concept. I don\u0027t see how it would be any more of an issue than someone making a model of the space shuttle or apollo. I think you\u0027re being overly dramatic but if you find evidence to the contrary, let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent is its real world intent, a mars mission....in our case, duna. so its intent is to be an all in one ship with enough fuel and RCS for a LKO to duna and back mission based on its final weight. obviously this can be used in other places if towed there by other parts. It will still require you to get into orbit with other parts before you would want to travel anywhere else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe static dish, may have some science transmission potential. It\u0027s actually a pretty nice dish part on its own, and I think I can make it just as transparent in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t decided whether to break it up into individual parts, or contain it whole as one or two single parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E judging by the concept of NASA\u0027s design, this vessel has 3 stages at most, and most likely only 2 stages. My guess is the whole vessel is propelled to mars and and back in a single stage, while the upper stage detaches from the bottom stage to travel to the planet and return, where it would re-dock and continue back to earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with the plethora of alternative command modules, it may be prudent to allow people to use their own, however things like that would break the design scheme and the ship would have to be split up into several different parts with their own function in order to do that. basically, assembly of the entire stack would be required in game and that\u0027s a bit of work, not to mention having to look for each part. so it would seem simpler to either split it up into less parts or keep it as a single whole part wherever possible. I don\u0027t think people need another plain fuel tank or a simple all black decoupler sitting in their parts folder. at the very least, the engine will be separate from the rest of the vessel, and possibly the command pod too. But you\u0027ve got to consider the design, for example the long humps along the front, would have to come apart from the command pod is that was its own part. that means you\u0027d have to add them manually. I\u0027m not sure of what their actual function would be in the concept version as it\u0027s not explained. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could imagine someone slapping some wings and radial tanks on this thing, making a decent looking space plane.

If you read the details, it can propel itself in a number of ways. for 250 million, the fuel costs of this antimatter ship would be a bargain. technically, such a ship in real life could use various types of propellants, albeit with differing efficiencies. of course this thing doesn\u0027t exist yet -- but it could. in real life it would most likely act under the same principles as a nuclear rocket. of course, it all relies on a refined and increased production of positrons. that\u0027s only underdeveloped because the lack of development in production. but the reduction of tons upon tons of weight into just mere grams, is where most of the gains are.
