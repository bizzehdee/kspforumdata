You have a huge amount of thermal mass in those tanks, meaning it takes the radiators a long time to cool them down to minimum temperature (273 K), during which they will operate at full throughput (and thus get red-hot). Also, air temperature on the launchpad is 311 K, and it will keep seeping warmth into all of those tanks with their giant surfaces all the time.\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the radiators do not explode, I see nothing wrong with your observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to check for heat that comes out of nowhere, take a small part with low thermal mass, for example a probe core.
