Again, thanks to a.g. for his invaluable assistance. The main additions for this version are the vectors, an the ability to lock window positions so you don\u0027t drag them around accidentally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FPV currently mimics the behavior of the NavBall\u0027s, so it changes from surface velocity to orbital velocity and target relative velocity when the NavBall does. The target and node markers do not look the same, however. The target indicator is a square, and anti-target is a square with most of an X drawn through it. The maneuver node indicator is a diamond, and the anti-maneuver node marker is a diamond with an X through it. The main limitation of the indicators for now is the rather limited field of view of the HUD. It is harder to stumble upon them than with the NavBall for now. In the stable release, however, I will have them clamped to the edge of the HUD so you can steer towards them. As usual, just unzip into your GameData directory.

Version 1.3 Beta 2 adds several improvements, most notably to the HUD. The pitch ladder now clamps to it\u0027s section of the HUD, and will not overwrite the speed/altitude tapes. The FPV and other markers also clamp to the pitch ladder much better. In the spirit of 0.22, the HUD is disabled until you research Electronics. The other gauges are available from the beginning. There is also a new \u0022Vertical Ascent\u0022 mode that you should notice the next time you launch a rocket. This allows much better control at attitudes above 70 degrees. Additionally, Orbital mode is now available. When a vessel is in a stable orbit, the HUD changes to a relative indication of your velocity. In other words, the pitch ladder and compass now represent how far the ship\u0027s nose is from the FPV. To burn prograde, just set 0 pitch and heading 0. To burn retrograde set the heading to 180. This mode can be disabled through the advanced menu. And the final addition is mouse input for fine control. Also enabled through the advanced menu, you can click in the center of the HUD and drag to make fine attitude adjustments.
