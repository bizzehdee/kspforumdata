For my space stations I standardize on the standard size clamp-o-tron for transient traffic connections. I only use senior size connections for things that don\u0027t come apart often. With a Mk3 based vessel I don\u0027t really have a good solution that\u0027s streamlined unless I\u0027m using the stock Mk3 cockpit with a docking port on it\u0027s nose. I envision a short part with sliding doors, so you don\u0027t have clearance problems with clam shell and the docking port extends to slightly clear of the outer mold line of the part. Use some of the excess volume for Monoprop tankage.\n\nAnother would be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack or even just a structural fairing to fill in the shoulders of the PPD-27 XL Cupola Cockpit to smoothly fair it into a 3.75 part. I actually have more use of this part as a 3.75m command pod than just a Mk3 part, but it doesn\u0027t fit as clean as I\u0027d like. As a minimum, just a little filler part to fit the sides to clean up the transition. Even better would be a thin Mk3 adapter the thickness of the decoupler or probe core with the side fairings coming forward on either side of the mk3 part. \n\n![j6Rab15.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/j6Rab15.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ihniman1","CreatedById":198389,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-22T20:57:18Z","Content":"Would it be possible to add speed readouts to the inline command bridge?

The mk3 CLEAVER and mk2 scramjets make a good pairing for a fuel-efficient 3 phase ascent with JNSQ: 1) CLEAVER airbreathing climb and accelerate to 1300 m/s; 2) Scramjets to further accelerate through 3000 m/s; 3) CLEAVER closed-cycle as scramjets flame out around 38km\n\nThe late part of the scramjet phase often causes the CLEAVER to overheat due to drag. The CLEAVER is shielded behind a mk3 stack but aiming just a little nose-high causes overheating even though it looks like the engine is not sticking into the airstream. I wonder if the CLEAVER has a misplaced drag cube or other aerodynamic problem.\n\nPossibilities include:\n\n*No change.* That\u0027s valid since the overheating only happens with mods that rescale Kerbin and increase minimum orbital speed.\n\n*Examine the CLEAVER\u0027s aerodynamics.* Even at 10 degrees nose high the CLEAVER looks like it\u0027s shielded from the airstream but it\u0027s definitely heating from drag. I can help with testing; I have zero experience with drag cubes but am willing to learn.\n\n*Boost the heat tolerance.* This would be the easy fix (and is the one I adopted in my install). You might not want to do that with your mod if you consider overheating risk to be part of the CLEAVER\u0027s game balance.\n\nThank you for considering these comments."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-25T03:29:42Z","Content":"I can take a look at it.
