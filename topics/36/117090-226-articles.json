It helps to look at optional patches before you install them to see if they are actually something that you need or want.\n\nThe engines are based on real-world engines, and as such, their performance may not be up to stock \u0027gamey\u0027 standards.  Expect generally lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on most vacuum engines compared to stock equivalent engines.\n\nHowever, the LMAE is also perfectly capable of lifting the LC2-POD on Mun, minmus, or other low gravity worlds.  Keep in mind you do NOT need a Kerbin-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of \u003E1 for a lander, except for specific cases (really only Eve landers).  Mun has far lower gravity than Kerbin, and as such a far less powerful engine is needed.\n\nThis example uses the LMAE, and has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of \u003E1.5 on the Mun, more than plenty for an ascent.\n\n![sarP2xU.png](http://i.imgur.com/sarP2xU.png)\n\nEven adding a descent stage with an LMDE, it still has plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u003E1.5) (note that I didn\u0027t add legs or science bits, which will drop your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E slightly, but should still be plenty for landing and ascent):  \n![u76Iwop.png](http://i.imgur.com/u76Iwop.png)\n\nCertainly you can gain some efficiency in your ascent/descent by using more powerful engines with higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but that is at the cost of higher launch mass and dry mass of the lander, which may counter the added fuel required for the less efficient lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E landing (if it does or not will vary depending upon craft design, solar system scale, ascent profile, landing target, etc).\n\nI know that these craft work because I have recently used very similar designs to these in my career game, and a setup similar to what is shown is sufficient for Mun landing\u002Bascent (can almost be done with the ascent stage alone).\n\n(Note to self:  Remove optional patches from distro, as apparently nobody bothers reading release notes or investigating what the optional patches do before installing them)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T00:42:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 35 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (Note to self:  Remove optional patches from distro, as apparently nobody bothers reading release notes or investigating what the optional patches do before installing them)\n\u003E \n\nI happen to like the optional patches."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceBadger007","CreatedById":150547,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-01T01:11:01Z","Content":"Here is the final (part 3) of my almost fully reusable mun mission!

Another detail that might be important is that [the text detailing the changes to engine stats only appear in non-SSTU parts](http://i.imgur.com/i6aaceN.jpg). So, did I miss some SSTU-specific module that also needs to have upgrades added to or is this a bug?\n\u003E \n\nI think you are hitting on a limitation of the stock part / config system.\n\nI\u0027ve had to make assumptions and workarounds to the fact that the stock code -never- passes in the root config node after prefab initialization.  Basically I have to cache the entire part config -at the time of prefab creation- and use that to derive the engine-cluster stat upgrades when cluster # is switched.\n\nThe problem there is that the cached data never gets updated from the stock PartUpgrade code, as all it does is some hacky back-end updating of the variables on the live part-modules in the editor/in flight, it never at any point updates the config nodes for the part or re-passes those updated config nodes back into the part-modules so that they can be processed / values re-loaded.\n\nHonestly there might not be any clean solutions to this; certainly not with the current ModularEngineCluster code.  What I would need is a way to determine the \u0027base\u0027 stats for the engine, at the time of part instantiation, prior to the MEC code running, and cache those base/raw stats on a \u0027per-part-instance\u0027 basis, using those to derive the engine cluster stats.\n\n(Actually its been so long since I\u0027ve worked on that module, I\u0027m looking into it now.  Might not be as difficult as I\u0027m imagining, all depends on how hacky the workarounds I currently have in place are.  I -do- want to get this fixed and working though as I intend to create a set of upgrades for most of the engines to upgrade various stats during career progression.  Will update/edit/post when I know more about what it will take.)\n\nEdit:  Looking closer at the code, it -should- all be working.  I currently grab the ModuleEngines\\* base thrust stats during the PartModules Start() method (ensuring the engine module has had onload and onstart callled on it).  At this point the upgrades -should- have already been applied, so the MEC should be grabbing the post-upgrade-modified-base-stats and using those to determine cluster thrust #\u0027s, but apparently there is something weird going on.  Will have to do a bit more investigation on the PartUpgrade code to see when/where in the PartModule start-up cycle that the upgrades are applied and when it is safe to grab values from the part-modules.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-03T21:32:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2017 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlimOncul","CreatedById":162298,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T21:18:22Z","Content":"Hi i got a modlist and when i try to put SSTU tank to vessel its wobble and stack over flow exception happens   \n\nKSP.log is full of Part.onAttach (.Part parent, Boolean first) if its necessary i will upload it too.  \n\nGame version 1.2.2\n\nSSTU version 0.5.34.131(latest)  \n\nModlist :   \n[https://gyazo.com/e0703c3f8e1932220cf11175668c3d59](https://gyazo.com/e0703c3f8e1932220cf11175668c3d59)  \n[https://gyazo.com/4af0261c61acca28c79954cd349d2de7](https://gyazo.com/4af0261c61acca28c79954cd349d2de7)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T21:26:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, AlimOncul said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi i got a modlist and when i try to put SSTU tank to vessel its wobble and stack over flow exception happens   \n\u003E \n\u003E KSP.log is full of Part.onAttach (.Part parent, Boolean first) if its necessary i will upload it too.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Game version 1.2.2\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E SSTU version 0.5.34.131(latest)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Modlist :   \n\u003E [https://gyazo.com/e0703c3f8e1932220cf11175668c3d59](https://gyazo.com/e0703c3f8e1932220cf11175668c3d59)  \n\u003E [https://gyazo.com/4af0261c61acca28c79954cd349d2de7](https://gyazo.com/4af0261c61acca28c79954cd349d2de7)\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the report;\n\nPlease upload the log files as well, as without them I cannot possibly tell what is going on / going wrong.

I understand that they shouldnt be absurdly oversized, but again this is KSP. I had scaled a base to 6.5m but the fairing would only extend to, I think 7m. Which was too small for my craft. I changed the cfg so it now goes up to 10m at the 6.5m scale and that works well for me. Honestly I could have gotten away with 8.5m but didnt want to have to go back and change it again. \n\nIIIRC, the default was 1.25m base with 1.875m fairing and I raised it to 2.5m. This allowed the scaling to work much better for me. And, I do very much prefer your fairing bases over stock, mostly cause they are already tweakscale compatible, saves me a lot of hassle. Though, I still plan to make changes to them. I think you have the max sections set to 2, I like to have at least 4 most of the time.
