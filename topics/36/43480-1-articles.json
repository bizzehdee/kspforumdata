Majiir\u0027s hexes can be interacted with - you hover over them and they give you more detail. The same could happen here so that if you click on a hex, the hex expands to give you a near-full-screen detailed view of just that hex - not stretched crazily at the poles so you have trouble determining actual distances, and in vastly more detailed than the current maps provide. Or it can give the hex you click plus the 6 immediately surrounding ones, so you have detail and context. Click on a neighboring hex and it centers and loads the boundary maps. Planning a trip or a landing site would be much clearer, much easier. With layers you could see a kethane map, then switch to a terrain map, then a topography map, and any other kind of map you want to add - other resources, etc. A generalized framework would allow anyone who wanted to mod in anything along these lines a big help with getting that going, which will only result in more and better mods.

I\u0027ve been thinking about a mapping replacement for a short while, and the geodesic grid code could definitely come in handy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACalthough not necessarily the way you\u0027d expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIcosahedral grid cells are roughly evenly distributed around the surface of a sphere, so they\u0027re useful for data storage. In particular, icosahedral grids don\u0027t suffer distortion at the poles. Even if you end up rendering a 2D map, storing the data using a geodesic grid has advantages; on a rectangular map, polar data will look a little more stretched, which helps latitude perception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe grid can also be used to build a spherical mesh (smooth, not with individual hexagons) that can be textured without polar distortion. Alternatively, you could use a vertex shader and crank up the subdivisions. You can easily adjust the mesh to fit the shape of the planet this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hex-based approach with a detailed view could also work. A big advantage here is that you don\u0027t actually have to store as much data. You can just store a level of detail for each cell, and then sample terrain levels when you want to render a detailed view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick myth-busting: it\u0027s not impossible for a satellite to scan while unfocused. It doesn\u0027t happen automatically, but you can pretty easily code a way around it.

You can store \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E data at a hex coordinate.) There\u0027s no reason a mapping mod that uses some Kethane code has to work the exact same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest limitation is actually PQS (the game\u0027s terrain system). It\u0027s computationally expensive to query for terrain details, so it\u0027s important to be careful with storing and caching that data. For reference, on my i7-3770 system, ten thousand altitude queries takes around 200 milliseconds, so you can only perform a few hundred queries per frame before you really kill performance.
