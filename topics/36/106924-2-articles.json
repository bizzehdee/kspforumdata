Thank you for helping out with this.\nSo far all good news but some instructions required.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, for the life of me, I can\u0027t figure out how to transfer the science from the experiment to the capsule so I can get the science for it... It is driving me insane. It\u0027s the only science part that I can\u0027t get to do it. So I take the parts up in the container, attatch on EVA, and run the experiment. But when I go to grab the science, it doesn\u0027t even give me an option to \u0022collect data\u0022 or whatever. I just have to store it, and deal with it getting incinerated on re-entry or transmit the data for 20% of the science earned. Which at that point isn\u0027t worth it. I tend to go with a more realistic approach to my career modes, so I\u0027m not returning to Kerbin with the experiments. Just the science... So until I can \u0022take data\u0022, or whatever, this mod is basically useless to me....\n\nJust for clarification. An engineer is only required to mount the attachment bracket in EVA. Using an equipped wench (or electric screw driver). After than any kerbal can mount an experimental onto the bracket without tools. Even Jeb can do this. This is covered in the KIS manual. Got to love the KIS documentation as it appears inside KSP as a readable KIS item. Which is amazing. Once the experiment is run and finalized. You do not collect data. This is a material sample experiment and must be examined on Kerbin to get any science points. Any Kerbal can EVA and pick up the experimental tray. Use the G key to grab it off the bracket. It must then be stowed back into the original stowage container. Mousing over the item when back in the stowage will show that it still contains data once moved. Land back on Kerbin and the final mission debrief screen will show your science reward. \n\nAs far as I know removing the mounting bracket is optional. On a space station leave it in place for future missions. On spacecraft it will of course snap off harmlessly on reentry. An engineer can save you some bucks removing it and stowing it alongside the experiments for the return journey. \n\nSo far. So good. Right now the only snag I can see is that the KEES contracts might still need some work. I think that they don\u0027t clear when the experiment is returned. Need to confirm this for sure. If your using Contract Configure by Nightingale perhaps he can help here. I have seen his Field Science contracts plugin generate a mission to do a Kemini experiment for funds only. This represents hiring out the payload space to an external corporation to do some private R\u0026D in. That mission completed just fine.\n\nEDIT: Could be a version goof on my part.

Hopefully the payload carrier will work as I can\u0027t get larger a KIS container this big until much later on.\n\nHey nobodyhasthis;\n\nsorry for not replying earlier - for some reason the thread isn\u0027t notifying me.\n\nAnyway glad to see you got it working.\n\nAs for the KEES experiments, you know that each Seat (ie, Kerbal) in a capsule has a KIS inventory as well, right? You can store KEES experiments and the KEES PEC in the Seats, although only 1 item per seat, so you\u0027ll need a 2-Kerbal capsule or rendezvous with something already in orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"nobodyhasthis","CreatedById":139024,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:18:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As for the KEES experiments, you know that each Seat (ie, Kerbal) in a capsule has a KIS inventory as well, right?

Having a backpack when entering the pod can cause a Kerbal duplication bug. When a Kerbal appears inside and still outside the pod. I have also had case where the backpack is left behind. It is rare bug and does not always show up. As a result I just avoid it by putting back pack mounted items into their own storage."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:40:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is rare bug and does not always show up.

This seems to be best solution and KIS seems more stable this way. \nWill Have to try using the pod stowage as suggested to test things. Long term out of sheer love the mod and a role playing decision. I will probably be sticking with the proper stowage container. It looks like a more realistic way to carry the experiments. \n\nNow here is a bit of a noob question for you ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif).

Noticed that there might be a problem there. So thought that I would ask the \u0022noob\u0022 question about install options. I just could not understand the different version numbering and there is no such thing as silly question in debugging experimental builds. Turns out by going for the separate packs I was running version mw-4 of the whole mod. All when well. Did not spot any bugs. However did not test the later experiments on top of \u0022Station Science\u0022 builds but everything I did use was working just fine. \n\nOnly minor snags caused by the \u0022For Science!\u0022 mod which moves experiment data. I disable this when carrying Nehemiah experiments and everything is fine. \n\nNow starting again on new career. Running with new version of KIS installed and the complete pack option. This is a completely different build with a different set of mods. Will let you know if I run into snags. So far a great mod update."}]}
