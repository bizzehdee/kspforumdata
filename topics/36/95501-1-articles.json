These APU\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s will be a realism replacement for the overpowered RTG. The APU/EPU will be self contained units, meaning they will have enough fuel in them for 6 Hours. They are only meant for use for accent, orbital insertion and decent. In the Space shuttle they used them for the Hydraulics.

However if we assume that the Electric charge is in mA not A we get the KSP RTG is now 2.7Ah at 30V so 81W thats inline with the Apollo 12\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015317 ALSEP RTG. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoyager 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s RTG (single) in KSP: E = 3.7/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSEP RTG in KSP: E = .65/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok so i have a precedence for the amount of power an RTG uses in KSP, how do i use this for the Fuel Cell, APU and RAT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo Era Fuel cell was 30 VDC 1420 Watt with a peak of 2300 watt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDimensions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-D: 111.8 x 55.9cm, 111.1kg (44 x 22 in., 245lb.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBaseline established for Fuel cell in real life, so KSP terms its:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.13/s (ignoring peak)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerfect now i need to scale this for KSP. Well, at 55.9cm wide we see that the apollo fuel cell is a kSP tiny. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the Fuel. The cells were fed by two hemispherical-cylindrical 31.75-inch (0.806 m) diameter tanks, each holding 29 pounds (13 kg) of liquid hydrogen, and two spherical 26-inch (0.66 m) diameter tanks, each holding 326 pounds (148 kg) of liquid oxygen (which also supplied the environmental control system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(taken right from wikipedia, couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find NASA source on this one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso for the usage of fuel it should be (simplified a H=1 O=16) by weight of 1:8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso for each 1/kg of Liquid Fuel used 8/kg Oxidizer need to be used. but this won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t add up as in KSP it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 8 units of liquid fuel per 11 units of oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats more like RP-1 and Oxygen, wile this type of Fuel cell has been created it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s runs Much to hot to be used, and is more expensive. to combat this we will fudge some numbers to make it work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know C# to be able to do any major code, i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll use the already implemented .cfg files to do what i want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Fuel cell in KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize: Tiny\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput 13.13/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel 8.6 kg Liquid Hydrogen / 68.8 kg Liquid Oxygen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work.

So, Lets change it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Fuel cell in KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize: Tiny\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput .0457/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidFuel = .0009\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer = .0011\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means with a full FL-T100 you can create: 2.285 Amps of charge or in KSP 2285 E units and will last 13H53M20S. While making this fuel Cell powerful, it also makes it semi-balanced. The other option is to decrease the fuel usage 10%, but this would make it be able to charge 22850 and last 138H53M20S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this would make the timeline more correct for the Apollo Erra, and the charge balanced for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, thats that taken care of. So, where to put it. Well, it will have to be in somewhere between batteries and Solar Panels for the first small one. Now, as the size increases so could the power output, but this would also scale the Fuel usage. Relatively easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the APU is a different beast. It will use Monoprop at a higher rate, but also has an increased power output. for the Boing Dreamliner the APU will generate 235kVA 235VAC (guessing three phase) is 614.2A!! that would be a charge rate of 170.6/s. That kind of charge just isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t needed in Stock KSP. as we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to worry about using them to power all the lights on a plane, and the cabin avionics and sensors. KSP doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t model amount of current needed just to run a command pod (yet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPut them at the end of the tech tree!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Why? Whats the point in that, by then you can have RTG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. Besides fuel is a premium in the start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe RAT. Ok, this is a Ram Air Turbine, this is the last ditch to create electricity if both the Batteries are empty and the APU is out (in real life, this would be used if both engines are down, and the APU\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t start) and all planes have them (well not crop dusters) it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a propeller that pops out somewhere on the planes and creates just enough power to run the critical systems. The faster you are gowing the more current is created. this would only work where there is an atmosphere (something to make the propeller spin) so Kerbin, Duna, Lathe, Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill update when i have Proof of concept parts done and post them for Balance review. Right now i have the Fuel Cell complete, using the RTG, i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll change this to the above objects later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should fill a void in some of the Aerospace realism parts that are missing as all jets (that i know of) and planes (Militart and medium\u002B commercial) have APU/EPU and most space craft have Fuel Cells (the Space shuttle had them, as well as the Apollo CSM and Some Probes. and the RAT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s most commercial planes have them. Can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find documentation on if the Space shuttle had one, but i don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think it did. Air Transat Flight 236, an Airbus A330 used a RAT to perform a deadstick landing in the Azores. and in KSP many a time i have landed my plane, shuttle, SSTO deadstick, and 80% of the time, the reason for less then safe re-entry was running out of electrical charge high in the atmosphere. while a RAT won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t help me there, i could have used an APU/EPU until lower, and avoided a retrograde facing re-entry. FAR doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Jeremy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound good read on Fuel Cells from NASA: The Fuel Cell in Space: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow by Marvin Warshay and Paul R.
