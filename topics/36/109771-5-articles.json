Basically, a system that allows for constant replenishing of life support resources, which MKS/OKS allows for. I\u0027m sure that Regex, Dr. Jet, and anyone else working on this will give it the proper consideration with regard for realism in this mod (assuming, of course, LS is part of the scope for this project), but for stock KSP, I\u0027d recommend the Soylent mod for your life support replenishment needs. It\u0027s simple, uses only a handful of parts, and has just enough in-fiction plausibility to not feel too cheaty, imo.\n\nBTW, I wish I was good with content creation, because I\u0027d totally get in on this action. Instead, I\u0027ll just eagerly watch the progress. I can\u0027t wait for RO for 1.\\*.\\* to be released, and then have this to run alongside.
