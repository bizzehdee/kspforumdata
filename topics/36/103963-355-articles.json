It\u0027s the thing I\u0027ve encountered that would even come close to explaining that performance gap (AVP \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B KS3P still yields decent perf on OpenGL here). But the reporter doesn\u0027t say, and gives very little detail... In fact it\u0027s really quite useless as far as performance information goes, beyond \u0022I clearly have mod issues\u0022.\n\u003E \n\nI mean, scatterer is a graphics mod.  Even on DX11 it hurts performance, that\u0027s just it\u0027s nature.  It gets worse with dual camera though, and that\u0027s largely squads (or maybe even Unity\u0027s) fault because they have not implemented single camers in OpenGL codepath yet.\n\nI hear you.  For the end user, this is the same ol \u0022but it don\u0027t work good!\u0022 story.  Sadly, not much we can do right now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-11T14:19:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2020 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-11T14:18:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, R-T-B said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Proton is just steams wrapper for the tools i suggested (dxvk and wine, I think it adds esync too).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At any rate, glad you do not carry bias.
