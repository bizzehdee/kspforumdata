It seems to be the most common request and in fact even I requested it when I first subscribed downloaded and played. Everything else looks like crap compared to ALOR. So i don\u0027t mean to respond for him yet again but I can only assume that the capsules are still a WIP and he will work on them when he gets a chance. Right now I hope he is busy finishing up KONQUEST and after a break I assume and hope he will pick up working on the capsules again. Because they look basically done they just need IVAs. At least one of them looks basically done. I mean with all of the mods he is making besides a rocket mod like KW and some plugins you wont need much else once he finishes up all his planned projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UU58DKB3YguDiVcUh4bmef5w\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UU58DKB3YguDiVcUh4bmef5w\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zo2BowO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zo2BowO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thorbane","CreatedById":76234,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T16:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a contact notification in the GPWS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wolveirne16","CreatedById":23761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T13:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having some fairly serious lag in the IVA with this mod, which seems fairly odd to me.
