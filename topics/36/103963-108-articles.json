That could potentially keep me able to use this as you make it look more and more beautiful (laptop here, upgrading the CPU is out of the question :P)\n\u003E \n\nI already thought about doing this, the issue is, if you vary the size of the fourier grid, the waves generated are going to be completely different and won\u0027t match. As long as the grid size is the same, CPU and GPU will generate the same waves at any point in time, but change the grid size and the results are completely different and won\u0027t match up.\n\nBtw I gave it a performance test on my test unity project, I have a quadcore i5-2400 @3.1Ghz, I rebooted my machine with only two cores enabled and ran the wave simulation on the CPU, fourierGridSize of 128 chugged very badly but a grid size of 64 ran at 70 fps, so at least I know a grid size of 64 should work reasonably for lots of people. Well it\u0027s gonna be different in game, since KSP will be hogging one core but it should still be manageable.\n\nAlso, this is new, but when running wave generation on the CPU game fps and wave fps will now be decoupled, that means if your CPU can\u0027t keep up, the waves might be running at 20 fps while the game runs at 30 fps, which might look weird but might be better than having your gameplay slowdown too. They won\u0027t \u0022lag behind\u0022 as you move the camera or anything of the sort, they will just seem to animate at a different rate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 24 minutes ago, Mr Betelgeuse said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Great mod.
