I am hoping to partially achieve this by modifying \u0022short\u0022 (wheesley, panther, all node attaching engines)\u00A0jet engines to require an \u0022engine space\u0022 resource for use, and creating heavy, fuel-free engine space Mk1 fuselages to occupy this space and thus make players have build larger planes for better engine performance (as irl).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been messing around with .cfg files for a while but I don\u0027t have any real modding experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am hoping to do this by assigning a constant production rate of this resource to the engine space part, but I am having trouble making the engine itself consume at constant rate.
