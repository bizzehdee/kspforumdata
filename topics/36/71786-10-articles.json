And everyone could set it as they like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanic skill reduces those percentages in fractions. ie. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100% skill on 1 kerbal in vessel would reduce fail chance to 2.5%, 1,25% and 0.75%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100% skill on 2 kerbal in vessel would only reduce fail chance to 1.25%, 0.75% and 0.375%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough in all honesty I think this skill should be something we upgrade somehow at the base.
