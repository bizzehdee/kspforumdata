For the purposes of your mod, I think what you\u0027d want to do is try to come up with a value for the asteroid recovery which would create a good return without breaking the game balance (which is already unbalanced pending re-balancing.) Take into account what would be the likely cost of the rocket and parts needed and the ease of landing an asteroid (which doesn\u0027t look to hard in stock). Then scale the return based on the asteroid\u0027s size and some random number (which would be how rich the asteroid was in valuable minerals.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T20:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t bother with conversions. I think you should be balancing the value for the game instead. Find out the total cost of a successful asteroid retrieval mission, and figure out what a good return should be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T21:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you want to be realistic, try a conversion rate that is simple, but puts you in the right ballpark.
