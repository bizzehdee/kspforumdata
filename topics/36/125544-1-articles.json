This means that I can scale them with distance so that you can still see nav lights from afar like you should be able to. The current ones are just lights, which doesn\u0027t do you any good when you barely see the plane anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still a bunch of functionality left to add like blinking and bunch of usability stuff, but I\u0027m really happy that the core of it is working great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a video of it in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/ScaryClearBobwhite\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gfycat.com/ScaryClearBobwhite\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a fancy Imgur album, but you\u0027ll need to look at the album on Imgur to be able to really see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Xbica\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I\u0027m surprised that no flight sims seem to model this, but depending on the angle of the plane, there are certain lights you shouldn\u0027t see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, from the front you should see only the red and green, but no rear white. If they are flying right to left, you should see red. If they are flying left to right, you should see green. If they are head on, you should see both colors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a video\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/ElatedIllegalKestrel\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gfycat.com/ElatedIllegalKestrel\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit hard to see in a small webm due to compression.
