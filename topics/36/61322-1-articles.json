Nozzle gets that and adds it\u0027s own corrections (including afterburner, if present) and produces thrust from that. Every part depends on what the part before it is doing, and only that.

Ramjet and scramjet bodies would essentially be just burners and nuclear jets wouldn\u0027t be even that (just a heating element feeding from the reactor). On turbojets and low-bypass turbofans it would be the entire compressor\u002Bburner assembly, and also pass bypass data down to the nozzle. High bypass turbofans would be the most complicated of the bunch, they\u0027d need a special inlet model which would also produce thrust. This might be best left for later, but if done, would also easily allow making propfans and even turboprops! I can see quite a few combinations possible with those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camlost","CreatedById":57590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T00:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbody\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is still very complicated and has to be defined with a lot of parameters in cfg.
