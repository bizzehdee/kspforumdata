Kinda reminds me of that time in Xenogears when Kosmos has a pistol for some reason and it turns out to be a subdimensional anchor to summon forth a gun the size of a small train, complete with space-bipod. Cuz in space, putting a bipod on your gun does anything at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silvester","CreatedById":77500,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T14:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit purpose is for the preparation for sending something like this \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ml-GUX9_KYo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat the bottom is i think what i like to texture the base \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexpandable base for something-something , maybe i\u0027ll give some satelite disc at the top or maybe more \u0022expand\u0022 like a communication tower or more complex animation \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry for lack of texture and a forgive me because this is my first mod it is lack of quality\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei need an idea what a base meant to be\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T18:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey everyone starts somewhere. I think the fact that you got something in game is pretty impressive. I\u0027m sure it feels good to finally succeed if you were like me and spent three hours trying to strangle Unity for being so useless (In fact I recently repeated the sequence). The texture is pretty cool too. It looks like the Xycraft stuff from minecraft to me. Maybe try googling stuff to see what references you can look at in your modelling. Also try explain what you are going for a little better. People here are friendly and are usually helpful. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
