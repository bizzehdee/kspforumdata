Like subtractCost ? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have bug to report: If you add a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E container to SSTUVolumeContainer on a pod. It will set seat \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E volume to 0.\n\u003E \n\nInteresting.  Have added it to the things to investigate; however I won\u0027t be able to do anything on it until there is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E for 1.2 (as the mod is now fully built for 1.2, there is no going back).\n\nAnd yes, the source posted on Github pretty much -is- the documentation for the PartModules.  Quite a few are fully commented and should tell you exactly what the variables do.  The rest should be able to be deciphered from the code with a bit of work/reading (if you can read c# that is).\n\nJust note that anything in a PartModule with a [KSPField] tag above it is a config field that can be setup/manipulated through the config file.  Exceptions to this are where it specifically has in the comment \u0027don\u0027t mess with this through config\u0027 or in some of the custom-data-classes that I have that load through sub-nodes in the PartModule.  For the custom data classes you kind of have to track down their class definition and look at their constructor to see what fields they load.\n\nMore development progress:\n\nCustom shader compilation setup and working.  Custom shader per-platform-loading code setup and working.  Custom shaders supported through ModelData based TextureSet switching.  Custom shaders added to MFT-A tank texture sets, and working again in-game under 1.2.  So indeed it was just a Unity-version mismatch that prevented the previous ones from working.\n\nShould have a \u0027shader-testing\u0027 release available later this evening.  Will send out links through PM\u0027s to those who had volunteered for platform testing.  Please note though that this is for testing of the shaders only -- lots of other stuff is still broken or intentionally disabled.\n\nAlso:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/147586-porkjets-part-overhauls-as-12-modding-example/\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=2758936\u0026embedComment=2758936\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNathanKell has been -busy- adding quality-of-life-enhancements for mods/modding/modders.  Good stuff.\n\nAlso, it looks like the \u0027stock\u0027 definition of \u0027module-switching\u0027 is pretty much like my previous hacky solution -- just functionally disable modules until they are needed.  Disappointing, but at least there is some support for it now for a few stock modules that I previously couldn\u0027t use (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\nSounds like there will not be an updated ModuleManager for at least a few days.  Also waiting on the stock symmetry-part-with-modified-fuels bug to get fixed.  So probably no 1.2-compatible releases until next week/end."},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T16:47:13Z","Content":"Always check your staging, folks.

You can press the buttons and it\u0027ll change the selected nose.\n\nThe boxes on the left will be for either pre-rendered models, or more likely a pre-rendered texture icon, and are actually a button that triggers the change in adapter.  The \u0027Name\u0027 and \u0027Description\u0027 columns can/will have differing text, I\u0027m merely loading the model-data name for both at the moment.

May even leave the old scroll/list controls code in place and have a config option somewhere to toggle between full gui or simple gui.\n\nThe only thing stopping me at the moment is the icon/model rendering.  It is non-trivial to do run-time rendering of a model in a specific area (involves render textures or some camera witchery, and also a lot of object creation/destruction), none of which I have any experience with in Unity.  So what I\u0027m likely going to do is pre-render a series of icon textures (64x? 128x?) for the adapters and render those onto the buttons.  Will be a few MB worth of textures, and a fair amount of work to render them all, but will be easy to code and easy to support.

Fairings, decouplers (ISDC/RBDC/PDC), MUS, MFT, petal adapters, probe core, MSRBs, heat-shield, and welding-docking port all now use the PartUpgrade system.  This means the parts all start at 1.25m in the editor (for now), but I may be adding some additional code to up the size to the max unlocked diameter for new in-editor parts; we\u0027ll see.\n\nDid the conversion of the MFT textures yesterday to the format for he new shader.  Actually resulted in a pretty large reduction in memory/size of the textures due to the split off of the Spec map (was able to compress the rest of the textures to DXT1, and thus half-size on disc).  Also compressed the flat colored textures to half-resolution as well, with no noticeable loss of quality in game (spec, norm and AO maps are still full res, which is where most of the detail comes from on these parts).  The gold\u002Borange textures look even better now due to proper colored-specular support.\n\nMoved all of my tank texture sets into the base SSTU install now that they\u0027ve been sized down a bit.  Will be examining doing the same for the rest of the adapter, mount, nosecone, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E textures.  Could result in saving a few dozen MB after all is done, and likely a similar .zip size even with all of the base texture sets included.\n\n[@JoseEduardo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127759-joseeduardo/) Any interest in hosting the tank (and shuttle) textures you made in/with the SSTU-Nova pack?  I don\u0027t really have any problem including them with SSTU, but I also don\u0027t have the original files for those textures and so am unable to update/convert them to the new AO format.\n\nSolar panel textures have been made double-sided and converted to .dds; this added mipmaps for them which greatly cleaned up the aliasing on the panels at larger view distances.  Huge improvement in their looks at distance, but did muddy up the zoomed-in detail a bit; probably a worthwhile tradeoff, and mostly unavoidable with .dds.\n\nAnyone have any objections to the proposed \u0027adapter-selection\u0027 GUI?  Do I need to keep the current GUI-slider/button based system in place at all?  Will be making the GUI based solution the default, but could possibly have a config option somewhere to go back to the slider system. \n\nStock resource-copying bug has been fixed in the latest pre-release.  A few other long-standing SSTU/stock bugs have also been fixed in the 1.2 code including the \u0027must drop a part and pick it up before surface attach\u0027, and the \u0027parts with transparency have odd rendering\u0027.  Overall 1.2 looks like it will be a good update.  Still a lot of work to be done by SQUAD on stock bugs, but I\u0027m feeling much more optimistic about this release than I did 1.0 or 1.1 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is a single part:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [...snip...]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Could legs work using a the less buggy ModuleAnimateGeneric or SSTUAnimateControlled module?

More goodness yet-to-come with the PartUpgrade handling and some of the new stock module functions such as enabling/disabling converters and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules.\n\nLanding Legs -- not really.  Most of the models do not have any colliders setup for the actual leg portion as they rely on the WheelCollider.  Also the stock models are compiled with WheelColliders in them which will cause you grief if they are not controlled by a PartModule.  The only exceptions would be those landing legs that are specifically built for ModuleAnimateGeneric such as some of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E parts with integrated legs."}]}
