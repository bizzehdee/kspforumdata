Should be fairly amusing to see if I can use that to do anything amazing. I\u0027ve used it before to fold gliders into cargo bays. Always a fun way to explore other planets. A ship powered by a probe core, a cargo bay, and your either probe-glider or piloted exploration craft stuffed in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick with those, for me, was to find the perfect deployment altitude. You want to unfold everything (as I don\u0027t, and refuse to, use Deadly Reentry) so that your wings and control surfaces are in their standard position before you meet the atmosphere. That way you can be more than ready to glide. The other half of the battle was keeping the thing so small and light that it could sit in the cargo bay without taking up much room, yet also having an ability to control the thing once it was unleashed. Always wished there to be a pilot seat that was small, light, and simple. I figure, why not mention my thoughts here, where there\u0027s a lot of creative talent flying around (pun fully intended) and see what people think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea, basically, was to have a probe-sized connection both front and rear, a high-visibility canopy with reasonable instrumentation, built with minimal onboard resources. No reaction wheels, a probe core (just so that the annoyance of the whole \u0022I forgot to apply the brakes\u0022 scenario can be eliminated), a small amount of battery power, and, say, 3 units of Monopropellant onboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially an inline cockpit, but made to be just barely bigger than the Kerbal inside it. As for instrumentation... A real seat of the pants feeling here. Altimeter, Radar Altimeter, Compass, Navball, Velocity, and Atmosphere. Oh, and if it\u0027s possible, a nice \u0022gear warning\u0022 light for when you\u0027ve got the gear up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, it\u0027s a lot to mention, and I\u0027d have better luck mentioning it elsewhere, but I figured it can\u0027t hurt to mention the idea here. If nothing else, maybe it spins off a few cool ideas that can be used. If I had any knowledge at all in 3D modeling, Unity, and texturing, I\u0027d give it a go myself, but I don\u0027t have the aptitude for learning Blender. Last time I tried was about a year ago, and I got so lost trying to figure anything out that I gave up on it. I know from the tutorial I\u0027d been trying to follow that this stuff is hard to do, and few appreciate the work that goes into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for that alone, I thank everyone involved in the whole modding project, just because it is hard, and so few people show gratitude toward the modders. So I\u0027ll leave the idea here and see what people think, but other than that, there\u0027s not much I can do. I can\u0027t honestly contribute to the project any more than ideas and bug testing, which are the two end-points of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I\u0027m somewhat liking the DSR3. I like the DSR2 better, but that may just be personal bias going on. The DSR3\u0027s body shell is easy to work with, and I was having fun a while ago sticking various parts from the Lack Luster Labs part pack on it. Sure, the white clashes with the grey, but the angular shapes and design kinda went with it, and that startled me, in a good way. I usually find myself annoyed that I use so little of the LLL pack, just because there\u0027s so little that goes with it but itself. And yet, the DSR Rover Hulls match at least in the rough, angular design. I like it. Sure, at this point, my mind screams \u0022I want a white one!\u0022 but that\u0027d only be depriving myself of the beauty of the current design. That, and the fact that the DSR Hulls look good on Wheels, or on Tracks, I find it awesome. It\u0027s hard to find a vehicle that looks good regardless of what it\u0027s sitting on, but the DSR is that vehicle. Heck, it even looked good as a plane. Wouldn\u0027t tend to use it like that on missions to other worlds, but I could see an upscaled Firespitter Bomb Bay being the release mechanism for one of those sometime soon. Might try landing one on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAck!

It\u0027s really quick and intuitive, so for producing 3D concept art it\u0027s absolutely ideal. I like your idea for the cockpit, it could also fit well with the rover body theme Spanner and I have going.

Notice the large amount of window material used to give as large a field of view as possible (yes, I know you can only look 180 degrees as a Kerbal, but still, I think glass looks better when dealing with multi-monitor play, where you see a little more), as well as a reasonable amount of \u0022toward the ground view\u0022 from the perspective. I figure, the Kerbal sits with his head (in helmet) almost touching the roof glass, if it gives an idea of just how much visibility there is in that design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for instruments, front-and-center should be the Compass on top, Navball, then Atmosphere. To the left, Altimeter next to the Compass, and under the Altimeter should be the Radar Altimeter. To the right of the Compass should be three lights: Gear, RCS, SAS. Below those, the Velocity gauge. This leaves plenty of room underneath for things like RPM screens. The idea is to not clutter up the visible space in front of the pilot: I would rather look down to see my gauges and be able to see down the nose of the airplane than to have my gauges in my face and barely a view of where I\u0027m flying.

The MK1 is great for a view of the sky, but forget looking left or right, and you won\u0027t see anything you\u0027re about to hit.

B9\u0027s cockpits, with exception to the HL one that looks like it came off an airliner, and the one that looks like a truck cab, have reasonably poor visibility.
