Reactors, with a couple of exceptions, all create either Thermal Power joules or Charged Particle joules.\u00A0 So, to run an electrical engine you need to combine a reactor, which generates Thermal and/or Charged Particle joules, with a generator which can convert Thermal and/or Charged Particle joules into MegaJoules -
