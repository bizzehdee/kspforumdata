A better idea for a cheap and simple rocket would be a concept that can\u0027t ultimately be refueled for example either a hybrid fueled or ablative cooled rocket engine. A hybrid would simply be a throttlable solid fueled SRB with performance, cost, and dry mass that falls exactly in between that of equivalent solid and liquid system regardless of how hybrids are believed to work either on paper or in practice. The ablatively cooled rocket would hold DRE compatible ablative coating internally and slowly burn through it as a third resource that fuels the rocket engine, the advantage would be an engine that\u0027s possibly lighter and much cheaper, but the trade off is when you run out of ablative coating the engine stops working forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second rocket sounds like SXT\u0027s black adder engine, and while I would love an extra ram free stock revamp version or equivalent to it doesn\u0027t adding a bunch of new engines sound kinda outside the mods scope?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-07T04:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2014 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by passinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T05:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand while I would love an extra ram free stock revamp version or equivalent to it doesn\u0027t adding a bunch of new engines sound kinda outside the mods scope?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENah, looks to me like he\u0027s suggesting something like the extras already included in this mod, but a bit more extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MainSailor","CreatedById":74050,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T13:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe orange details on the tanks is authentic.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.

There\u0027s an old story going around about how North American hired California surfers to spray on the insulation on the tanks of the S-II stage because of their experience using spray foam making surf boards. I\u0027m not sure how accurate that story is. The phenolic layer was the original design which apparently had issues staying bonded with the tank while it was filled with the cryogenic fuels. More \u003Ca href=\u0022http://history.nasa.gov/afj/s-ii/s-ii-insulation.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInsulation for the LH2 tank created some of the most persistent technical problems in the entire S-II program. ... This ... confronted the company with the problem of adequate external insulation and with special difficulties in bonding the insulation to the super-cold surfaces of the fuel tank. The original solution specified external insulation made of phenolic honeycomb filled with a heat-resistant foam of isocyanate. Fabricated in panels, the insulation material was sealed at the top and bottom with a phenolic laminate followed by a layer of Tedlar plastic film. The process of bonding the insulation panels to the tank created potential hazards. Air pockets next to the super-cold metal could be turned into puddles of liquid oxygen; these puddles could eventually weaken the bonding, thereby allowing large panels to peel off. To avoid this, the S-II stage featured a liquid-helium purge of the insulation through grooves cut into the insulation surface next to the tank walls. Helium flowed through the grooves from the start of hydrogen loading through countdown and up to the instant of launch.\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this design never worked very well. The purge system was tricky, the insulation bonding repeatedly failed, and chunks of insulation continued to fall off during tanking and test sequences. Although several S-II stages were produced with the original insulation concept, the results were so discouraging that North American spent considerable time and money working up an alternative. Instead of making up panels and affixing them to the tank, the company finally evolved a process for spraying insulation material directly onto the tank walls (eliminating the air pockets), letting it cure, then cutting it to the proper contour. This technique turned out to be much more economical and much lighter than the insulation panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T01:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe first one I find kind of pointless as you can just stagger thrust by rapidly turning it on and off.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no one will actually \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E that.
