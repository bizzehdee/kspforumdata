The AI needs a stand-off distance setting, maybe one particular to each kind of weapon, like 2 km for AIM120, 500 m for AIM9 and 50 m for guns/cannons. The AI needs variable minimum speed setting as well. In short when a large-fast fighter goes up against a small-slow but nibble fighter the fast fighter tries to maneuver in close like it was also small-slow and nimble, and gets utterly destroyed. There needs to be a way to program a fighter to stay high and fast, swoop in, fire missiles and fly away, turn around when far and repeat, it should only go to cannons and close in fighting if it has no missiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried playing around with the altitude settings but this resulted in the big fighter not willing to pitch down enough to lock its weapons on the small fighter.

The specific thing I\u0027m curious about, however, is how I can use kOS to pass the same coordinate information to the GPS Coordinator and/or targeting pod from a script. This would be similar to how a pilot already has mission data loaded into his plane before taking off. However, if there\u0027s already a way to do this just let me know.

The \u0022TWS locking radar\u0022 is a combination of Target Tracking Radar (TTR) and Fire Control Radar (FCR) and it is supposed to get data transferred to it in what is called an EWR Passdown - that is to say, the EWR tells the TTR where to point, and whether to got active or stay quiet. In KSP\u0027s limited battlespace, the AI should keep the TTR off if there is an EWR present on its side. The much more powerful EWR continually scans the area, and the AI should only allow the TTR to go active when the EWR detects something within the search range of the TTR; the TTR then looks for the target, activates its FCR to lock up the target, and fires its missile/guns at it. If the EWR is taken out, or there isn\u0027t one present, or the system doesn\u0027t have a datalink (I can\u0027t remember what Baha called his datalink part... radar receiver?) only then should the AI should use the TTR as a search radar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current b-scope has the icons fade out after an azimuth sweep; because I was messing with stealth parts I assumed it was because the target was fading out of track due to RCS reduction. Turns out it does this for all targets. On a digital scope the icons don\u0027t fade out between sweeps - the fading out people associate with radar was because prior to LCD digital displays, they used old phosphorus tubes on the PPI screens, whose dwell time was long enough to make a pip stay on the screen so people could identify its position and bearing - making it popular in movies for displaying radar sets because the audience could interpret what they saw much more easily. On a real B-scope, the icon stays in its position until the next sweep - and will start blinking if the contact is lost at its last location for 3-5 sweeps depending on the radar model. Hopefully Baha will consider fixing this for the next update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phas","CreatedById":90083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T18:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey BahamutoD, please consider this small feature request: could you make an \u0022auto mode\u0022 for the radar data receiver where if the \u0022auto mode\u0022 is activated and the receiver is not connected to any radar, it will connect to the first available allied radar?

Right now, whoever tries to lock a target last overrides the command of the radar. This could be an issue if the previous user was using to guide a missile. The reason I bring this up is, if there\u0027s a whole bunch of datalink receivers auto-linking to the same tracking radar, they\u0027ll just be fighting over it the whole time and interfering with each other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because you\u0027re doing it backwards. The TTR/FCR radar locks up multiple targets as a designator (this is called multi-targeting and radars can lock up from 1 to 37 targets, depending on the model). The datalinked launch system selects one of the locked up targets to fire at - the system does not tell the radar which target to lock. So all you have to do is set it so a unit with a datalink gets a choice of targets to launch at, but doesn\u0027t actually get to tell the radar set which target to lock. UI-wise, the player would select the radar and click on which targets they want the radar to lock up, and then switch to the launching unit to choose between targets. You could probably have a tally for the targeting radar which indicates how many lock-ons are left; this would allow players to have multiple radars locking up multiple targets, and datalinked units would switch between radar sets for their target selection. This would allow for homeland-style radar chains and scenarios where a player has to punch through the chain to get at a target within.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quabbo","CreatedById":147955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T19:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMG that Mod is AWESOME.
