Then you can see the relationship and transforms you need..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe item you need in a solar panel is a transform called sunCatcher, it is this that is used by the game to determine how much exposure to the sun the panel has. To incorporate it into your cubesat it would be a case of just adding the solar panel part module to your cfg and adding the sunCatcher transform in unity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will only be able to have one active solar panel though as multiple suncatcher transforms doesn\u0027t work very well, and I\u0027ve tried multiple modules in the past and that seems to mess things up quite badly.\u00A0\u00A0 In conclusion you would be much better off just making some ultra light solar panels for it instead\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T14:39:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frost24","CreatedById":163751,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T15:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you spanner and yes it does seem like it will be easier to just make seperate solar panels and it will be easier to write the config file too, i was just thinking that the future mod would not have 100 parts but a all in one instead but thanks for the help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
