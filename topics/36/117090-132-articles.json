I see several issues with MJ, FAR, MFT/RF and yes DOE but the DOE errors are happening on far more than just SSTU.  Something you\u0027ve got installed is stepping on a ton of different things and I\u0027m not sure what it is.  I can tell you that I run SSTU and DOE together right now and don\u0027t have a single one of your errors.  \n\nI\u0027ve really got no idea what your problem is rooted in but I do know from experience that RO can frequently not play well with things that aren\u0027t supported by it.  If it were me, I\u0027d start by making sure that everything I\u0027m using is either explicitly supported, or at the very least explicitly is stated by a mod author as having no problem running with RO.

If you implement this across all tanks inevitably people will fail to read the OP/ReadMes/changelogs etc and will come asking/bug reporting that either a) they don\u0027t have their switched tanks they were expecting or b) if you ignore tanks modified by those switchers, people will come asking/bug reporting that they don\u0027t have the SSTU switched tanks.  I would volunteer now to help field those question in thread to be able to have the SSTU container model more widely available. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As to the second part - limited expansion to MK2/3 form factor?

Perhaps you could include this as an optional patch similar to the way the Nertea handles some things for CryoEngines/Tanks.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed, the SSTU volume-switch module could be added to other mods\u0027 parts (most of them anyway).  The parts that use the B9 part/model switch would not work however due to how their models are built (e.g. lots of sub-models within a single file; my system expects one model-file per actual model) -- I would have to create a special model-switch module to handle this model setup (or adapt/add such functionality to the current system) (or bug [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) to integrate some sort of external volume-updating api to interface with the SSTUVolumeContainer module....which might be the easiest/cleanest way to get it done).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mage, speaking of adding SSTU modules to stock parts got me thinking, would it be possible to add the SSTU tank endcaps/mounts/noses to stock tanks or mod tanks, including Procedural Parts without plugin changes?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E here\u0027s why I\u0027m asking if it is possible to add compatibility with PP in particular:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E (the top of this Nova first stage can easily be done with the interstage fairing, but the bottom would need a bit of diagonal tanks\u002BNova mount)\n\u003E \n\nProcedural parts = no, not going to happen.  Well, not by me anyhow; it would have to be implemented in the Procedural parts code/plugin that mirrored the functionality I have in the MFTs.  Procedural tanks are built like I build the fairings; there is no Model / .mu file; and all of the MFT code depends on the model .mu files and the model-definition .cfg files, and on models being static.\n\nStock/mod tanks = yes, and no.  Yes, it can be done, but no you cannot just add them to a tank.  In order for the end-cap switching to work the tank must be entirely controlled by the MFT module.  Now, you can set the MFT module up to only have a single \u0027main tank\u0027, and with non-adjustable diameter and height; so in effect yes, it can be done.  But not as easily as just slapping some end-cap switching module on the stock part (because such module does not exist, and the end-cap switching is part of the MFT module).\n\nSo... I\u0027m taking it that the general consensus is \u0027Use the VolumeContainer and/or MFT modules everywhere possible\u0027 ?\n\nI\u0027ll work on some stock-tank config files and patches to set the stock tanks up for MFT-izing.  Have been intending to for awhile now... it is just not as easy as it could be given the inconsistencies in stock part modeling (e.g. many parts are not modeled at 1:1 scale and I have to basically import them into blender to figure out their un-scaled dimensions and volumes).\n\nWill see about getting at least the first of these done for the next update/release (which will likely be tomorrow... spent too much time working on wheels this week/end and haven\u0027t had any time to devote to SSTU stuff ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) )."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T18:34:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Indeed, the SSTU volume-switch module could be added to other mods\u0027 parts (most of them anyway).

Require new code, also yes... a fair bit.  Would have to be a separate part-module with code to procedurally generate the tank, along with the GUI controls to enable it, while copying in all the code to handle the mounts/fairings/volume/attach node stuff.  I\u0027ve already got the mesh-generation in place that can create conic tanks, which is the hardest part (the same code that generates the fairings) (but not spherical, at least not properly shaded...) , but it would need new handling code to actually generate the tanks from the parameters UI.  However these would be straight and completely lacking in detail... it would be a nightmare trying to do any external piping/duct geometry on them.  UV mapping on such things is also a complete PITA and generally doesn\u0027t turn out looking well; you will end up with stretching on one axis or another (or hundreds of lines of code to avoid it at the cost of hard-to-re-use textures).  And the GUI needed to do it properly would also need to be created from scratch; if I were to do it I would allow dynamic-multi-segment tanks where you would position and size each ring/arc/loop of the tank independently and select shading model.\n\nI -might- look into it in the future (have given it some thought in the past)... but I wouldn\u0027t get your hopes up to soon.  I personally prefer the geometry and texture detail of pre-built models, and the amount of code that would be needed to -do it right- really isn\u0027t appealing to me *at the moment*.  However I\u0027ve slowly been working up to it... which is why I rewrote the mesh generation into its current form; it easily enables multi-segment meshes to be created (as seen in the taper/bi-conic ability of the IPA and ISDC parts).\n\nHmm.... if you want to open an issue ticket about it so that it doesn\u0027t get lost/forgotten, it\u0027ll be much more likely that I actually get it done at some point ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  At least that\u0027ll give me a place to start collecting notes and determining feature set, requirements, dependencies, etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 24 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been contemplating adding the ability to modify MFT/RF volume for a while, but the truth is that there are very few B9 parts where the subtype actually changes the volume, and then it\u0027s usually not by a huge amount.

But, since you call your tanks MFTs, I would assume you\u0027re referring to your SSTU MFT tanks and not the Modular Fuel Tanks mod. I only mention this due to the fact that the two do not mix -at all-. Unless you\u0027ve written your own patch to either add LH2 to the Modular Fuel Tanks mod (which I think has been done on that thread)  or try to set Modular Fuel Tanks mod to ignore your parts (no idea), since it comes with it\u0027s own fuel switching and LH2 patch included. I guess I\u0027m simple minded that way. So, in earnest, I just totally do not use the MFT mod, just so I can use the tanks without having to worry about the mod interfering with your parts.

It combines the 1.25, 2.5, 3.75m cryo tanks into an MFT part, with adapter/mount switching, diameter scaling, and VolumeContainer for resource control.
