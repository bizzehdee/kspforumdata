In this future stable fusion reaction is commonplace. With fusion reaction comes engines, and comes colossal cruisers.\n\nThis mod requires Extraplanetary Launchpads, Hangar Extender, Civilian Population, Regolith and Community Resource Pack (last 2 are included)\n\nIn addition to the cruisers Netherdyne RnD will eventually have huge biodomes and space station parts to rival the size of my stanford torus.\n\nHave Fun!\n\n![9MXB8dz.png](http://i.imgur.com/9MXB8dz.png)\n\n![CU1WQ2L.png](http://i.imgur.com/CU1WQ2L.png)\n\n![RxyWqTh.png](http://i.imgur.com/RxyWqTh.png)\n\nCruiser building tips:\n\n- Cruisers require a bridge, reactor, and engines. Other parts are optional but make them useful.\n- You\u0027ll need to attach fuel tanks for ships built with it for conventional fuel.\n- When surface attaching parts, add small struts to the top and bottom to stabilize them.\n- When using the Nacelles add struts near the top and bottom to stabilize them.\n- Cruisers take a LOONG time to turn, even with the reaction wheels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-23T16:12:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2021 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**\n  \nLink to defunct website removed by moderator"},{"CreatedByName":"The Pfaffanater","CreatedById":139040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T04:07:36Z","Content":"looks sick, love all your work man.
