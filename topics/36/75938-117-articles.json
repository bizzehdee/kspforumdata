Also, the switch from TGA is a good move. KSP never really recovered from that issue, and these days you only ever see PNG or DDS, even MBM has nearly disappeared completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the node of DDS, I discovered that if your mod uses texture sharing using the \u0022texture = oldtexturename, new path and texture name\u0022 method, which requires dummy textures to be placed in the folder where the model is (not necessary in one-folder setups) and you convert those tiny textures into DDS, something goes wrong somewhere and those tiny DDS files will fail to load properly. I\u0027ve started filtering out any texture that is smaller than 64x64 and leaving them in PNG format, which has eliminated that problem. It seems that even non-texture sharing setups suffer from failed texture loads when small textures are converted like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to keep in mind: the texture converted utility that was made for KSP a while back uses an auto-detection method for normal maps which, in some cases, will misidentify a texture that contains a mostly-blue color-scheme. For instance, I converted my TextureReplacer fueled planetary textures to DDS and the texture for one of those near-complete ocean planets was misidentified as a normal map because of its colors. When the utility was done converting it, and bashing it into the format it feels is right for DDS normal maps (I kinda dislike it, but if it works... whatever) that planet ended up being a bright pink. Had to disable that detection method for that folder and convert the normal maps separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m remaining skeptical about the DDS conversion saving RAM, though. Sure, it makes loading the game a lot faster since it can skip loading the textures into system RAM first, then converting them, and then copying to video RAM. The thing is this: if you have mips turned on, those mip levels will make the file larger. Also, DDS images tend to have very uniform disk sizes compared to other formats that will have varying sizes based on number of colors, compression levels, dimensions, etc. Sure, in the end they\u0027re all the same in your video ram, but I\u0027m unsure if the conversions we do on the outside are quite the same as what happens when KSP loads them. Either way, since switching to DDS and since KSP left beta, my performance has been pretty cruddy and I\u0027ve been crashing a lot more often. I\u0027m being forced to cull my mod list down a ton, which is painful in many ways. On the bright side, I likely use about 1% of those parts anyway... but still, you never know when you\u0027ll need that obscure part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like, lo-fi, I\u0027ll commit my current setup where I have all of the non-dev parts in the folder structure that I mentioned higher up in this post, with all the textures loading perfectly fine (on my end anyway) and all the model nodes set up correctly.

Another thing I\u0027d like to do sometime is further optimize the textures, resizing a few overly-large ones for the detail levels that you\u0027ll \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E see in KSP, and redoing a few normal maps, as well as introducing my darker wheel textures that I prefer to use... But I\u0027ll wait on that stuff for the time being. I still need to look into figuring out what object names to enter into the texture switcher modules to make a texture switch available on some of these parts. All optional of course... not gonna introduce any hard dependencies into anything. Anyway, all stuff I\u0027ll look into on my own time later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T06:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 06:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T07:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother question regarding particle effects: will it interfere with CollisionFX or can you have MM ignore your parts from being patched?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, I\u0027ll check that out later.
