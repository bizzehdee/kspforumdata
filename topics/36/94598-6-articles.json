Even somewhere like Duna, with a high amount, doesn\u0027t really net a substantial amount even when flying with the Warp Plugin scoops. I tried editing the \u0022scoopair\u0022 value in the part file, and it seems to increase the amount of power needed along with the added intake. So increasing the scoopair value from .6 to 2.6 on the large radial scoop, increased the MW needed from 24 to around 105MW(it also increased the amount of Argon on the LP substantially). So I assume these ratios need to be tweaked in the dll, I can\u0027t find anything else in the cfgs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefineries - The process of turning water into LFO seems to take a very long time. The oxidizer is created very quickly, but the liquid fuel conversion takes a long time to produce a substantial amount. I have tested with the 2.5m inline and the next tier extractor, both seem to have the same rate. Maybe it\u0027s supposed to be a long term, offloaded type of refinery? If so, it needs an area with a LOT of water or multiple extractors. Seems like resources are handled differently now, with regolith and no OSRX, amounts are showing as % instead of PPM, seems like I am getting a lot less water. I don\u0027t see anything in the cfgs for editing the conversion rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, as far as I can tell, this version seems to work just fine with MKS/TAC without modifying anything, unless I\u0027m forgetting something I changed. Now that there is no OSRX the configs don\u0027t seem to be needed.

At and above 100x, there is a sizable and disproportionate gain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting further, by editing the He3 Cryostats reserves a little, it seems that the tritium breeding rate is not dependent upon the amount or rate of charged particles at all. DT, DHe3, and 2He3 modes all have the same exact rate of tritium breeding. It is dependent, linearly, on total reactor output/heat, and non-linearly on time acceleration. Serious problems for maintaining a fusion-powered microwave-beaming satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Actually, the increase in gain does appear to be linear after 100x...for some reason, it just magically becomes viable and the signs flip when time is scootched up past 50x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: So, a temporary fix for myself is just decreasing fusion fuel consumption by a single order of magnitude. This makes tritium breeding sustainable at 75% reactor output for the 3.75m High-Q Tokamak. I have noticed that at 50x time with this vessel operating at 95% reactor, the tritium rate is -0.01. However, when I increase this to 100x time, this goes instead to -0.18, a factor of at least 9 times more. Something going on with the simulation at 100x\u002B causes something silly not to happen to breeding rate, but reactor fuel consumption. The Deuterium rate goes from 0.18 at 50x to 0.00 at 100x...magically it isn\u0027t consuming fuel at that point. I\u0027m guessing this only for a simulated ship, though, not a vessel in background which should behave normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething really weird is going on here, as well. According to the reactor control panel , normally (without my edited consumption rate) the consumption rate for Deuterium and Tritium sit nicely at 32 liters per day, and the breed rate here shows 155.2 liters per day for tritium. Somehow, this is not translating accurately to either consumption or breeding rate, though my bet is on consumption. This vessel has been up for a total of 2.5 hours and (at its 1/10th rate of consumption) has already lost 4 units (liters???) of Deuterium. Deuterium rates: @50x, 0.08 - @100x, 0.00 - @1000x, 0.04 - @10,000x, 0.40 (oscillates to 0.33).
