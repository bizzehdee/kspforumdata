They\u0027re mostly superstructure with some US wedge storage, crew accommodation, fuel storage and some high efficiency engines. I can swap out their payload with KAS, to include science instruments via the US wedges. Its very handy and fun to EVA and reconfigure a craft. Unfortunately when I built them I neglected to include any RCS, so some KAS attachable RCS wedges would be nice to have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divico","CreatedById":119955,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T15:51:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daishi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daishi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... to stop me getting bored\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t want you to get bored.
