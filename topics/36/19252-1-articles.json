Well no more! The Style and Space Plugin Pack is here to simplify the best plugins out there, so all you must do is say: \u0022Hey, I want to build a space station. I\u0027ll just going download the Style \u0026amp; Space plugin pack!\u0022 instead of \u0022Hey, I want to build a space station! Oh, but which mods to choose from?\u0022 Yes, that sounds easy, but most have found installing this pack quite difficult! It includes downloading a file, dragging and dropping something, and launching your game. Although a step by step guide is available, you may need to resort to your local computer scientist to get this one to work. Sorry, guys! Oh, but the trouble is worth it; the pack will include anything from your classic mun rover, to a space shuttle to get all your 48 of those pesky mapping satellites orbiting Kerbin!
