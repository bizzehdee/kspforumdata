Did you ever feel the need to build a trap for a friend on your DMP server which blows up as soon as he gets near? These dreams could now come true!\n\nElektronics is planned to be a mod which enables you to create electronic circuits which are able to interact with parts. You will be able to toggle actions, read values like resource amounts, transfer resources, transfer values and commands to distant vessels and much more.\n\n* * *\n\n**But what would I need it for?**\n\nHere are a few examples on what you could do using Elektronics:\n\n*Autopilot and refueling*\n\nYou have two space stations, a habitated space station (station A) and a unhabitated storage space station (station ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png).\n\nYou\u0027re using TAC life support, so station A needs food, oxygen and water. Station B holds these supplies so they can be distributed without having to launch from Kerbin.\n\nThere\u0027s a sensor (one from Elektronics) on station A which continuously checks the resource amounts. As soon as a value is lower than it should be, the sensor will dispatch a signal to a radio transmitter (from Elektronics) which will use an antenna to send a command to station B. This command tells station B to refuel a cargo ship which is already docked to station B. After refueling it, the cargo ship will be sent to station A. As it arrives there, it will dock to station A, refill the supplies, undock and go back to station B for further transports.\n\n*Traps*\n\nYou\u0027re playing together with someone on a DMP server who likes to mess up your stuff. Time to mess up his stuff! You can take an explosive (e.g. the ones from KIS), wire it to a beacon and wait for someone to approach your trap. As soon as the beacon detects someone who gets near to it, the explosive will be triggered. *Boom.* He sure didn\u0027t expect that!\n\n*Timed events*\n\nYou want to start your engine for 10 seconds every 10 minutes? Nothing easier than that. Just take two Elektronics timers, set one to 10 seconds and one to 10 minutes. Then, wire the 10 seconds timer to the 10 minutes timer, so it gets resetted every 10 minutes (causing it to run again) and wire the 10 seconds timer to the engine, so it gets started/shutdown for 10 seconds.\n\n*Whatever you can imagine!*\n\nIt\u0027s up to you, really. You could probably even create KSP in KSP, although I wouldn\u0027t suggest you to do that.\n\n* * *\n\n**Isn\u0027t that a bit** ***too*** **hard?**\n\nNah, why should it be too hard? Actually, it\u0027s pretty simple as soon as you understand what\u0027s it about. If you don\u0027t like wiring together logic gates but rather develop \u0022applications\u0022, you can also do that. It will be much like kOS, it will just give you much more possibilities.\n\n**But that\u0027s not KSP!**\n\nWhy not? KSP is a sandbox game about creating stuff. We have mods which add robotics, inventories, weapons, automation and much more. Why not adding logics?\n\nIn real life, for example, vessel to vessel communications including sensors to monitor stuff are very important. I think things like this might be great for KSP as well.\n\n* * *\n\n**Planned parts**\n\n- **Logic gates** (AND/OR/NAND/NOT/XOR etc.)\n\nHas N inputs and 1 output. Compares values and returns the result.\n\ne.g. AND-gate:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Input: Value1, Value2   \n[\\*=1]Operation: Compares whether or not Value1 and Value2 are equal   \n[\\*=1]Output: 1 if equal, 0 if not equal\n\n    [\\*]**Memory blocks**\n\nHas N inputs and N outputs. Receives a value and stores it for later use.\n\nExample:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Input: Value1   \n[\\*=1]Operation: Stores Value1   \n[\\*=1]Output: Stored value\n\n    [\\*]**Radio transmitters**\n\nIs connected to an antenna. Transmits the input value (or values) to a specific target\n\n    [\\*]**Radio receivers**\n\nIs connected to an antenna. Outputs a received value (or values).\n\n    [\\*]**Buttons**\n\nCan be either toggleable or not. Outputs a value as soon as the button is triggered (can be triggered on EVA for example).\n\nExample:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Value off: 0   \n[\\*=1]Value on: 1   \n[\\*=1]Operation: outputs value \u0022on\u0022 when triggered, \u0022off\u0022 when not   \n[\\*=1]Output: value \u0022on\u0022 (1) or \u0022off\u0022 (0)\n\n    [\\*]**Constant values**\n\nStores N constant values.\n\nExample:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Value1: 1   \n[\\*=1]Value2: 200   \n[\\*=1]Value3: 50   \n[\\*=1]Operation: outputs the given values   \n[\\*=1]Output: Value1, Value2, Value3\n\n    [\\*]**Beacons**\n\nMeasures distances between a beacon and a beacon receiver.\n\nExample:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Operation: output coordinates and distance to a beacon   \n[\\*=1]Output: X, Y, Z, distance\n\n    [\\*]**Timers**\n\nOutputs a value after a given timespan.\n\nExample:\n\n    - [\\*=1]Value (on): 1   \n[\\*=1]Value (off): 0   \n[\\*=1]Time: 1000ms   \n[\\*=1]Output: 1 after 1000ms, 0 after it\u0027s done\n\n(can be resetted so it runs again)\n\n    [\\*]**Sensors**\n\nCan be attached to parts containing resources and outputs the resource amounts.\n\n    [\\*]**CPU**\n\nPretty much like kOS but for interaction with other Elektronics parts.\n\nProvides as many outputs and inputs as you wish and is able to use them within a script. These scripts can be written using either an in-game code editor or a conventional text editor.\n\nThe CPU will however only be available on later tech stages. It will probably use Python for scripting.\n\n    [\\*]*[.. and more]*\n\n* * *\n\n**Do you expect me to do complex stuff just using logic gates?**\n\nNo, of course not. Logic gates are meant to be used for basic things like comparison of two values. Of course, you could also create more complex stuff with that but that\u0027s totally up to you. If you don\u0027t like to use logic gates, go with the CPU. It will be much easier to use for big things but it would be overkill for simple things like \u0027check if value 1 is greater than value 2\u0027.\n\n**When can I expect to see anything going on here?**\n\nI will keep this thread updated. Right now I\u0027m working out the concept of this mod and I\u0027ll start the development within the next few days. Keep in mind that a mod like this requires a quite big amount of work. However, you can always ask me on how it\u0027s going.\n\n**Does it work with stock parts**\n\nI aim to support as many parts as possible. Every action which can be toggled using action groups can also be toggled using Elektronics, so it would already work with most of the things.\n\n**Any suggestions/critics/questions?**\n\nPlease, go ahead and let me know!\n\n* * *\n\nSource code: [GitHub](https://github.com/flurreh/elektronics) (empty as of now, I\u0027ll add basic code soon)\n\nLicense: MIT\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T15:18:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by codefox**"},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:51:06Z","Content":"Haha, brilliant.\n\nAlthough I really should just finish vessel permissions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:52:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Haha, brilliant.\n\u003E Although I really should just finish vessel permissions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat\u0027d be a great addition to this mod!"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:20:57Z","Content":"I want this!\n\nAlso, have you seen this?\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111519-Proximity-Sensor-For-Switching-Action-Groups](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111519-Proximity-Sensor-For-Switching-Action-Groups)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T12:30:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech**"},{"CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:38:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, have you seen this?\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111519-Proximity-Sensor-For-Switching-Action-Groups](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111519-Proximity-Sensor-For-Switching-Action-Groups)\n\nI took a look at it when I saw it in your signature already.
