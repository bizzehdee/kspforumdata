Didn\u0027t know the process was so lengthy. Heh. For pre-1.1, it looks fantastic. Absolutely wait until 1.1 to make model tweaks. Have any resources on how to prepare for 1.1 textures?\n\u003E \n\nIts probably not so lengthy for others.  I\u0027m still learning modeling, and figuring out workflow and techniques, as I\u0027ve only picked it up in the last 8 months or so. I\u0027m also very particular about texture layout, which adds substantial time to the modeling process (uv layout, ao bakes, normal bakes on occasion) -- its also the only thing that enables me to do textures, as I\u0027m not that strong on the computer art front either.  KSP has pretty much been my intro to modeling and texturing, and it has been a long and often painful learning process.\n\n1.1 textures, if I\u0027m reading the Unity information correctly, could have many different setups.  The existing textures should work with very few tweaks, but would be only taking advantage of 10% of the features of the new standard shader.\n\nThe new features enabled with the shader though will offer a ton of possibilities for new techniques, for both increased detail and saving time, and great potential for saving texture memory as well.  The ability to use multiple UV maps for a model opens up the possibilities to use textures entirely differently, especially combined with the new standard shader \u0027detail texture\u0027 and \u0027ao texture\u0027 capabilities.  I won\u0027t really know more until I can dig into it, and I\u0027m sure it will be a learning process when I get there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 31 minutes ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If I may ask, did the engine config changed?

Why hasn\u0027t anyone done that?\n\u003E \n\nIVAs - I\u0027ve stated many times how I personally feel about IVAs - a near-complete waste of my developer time, -and- painful to work on.  The combination leaves a bad taste in my mouth just thinking about them.  Yes, I would -like- to have IVAs for the pods, however they are absolutely last on on my priority list for the stated reasons.  Some of this might change with 1.1 and the new options for texture mapping/etc.  So currently, sure, you could take that as a \u0027yes\u0027, but in realitiy I will probably be done with modding / KSP will be dead before I get to them.\n\nAsking someone else to do them -- Always an option.  Good luck finding someone though.  How hard is it to find someone who knows how to do modeling? A bit difficult, but not impossible.  Now, out of those people, how many would be interested in modeling for KSP?  Maybe a small handful.  Now, how many of those are willing to do it -for free-?  Maybe one or two.  Now, will any of those want to do just IVAs for someone elses\u0027 parts?  Not likely.\n\nHowever, if you can find some interested, I\u0027m more than open to pull requests.  Will even provide the base modeling asset files / starting geometry for most of them (as I generally make it while I\u0027m making the pod exterior) if needed.  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I was thinking about the 2 men pod thing... what if you used Gemini without the nose? like, a custom Gemini? not a historical replica, just a Gemini-esque capsule  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E also, I found this while searching for Gemini trying to imagine it without the nose ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E [![13755-03-464458.jpg](http://www.foundation3d.com/uploads/general/2014/02/13755-03-464458.jpg)](http://www.foundation3d.com/uploads/general/2014/02/13755-03-464458.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E thought it was pretty neat, enough to share it, for reasons ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E but that also led me to think of another use...

The SMs that are built for the CMs are going to be specially balanced for those CMs, and of little use elsewhere (they will be very underpowered for general use).  The generic MSM will be much more adaptable and balanced for general use (and probably be vastly overpowered for use on the CMs), and basically intended for payload delivery.  That is the entire reason I\u0027m making an SM-per-CM, -**and**- a second modular SM series -- so that the specialized SMs can be balanced for their part series, and the MSM can be balanced for general use (will be like the difference between the HUS and the MUS with 4xRL10s; one is special balanced for a specific use, the other one is generically balanced).\n\nThe per-pod SM\u0027s will have integrated engines, a single set of stats, and have mass and fuel balance to enable a specific dV budget for their intended CM.\n\nThe Modular SM\u0027s will -not- have integrated engines (select your own), but will have variable length, diameter, and several geometry/mesh variants (so tapered/stepped like the Orion SM, or straight like the Apollo SM, or likely another design or two I\u0027ll come across), and their fuel and mass will depend entirely upon their current setup; might even have options to select solar/rtg/fuel-cell.\n\nI guess I\u0027m just not seeing the point of adding all the complexity to the regular SM\u0027s, when the MSMs will offer all of the features you are looking for and will likely be available in the same geometry variants as the specialized SMs (only difference really will be the integrated engine and specialized balance on the regular SM\u0027s).."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T16:49:34Z","Content":"General Dev Update:\n\n- SC-A-CM geometry \u0027finished\u0027, at least until 1.1\n- SC-A-CM texture WIP - probably about 2/3 done, needs a bit more detail and some more colors (what color should the main-parachute packages on the docking tunnel be?).

It is at least as effective as the stock module while being a ton easier to setup and understand what the settings do.  Really, there is only two settings currently-- pyrolysis efficiency (single float value, determines how effective each unit of ablator is), and thermal-input-curve (determines the ablation rate for a given temperature).  Need to do some high-speed returns to validate its effectiveness tonight, as ~2300m/s was about the highest I could hit with my simple test craft during ascent in the atmo (testing heat-shields is a bit of a strange process).\n- SSTUAnimateLight Module - Working.

It will probably be a few more weeks before I can have the rest of the scheduled features for this release done, so it will probably go through several pre-release iterations.  This initial one will have the SC-A-CM in it in a WIP state, and likely not much else.  I have not yet done the docking ports, RCS ports, or the necessary engine model for the SM.  So 0.2.24-pre1 will come this weekend, and 0.2.24-pre2 will come next weekend with hopefully a few more parts in it (spent much of this week doing plugin work for the parachute, heat-shield, light, and auto-decoupler modules).\n- Have decided to, for the time being, re-use the existing docking port geometry on the new SC-A-CM.  So, no more white docking port... but it is also a bit higher poly than needed (though, probably not enough to be noticeable in most cases).  Have re-scheduled the docking ports to be redone in an further-out-version, as I do not really -need- them now.
