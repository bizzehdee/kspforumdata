There\u0027s a difference...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming you are generating the colliders in Unity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re generating them in your 3d modelling program, you have to select your collider object, then right-click the Mesh Renderer, and Remove Component... Then you have to click \u0022Add Component\u0022--\u0026gt;Physics--\u0026gt;Mesh Collider... Then make sure for \u0022Mesh\u0022, the name of your collider object is showing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether you generate the colliders in your modelling program, or have Unity generate them, you have to check the \u0022Convex\u0022 box in the Mesh Collider component...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI havent had Unity generate my colliders, so I\u0027m not exactly sure how its done... I know you have to have a Mesh Collider component added to the object you are generating a collider for, tho...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoyalVengeance","CreatedById":151487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T02:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot it ! I chopped my cover ( It looks like an upside down bowl ) in 4 quadrants , then imported it Unity , made four of those with separate colliders in Unity, then rotated them until I had a bowl of colliders !
