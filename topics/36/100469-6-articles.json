I think I also sent you the part definitions that I have setup so far for Kethane. Not sure about the scale for the parts yet though.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u0027t have a clue as to how to make the part definitions easier for cross platform with out having to list them all out. Unless maybe you could have a variable for the slashes, and before the definitions have the platform.system check set the slash variable to be either \\\\ or / I guess. It would make it kind of clunky though I guess.\n\nOh, just realized the kethane part definitions I did, they\u0027re all classified as utility lol. Don\u0027t know if that changes anything or not. Thought I had fixed that.\n\nNoticed, for the 1m converter, and maybe the heavy drill, that it is importing something, but no meshes. If I delete everything else, then do a box select over empty space, it picks up parts of those two parts. Strange how all but two of the parts came in properly for the most part.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnother odd occurrence. I just realized that my \u0022munbase1\u0022 that I previously rendered had the 1m kethane converter, but when I just tried to import it, they don\u0027t import.
