Sometimes I get really annoyed with science writers who majored in journalism instead of a science. The exotic matter for warp drives has \u0022negative\u0022 mass. Yafeshan referred to it with the Casimir effect, but the Casimir effect involves a special region where the quantized electromagnetic vacuum has a lower energy density than open vacuum. Where vacuum is arbitrarily defined as \u0022zero\u0022 energy density (nevermind that the sum of the energy over all possible modes is infinite, unless you include a Plank-length wavelength cutoff, then it\u0027s just ridiculously large), a Casimir cavity has a negative energy density. Because the energy of the quantized vacuum doesn\u0027t gravitate (one of the huge contradictions between general relativity and quantum mechanics), the negative energy of the Casimir cavity is treated by general relativity as a negative mass, being gravitationally repelled by normal mass-energy. *This* is the exotic matter needed for bizarre solutions of GR which involve stabilized worm holes and warp drives. Ultimately, there are no predicted particles, from particle accelerators or otherwise, which have this feature of negative mass-energy. There are only special regions of modified boundary conditions (like two conductive plates) which have effective negative mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL,DR: It\u0027s fine to use a particle accelerator to create exotic matter for your plug-in, but an Alcubierre Warp Drive\u0027s required exotic matter is not known to be producible through any process in a particle accelerator. In fact, it\u0027s not known to be producible at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: FWIW, my research emphasis is Quantum Optics and Quantum Information.

But I think that, for KSP-I, it\u0027s just a bit too much to have two separate types of anti-matter.
