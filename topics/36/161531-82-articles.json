It will be working significantly more realistic and balanced. For example when you have both Thermal and charged power generator, it will properly load balance, meaning it will use both generators and no just the charged particle reactor 100% and 0% thermal load. That was like saying fusion reactors do not generate thermal heat when they produce charged particles. This effectively means you will accrual means you save fuel, can breed more tritium and produce less waste heat if you have a thermal electric generator available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T22:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kielm","CreatedById":82247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T00:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick question for here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played this mod, and I have been toying with it a little today and have noticed some new overheat mechanics on the regular Thermal Rocket Nozzle (not the Turbojet), which seems to accumulate heat fairly rapidly.

I had everything working pretty well until this update. TTJ and thermal rockets are pretty much unusable in non-atmospheric mode for me again. I switch over to hydrazine and get about 3 seconds of thrust before they overheat and either explode or the \u0027prevent overheats\u0027 MJ2 function throttles them to 0, making these engines completely unusable for any size payload. Even using a 3.5m version with minimal payload results in this. When running in Atmospheric mode it says \u0022Warning: dangerous overheating detected, reactor shutdown imminent!\u0022 continuously on screen, but none of the other reactors actually shut off. This is all new behavior in the 1.3 update for me.
