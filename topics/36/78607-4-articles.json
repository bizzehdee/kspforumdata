Having looked at the source code, this plugin decides that you meet the requirements by manually checking if there are parts with the correct modules on your ship. However, Remote Tech 2 for one removes the stock communications module, and puts in its own module instead. Because of this, the current iteration of this mod is not compatible with Remote Tech (or any other mod that does this kind of thing). At least not when it comes to parts that are affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like, you can test if this is the issue, by going into your Game Data\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility folder and making a copy of the longAntennae folder. longAntennae2 for example, then edit the part.cfg inside so that \u0022name = longAntannae\u0022 reads \u0022name = longAntennae2\u0022. (I haven\u0027t modded parts like this too much, but I think it also works if you don\u0027t create a new folder, just create a copy of the part.cfg and do the same inside it. But I\u0027m not sure.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also after this, you could launch the game (or \u0022Reload all\u0022 in the debug menu if you don\u0027t want to relaunch) and a new copy of the stock antennae should show up in the VAB. Replace your ship\u0027s antennae with this one, and it should be ticked as correct on the launchpad. This worked for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I think that this issue could be fixed without further problem from Remote Tech 2 by simply altering the code that it checks both for \u0022ModuleDataTransmitter\u0022 which is the stock module for the antennae (and the dishes) and ALSO for \u0022ModuleRTAntenna\u0022, and consider it fulfilled if either is present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT3 The Revenge of the Edit: See, this is the problem with me getting used to mods.
