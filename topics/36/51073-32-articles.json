Both the idea of it, and the implementation is pretty slick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re really on to something here. This addresses one of the really unfulfilling things about the current science system. It\u0027s just \u0022get a device to a place and click a button.\u0022 So it\u0027s sort of an achievement-based system, but it\u0027s not actual \u0022Science\u0022. We as the players don\u0027t learn anything from activating the goo container in a Munar crater. But this mod gives science points for doing actual exploration and discovery. And in the process, we get cool maps that are helpful for future exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my request if you get time: Unmanned probes were made fairly useless in 0.23, and you fixed that here. But rovers have always been useless, aside from just being able to say \u0022I built a rover and drove it on the Mun.\u0022 I think your system here would be a cool way to encourage us to explore with rovers. If you made a sensor that, similarly to the Been There Done That, only worked at very low altitudes, but maybe if it had a horizontal scanning radius of a kilometer or so. So it would be attached to rovers and you could get science points for scanning a large percentage of a particular biome. So for example, that would encourage me to drive a rover through the Munar Canyons, if I could get science points for doing it. Even better if the scanner actually made a useful map. I\u0027m not sure what it should scan in order to be useful, because I don\u0027t know what all data Squad has put into the landforms.

Every time I activate a Biome or Altimeter scanner, the vessel starts spinning. I also see a little wobble with undeployed scanners, but not that much.\u003Cp\u003EI run RemoteTech and Deadly Reentry, but I suppose this combination is quite common; has anyone else seen this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have this problem, but mine seems worse. I have a satellite with the altimetry and biome sensors and also a BTDT together with a Kethane scanner. Whenever I focus on the satellite or reduce the warp to 1 it starts spinning uncontrollably. This happens without any sensor being activated. When I do manage to activate the sensors they all work perfectly, but keep on spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T08:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spyker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T10:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, another suggestion.
