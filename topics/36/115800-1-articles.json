I know bout the CrewRoster field, but I don\u0027t know which parameters specify what skill a kerbal has. Any ideas?\n\nThanks! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Epiphanic","CreatedById":147887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:14:09Z","Content":"According to [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103745-Editing-the-traits-abilities-%28pilot-scientist-engineer%29-of-the-Kerbals), a kerbal\u0027s trait (Pilot, Engineer, Scientist) is a function of their name. So if you change their name in the persistent.sfs file, their occupation will also change. [Ship Manifest](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270) has the ability to change a kerbal\u0027s trait without changing the name you see in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:48:39Z","Content":"Wow.
