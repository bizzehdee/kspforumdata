If you spot a bug please let me know. Ideally bugs should be raised in Github, but if that is too much to ask then post on this thread. More helpful than raising a bug report is to raise a bug report with lots of information about how to reproduce the problem, and with logs files, save files, craft files etc. Even more helpful is to write a fix by forking the code in Github, and then generating a pull request \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntroduction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod is intended to identify areas within a vessel that can be crewed by Kerbals and through which kerbals can pass internally to reach other parts that can be crewed. It is envisioned that this information could be used for restricted crew manifest style movement of kerbals within a craft, and also a future sanity mod that takes into account who the kerbal\u0027s bunk mates are. (Other mod developpers have also contacted me privately to suggest other exciting uses for this mod, but it is for them, not me to announce their ideas.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two key pieces of information that are needed by this mod:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Can a part house a kerbal or allow a kebal to pass through it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Can an attachment node on a part allow a kerbal to pass through it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently the config only allows us to know if a part can hold crew. Therefore it is envisioned that the config will be extended, and a set of configs for well known part packs written to ship with the mod.

I thought I would just ask for some thoughts on the idea, and see if anyone has any suggestions of where it might go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the idea is to identify habitable space in a craft that is contiguous, in order to create an extra consideration in the design of craft. So for example a command pod is habitable space, as is a Hitchhiker container. A docking port is not habitable, but it seems to me that all docking ports other than the junior size should be \u0022kerbal-passable\u0022 meaning a kerbal could pass through one. So if you had a command pod attached to a docking port, docking with a hitchhiker container attached to a docking port, then that would create one contiguous habitable space. However if you had a fuel tank inbetween that docking port and the hitchhiker container, then the space would not be congituous, and so the conbined docked craft would have two seperate habitable spaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what use is this? Well it occurs to me that it could be taken into consideration for various features. Top of my list are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Crew transfer. If parts in components of the same contiguous living space then a mod could allow transfer of crew without the need for eva, but if they are not contiguous then this is not an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Sanity mods. I know that at least a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66009\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecouple \u003C/a\u003Eof people have suggested sanity mods. It seems to me that a sanity mod could take into account the way in which kerbal\u0027s sharing living space affect each other\u0027s sanity. Of course if the kerbals are living in non-continuous living spaces then they are not going to have the same affect on each other as if they are living together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy proposal is to write a very light weight mod that identifies the contiguous habitable spaces (taking into account other types of part such as adapters, dockingports etc that could be considered passable), and allows the user to visually see which parts of the vessel make up each habitable space. However the main purpose of the mod is to expose this infomation as an API so that other mods can easily use the infomation for whatever functionaiity is envisioned, without having to worry about working out which spaces are continguous. It would also allow players to easily see if living psaces where connected or not, and so role play whatever rules they wanted to impose on themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60936\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecrew manifest mod \u003C/a\u003Ealready allows players to move kerbals betwen parts without EVA, so that feeds into 1) in my list above. I did mention this idea on the crew manifest thread, and the idea was recieved like a fart on a bus, but then I suppose that is understandable as many players are using crew manifest in order to avoid EVA. However that does not mean that me writting this mod need create a problem for such users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I wanted to put the idea out there, and see if anyone had any further ideas for features that might benefit from the concept of connected living space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-10T16:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2016 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by codepoet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding information about the API\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T23:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euhh is this a suggestion or are you making this mod ?

Provide an automatic means for Kerbals to move through the living area. As in, have them move around the craft randomly. This could be done via a random check every hour or so while the vessel is focused and a random \u0022scrambling\u0022 of the Kerbals when switching to a vessel (if the time delta is enough) or after timewarping. Have the moving time delta reset when engines are ignited or some sort of human input has been done.
