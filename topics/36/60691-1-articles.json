Instead of each successive Science report being worth less and less, the science value of each report is constant up until the Science cap for the particular experiment/biome is reached\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The Mobile Science Lab now passively increases the data amount (and therefore the scientific value) collected by experiments. So instead of collecting 40 science worth of data, you could be collecting 60 instead\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Untested so far): The science cap for experiments/biomes should be increasing as you progress through the scientific part of the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe config file in this mod is meant to be used with ModuleManager to increase the Science Data cap across the board, allowing experiments to be repeated more times before hitting the wall. Combined with the above plugin changes, the mod aims to make gathering science easier and less boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this is a WIP (and a first release of the code at that), there are major balance changes that needs to be made. Additionally, compatibility with other mods is unknown at the moment, but since this mod extends and adds functionality to the ModuleScienceExperiment class, any other mods that change that could have a conflict.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.5 Changes:\u003C/strong\u003E Removed Science Decay for experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the difference between these two pictures taken within the same career mode by successive flights?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/drTB5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

What I mean by the limitation is the value \u0022science cap\u0022 that all experiments have, which says how much data you can ultimately collect. For example, normally you collect 100% of the science cap value (5 Mbits) when doing a crew report and earn the full science value. However, subsequent crew reports, even though they collect 5 Mbits, don\u0027t provide any Science, since the cap has already been reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing the cap lets you repeat the experiment more in the long run is what I meant. Additionally, my mod should be increasing the Cap further depending on what Science nodes you have researched up to, giving even more of a reason to go back to locations previously visited to obtain more science. That, and my plugin boosts the awesomeness of the Science Lab, making it worthwhile to lug up into orbit and use when collecting experiment data (note: the passive data boost only applies when the experiment is and the Lab are on the same vessel; you can\u0027t process the data later to increase the data size...
