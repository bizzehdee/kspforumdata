The forum posts are hilarious at times. I\u0027ve gotten interested enough to try making star systems and was wondering if any dude here could let me have a look at some functioning cfgs for stars and their orbits so I can understand how the creation process works? Multiple examples would help me figure things out faster.\n\nLooking to get good enough to recreate this [http://physics.open.ac.uk/~ajnorton/papers/wasp_quintuple.pdf](http://physics.open.ac.uk/~ajnorton/papers/wasp_quintuple.pdf) Distances look reasonable for interstellar travel, planets and some really \u0022outer\u0022 planets without needing a black hole. Kerbol can be something along the lines of a hard to visit tiny barycentric object if the Hill spheres of the two binary pairs are really large. (Does it even work that way in KSP/Kopernicus?) \n\nClearly never done this before so I reckon that by the time I\u0027ve understood the basics, making the double teardrop contact binary and figuring out variable lighting from its rapid rotation won\u0027t be that big a problem with further Kopernicus development/someone more capable works it out before I do:D.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T05:46:41Z","Content":"Well, I would suggest using the Nemesis example from Kopernicus because we copied it and modified it to our needs (we will work on power curves), but you may play around with our star configs.
