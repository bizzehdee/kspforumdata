So If you are willing to help deciding how this Mod will go just tell me! As for 3D models and Textures, I could do that myself but the more the merrier, this mod will require different sub-parts to be design so a hand of help will be appreciated.

However this brings in an interesting Modding problem, how to create parts in-game and have it show on the part list. If I figure out how to do this, that will be awesome. The way game works, it loads up parts and its configs from the loading screen. so it will be tough to implement such mechanic as we have to refresh the partlist everytime an engine is finished being created\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T22:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T22:53:59Z","Content":"\nHere are a few ideas/thoughts I got about this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst, the realism aspect: \u003Cbr\u003E\nEither go for a somewhat realistic engine design, with requirements depending on several parameters (thrust, use, fuel... will influence nozzle, turbopump...); or go more \u0022KSP-style\u0022 and allow the player to strap random parts together to make an engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRealism would allow the mod to be more complete IMO, but will require mods (Real Fuels first, maybe even RO depending on the mod development) and may not be suitable to some KSP players.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA more realistic mod could also include number of ignitions depending on the parts used, the possibility to upgrade an engine without redesigning it (could be done using tech tree progression in career).\u003Cbr\u003E\nA more \u0022arcade\u0022 mod would be easier to use, but you will reach KSP\u0026#39;s limits in terms of engineering pretty fast.

But if we find a way to actually have a dedicated JPL building, have its own category inside VAB. This will be a great addition overall to the immersion and experience. Engines will be save-persistent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFailures, not mention but was really in my mind, great companion would be Kerbal Mechanics or Dang-it, using rocket-parts to repair or even change the engine overall inflight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd Yeap, plumes will be probably used for this.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T00:17:51Z","Content":"\nNice!!
