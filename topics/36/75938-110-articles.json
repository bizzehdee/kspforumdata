So, while KF wheels and the stock conversions will behave alongside the sound mod, the sounds will only actually react to wheels still using the stock module. Anything running the KF module would rely on the way lo-fi implemented the sounds himself and not the way the other mod handles them. So, as lo-fi said, you\u0027ll have no problems, unless you consider the wheel sound mod not actually working on the KF-configured wheels a problem... in that case you\u0027ll have tons of problems. It\u0027s all a matter of perspective really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good thing is that since you guys plugged in your own sound files to the plugin, I\u0027ve decided not to go with the rover wheels sound mod. I guess it\u0027s enough for me to have any audio feedback, or the immersion to hear a motor running, even if it\u0027s not the electric whine more associated with the other mod. (Plus, I assume that on a non-atmo Mun, where I am primarily taking the KF conversions, these sounds would be quite muted, which I feel might be closer to your motor sounds anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eduring researching planetary mining I stumbled upon interesting stuff; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elarge tracks concept:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJtOD_KEyDQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso new movie take on Mars vehicle wheels is coming soon (looks like weird mock-up and mix of ideas though):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/the-martian/the-martian-01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022the-martian-01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeepOdyssey","CreatedById":91001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETexture extension such as .tga .png is embedded in a .mu file[model file].

However, I joiend the KSP bandwagon around when .18 was released, and at that time the extension in the .mu file no longer made a difference. However, I will say that the stock DDS support is rather buggy and so I would still suggest that the mod author make up their own mind about DDS and if they don\u0027t do it, then it is up to the end user to convert them if they wish. DDS presents a number of issues related to quality (mip-maps may increase performance, but often times you will see a blurry mip-level even when the camera is pressed against the part) and, as I have experienced (along with several others, though we are a minority at this time), KSP will sometimes be unable to load a particular DDS image for unknown reasons leading to pure white parts. Because of this, I have had to, quite annoyingly, manually re-convert most textures back into PNG to avoid \u0022missing texture syndrome.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T18:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I think I\u0027d rather set up the texture sharing for the parts.
