Been playing KSP a ridiculous amount and I\u0027m thoroughly impressed with all the mods. I\u0027ve modded a few games in the past, so I\u0027ve started tinkering with KSP myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m out of practice with modelling and texturing but will be brushing up those skills. Initial stuff from the mod I\u0027m working on will start as cfg edits with the aim of creating some original parts. With KashCorp (\u003Ca href=\u0022www.kashcorp.co.uk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.kashcorp.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E) I\u0027ve a few goals, including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Integrated parts to cut down part counts and counter light-amplified-gain (LAG). These will be carefully balanced, mostly through mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My own take on nuclear propulsion and related technologies (such as reactors). Shouts out to Interstellar for their ground-breaking stuff but I\u0027m wanting to do something a little simpler, more gamey, less \u0027realism\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My own take on offworld fuel-manufacturing/refining processes. I love kethane but I want MOAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Space-station and satellite parts. Karmony and toroidal fuel tanks (I forget the mod. Talisar?) have me inspired and again, want MOAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye on the web-site and this thread for progress. I\u0027m hoping to get in touch with a few mod authors out there and I\u0027m always interested in contributing/contributions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T04:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour ideas sound very interesting!

Thanks for the interest and reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m busy compiling and tidying up some of my early work, several integrated components to cut down on part counts. I\u0027m re-using Squad assets as much as possible with Project Integral to cut down memory requirements and because I\u0027m out-of-practice with modelling and texturing (I plan to change that).
