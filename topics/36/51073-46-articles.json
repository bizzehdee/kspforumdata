The toolbar button (I pulled the icon out of the Unity assets and colored it to match the default SCANsat icon) opens and closes the small map.

The instrument window can be a little wonky if you try to drag it off screen while the small map is closed; it will snap back to below wherever the small map was, even if it\u0027s no longer on screen. But otherwise the windows don\u0027t seem to be affected.

I right click and click \u0022start\u0022 and the options change to \u0022stop\u0022 and \u0022analyze data\u0022, but the instrument never shows the deployment animation and I never accumulate science or new data. I can click \u0022stop\u0022 and \u0022start\u0022 repeatedly with no animation ever occurring. I am running about 30 mods and I am unable to correlate this issue to any one of them specifically.
