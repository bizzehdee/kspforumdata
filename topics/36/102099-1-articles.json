And needless to say, this has made my experience of the game quite interesting. It allows for intense, Interstellar-esque moments, where I have to do my best to save people when missions go catastrophically wrong.\n\nAnd sadly, I lost Jeb a few in-game months ago (he was the second casualty), and I miss the guy. That got me wondering, **what if there were missions where it is possible to resurrect dead Kerbals ?**\n\n*(Pause for dramatic effect)*\n\nIf a Kerbal is killed in action, a mission appears in Mission Control, where you have to locate a specific location in the game, head there with a Kerbal to pray the Space Kraken for mercy and bring your fellow Kerbal back from the dead. \n\nAnd maybe, to make it a bit more gruesome, throw in a lesser-experienced Kerbal as a sacrifice. \n\n*(This is why my mother thinks I have issues)*\n\nThe mod spawns the said landmark at random locations, preferably difficult to reach, and even more to return from - losing a pilot would remain a tragic experience while offering the opportunity of interesting missions.\n\nI have no knowledge of modding (although I have some knowledge of programming and have a vague idea of how Unity works) and I am curious of studying the feasibility of this mod.\n\nAnd, most importantly - would you be interested in downloading/using it ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T21:33:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sovnheim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T22:14:12Z","Content":"This would be very interesting, not just for Career Mode.
