Kronkus has a version of Kopernicus inside of it, and fully or partially overriding a new version of Kopernicus may cause this. It is happening to me too, for instance, and it isn\u0027t Kronkus causing it, it appears to be one of the other I installed...\n\nEDIT: Wait, no, it IS Kronkus. After installing each individually, Kronkus is the one that caused the space center to instead bring you into deep space (near Mun, you can see it orbit every few hundred days).\n\nAlso, I am getting \u00222 errors found in galacticneighborhood/core/StockFix.cfg\u0022 after installing Kronkus, despite no errors with everything BUT Kronkus installed.\n\nIt is in fact the culprit, and I hoped the information was helpful in some way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T06:30:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 06:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YagiHige**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T23:23:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alright, thanks for the quick reply. her\u0027S what I found: I updated to the latest version of gn, and some of the packs work. It\u0027s just a pain saving the gamedata folder everytime before adding a new mod. so far I\u0027ve noticed these packs causing problems:\n\u003E -Kronkus: Breaks the Base.
