I\u0027m uploading a new version to kerbal stuff now, hopefully it works. @moggiog thats weird man, i honestly have no clue whats happening. Can you upload your ksp\u003Elogs folder for us to look at? @thomas we were making this pack back in an old version where the particles could only be set to target stock bodies. After upgrading versions we just forgot to remove it...i\u0027ll get around to it at some point. @medikohl not so much of a tutorial, it\u0027s more trial and error. Browse through our configs and see if you can work it out, and if you have any questions feel free to pm me. kittopiatech is not required for kopernicus packs, kopernicus can do everything kittopia can do and more. theres a tutorial for kopernicustech (but not stand alone kopernicus) somewhere on the developement forums which might help. but then again the configs for planetfactory wasn\u0027t too different to the ones now, theres just way more configurable options with kopernicus.\n\n [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2cp9od952knb7uu/Logs.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2cp9od952knb7uu/Logs.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:07:29Z","Content":"Hey people, good news!

When I do my 1.0 grand tour, I think my goal is gonna be to land on it and return from it. I\u0027ll probably need mods to do it, but I\u0027m hoping I can cram something onto my lander to do it. The last time I did Eve I had to use a blimp to get past most of the atmosphere.\n\nI see quite a few bodies in the pack with relatively high gravity which is going to make things interesting.\n\nI thought PF:CE\u0027s Thudd was harsh. Hah.\n\nAnyway, the one thing I wish for is some sort of visual enhancement patch (whenever EVE rolls an update out anyway, which may be a while).
