That way, the physics is better and I can make some sort of Galileo probe to Jool. Also, how do I make a temperature and pressure gradient for altitudes below sea level? Any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-12T14:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2021 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by WarpPrime\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-21T03:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210576-warpprime/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022210576\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210576-warpprime/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@WarpPrime\u003C/a\u003E You can\u0027t change those settings directly. The atmosphere\u00A0 curve ends at sea level and you get destroyed because of (presumably) a kraken there because there\u0027s no PQS-- no terrain. It\u0027s normal for you to be destroyed when you somehow end up under the terrain on any normal planet. In a gas giant there\u0027s no terrain to sit on. Of course, in a gas giant the sea level is an arbitrary object as there is no point of hard transition between the states of matter to be used as a yard stick, so your needs to change the death altitude (-250m) and to have the atmo pressure curve go on below sea level are pretty empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution you\u0027re looking for comes as close as these:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMake the pressure and temperature curves become unplayable as you reach sea level, because sea level is abstract. Jool says it\u0027s 25atm in the tracking station but it\u0027s actually 40atm (the default part pressure limit).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChange the gas giant into an ocean world with the terrain flattened and offset far down inside of itself, and with thick ocean fog so you can\u0027t easily see the terrain if you manage to splash in it. The ocean counts as PQS, and the terrain is very far down now so you don\u0027t die at -250m like normal.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTurn on part pressure limits in Difficulty Settings. This makes it so parts explode at 40atm of pressure (their default rating). (Ocean pressure scales just like atmo pressure but far more steeply and starting at the sea level atmo pressure so you will get crushed just as you splashdown in what would count as a see of Liquid Hydrogen.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll of the above.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"}]}
