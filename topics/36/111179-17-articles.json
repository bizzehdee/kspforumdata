Yes it is. Would download for planet with rings on steroids, but my game is laggy enough. Anyone have a picture of the planet with the huge rings? Also, do I need Better Time Warp? CustomAsteroids hates it. And could someone make a DistantObjectEnchancement and/or PlanetShine config?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T06:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 06:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheJewelOfJool**"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T10:33:18Z","Content":"Better Time Warp is optional - which may turn into a requirement since KAC can only go so far and you would spend a lot of time traveling to Sirona, let alone the two stars and Kinern."},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T23:42:52Z","Content":"I have been trying to solve some issues on my end, however, we may need to release the pack before we add the binary planets.\n\nSigma Binaries has been bugging out for me today by screwing up the Exoplanet systems and the Yof-Sawob system.\n\nI have fixed the problem up, however, that means removing the SigmaBinaries mod entirely.\n\nI am going to test out Yof and Sawob again without SigmaBinaries installed (I had to remove Yof and Sawob because I had no idea as what was occurring)."},{"CreatedByName":"Pkmniako","CreatedById":138569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T10:20:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perfect name - eh?\n\nNeeds something like *\u0026 Jebediah*"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:25:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been testing the Kopernicus Binary feature lately and it seems to be a lot simpler and better.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t glitch out the mass system in the game - yet.\n\nI\u0027m trying it out on a replica of a planetary system that has two stars - PSR B1620-26, which also has a planet around it (and I found out that I can make 600m radius stars last night!)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T15:27:39Z","Content":"Hi there guys, I wanted to apologize for the problems SigmaBinary may have caused and at the same time thank you for taking the time to report those problems so I could improve my mod.\n\nIt\u0027s still in a developmental phase so your help reporting bugs was (and still is) highly apreciated.\n\nat the same time, good luck with your mod.
