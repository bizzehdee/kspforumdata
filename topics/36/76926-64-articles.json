Maybe you, BahamutoD, can create this weapon. It has this really nice effect and sound, and space battles would become even more awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd regarding the physics range. I still have issues with deorbiting crafts, or when switching from crafts in orbit to the ones on ground, they get the orbital velocity of the first craft. OK, I have to say that only happens with ranges of 150km or more. And don\u0027t even try 1000000km or more. Really weird stuff is happening. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do you have any plans to make assault rifles or pistols?

A reloadable missile battery so to speak. What I did was borrow some code and models from the existing missiles and then apply it to the new rocket pod code. Sadly, that hasn\u0027t quite worked out. Either no missiles fly out of the pod, or the whole pod tries to act as a missile. \u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean config edits, it\u0027s not possible \u003Cem\u003Eyet.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022battlefieldaces\u0022 data-cite=\u0022battlefieldaces\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am currently building my military supercarrier and I\u0027ve docked 3 modules already without any bugs.

This is because of the new feature that allows bullets to survive until they are out of physics range, rather than being destroyed after a fixed amount of time. I may have to clamp bullet range for fast firing guns for this reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-26T18:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2014 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BahamutoD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"battlefieldaces","CreatedById":113779,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T18:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Through my own testing, I found that landed vessels\u0027 collision with the terrain gets disabled at 12km regardless of phys range, so they fall through the surface.
