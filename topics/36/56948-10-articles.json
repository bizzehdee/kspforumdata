Plants are live and, like animals, require oxygen to live. Luckily for us animals, plants happen to produce excess oxygen in the light. In the dark, however, plants take in oxygen and produce CO2 and water by breaking down sugars. This means you need to keep your greenhouses in sunlight (or turn the lights on) to keep your BioMass from completely disappearing.
