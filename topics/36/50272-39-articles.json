Also, my map view of Gilly didn\u0027t match up with what I was landed on. So my tug that was orbiting smashed into the ground, despite the map view saying there was plenty of clearance (I know Gilly\u0027s weird like that, but also in the map view, I was apparently 1000 metres or so above the surface (even had an orbit line) despite being landed..
