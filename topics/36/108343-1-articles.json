What\u0027s more: when I add a part that I modified to a vessel, when it\u0027s right-clicked it shows the proper modded name of the part, but when I actually launch the rover the wheel changes back to its original unmodded state and name, and remains so when reverting to the SPH.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T04:15:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T04:23:19Z","Content":"Are you changing the name in the header of the cfg?\n\n    PART{name = IAHMS125  \u003C-- make sure this is uniquemodule = Part"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T04:27:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure you can just change the value of the turn radius.

I have a feeling the game obeys the angle of the collision mesh, which I believe is built into the model.\n\nHmm... I\u0027m noticing that several of the lines may have something to do with steering impacting the turning radius, so as your rover speeds up, you can\u0027t turn as hard. I think that by modifying the base value the wheel should turn much sharper at low speeds, which is what I\u0027m looking for. In addition I believe I made a suggestion thread about it a while ago and a mod author said he had a tweakable for the turning radius, so it might just be possible. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to figure out anyway.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you changing the name in the header of the cfg?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     PART{name = IAHMS125  \u003C-- make sure this is uniquemodule = Part\n\nHmm, I dunno! I\u0027ll check it out and report back.\n\nEDIT: Hmm, it looks like it was indeed the same as the regular Ruggedized wheel. Thanks a bunch, and I\u0027ll be changing the necessary as soon as I can. Maybe this thing\u0027ll be solved once and for all!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T19:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:57:42Z","Content":"It would help a lot if you posted the original and modified cfgs"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T00:29:56Z","Content":"The part has to have a unique name, or ksp will get confused over which version it\u0027s supposed to be loading.\n\nTo change the steering, alter the steeringCurve values. For each key, the first value is the speed, the second is how many degrees it will steer at that speed. Third and forth values are entry and exit vectors for that key, but that gets a bit technical. Google KSP floatcurves for a detailed explanation."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T02:09:14Z","Content":"Hey hey, it\u0027s working now! Victory!\n\nYup, it turned out that the only real problem was the name. All the rest of the values I figured out how to use them (semi)properly so the wheels behaved like I expected them to. Or rather, much more zealously than I intended them to... I think a 90 degree turn is a tad too sharp...\n\nThanks a million for your answers!
