Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, on the color, I\u0027m of two minds. White would be truer to the real vessel that\u0027s inspiring this one, SpaceX\u0027s Dragon 2 capsule, so if that matters to you, there you go. But since I know this isn\u0027t supposed to be a 100% replica of that ship, it might be interesting to see what else you could do to set this one a bit apart. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several mods in progress or recently released that feature white capsules with black accents. Some are faithful copies of real-life craft, either past, present, or future, i.e. The various Orion/SLS projects. Others are more unique, but still have kind of the same overall look: White with black trim. So maybe you could do something more like a light gray primary color, but with dark gray trim and accents, instead of black. Might look cool. Of course, things that need to be a certain color on the outside of the ship shouldn\u0027t adhere to this rule, obviously. If the heatshield needs to be black, make it black; handrails and such should be a high visibility color, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you\u0027re looking for texture inspiration or guidance, I suggest taking a look at the OPT Spaceplane mod, K. Yeon is doing fantastic work with creating \u0027stockalike\u0027 textures that still incorporate his own unique style at the same time. Also, the KerbonTech capsule is a pretty good-looking Apollo-esque style unit, I use it almost exclusively when I want to use a conical pod for my command part. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d go too far wrong if you gave your ship a similar look. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, those are a few ideas for you to chew on, Tygoo.
