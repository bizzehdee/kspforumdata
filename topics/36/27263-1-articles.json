We are still working on plugins for our wheels as well as creating all the parts needed for the above craft. All above textures will change to show the Outlaw Creation colors and Logo. The Flatbed will have a magnetic docking system so allow easy loading and offloading of cargo. The Tanker will have a hose that will be operable in EVA only for fuel transfer. We will be adding storage tanks to fit and work with the tanker before we release the pack.

Concepts of the planes will be that of 2 custom C-5 galaxies. One will be for that of planets with an oxygen based atmosphere. The second will be one that can fly in both but does not have the engine power to transport cargo in an oxygen based atmosphere. Both models will have some space flight capabilities to allow docking with our space freighter so they can be transported to the planet of your choosing. The C-5s will have the same magnetic system our flatbed will use. This will prevent cargo from moving while in flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those worrying about part count, we will be making as few parts as possible.
