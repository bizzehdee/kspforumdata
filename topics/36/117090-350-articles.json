I was trying with the HAB 1B. That one do not have its stored resource increase with inflation, same with the other HAB I tested.\n\u003E \n\nFrom the HAB-B1 Config:\n\n    MODULE\n    {name = SSTUInflatableanimationID = deploydeflationMult = 1inflatedCrew = 10deflatedCrew = 0inflationMass = 1.9905inflationCost = 1194resourceName = RocketPartsinflated = falseANIMATIONDATA{\tANIMATION\t{\t\tname = ST-HAB-B1-Deploy\t}}\n    }\n\nNote the line that says \u0027deflationMult = 1\u0027 -- this states that it has zero reduction in volume when deflated.  So it appears to be working as the configs specify.\n\n(I may have changed the regular HABs around so as to not shrink volume; all of their \u0027inflation\u0027 volume is for living space, and their resource containers\u0027 physical volumes can fit into the non-deployed model with lots of room to spare)\n\nEdit: Also note in the part-config for that part, that the \u0027coreContainerIndex = -1\u0027 -- meaning volume updates from the \u0027core\u0027 model are disabled (it effectively has volume = 0).  All \u0027user configurable volume\u0027 in that part comes from the volume in the adapters.\n\nSorry, my previously posted example patch was likely in error -- it would work as intended on the CFG parts, but the HAB parts require a different setup.\n\nI guess I should ask -- what *exactly* are you trying to do?  (e.g. what part names, what specific volume changes (from what, to what, on which resources), etc)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-18T18:57:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2018 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T19:26:56Z","Content":"[@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/)\n\nHere is a patch to adjust ST-HAB-B1 \u0027user configurable\u0027 volume and enable deploy/retract based compression of resources:\n\n    @SSTU_MODEL[ST-HAB-B1]\n    {%volume = (specify desired user-configurable volume in cubic meters)\n    }\n    @PART[SSTU-ST-HAB-B1]\n    {@MODULE[SSTUModularPart]{\t%coreContainerIndex = 0}\n    }\n\nOther HAB parts should be patchable in a similar fashion.

I will also change the deflatedCrew to 1 on the variant that have a integrated hatch... sound like something you might want to do too.

It just now occurs to me that it\u0027s possible one of the modules was not being controlled from the docking port... but the solar panels on the two modules lined up so I assumed the angle was right. Is snap strict about 180 degree rotations too? do I need to attempt rolling the module over 180 degrees?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E edit: I ask because I tried to set mechjeb\u0027s force roll to 180 degrees but it didn\u0027t actually flip the module over.

So, I\u0027m going on to the next step -- does anyone have a save-game where this issue is occurring regularly (preferably mostly stock/minimal mods involved)?  Or has someone found steps that will trigger the problem reliably?  Are there any log files available from a run of KSP where this issue has occurred?  If you have any of that information, please see the link above and feel free to add whatever information you may have to that issue ticket.\n\nBasically, before I can even look into the problem I need to be able to reproduce it; if I can\u0027t see the problem happening, I have no chance of finding the cause.
