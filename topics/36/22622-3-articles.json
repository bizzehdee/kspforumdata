If you\u0027ve ever created something and seen or heard peoples comments about it, you\u0027ll know what I mean. On the matter of particle FX, what the Ions and similar engines will have will be as close to the real thing as I can get. The image that is in the first post and page or two back were just some ideas I had while I was learning (playing) the Unity particle set up. Each one is two or three emitters and each emitter has a very low number of active particles at a time as I could get away with, since I had no idea how they impact performance. If I add a significantly higher number of active particles per emitter I can definitely get the right effect, as long as it doesn\u0027t end up looking too bright!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any suggestions for things I can add to Stockalike I\u0027ll be glad to try implementing them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also going to cross post a Spaceport comment on the Electric Engines over here since it was an interesting post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Desperado\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Desperado\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice idea and nice models, I like the trusters and would really like to use them. But I cant, because:\u003Cp\u003EBig downside is that the TWR on all the engines is very bad: equal or less to the standard Ion engine but with less Delta V due to relatively high fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes them unusable for most of my projects, even the space probes are better of with standard ion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease have a look at the engine performances. Using more fuel/lower delta V is fine, but at least give them a higher TWR then. Anything below 0.5 on such a small engine is basically un-usable because when you power a probe on it you drop below 0.1 often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXeon tanks are also not in line with the other Xeon tanks they have too much xeon per ton, which makes them a bit cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my reply:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the feedback.\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve balanced the parts is simply as multiples of the stock one (or same size for the Arcjet/Resistojet). So the larger engines have the same mass and thrust as 4 small ones, and the radial ones have the same mass and thrust as half of the small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArcjets have twice the thrust of an Ion, Resistojets have four times the thrust. That goes the same for the 1.25m engines, except as mentioned before, they are equal to 4 of the small engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think of it in burn times as well. The stock ion/RLA 0.625m ion with 1 stock tank worth of Xenon has ~96 minutes of burn time available. The arcjet, with half the ISP and twice the thrust, has a burn time of 24 minutes. The resistojet has a burn time of only 6 minutes, but a lot less dV available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Xenon tanks, they are balanced in the same way, multiples of the stock one. The smallest 1.25m tank is equal to the dry mass of 4 stock ones, and has 4 times the capacity. They are essentially there to lower part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore engines are on their way eventually though, some of them I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m aiming to have TWR on par with the LV-N atomic engine, but with a tremendous power requirement to match.
