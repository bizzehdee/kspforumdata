Mostly spent time trying to figure out why the shaders don\u0027t work in OpenGL on windows (but apparently works fine on OSX?  anyone using SSTU on a linux variant that could confirm if they work there?).\n\nHonestly I\u0027m stumped on the shaders.  They don\u0027t throw out any errors during compilation in Unity, or assignment in KSP.  They work fine in the Unity editor (when it is force-loaded in OpenGL mode).  However all three of my custom shaders fail to one degree or another when used in KSP in OpenGL mode -- the solar and recoloring/masked shader both render as black/no-lighting, while the icon shader renders some light-blue texture on everything.\n\nBut...at least that gives me a place to continue my investigations -- the icon shader renders -something-, so I can likely work back from there to see why/where things stop working correctly.\n\nSadly, the testing process is going to be long and painful as I cannot use the Unity editor for testing (which is where rapid-development testing stuff should logically be done); apparently there is some difference between the editor in OpenGL mode and KSP running in OpenGL mode.\n\nAnd all this... is to fix some icon problems on OSX; which supposedly uses OpenGL, though strangely the OpenGL specific code I put in doesn\u0027t effect it (though does seem to effect OpenGL on windows?).  Ahh, such fun dealing with shaders and platform specific hackery when you don\u0027t have any platforms at hand to do testing on.\n\nOn to the actual progress -- made up the glow textures for the LM engines:\n\n![WaP9faH.png](http://i.imgur.com/WaP9faH.png)\n\nFigured out some a nice procedural system for making the glow textures, including the noise and banding.... so will be applying that system to new glow textures in the future.  Quick, easy, looks good, and highly configurable for different glow texture outputs.  Basically it comes down to treating the red and green channels separately (using additive blending), which gives some very fine-grained control for the overall resulting combined output.\n\nThis finishes up the reworked LM engines, and they will definitely be available with the next full release (LMDE available in dev branch now if anyone wants to try it out, LMAE will be available in dev soon).\n\nAnd also started working on the SC-D ***set*** of pods.  Going to -try- to work all three into a single part series (early career pods) (and going to try and share textures wherever possible).  Might as well give some options for early craft design.\n\nVA = 1.875m (bot) x 1.25m (top)  \n\nTKS = 2.5m (bot) x 1.875m (top)  \n\nGemini = 1.875m (bot) x 0.625m (top)  \n\nGemini-SM = 2.5m (bot) x 1.875m (top)  \n\nMercury = 1.25m (bot) x 0.625m (top)\n\n![3h1MVH1.png](http://i.imgur.com/3h1MVH1.png)\n\nThey are all going to be labeled as SC-D for now, probably end up being SC-D-VA, SC-D-Gemini, and SC-D-Mercury for the full part/series names.  At some point in the future I\u0027m going to rename/relabel/regroup all of the ShipCore parts into something a bit more organized (probably during the next major KSP update, 1.4, if it ever happens).\n\nObviously very early in the modeling stages, just getting the rough geometry laid out for now.  Not sure exactly how I\u0027ll be working through the parts (what order/etc)... but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll post more info as I get it figured out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-10T20:03:51Z","Content":"Omg thank you so much for those pod additions!!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-10T20:22:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, Lukas1 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is strange, because the other engines (RD, Merlin) work well on the stock fuel\n\u003E \n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E is considered to represent kerolox (kerosene and liquid oxygen) in the real world.
