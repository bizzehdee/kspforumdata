A FLM-7200 and FLM-3600 could comprise the radial drop tanks. I could see using the FLM-14400 and a 7200 for the inline tanks.

Maybe the ISP is too high? 140km/s seems a bit too much but for the KSP solar system. Something like 10km/s would get you pretty much anywhere and back sticking to the \u0027reference\u0027 design but hey, you could always go out there and build even bigger ship. Having engine an engine THAT efficient in real life would mean we could visit Ceres, carrying life support and tons of stuff that you don\u0027t need in KSP unless you play with life support. 20km/s for that particular design sounds like a good target right now, will get down to 10-12 with all the life support for your kerbals which is plenty! \u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work, @Angel-125 !\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to what I read, the NASA design had about 22k deltaV. 140k it is definitely too high for pulsed plasma mode.
