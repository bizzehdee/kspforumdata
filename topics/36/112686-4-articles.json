Also, the side panel is hard to attach to the open truss - is there a way to make that easier?  (I\u0027m thinking a dedicated attach node, so we aren\u0027t trying to adjust a surface attach.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On a wishlist is a cargo bay with a door.  (My current use would be with a side door - but I can see an end door would be nice too.  Actually, I can see in my head an end clamshell door that could do both uses...)  Just wishlist - the open truss and side panels allow much of the same types of use.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Last two are minor cleanup things: You have things listed as \u0027size3\u0027 - that\u0027s the 3.75m size.  That\u0027s a bit smaller than these.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  I\u0027m not sure whether size 4 or 5 would be better - you\u0027ll know the scale better, but fixing it would help those like me who use FilterExtensions find them easier.  Also, it\u0027d be nice to have a Connected Living Spaces config - at the moment the only piece it really makes a difference to is the size adapter (which I think should be passable) but I\u0027m expecting you\u0027ll want more in other pieces as you make them.  (I see several in this thread that probably should have a config as well.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A beautiful mod by the way - I\u0027m just starting playing around with it, and I\u0027m not sure yet what I\u0027ll do with it, but it gives me ideas...\n\u003E \n\nHello DStaal, the bulkhead/endcap is coming in (probably) the next experimental release. As to the bulkhead profiles I went with the size3 when they\u0027re actually size5 nodes because I didn\u0027t know much about customizing bulkheads. However, I just last night infact, found a great thread with a bunch of info on how they work. Basically I would need to write a script to give the parts their own custom icons, but other than that I can change the bulkhead names to anything I want and then they can be sorted that way. My plan for the T404 parts is to list them as T404 and the T402 parts as T402, etc. I\u0027m looking into writing a script that can inject the icons, it looks pretty simple, I\u0027ll be experimenting with that soon. Until then the next stable release (thats V1.1) will have the new bulkheads added to the cfgs at least. \n\n\\*Side Note\\* I finally figured out the ins and outs of the ever cryptic drag cubes. And will release the updated cfgs soon. Where this will make the most impact is with parts with odd shapes, like the hollow T404s. \n\nThank you for the kind words and the feedback!"},{"CreatedByName":"Siphonophore","CreatedById":149811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T08:09:08Z","Content":"Alright, I\u0027ve suggested an inflatable centrifuge but it sounds a little too Lifesupport-ish so I\u0027ve had this idea for a more Kerbodyne Plus-ish centrifuge\n\nHow about a non-IR foldable centrifuge habitat?
