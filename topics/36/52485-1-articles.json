Be it Kerbin\u0027s own Keomagnetic field, Kerbol\u0027s expansive electromagnetic dominance, or Jool\u0027s tremendous local field trapping precious antimatter, you can\u0027t escape the influence of an extremely powerful magnetic presence. It took our scientists playing with some motors in Zero G to suddenly realize the potential of these vast fields of electromagnetic force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotors operate on the mechanical force created from the interaction of two magnetic fields. One field usually being generated by a wire coiled through a rotating shaft; and the other by either a fixed magnet, or wire coiled around iron cores in a stator, or fixed point outside the shaft. When the rotor coils are energized, magnetic action generates mechanical motion in the form of torque. While normally this action is action is equally distributed in both directions, the right configuration of coils can result in an imbalanced force in the desired direction, producing magnetic \u0027thrust\u0027. With the entirety of the Kerbol system all but saturated with huge, dominating magnetic fields, engineers realized the potential for utilizing magneto-mechanical principles towards the improvement of space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENO CAN BRAIN NO MORE VERSION:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrusters that use Motor Action as the primary propulsive force. With the Sun or local planetary Geomagnetic field as the \u0027stator\u0027 segment of the motor, and thruster \u0027coil\u0027 blocks as the rotor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrinciple Characteristics of EMRCS Reactionless Thrusters. The primary pros as well as balancing cons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No \u0027fuel\u0027 required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVessel does not have to carry a limited supply of Monopropellant. This is the biggest advantage. These thrusters NEVER (as far as we\u0027re concerned) have to worry about running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Very Large Power Consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s not fool ourselves. Generating an effective magneto-motive force to move a spacecraft massing several tons requires a lot of power. If you\u0027re running on solar panels and batteries, you\u0027ll be spending a LOT of time waiting for recharges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Very Low Thrust Power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, while it holds the promise of near infinite thruster power, the mechanical forces are going to be small. This is NOT a substitute for say, an ion or plasma thruster. In fact, Ion thrusters look like Mainsail rockets compared to an EMRCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The parts themselves will be heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s wire wrapped around solid iron cores. Does this need to be explained in detail? You aren\u0027t saving weight by dropping monopropellant tanks unless they were BIG tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The parts produce large amounts of waste heat when in operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhm\u0027s law states that current is voltage divided by resistance. Watt\u0027s law states that power (heat) is Voltage multiplied by current. Power (heat) thus goes up with the square of the voltage. And for magnetic coils to generate the kind of fields needed to produce appreciable reaction force require a large amount of current, thus, large voltages. Which of course when you sift through all this electronics tripe, simply means that motor coils get HOT. EMRCS is thus understandably very quick to overheat when in use, and require heat sinks/radiators to dump their waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it. That\u0027s all there is, there isn\u0027t any more. EMRCS, in the concept of game mechanics are simply RCS thrusters in which monopropellant is traded for electrical consumption and the production of waste heat on a \u0027heavy for its size\u0027 part that produces low amounts of thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I\u0027d get this idea out here and see if anyone who models parts wants to give it a crack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone interested?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T15:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great idea, but to work as described would need a plugin, as the stock engine/rcs modules will not operate on electric charge alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is kinda a way around that without using a plugin, by making a new resource that the engine/rcs burns AND produces (see the firespitter electric props for example of this).

In terms of power and efficiency, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s got the power of a mainsail engine, with an efficiency surpassing that of an ion engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, it is also the largest, heaviest engine you can get, measuring 3.5 to 5 meters or larger (depending on whether it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tuned for stock designs, or for modded parts or much larger size), and has a nasty, tempermental drawback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Most scientists would agree that when you take super-heated nuclear plasma and hurl it out the back of a tube at a decent fraction of the speed of light, that anything that happens to be behind that tube is likely to suffer from a severe case of Not There Anymore.
