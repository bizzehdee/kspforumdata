Thanks to Pete the oceans and terrain look really good but what is lacking are the clouds. So I started to look at the behavior of clouds over time on earth to see how to properly model them. What can be observed is 3 distinct behaviors for the clouds. At the equator region the clouds appear to form quickly and break down quickly without traveling very far. This is not the case tho, instead as the cloud move out of the region they formed in new clouds appear right away to replace them. They also tend to form over the tropical land mass regions and travel a certain distance over a ocean before breaking up. As the travel eastward they are pushed south in the southern hemisphere and north in the northern hemisphere. The other two behaviors are based on the jet stream which causes the clouds to travel quickly compared to the equatorial clouds and they experience rotational dynamics as they travel. These two bands don\u0027t appear to be pushed to the north or south consistently. I have some links to this behavior below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3723\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3723\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVDK6Mi_tKg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion for really realistic clouds is two fold. First the easy part of implementing the 3 bands for the various cloud types. The second would be to expand Overhaul to support animated 2D cloud textures. This would added great realism to cloud behavior.
