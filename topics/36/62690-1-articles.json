Each node has a vector defining its orientation, in addition to its position. If you redefine the four side nodes on the hub to share the same orientation as the top and bottom, you could attach just fine exactly as shown in the picture -- however, that orientation would be undesirable for just about anything else you might want to attach to those nodes, since you normally want things attaching to the side nodes sideways, not upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you can attach the hubs to those four nodes by rotating the hubs onto their sides.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T23:44:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
