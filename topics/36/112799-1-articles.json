I just found that when I right-click on one of my modded parts, the right-click menu doesn\u0027t show up, and then never shows up for anything else until I go back to the VAB.\n\nThere aren\u0027t any errors in the log.\n\nI realize this isn\u0027t a lot of info, but I don\u0027t really have much. Can anyone give me a suggestion as to what I might need to check?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLGG\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T01:47:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T01:47:08Z","Content":"Well, I found my problem.\n\nTurns out that I had two apparently incompatible modules there, the ModuleScienceExperiment and the ModuleScienceLab.
