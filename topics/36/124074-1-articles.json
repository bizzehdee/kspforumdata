I feel I am now versed in the game to try my hands at making a simple gameplay altering mod. I can hint it will be part modifications and additions to the community resource pack. These mods will be life saver things like solving the \u0022I forgot to deploy my solar panels , now my battery is dead\u0022. Im asking moderators to answer some questions about release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Am I allowed to write configs that change the behavior of stock parts? I would be using Module Manager with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do I just make up my own license for the mod? Or do I have to use an official template of licenses?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Do I credit Squad for MM edits of their files?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I need some resources ratified into the official community resource pack. Do I just need to contact the author of that mod before release? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Is it common courtesy to credit anyone in the forum that has helped me with new knowledge that got this mod working?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You fellow kerbals, modders, players, mods, developers, and Squad....im looking forward to a long, cold, desolute winter of playing this game and delivering great mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T08:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Yes, that\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You make a license that you\u0027re comfortable with.

Often it\u0027s good practice (even when the license permits) to contact the author and ask them if it\u0027s okay. If you want your stuff included in someone else\u0027s work, you also coordinate that directly with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Some people credit anyone who has helped them along the way. Typically speaking, borrowing from community knowledge isn\u0027t something that you need to credit. Borrowing someone else\u0027s work, however, needs to be credited.

Water, EnrichedUranium etc) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough if the CRP already has a resource that you can use, all you have to do is include CRP as a dependency for your mod and your all set.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
