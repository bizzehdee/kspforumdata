Also, the 2.5 meter to single 2x2 adapter - the \u00222.5 meter\u0022 circle is quite a bit bigger than all my other parts of that size, making it look horrible if I try to use it.

Doesn\u0027t matter exactly, I just sometimes find myself needing a shorter 2x1 block or 1x1 \u0027basic walkway\u0027, that\u0027s all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More adapters and in different lengths, i.e. a 1x1 to 2x1 centered adapter, but the length of a hull or walkway section. Same for the off-center part. Also, how about a 1x1 to DOUBLE 2x2? Centered and off-center, natch. Or a 2x2 to double 2x2, both ways. Meaning rectangle to square, and also rectangle to long skinny double width rectangle, get it? Again, centered and non, as appropriate. These would simply make for more elegant looking, more \u0027streamlined\u0027 designs.
