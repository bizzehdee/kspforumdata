My goal with Ariane 5 was to have one vehicle for launching ATV and one vehicle for launching satellites/payloads. The ECA upperstage (without HM7-![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) will be included in the update, which will allow for the Ariane 5 ECB configuration. I\u0027m not entirely happy with how the HM7-B engine looks, so instead of delaying the update more, I will exclude that engine from the update and work on it for Ariane 4 at a later date. Once Ariane 4 is live, then people can make the ECA variant if they want to.\n\nI could release the entire ECA right now, but I don\u0027t want to release an engine I\u0027m not 100% satisfied with."},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T14:08:57Z","Content":"Ok, that sounds like a good plan.
