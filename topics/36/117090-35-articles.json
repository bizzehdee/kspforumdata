Would it be possible to, at some point in the future, switch to something like UI\\_ChooseOption in KSPAPIExtensions?  I get that this might not happen until release due to licensing concerns.\n\u003E - Likewise, having parts move around as you update them makes it very difficult to make multiple adjustments.  Would it be possible to move the parent part around the part being edited, at least if it\u0027s stack attached?  I believe this is the way Procedural Parts does it - it annoyed me at first but now I see why they do it that way - having the window move around makes consecutive adjustments very painful.\n\u003E \n\nHmm.. will look into the agency stuff; haven\u0027t poked around that end of things much/at all.\n\n1.) Buttons -- Yes, but not until 1.1 is available with the new GUI system; not going to spend time making a bunch of custom GUI controls that will just be thrown out with the next KSP update.  And I would -love- to be able to use KSPAPIExtensions (as it has many of the exact GUI controls that I need); but aside from licensing issues there is one blatant problem -- the authors requirement that my mod be listed on his \u0027mods using this\u0027 list -before- I can release it... that just does not work for me; the mod is already released, and I am unwilling to wait an unspecified period of time in order to publish the next release (esp. since the author seems to no longer be active).  The licensing stuff I could possibly live with / work around / comply with; but the pre-release listing requirement kills my interest to use it / link to it.  And then there is still the problems associated with external code regarding updating; having to wait for them to update / their unrelated updates breaking my mod.\n\n2.) I consider moving the root part to be wrong.  Under no circumstances do I want my craft moved around in the VAB.  Yes, the moving right-click info box is... annoying, but I consider that a stock GUI implementation error rather than something I should need to address (e.g. the info-box should not move as long as it is -still- open; it should only reposition when re-opened).  I might investigate adding a toggle to these parts in the future to determine their behavior, but it will not be high on the priorities list."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T19:42:20Z","Content":"Fair enough ...

More precisely its inability to cleanly merge disparate branches without necessitating manual conflict resolution.  If I ever have to manually resolve a conflict, git has failed in its purpose, and has become more of a burden than the utility that it offers.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With that said, my current (private/unlisted) dev setup is not too far off from what you are describing; only I end up manually merging changes from disparate branches (e.g. change made in 2.04 branch that is not in master, but needs applied to 2.05 branch; I end up manually merging it into master (by copying files...), and from there doing a proper upstream merge to the 2.05 branch -- the problem is this leaves the 2.04 branch \u0027out of synch\u0027 with master / unresolvable).  \u003C--- this is my main problem with git branch management;  how do you merge -just one change/commit- back into master from a sub-branch, using the Git-GUI tools?  (I don\u0027t want -all- the changes from the dev branch, but just a very particular subset).  I will certainly admit that my \u0027skills\u0027 using git are, perhaps lacking in a couple areas; but really... should I need to take classes / read 100 page manuals just to use a \u0027productivity enhancement tool\u0027?  (would rather spend that time learning new programming concepts, new libraries, or new APIs).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [...]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyhow, thanks for the suggestion and info, certainly one of the more intelligent/informative/helpful posts that I\u0027ve come across, and I likely will change up a bit of my workflow to help clean up a few of these issues.\n\u003E \n\nHmm, honestly, I haven\u0027t ever been satisfied with the git GUI tools out there. They\u0027re horribly restrictive and limited, the merging is crap, and they at best only fit a single work flow. I\u0027m command line for life, on that front - not least because then if I need anything in particular, I can script my way out of it. I have a command that when I\u0027m on a release branch and have committed a fix or something, I can then merge it downward across active release branches (potentially multiple, in practice only ever one), and down to master. Making that easy prevents the branches from getting too far out of sync.\n\nAnyway, the command you\u0027re looking for is cherry-pick, as in git cherry-pick , where checkoutable is a reference to the commit you want - I usually copy the SHA code from a log listing - and possibly adding the -x switch to annotate the commit message with the SHA you picked. That applies that single commit to your current branch, as a separate commit.\n\nIf merging conflicts are a massive chore for you, I\u0027d also look into a good merging tool. I pretty exclusively develop on Linux, which has an extensive list of just such tools, all wired up to work with git. Then it becomes as simple as running git mergetool if something conflicts, and getting a good, transparent UI allowing you to pick code lines, or merge them. (Binaries in general should be merged by picking which of the two conflicting versions to use, and anything that\u0027s the output of a script has no place in a git repository.)\n\nAnyhow, I\u0027m happy to help, and if you want, I\u0027ll gladly answer questions, help you find information or methods that work, etc. I\u0027m \u0027gertsonderby\u0027 on Github, my git scripts and shortcuts are stored as gists there if you want to see them."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T23:53:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m glad you appreciate it, as it cost me my entire night worth of development time last night doing testing =\\.  -That- is why I don\u0027t do out of schedule releases, as now I\u0027m behind schedule for the rest of the week (and its only Tuesday =\\).

I\u0027m not sure about an alternative though...there weren\u0027t many 2-man spacecraft to my knowledge, other than the Gemini...hmm\n\u003E \n\nTantares have a Soyuz, but its in 1.2m5 and part are extremely light. HGR have one too, better balanced and in 1.875, but not maintained anymore. Fasa have a good Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, but they come in allot of parts. My point is at this point every relevant capsule have been done already. That should not be a guideline. Whatever Shadowmage will come up with will be radicaly different in nature. It won\u0027t be just part, but part that are driven by his plugin and philosophy. In that spirit, I would like all relevant capsule to be remade by Shadowmage. (exept aset\u0027s Alcor, but thats another story) But I don\u0027t see that happening, because Fallout 4. So I won\u0027t be picky.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Soyuz has been both a 2 and 3-man design, depending upon the era / specific model reflected (model Soyuz-7K-T, flights Soyuz 12-40).  This was the model (well, a derivative of this model) that was used in the ASTP.  I\u0027m also unsure of the ability to cram 3 giant-headed kerbals into a tiny little Soyuz pod.  So, -if- I do one, it will be a 2-man pod.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mostly though, I\u0027m looking for alternatives because I hate the way Gemini looks (and Mercury too...).  That horrible \u0027tunnel\u0027 bit sticking out the front screams... bad engineering to me.  The engineering was probably fine, and they likely had good reason to do it as such; but I\u0027ve always though it was one of the most tacked-together looking spacecraft, which while probably more \u0027Kerbal\u0027, just doesn\u0027t appeal to me.\n\u003E \n\nMy two cents about Gemini:\n\nI am not a big fan of American design in general, It feel that the all in one capsule is sub optimal engineering wise, trough it might make sense in the case of the Apollo, Soyuz 7k-lok plus the LK lander setup seem a bit too complex to be reliable. Anyway, I did like the SSTU\u0027s Orion, so If you end up doing Gemini I am sure I would like it too.\n\nMy two cents about Soyuz:\n\nIf you end up picking the soyuz, I would suggest to have both the 2 and 3 crew variant. The Control panel is the same in both version, just one more seat. Having 3 Kerbals cramped in such a small space would be quite funny, and a accurate depiction of how it feel to be in a Soyuz.\n\nThe real chalange is the orbital module, lunching a Soyuz without its orbital module is quite OP, specialy for a 3 crew variant. I don\u0027t see how you could inforce its use, but I don\u0027t its the way to go. I think the return capsule should be minimalist, 40 battery and thats it. On the other side, orbital module should stack allot of fonctionality, making it almost essential, like large battery, experiment, KIS, life support and whatever else you come up with. Given what your mod have to offer, the final product could be quite exeptional.\n\nAnd now I will go see what I can do with SSUT-0.2.22-beta\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T23:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T00:51:39Z","Content":"Doing some plugging for SSTU in my spacecraft exchange topic ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126830-jimbodiahs-nasa-rockets/](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126830-jimbodiahs-nasa-rockets/)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T03:47:46Z","Content":"I like these upper stage. its quite nice to be eable to do a delivery system with so few part.\n\nAnother bug to report:\n\nWhen you connect struts to fuel tanks, the second connection also select the part. same with fuel connection.

On one hand they are a huge part of space history/tech.  On the other hand, their unique shapes (for the main rocket) and configurations (such as the 3-piece CSM) are not as conductive to the low-part-count multi-use parts.  \n\nHowever, if I were to do the pod, It would likely end up with three pieces: 1 - Orbital Module (Docking port, transmitters, fuel cell?, micro-science lab?, probe core, rcs?), 2 - Descent Module (crew capacity, parachutes, heat-shield, rcs?), 3 - Service Module (Main engine, rcs, solar panels).  Would be one part more than the Apollo/Orion CSM setups, but might be an acceptable compromise.  Could very easily ship a second config for a 3-crew variant, though I doubt I would want to do any more IVAs.\n\nAlternatively to Soyuz I\u0027m considering a scaled-down Apollo/Orion type capsule (probably similar to the VA capsule Jose linked earlier, but unsure yet), perhaps even a custom design.\n\nFairly certain I\u0027ll be doing a 1.875m CM/SM one way or another, even if I just end up scaling down the Apollo stuff (once finished).  Every career game I\u0027ve played I\u0027ve ran into the huge gap in tank sizes/command pods, and would love to have these ready for 1.1.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Doing some plugging for SSTU in my spacecraft exchange topic ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126830-jimbodiahs-nasa-rockets/](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126830-jimbodiahs-nasa-rockets/)\n\u003E \n\nNice work ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Autochton said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [...]snip[...]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyhow, I\u0027m happy to help, and if you want, I\u0027ll gladly answer questions, help you find information or methods that work, etc. I\u0027m \u0027gertsonderby\u0027 on Github, my git scripts and shortcuts are stored as gists there if you want to see them.\n\u003E \n\nAye, the GUI tools are sorely lacking compared to the command line capabilities, and I\u0027ve had to resort to command line more than a few times to solve various problems.

The same length can be unlocked by multiple nodes to allow for multiple possible paths to unlock larger tanks.\n- Added support to use all existing engine mounts as lower-cap options, with fuel volume (no fairings, yet).\n- Combined the split fuel tank textures into a single larger texture; makes texturing a bit easier, but does slightly increase memory use for some texture sets.  Will facilitate splitting the texture sets up into multiple packages without duplication of assets.\n- (Temporarily) Removed support for multi-coupler parts (quad-adapters).  Support for the nodes is problematic and will take time to convert/clean up the code from the existing fuel tank module.  Might have these worked back in for the next release, but if not will add them in a future update.  I wasn\u0027t overly happy with the models either, so they might wait for a model re-work to be added back in.\n- Will be leaving the existing fuel tanks available as-is for a release or two, so that craft can be converted/etc.\n- Have not yet added in all single-node adapters, but they should be done soon (config based)\n\nWill be moving on to finishing up textures and implementing tech-limits for the upper stage tank parts next.

Is there a Jupiter style engine mount?\n\u003E \n\nyou mean the DIRECT mounts? yeah, they allow for DIRECT V3 designs, the 4 engine mounts is one of the last ones though\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t feel bad about the time, its not like it was wasted, and it wasn\u0027t the fuel tank stuff that took up the time anyhow.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Soyuz - I\u0027m a bit torn as to whether I should get into the Russian parts much/at all.  On one hand they are a huge part of space history/tech.  On the other hand, their unique shapes (for the main rocket) and configurations (such as the 3-piece CSM) are not as conductive to the low-part-count multi-use parts.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E However, if I were to do the pod, It would likely end up with three pieces: 1 - Orbital Module (Docking port, transmitters, fuel cell?, micro-science lab?, probe core, rcs?), 2 - Descent Module (crew capacity, parachutes, heat-shield, rcs?), 3 - Service Module (Main engine, rcs, solar panels).  Would be one part more than the Apollo/Orion CSM setups, but might be an acceptable compromise.  Could very easily ship a second config for a 3-crew variant, though I doubt I would want to do any more IVAs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Alternatively to Soyuz I\u0027m considering a scaled-down Apollo/Orion type capsule (probably similar to the VA capsule Jose linked earlier, but unsure yet), perhaps even a custom design.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fairly certain I\u0027ll be doing a 1.875m CM/SM one way or another, even if I just end up scaling down the Apollo stuff (once finished).  Every career game I\u0027ve played I\u0027ve ran into the huge gap in tank sizes/command pods, and would love to have these ready for 1.1.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nice work ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Aye, the GUI tools are sorely lacking compared to the command line capabilities, and I\u0027ve had to resort to command line more than a few times to solve various problems.

The same length can be unlocked by multiple nodes to allow for multiple possible paths to unlock larger tanks.\n\u003E - Added support to use all existing engine mounts as lower-cap options, with fuel volume (no fairings, yet).\n\u003E - Combined the split fuel tank textures into a single larger texture; makes texturing a bit easier, but does slightly increase memory use for some texture sets.  Will facilitate splitting the texture sets up into multiple packages without duplication of assets.\n\u003E - (Temporarily) Removed support for multi-coupler parts (quad-adapters).  Support for the nodes is problematic and will take time to convert/clean up the code from the existing fuel tank module.  Might have these worked back in for the next release, but if not will add them in a future update.  I wasn\u0027t overly happy with the models either, so they might wait for a model re-work to be added back in.\n\u003E - Will be leaving the existing fuel tanks available as-is for a release or two, so that craft can be converted/etc.\n\u003E - Have not yet added in all single-node adapters, but they should be done soon (config based)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will be moving on to finishing up textures and implementing tech-limits for the upper stage tank parts next.

But the jump from 1.25 -\u003E 2.5 is... unnecessarily more difficult than it should be.\n\nAs far as upper stages go - I\u0027m done.  There might be more textures, but the two styles of upper stage that I have made cover 95% of the upper stage designs that I\u0027ve seen (excepting SRB upper stages and the strange Russian multi-tank design).   \n\nFuel tanks are mostly the same state - I have no need for more fuel tanks, at least after the WIP refresh is done.  \n\nMost of the other parts you mention are in about the same state (excep perhaps payload fairings); they are quite usable, and offer enough functionality for stock/non-RO game setups.\n\nThanks for helping out with the info regarding fuel-setups ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, astovall321 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027v become a fan of the Cryogenic engine mod, any plans to support real fuels or Interstellar Fuel Switch?\n\u003E \n\nReal Fuels - compatibility is built in, you merely need to create a set of patches to enable it.  It will then give RealFuels/ModularFuelTanks complete control over the tank contents (for both regular fuel tanks and upper stages).  Please see the RO patches for what is needed to enable this.\n\nHowever, I do not use real-fuels, so I will not be making patches for it personally.  If someone is kind enough to submit some for inclusion into the stock mod though, I would happily accept such a PR, and am willing to ship the stock-RF-compatibility patches with the mod..\n\nFuel Switching - built in, as noted.  You merely need to edit or patch the fuel-definition config files appropriately.  Note though, there is a bug with the current fuel-tank dry-mass calculation, where it is still based off of usable volume rather than fuel mass for that volume;  should have that fixed in the next update.  It works fine for stock fuels, as they are mostly 1t/m3, but for LH2 you would end up with overweight tanks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, astovall321 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so upon examining the config files I see that LH and LHO are already included as resources , the fuel tanks were just not mapped to those resources(if thats the proper terminology)  And also in the FuelTypes config, LH and LHO were preceded with forwarded slashes on each line, I know little about code so I can only presume that was to keep it hidden from the selection options. Then of course there is the problem of balancing  everything to work with Nertea cryo engines (so now I have not understanding C# and not being a rocket scientist working against me)I know LH2 is more efficient, less dense, lighter... I just have no idea how much so.  I changed the Fuel/oxidizer ratio to 10/1 and that seemed to help but the fuel volume and or tank mass factor might be off.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is to  Shadowmage, so since LH2 is part of the mod already ,are there plans to use it? will there be  Cryo specific tanks and or engines ?\n\u003E \n\nSee the note above regarding the current fuel-tank-dry-mass bug, is likely the problem you are seeing regarding the LH2 tanks.\n\nThose configs are disabled/commented out by default, for good reason -- there is no LH2 in stock! (and I don\u0027t feel like bundling / dealing with updating CRP constantly).  So no, I will not be moving to support cryo engines, or alternate fuel types, until they are part of the stock game.  I had the stuff in the configs from the initial testing and setup for it, but then ran into the problems regarding run-time fuel switching for engines and compatibility with RO (needs to be one or the other, can\u0027t be both, as RO does its own switching).  At that point I decided it would not be worth it to do the fuel-switching for the engines, as it is already implemented somewhere and would -only- create problems if I did it as well.  If you -really- want to use LH2 on them, I would recommend using real-fuels or the RO suite of mods.\n\nThat ratio sounds right, as long as they are whole numbers it should \u0027work\u0027.  As long as my resource \u0027volumes\u0027 config data is correct for the given resources, the fuel volumes should be correct as well.  However, note the bug I mentioned above regarding the tank masses."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T16:00:40Z","Content":"I wonder why no one tried to port the RO configs for a stockalike RealFuels patch...
