It adds options to exclude planets with an atmosphere, and the option to require one or more specific parts or part modules on the current vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add a part or part module requirement fill in the requiredParts or requiredModules field (only one can be used, the part requirement takes precedence over the module requirement). You can add multiple requirements by separating each name with a comma, do not add any spaces. All specified parts or modules must be present for the experiment to work, there is currently no method for adding or-type options. For the part field use the actual part name from the config file (the name = myPart field), not the part title. For the part module use the class name (from the MODULE = MyPartModule field in the part config).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.8:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latest version is updated for KSP 1.0.4, and fixes a few problems when parts have errors in their animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.7:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary additions with the latest update are the ability to setup multiple-use experiments. These allow a variable amount of samples/data to be collected by a single part, unlike all stock parts that only allow for one sample to be collected. Set \u0022experimentsLimit\u0022 to a value greater than 1 to use this feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also a new field to allow for EVA experiment collection. Set \u0022externalDeploy = true\u0022 to use this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second animation can be used with multiple-use experiments; this allows for a \u0022sample-fill\u0022 type of animation where a separate animation plays after you decide to keep or transmit data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of boost in transmission value generated by the science lab can now be altered. To change from the default value (50% of transmission rate) set the \u0022labDataBoost\u0022 to something other than 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything is configurable through the part.cfg file. Most of the available fields are the same as those found in the two stock modules. There are a handful of additional fields that control the animation behavior along with a few other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncluded in the package I\u0027m releasing is a reference.cfg file; it is setup with fields for my magnetometer, but shows every available field (or almost every field), their default values, and explains what they are used for. There are a couple that I\u0027m not sure about, and some of them seem to do nothing at all, but most of them are fairly simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is unlikely that you\u0027ll actually need to include every field in your part.cfg file, most can be left at their default values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe source is available on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/DMagic1/DMModuleScienceAnimateGeneric\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGitHub\u003C/a\u003E, along with a copy of the reference.cfg file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe module inherits from ModuleScienceExperiment, so most of the behavior is the same. The major change is that I am bypassing the base.DeployExperiment() method. Instead I create the science data myself so that I can control the experiment results page and what happens when you push the buttons. This causes a few headaches, but everything is mostly working ok. It does however, let me fix a few of the stock modules bugs; collecting an atmospheric sample while aerobraking for instance, or that annoying way the parts won\u0027t complete their animations (they stop on the 2nd to last frame).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone wants to try this out and see how it works for them that would be great. Or if anyone has any of their own science parts that don\u0027t work well with the stock modules, you can feel free to use this in your mod (though I wouldn\u0027t recommend doing anything beyond testing it for now), just include the .dll file and it should work fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently it is only setup to play one animation at a time. I plan on seeing about allowing for multiple or looping animations in the future. It does support one way animations, those that start and end at the same place and don\u0027t require reverse animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the reference.cfg file showing all of the fields. As you can see there are a lot, but again, most shouldn\u0027t be necessary to change (it\u0027s easier to read this file if you open it in notepad with wordwrap turned off).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E/*\n*                                                             Version 0.21\n*\t\t\tFor Reference Only - Do Not Simply Copy All Fields Into Your part.cfg\n*\t\t\t\tMost Fields Are Unnecessary - All Fields Have Default Values\n*/\n\n\nMODULE\n\t{\n    name = DMModuleScienceAnimateGeneric\t\t\t//Name of the module - don\u0027t change this\n\n\t--------------------------\n\n\t//Animation Fields**** Similar to ModuleAnimateGeneric (default values shown)\n\n\tanimationName = *\u0022your animation name\u0022\t\t\t//Name of your animation - get the name from Unity scene\n        sampleAnim = *\u0022your sample fill animation name\u0022 //Name of the animation to be played when a sample is stored in a multiple-use experiment, experimentsLimit must be greater than 1 to function correctly\n\tanimSpeed = 1\t\t\t\t\t\t//Speed to play animation\n\tendEventGUIName = Retract\t\t\t\t//Title of retract animation event/action group\n\tshowEndEvent = true\t\t\t\t\t//Do you want to show the retract event/action group - only displayed in-flight after deploy event triggered\n\tstartEventGUIName = Deploy\t\t\t\t//Title of deploy animation event/action group\n\tshowStartEvent = true\t\t\t\t\t//Do you want to show the deploy event/action group\n\ttoggleEventGUIName = Toggle \t\t\t\t//Title of toggle animation event/action group - Plays deploy or retract animation based on current state - Is reversible while playing\n\tshowToggleEvent = false\t\t\t\t\t//Do you want to show the toggle event/action group - not recommended to be used together with deploy/retract events, too many unnecessary buttons\n\tshowEditorEvents = true\t\t\t\t\t//Do you want to be able to preview the animation in the VAB/SPH\n\tuseSampleTransforms = false\t\t\t\t//Do you have mesh transforms that represent physical samples which should be removed when an experiment is collected or transmited\n\tsampleTransformName = \u0022transformName\u0022\t//The name of the mesh transform representing the sample\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t//If collection of more than one sample is allowed then the number of transforms must equal the number of samples\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t//And the transforms must use the same name prefix followed by a .00x number;

I think all of the basic functions are working correctly now. Transmitting data from the transmitter\u0027s button, lab processing/cleaning, and EVA data collection were causing the major issues and they all seem to work now. The only problem that I can find is that the Inoperable experiment warning will not show during EVA data collection using my module. Normally if you try to collect data from an experiment that can\u0027t be reused, like the goo pod, the warning dialogue will pop up, but that doesn\u0027t happen here for some reason, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s really a big deal though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added resource usage in a limited fashion. I added .cfg file fields for what resource to use (though I\u0027ve only tested ElectricCharge) and how much to use (in units per second). Right now it only works when you set a waitForAnimationTime value. When you start the experiment it will begin using resources, wait for the amount of time you set, then give the result (even if you have experimentWaitForAnimation set to false). If you run out of power it will stop the experiment and give you a message about being out of power. It also displays the resource usage in the part\u0027s VAB extra info tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise it is about the same. The code is much cleaner and hopefully easier to follow.

Try not to set \u0027waitForAnimationTime\u0027 shorter than around 0.2-0.3 seconds, this can cause odd behavior in resource usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other major change is the addition of the \u0027planetaryMask\u0027 field. This is a bitmask used to define on which planets your experiment can be conducted. It is similar to the \u0027situationMask\u0027 and \u0027biomeMask\u0027 used when creating a custom ScienceDefs.cfg file definition. The difference is that there are 19 possible values here instead of 6. By default it is set to allow experiments on every planet, default and mod, and on asteroids (it should still respect the \u0027requireAtmosphere\u0027 flag in your ScienceDefs.cfg file).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll | Asteroid | Eeloo | Dres | Pol | Gilly | Tylo | Bop | Vall | Laythe | Jool | Ike | Duna | Eve | Moho | Minmus | Mun | Kerbin | Sun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first two are special cases. The \u0027All\u0027 position allows your experiment to be carried out on any mode planets, this, unfortunately, is an all-or-nothing option, there is no way to further specify which mod planet you want your experiment to work on. The \u0027Asteroid\u0027 position allows reports to be collected from asteroid, this requires that the part be configured to collect asteroid science. The rest are for the default planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo simplify converting the values from binary to decimal, here is a string of 19 ones that you can plugin \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-converter/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eto this converter\u003C/a\u003E. Switch the values to zero for any planet that you don\u0027t want your experiment to work on. Just copy the values below and paste them into the binary-to-decimal box, it should tell you how many digits are in the value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1111111111111111111\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome examples: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an experiment that only works on the Mun you would use 100 (you only need to start at the first \u00271\u0027, any preceding \u00270\u0027s can be removed) in the converter, which comes out to 4, so you would set planetaryMask = 4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want something that works on every non-atmospheric planet you would put the value in 0111111110010011100 the converter; which comes out to 261276 (note that the first value for mod planets is set to zero, there is currently no way to specify which mod planets to add or ignore).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a lot of numbers, so it\u0027s worth checking a few times to make sure you\u0027ve got the values in the right positions if you want to use this. If you don\u0027t care you can just leave out the \u0027planetaryMask\u0027 field and it will default to work on every planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also made several bug fixes and updates. It should properly detect the boundary between the upper atmosphere and space now, and it respects the FlyingHigh and InSpaceHigh science multiplier values (they previously defaulted to using the FlyingLow and InSpaceLow values for both of the respective situations, which is also the behavior of stock science parts).

It is meant to be either a sample storage type of animation, or some kind of indicator animation (something that tells you how many samples have been collected).

This will play in segments based on how many experiments have been collected by the part. So if you create a 10 second long animation, and your part can collect 4 experiments, it will play 2.5 seconds of the animation every time you store or transmit a new experiment.
