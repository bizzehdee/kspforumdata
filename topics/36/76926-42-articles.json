I appreciate that you are so receptive of requests, but I see a point appearing on the horizon where just following those means an unwieldy amount of parts or a strange balance in what it does.

Latest is rovers and pods with built in weaponry, and have found some things that may or not interest you or other part developers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the vehicles is a tank with fully active turret and IVA\u0027s etc, of course you get snookered by the fact that the IVA does not or can\u0027t in any way i\u0027ve found rotate with the turret. Fortunately RPM comes to the rescue with the ability to easily add camera transforms and multiples of them to pods and parts, with an arrangement of 3 fwd transforms for the cameras a very acceptable external view is available via 3 internal monitors, It\u0027s good enough for a bit of IVA gunnery for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This can even be extended to camera transforms on individual weapons, tests with this have proved very successful, and in combination with the probe control room addon you can control your security drones remotely. It should be noted that in my tests that as with any other animated object you can\u0027t just stick an external camera on a weapon and have it follow the movement, unfortunately ksp doesn\u0027t work that way, so you will need to do this in unity, unless someone could figure out a way to add a camera transform via MM .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yes of course the other cool thing about this is that you now have a camera that can be panned tilted and zoomed from another location\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cJ6QJ1Z.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022cJ6QJ1Z.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote the recoil shoving the tank back up the runway, love that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question pops to mind however, is it just me or , does module light not like BDarmory,?

The IS-3 for example, has a piked nose and angling will only hurt it. The King Tiger however benefits massively - the frontal armor is unpenetrable by any gun \u0026lt; ~200mm of penetration, and angling makes it even harder to do so. However, the Panzer IV benefits very little - 80mm frontal armor to 30mm side on the Pz4G means that the armor can only be angled up to 86mm effectiveness. I understand the Pz4H has spaced armor on the sides of its hull and turret (the turret also has rear spaced) and that would help. Actually I need to test spaced armor a bit...
