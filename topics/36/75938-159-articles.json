I deleted all my crafts with rover wheels, and this solved the problem for the smallest size double rover wheel.

Somehow, hitting that button once on a craft and having it saved was enough to mess up all the other wheels. The other KF Small rover single wheels still do not animate or deploy properly, but they may never have worked correctly in the first place. At least the smallest wheels now work.

That\u0027s something I\u0027ve wanted to look into for a while now: making the suspension optional. There\u0027s already a check in the module(s) for whether the part is simply a non-interactive wheel, or if it\u0027s a fully functional wheel (for unpowered trailers and such) and I think the same logic behind that could be used to simply default the suspension values to zero and remove their tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth options are in the works, just not a priority right now.

The animation has a noticeable \u0022snap\u0022 from retraction / resting point ... but I know he can work that out in time.

He\u0027s been burned by taking dependencies on other mods in the past. My personal opinion is that quite a few mod authors are waiting for the 1.1 hammer to drop, fixing their own stuff, then figuring out what to do from there. Roverdude loves to collaborate with other modders and actively encourages sharing / playing nice together. I\u0027m optimistic that if folks reach out to him, he would be receptive.

I have newfound respect for all the folks who make mods. I completely understand mod makers who were actively developing their mods 5 KSP versions ago being slow to update until KSP settles down. There has to be some burnout after a certain threshold. Unfortunately it also puts the people who take dependencies on someone elses\u0027 work in a bad spot if they don\u0027t update as quickly.

So, I\u0027ll definitely be playing with that over time. It\u0027s probably born from a common trait amongst geeks known as a \u0022god complex\u0022 which urges us towards a goal of \u0022ruling the world\u0022 in which I am helplessly drawn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the unity animations and such, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too lazy to figure all that out. I figure it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be able to simply set that up itself when the asset is imported into the project, just like blender is able to import it from the .mu file. Anyway, Unity didn\u0027t show me anything that I wasn\u0027t getting already in blender, I\u0027m just too lazy to do all the work of trying to figure out what I should set everything to for your module to make it interact with a part that makes no sense to me.This is especially true if RoverDude \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E use some of your tricks. I could never make much sense of your parts either. I suppose we all have our specialties.

First off, are you using the absolute latest release of TweakScale? What is it you see in the part context menu? For example: Do you get a blank spot where the TweakScale controls would normally be in the part context menu (as in an actual space that has nothing in it), or is there simply no option for it on the part at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S1000RRHP4","CreatedById":110137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T18:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the latest version of tweakscale (2.2.1) and i will show you some screen of the Small Wheel context menu\u0027s and a panel from an other Kf Wheel on which i can change the scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appear that i simply haven\u0027t any tweakscale option in the panel for the small wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESMALL WHEEL:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XyM2tO7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XyM2tO7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTHER KF-WHEEL:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OBM97T7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OBM97T7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T03:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotcha, thank you. I\u0027ll look at the latest release package and get back to you here. I was pretty sure everything was set up properly, but mistakes do happen. One thing you can do to help, in the mean time, is to go into the KerbalFoundries mod folder and look for the \u0022WheelSmall.cfg\u0022 in the Parts folder. Open that up and look for a module in that part that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE:NEEDS[TweakScale]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    name = TweakScale\u003Cbr\u003E    type = KFWheelSmall\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is not present in the file, then that would be our problem. If, however, you do see that in the file then there\u0027s more going on here than a simply module definition and this all becomes just a tad more complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: I checked both the latest KF release, my local install, and even my MM cache and, in all instances, the TweakScale module remained intact on the part in question. Given these facts, there are only a few things that could be happening on your end. First off, the module could be somehow missing from your small wheel config. In that case, you could simply add the module with the code in the above code block into that part\u0027s config and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, somehow the \u0022NEEDS\u0022 check for the module could be evaluating false on your system. Changing \u0022:NEEDS[TweakScale]\u0022 to \u0022:NEEDS[scale]\u0022 would be more accurate and less likely to evaluate as false if you have TweakScale installed, but the folder name isn\u0027t being registered quite right somehow. Alternatively you could simply remove the entire \u0022:NEEDS[TweakScale]\u0022 part of the module definition, since you obviously have TweakScale installed already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third option, which is a very hard one to track down, is that there\u0027s an MM patch being run somewhere after it checks the part config\u0027s \u0022NEEDS\u0022 field which is removing the module from a wildcard search of part names. If this is the case, there\u0027s nothing i can really do about it except urge you to inspect any configs that may have MM patches, and may contain wildcard searches within those patches, and of which may be removing the TweakScale module within any of those matching parts that it finds, and... well, disable them or find a way to exclude the KF parts from it. I really hope it\u0027s not the third option however, cause those are annoying as heck.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T07:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S1000RRHP4","CreatedById":110137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T05:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the module in that part, exactly the same, and i did look in the .cfg of the tiny wheel, they have the same module, but in the game i am able to change the scale of the tiny wheel and i am not able to change the scale of the small wheel.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei looked at the .cfg of multiple KF part and i don\u0027t understand why the small wheel are the only one to be exclude.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore i asked for help, i tried to fix this problem myself, i tried to change the tweakscale\u0027s module of that part in: \u0022type= free\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut it didn\u0027t work at all the part is always exclude from tweakscale, even if i delete all the KF part, the small wheel is always excluded....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try a completely fresh install, and try with only tweakscale and KF, and i will add one by one each mod i have, that way i could find which one have an MM patches who conflict with that only part...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei keep you updated, i can only do that later today\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T07:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is really weird, and I was afraid that it might come down to that.
