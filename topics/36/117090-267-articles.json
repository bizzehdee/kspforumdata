In theory these curves were supposed to allow for the part to heat up to a given point before the ablation kicked in, increase ablation as heat increased to a point, but still allow for the re-entry to \u0027overpower\u0027 the ablation rate (resulting in higher part temps, and eventual explosions/loss of the heat shield part).\n\u003E \u003C/flux\u003E\u003C/part\u003E\u003C/output\u003E\n\u003E \n\nThanks for pointing this out, i might give this a try.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With the pods the difference between the CM and CMX is less than the heat shield mass, as the CMX versions should have more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel and higher dry mass to simulate the additional \u0027supplies\u0027 on board (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, etc, that mass is actually in the supplies rather than simulated, and the parts dry mass should be adjusted accordingly).

I previously used 7-zip, but it has licensing problems that prevent me from keeping it in the release repo.  So I was looking for something a bit more built-in, which lead me to the PowerShell commands.  Apparently these use a different .zip algorithm/encoding that OSX struggles with.\n\nAnyone aware of any \u0027free\u0027 (as in non-license encumbered) command-line zip utilities for Windows?\n\n(Edit:  Looking into using the exising C# .zip libraries... was already going to make a short thing that incremented build #\u0027s... might as well include the .zip functionality in it as well)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Sudragon said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Was there a fix for the SSTU solr panels opening during selection in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003E \n\nCannot fix that which was not reported.\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen any issue ticket on that problem, and don\u0027t recall ever hitting it during personal testing (which I did quite a bit of over the weekend).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-05T14:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2017 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T14:41:08Z","Content":"OK, I assumed I was just doing something wrong, or that the Windows install paradigm was different than what I have been doing forever.
