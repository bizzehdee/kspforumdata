Both have a different approach to building surface bases, but has EP support.

Pathfinder uses \u0022inflatable hab technology\u0022 you can shove into a container to land on the surface and takes a kerbal to put the modules onto the segments you inflate.

Mine is not a small mod load either.  I\u0027m running a total of 175 mods and all is well even with all of the above installed.  I\u0027ve even got stations integrated with SSTU/MKS parts and using the MKS resource chain and not a single hiccup.  The initial change over when GC/CC was added caused some goofy things to happen, but the quick update that followed made every single issue disappear for me FWIW.  I am changing my plans for my upcoming orbital assembly dock away from MKS and using the SpaceDock mod for my build location in the event that it doesn\u0027t cooperate with EPL any longer - I don\u0027t know if it does or not.  \n\nAll that said, as far as base building and life support goes, that\u0027s my world in KSP that I live in pretty much all the time since I love long colony games.  [@ComatoseJedi](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91567-comatosejedi/) is correct that the only other two very actively developed and complete base building mods out there is the Wild Blue series from [@Angel-125](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/) and KPBS from [@Nils277](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122414-nils277/).  Angel\u0027s Wild Blue series is heavily integrated with EPL and has numerous unique approaches to science, building and resource management.  It is largely ground oriented and relies on other mod\u0027s for life support systems.  The nice part of Wild Blue is the ability to create whatever template you want to insert into the system.  This is how players have integrated several of their favorites into the functionality of Wild Blue.  KPBS from Nils I haven\u0027t played with recently although I have heavy, heavy experience with it in the past.  The last time I left off with it he had heavily integrated TACLS support, EPL production chains and resource management that was largely based around stock/EPL but he was making great strides in getting support for MKS as well.  Nils always used to maintain an extremely heavy level of activity with KPBS so it wouldn\u0027t surprise me to find that it\u0027s far beyond where it was at when I last used it.\n\nAs for life support.  No.  Nothing.  TACLS, USILS and Snacks are pretty much it for widely supported mods and of course there\u0027s Kerbalism which is awesome if you don\u0027t mind sacrifice of many other mods.  If I can offer my 2 cents of a suggestion.  If you have to bail on MKS construction because of GC and need to abandon that portion of the resource chain I don\u0027t really see an issue even in the slightest although keeping it would be the best result if possible.  The fact is, the construction resource chain of MKS is strongly tied up in the MKS modules and planetary logistics now.  It makes more sense when setting up colonies to keep heavy resources like ore, uranite and metals on the ground in bulk storage containers where it can be easily harvested into and access them from orbit using the planetary logistics and MKS comes custom made with these cans of course.  Unless you planned on mirroring that functionality somewhere within SSTU modules then I don\u0027t see it as any great loss - again with the caveat that keeping it would be the ideal result.\n\nThat said - the loss of USILS would be tragic.  The combination of the life support requirements and habitation requirements give it the lightest \u0022realest\u0022 touch I think can be found for KSP.  This is coming from someone who refused to convert from TACLS all the way up until I didn\u0027t have a life support system available to me when it died shortly around the release of 1.1.2ish.  TACLS is no longer expanding and to my knowledge, neither is Snacks which is one of the main reasons why USILS is so attractive and it\u0027s loss would hurt."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T14:46:09Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), if you want to take a look at implementing WildBlue Technologies on BaseCore, I heard [@Angel-125](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/) is part of some secret kerbal discord society ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T14:51:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), if you want to take a look at implementing WildBlue Technologies on BaseCore, I heard [@Angel-125](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/) is part of some secret kerbal discord society ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n\\*nudge nudge\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T17:50:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), if you want to take a look at implementing WildBlue Technologies on BaseCore, I heard [@Angel-125](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/) is part of some secret kerbal discord society ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nI can neither confirm nor deny..."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T17:52:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, Angel-125 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can neither confirm nor deny...\n\u003E \n\nI heard it on one of those internet conspiracy theories videos"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T19:35:19Z","Content":"I\u0027m going to give it a bit before I decide which way to go on the MKS stuff.

My original goal was to have it cleaned up by end of Feb. and move onto maintenance mode from there (and new part modeling/development...but plugin should be \u0027done\u0027), and still look to be mostly on track for that goal.\n\nOne thing that may possibly be showing up in KF, but be of benefit to SSTU, will be pre-built landing leg sets.  These would be dual, triple, and quad configurations of landing legs intended to use stack (node) attachment onto the bottom of fuel tanks (between the tank and engine/decoupler/whatever would normally be on the bottom), in both horizontal and vertical configurations.  These would include both scaling support, and diameter adjustment.  Single legs will still be available that use standard surface-mounting for \u0027normal\u0027 uses, but I feel the stack-mount leg sets will also be able to accommodate many standard uses.\n\nHave also spent quite a bit of time investigating the MKS situation.  The problem I am having was/is with the inclusion of Configurable Containers in the distro -- I already have my own fuel tank system, and really don\u0027t need another one messing around with -any- parts in my install (I\u0027ve slowly been patching out the B9/IFS/FS fuel switching through optional patches).  Thankfully it looks like this situation should be cleaned up in the near future by RD and Allista (supposedly already has been, but awaiting updated releases with proper packaging).  Even if it isn\u0027t fixed on their end, I did a bit of code-fu and determined that there is no plugin-level dependencies between GC and CC -- it is merely included because some of the -parts- used in GC use the CC containers.  Those parts are not necessary to the functioning of the GC mod, so can be safely removed, along with all remnants of CC (plugin, configs, etc).  And as long as there are no plugin-level dependencies between MKS and GC, I can even remove GC entirely (apparently there will be some config-level dependencies, but those can be solved through patches).\n\nSo now I\u0027m just \u0027stuck\u0027 with coming up with my own EPL-MKS patch set, shipyard models, and finishing off my optional patches for the rest of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff.

I\u0027m working through the final cleanup steps on the model now, and will likely be moving onto the UV/texturing within a day or two.  The plans are to take this base model and also create the RD-171 and RD-190 engines from it, so this should result in three new engines being available with the next SSTU release.
