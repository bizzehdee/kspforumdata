So R is the radius of the thing. Ok, what is the unit? Is it meters? Default setting is Kerbin so shouldn\u0027t the radius be 300k to get the 600k diameter? Why is it 6 million? Rl is the \u0022limit\u0022. What does that mean? How is that different from height? It also makes no sense to give a \u0022height\u0022 as a radius. The half-values are much better, they have an explicit unit and are actual heights above the surface.\n\nWhat does \u0022beta\u0022 mean? Absorption? Scattering? What is the unit? Is it wavelengths? The value tweaks the colour somehow, but how? What is \u0022G\u0022? Is reflectance a percentage?\n\nSetting these values according to what I think it might be is clearly getting me the wrong results. It\u0027s a beautiful shader but at least take 5 minutes to write a readme or something with a usable guide for this stuff.\n\nUndocumented features don\u0027t exist.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T20:47:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BmB**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkway","CreatedById":142879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:07:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Done a little testing with your latest version (which you had posted somewhere in here)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
