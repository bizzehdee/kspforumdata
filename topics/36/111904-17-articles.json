Probably Bobcat confused Node 1 (Unity) and Node 2-3 (Harmony, Tranquility) models when texturing.

Every time I need to offset the two CBMs and put them more inside the module. In my opinion, they should be slightly thighter, but offsetting is ok for now.\n\n-S0 Truss: the support structures should be reshaped considering that Node 1 needs to be remade and the space occupied from the CBMs should be thighter. \n\n-JEM: the JEM main module texture is gross, compared to the other modules textures\n\n-JEM arm and Canadarm: in my opinion they should be faster by default when moving.\n\n-Truss and Panels: I find that the old system of making the trusses sun-tracking was ok.

Man, we love your work, maybe someone can take it and bring it on! I updated to 1.0.4 from a safe and plenty of mods 0.90 only to enjoy your pack.

However, you literally SAVED the ISS, Shuttle, MIR, Soyuz, Proton, Progress, Dreamchaser mod even adding other brilliant components! Without you, KSP wouldn\u0027t have real launchers, rocket, stations and a working shuttle on 1.0.4! Think about it! Why don\u0027t you just slow it down? You were a update-machinegun, other developers only update every month/3 weeks...
