I expect the game to change, the issue with the changes is the more mods you make, the more things you have to update. I can barely keep on track of the small amount of things I\u0027ve made, I can only imagine bobcat or someone similar who has made many many mods, updating all your mods can be a very time consuming practice, especially when you need to completely rebalance the entire craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am all for releasing things early and just seeing how they go, but I also do not produce anything near the quality of this mini shuttle.

He could just as easily not put up this thread and work on it, and no one would be any wiser. But no, instead he created a thread so you might both add your input and also learn a thing or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he wants to use modular fuel systems, that\u0027s cool. If he wants to use fancy plugins, that\u0027s his perogative. If he want\u0027s to polish it to the point that you could eat your dinner off of it, then that\u0027s cool too. The point is, it\u0027s his shuttle. Yes, it looks superb and all of us can\u0027t wait to fly it, but I would rather wait until he is happy that what we are flying is what he has intended, rather than what people pressured him into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowsutekh","CreatedById":55189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T00:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.22 should not break this mod in sandbox.

ZRM has talked about it quite a bit. It\u0027s pretty much required to make an actually realistic space shuttle, since it allows you to use different fuel types like in real life. So hydrogen-oxygen in the giant external tank (low-density, high ISP) and some sort of hypergolic in the orbiter itself (high-density, low isp, for the volume-limited shuttle. Could be standard ksp fuel or something \u0022realistic\u0022)\u003Cp\u003EIf you used stock fuels only you would have to shrink the external tank by a lot or else it would have a ridiculous amount of fuel and be extremely heavy.

It requires some practice and I\u0027ve been doing my gravity turn by hand. When transitioning and jettisoning the LRBs I\u0027m lowering the engines down to about 15% to keep the transition smooth (with about 3% fuel left in the LRBs).
