Im going to test it in an hour but it sounds like it flies completely different than it did before the upgrade. Can you confirm this SP? If so it is much easier to find the problem.\n\nMike, with stock aero it bleeds speed so fast you can only fly like 20 meters. Thats the reason of the dragmodel override. Without the lifting surfaces you cannot control it until 6000 alt. Thats when the control surfs kick in.\n\nWith the pre patch CoM location you needed a 12 degrees y axis OMS gimbal. Due to the fuel change the CoM is shifted. That should explain the OMS control issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T07:18:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeast**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T07:19:33Z","Content":"Let menknow what you come up with.

I flew a couple of reentries while editing the configs everytime. My observations are that with the lifting surfaces removed and only the elevons acting as lifting objects we could probably get there. The fact is that this doesn\u0027t do anything to drag. The problem is that the thing bleeds speed very fast until the flare. It is now impossible to do S turns, fly a 20 degree final, come in and 120 m/s for the flare and land at 87m/s. It already bleeds you to 80 m/s till when you are over the runway treshold."},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:18:52Z","Content":"I think i saw something like a drag modifier, due to the fact it IS somewhat aerodynamic (FAR says, too) o guess it wouldnt be much of a problem to correct that downwards.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWith FAR installed it may be not flyable, but the mass exceeds the drag by far (lol)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:27:11Z","Content":"Oh yeah Mike, there is something wrong with the right gear.

The drag gets auto calculated by KSP using the mass and shape of the object.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI hate to say this but my guess is that it is impossible to get this thing flying realistic due to the way KSP works and calculates stuff. We have to compromise. Do we want this thing to float realstic and be able to do S-turns and glide in from further out? Or do we want this thing to stall at around 55 m/s so the landing is a bit harder? I think these 2 are the options.

You can glide and land at around 85 m/s with stall speed at 55 m/s. There are a lot of topics on this forum showing that SSTO\u0027s are now kinda impossible to make realistic.\n\nIn my opionion we can do 2 things. 1 = wait for a new patch. 2 = go FAR all the way and see how this goes. My bet is that we can get pretty close to realism with FAR (I once created a shuttle for Real Solar Systems from scratch)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T11:16:56Z","Content":"cheech. did you download the patch I put up today?"}]}
