I\u0027ve got one 1440p display, and two 1080p displays. I run KSP on the 1440p. Only problem is that I have issues with running two instances in full screen. The problem is, I can\u0027t get the second copy of KSP to run correctly in full screen on either of my 1080p displays. When I go into fullscreen mode on another monitor, it scales up to the size of 1440p regardless of my set resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally - I really wish KSP didn\u0027t use the mac native fullscreen. It would be better if it just made itself fullscreen on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
