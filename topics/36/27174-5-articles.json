There is a new version for 0.20, but it looks like people are having some trouble with it, so I haven\u0027t switched over our parts to it yet. Unless they stop working with the game (which I don\u0027t expect them to anytime soon), I\u0027ll hold off on converting them over until I\u0027ve had a chance to play around with the new parttools. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get Unity for yourself, there are a couple of tutorials on the forums that show the full process to import a model in, then export a part back out.
