I was worried that changing things too much (like adding the weathering on the decals) was going to turn people against the pack. After all one of things I wanted, and that others have stated, was that they like the clean lines of this pack. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t modify the base textures that much. I\u0027d to think that the decals on the tanks would be stencils and sprayed on...they are Kerbals after all. One of my biggest complaints about some of the stock parts is the slightly dirty, scratched, and banged-up appearance of some of the parts. It was especially noticeable on the ARM pack parts and bugged me to no end. So you have my promise here that the tanks will always be clean and relatively simple, just with some added character to keep them from being \u0027boring\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd that tiling looks amazing.

I\u0027ve been going back and forth with some of the tiling/wrapping options in the pParts configs. Unfortunately I think because of the hex shape of the tiles, that\u0027s just how they\u0027re going to look when the texture compresses itself at the center of the flatter heat-shield parts. I\u0027m also tweaking options in the normal maps to see how the normals look during re-entry (which is why actually did an honest-to-goodness reentry test shown in the album.) I think the tile lines were a bit too strong on the original TPS tile design and it detracted from the design and became distracting when the tiles got smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is, now that I have finalized a design for the hex-shaped TPS tiles, I can move forward with the Fuselage pParts texture and aeroshell pFairings texture I\u0027m planning on using them with.
