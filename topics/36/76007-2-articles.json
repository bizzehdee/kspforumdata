Texture resolution is currently fairly expensive but these parts shouldn\u0027t need more than a 1024 sheet, and would probably do fine with a 512 sheet; light weight users may desire 256 sheet but at that point they should be using the Active Texture Whateverthethirdwordiscurrently mod for compression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics are expensive, so try to get your collision mesh as simple as possible. Mine are using 3 Cube Primative colliders, which are super cheap; it\u0027s how I got away with having mine be hollow. Because yours have those concave edges things are going to be complicated for you. Probably should have mentioned this earlier but mesh colliders on parts in KSP \u0027have\u0027 to be convex, technically they don\u0027t, but concave colliders are crazy esspensive. You have a few options, one of them is to just have a truncated triangular prism as your collider (could do with 6 cube colliders or 1 mesh collider) and ignore that your collision mesh is grossly unlike your visible mesh. Another is to have several convex mesh colliders overlapped that result in something similar to your shape. Say two triangle prisms rotated slightly so that each triangle is one set of corner points, then some other colliders filling in the space left over; I\u0027ll edit in a sketch of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This composite is composed of two mesh colliders and 9 cube primative colliders, more cube primatives can be used rather cheaply to enhance the accuracy of the representation, but at some point they\u0027ll have to reach into the tip of the triangles and then you\u0027ll need to use mesh colliders so that you can make it thin enough at one end but not leave any air pockets inside, as these colliders will compose the ends of the struss too.

The problem is that there are a lot of coplanar faces that overlap, if this were a rendered mesh there would be Z fighting everywhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sQPI4iE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sQPI4iE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this isn\u0027t a rendered mesh, it\u0027s a physics mesh, and collision is supposed to generally be a yes or no thing, but there\u0027s not much faith that Unity\u0027s physics mixed with KSP\u0027s physics will result in things working correctly in this situation. The suggestion is that instead of using primatives just make a well fitting mesh and cut it up. This way you get the same effect, but the mesh never overlap, they meet at a lot of places, but that doesn\u0027t matter. This will unfortunately make the part a lot more expensive. You may still be able to make use of a lot of primatives and then fill in the space with mesh as long as there\u0027s no overlap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reiterate, this is theorycrafting, it may work fine so test it; but it also might explode all over your face. What I recommend testing is placing things against the ends in the editor and with KAS because it lets you do that in flight; and ramming various things into the ends. For example, walk a kerbal up to it and push them against it walking back and forth; drive a buggy into it at reasonable velocity. Place it upright on the runway and then drive a buggy 2.5km away and back to see what it does when reloaded; also build some basic ships and do the same; they should be fine because of clipping rules but you don\u0027t want to learn that they aren\u0027t when you go to space. Place one upright and have a kerbal walk on the top side. Timewarp while things are touching it. But the most valuable thing will be when you release some parts and users can start bulk testing; assuming it survives your tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T18:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the information!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m doing is rather simple.

First, I export the completed model to dae, then I build a simplified shell over the model (pretty much following the example you gave above). I then export that into a separate dae. Then I finish them both in Blender (remove doubles, texture (on \u0022hero mesh\u0022), scale, align, etc.) and then move to Unity. I import both models, then substitute the collider mesh with the outer shell mesh I made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably doing more work than needed, but as I\u0027m still learning Unity and Blender, it\u0027s the best method I\u0027ve found for me so far and it gives me total control on exactly how the collider will wrap around the model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T20:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few more parts to be added soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 6-way adapter (2 stock, 4 trihex)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 5-way adapter (5 trihex)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA trihex to 2.5m adapter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn end plate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0022Stayputnik\u0022 style probe core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aVlTk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
