So if you could, let me know which part modules you are depending on, and also if you are using CRP stuff OTHER THAN the resource configs (i.e. resource maps, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be doing a pre-release and giving folks a week or so to sort things out before I switch it to general availability. Will post here (so you may want to sub) when it is ready. Anticipate the pre-release being ready (hopefully) by the end of the day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horstj","CreatedById":81915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T10:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the new version already released?
