You can attach a multi-node part to another part by any node now. You don\u0027t have to start with the last two in your cfg, and rearrange anymore\n2. Angled stack nodes now receive connections correctly from other parts instead of being treated like right-angled stack nodes in certain situations\n3. Toadicus also informed me that EGO-based stack NODE{}s now only attach to correctly aligned stack nodes. All your thin parts will no longer snap to the wrong stack node on the other side of the part.\n\nThat is all.

So in a classic vertical stack up the attach node of the bottom part must have its Zaxis pointing UP and the attach node of the top part must have its Zaxis point DOWN. The Xaxis and Yaxis do not appear to have any significance in how the two parts attach so it doesn\u0027t matter how they align in relation to one another as long as the Zaxis are anti-aligned (point in opposite directions).\n\nI\u0027m not sure if the above is an absolute answer. You might be able to get away with pointing the attach node of the bottom part DOWN and the attach point of the top part UP. It might be that you only need to anti-align the two Zaxis (point them in opposite directions). However, my test part (the bottom part in the example above) attached to a stock part when I pointed its attach node up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T05:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Absolution**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:47:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure if the above is an absolute answer.
