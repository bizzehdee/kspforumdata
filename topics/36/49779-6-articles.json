This means that when coming in close to the Mun you see it fade from a somewhat a-spherical scaled space version to the much more spherical rescaled PQS. We may need to maintain a constant ratio between body radius and the heights on the PQS to make things look proper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the twitchiness on the pad is due to the launch clamps. I\u0027ll look into designing rockets that don\u0027t need the clamps to launch / building effective clamps using parts and see if that changes things.
