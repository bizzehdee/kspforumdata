I\u0027m really enjoying both mods a lot. Out of curiosity, do you play with FAR? I\u0027ve found that you need a bit steeper ascent in order to avoid a tumble and break-up. Thrust limiting the booster engines at 50% helps a lot too. (70-80% with stock aero.)

The best iteration on the booster thus far has used the midrange engines for the boosters (so I imagine it\u0027s 50% limited the hard way), but it\u0027s keeping it together like you say that is the snag. Maybe it\u0027s just me, but I found 0.23 \u002B KJR to give very solid rockets. Even with KJR now, the noodle factor seems to have returned. Anyway. I\u0027ll mess around with the launcher some more, and see if I can hone it down.

The fairings will resixe as appropriate, but will not attach to the bottom plate, leaving you free to decouple the bottom plate as part of your abort sequence. HOWEVER this has not been tested for a pad abort, and you will need to decouple the LES and top ring prior to LES burnout so that the craft will fall free of the fairings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr add jettison motors.
