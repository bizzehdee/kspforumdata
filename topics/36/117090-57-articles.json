You can launch the tug into space with the payload and keep it there. When you\u0027re done, you dock it up with the station, blow it up, or put it on one of the ships you plan to dock with the station to take it with you on your interplanetary journey.

I even installed it and tried it out to see what would it do. It works, but it gives a very large amount of fuel for this mod\u0027s fuel tanks and I do mean large. What it doesn\u0027t do is switch over to other types of fuel tanks that MFT is supposed to support according to the config files that are supported with this mod, like service module and the rest. With SSTU\u0027s patch, it uses MFT for Real Fuels tank switching and configuration and limited fuel tank switching between LOX and Mono and Xenon without real fuels. Take out MFT and the tanks use using Mage\u0027s patch to give tanks the stand alone MFT function for LH2 it needs for the size tank you create, though it\u0027s not named cryogenic, but the tanks are there to support the engines for LH2/Ox. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Like I said, a choice will have to happen on what features you\u0027d want. The only thing I could suggest is a fuel switch on the engines that use LH2 to switch back to LOX for an MFT mod install. And I feel that Mage \\*might\\* not do that, because it\u0027s more work on parts he has already worked on, especially this week. He put a lot of work into what he done and I\u0027m not complaining one bit about it. Even if I have to drop a mod in order to use this mod in the way it\u0027s he wants it run, I\u0027ll do just that and figure out the rest. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In any case, thank you for your reply, Blowfish.\n\u003E \n\nI have been further investigating this and realized that MFT does in fact have a utilization slider. This slider gives you whatever amount of fuel you need at a percentage rate. So, in essence, you could use Nertea\u0027s Cryogenic engine mod and use the cryogenics to set up LH2 for this mod\u0027s LH2 engines. Scale down the ridiculous amount of LH2/Ox you\u0027ll need and voila, you have a viable cryogenic engine stage, that in fact uses a boiloff due to cryogenic engines mod. I will be further experimenting with this and the SSTU parts and will give my findings soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T18:17:25Z","Content":"gheghe, I also just downloaded the new X2 version from Nertea ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)   He is using a 15:1 ratio now though, so if you\u0027re using SSTU tanks, remove some Oxidizer to crank up your dV again due to the extra weight of the spare oxidizer now (around 25%).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T18:31:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T18:40:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 28 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/) Both patches were posted here and on Github.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)   \n\u003E \n\u003E LS: The mass is quite low and is different between the two mods.

If it is more than 0.1 tons, I would want to offset the mass of the base parts;  if it is less than that, can probably let is slide.  The mass/balance that I use for stock includes some mass margin for imaginary \u0027supplies\u0027; so at the point where the supplies are no longer imaginary, the pods no longer need that extra mass.\n\nBoiloff -- Its not that I can\u0027t bundle it from a licensing perspective; its that I\u0027m not going to use external dependencies where I would be forced to wait for them to update / be beholden to their updates breaking my parts / be at the mercy of them changing mechanics or balance.  If it were part of CRP, I would use it as-is (as CRP is required for the LH2 anyhow) and just go with whatever balance they put in; but I\u0027m not going to have a external dependency on a third-party mod for such a critical/integral function.  Its just too much headache from both an end-user and maintenance perspective.\n\nShuttle -  Mostly its a \u0027just for kicks\u0027 thing.  It could be quite useful from a utility perspective, but as others have pointed out a regular rocket \u002B orbital tug is generally more efficient.  The one unique capability it has is to bring things back down from orbit... which is not as useful in KSP gameplay as it is in real life (aside from a few contracts, it has no use; you never need to return science stuff to the surface as you can just transfer the experiments to a return pod).  I\u0027m pretty sure that these parts will go nowhere though -- as far as I\u0027m aware KSP is incapable of handling a single-part shuttle setup, and I\u0027m unwilling to break it into multiple parts; but I have to have at least a prototype to do testing on... so that is what I have created.\n\nPRs - Yah, they\u0027re not overly difficult (after the initial setup)... just nothing I\u0027ve had to do yet ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nSC-C Pod - not even close; still doing geometry and rough modeling on it.  I\u0027m 99% certain that these parts will work fine in-game, so there is no pressing need to do prototypes.  The first time you\u0027ll see them in-game will likely be after the texturing/etc is all done.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 34 minutes ago, lynwoodm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E While we are talking about the future of your mod [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) You are going to do a series of interplanetary parts, correct?

Trying to determine if I want to adjust the engine modules thrust and/or resource quantities based on scale (and if I do, will likely apply similar stuff to the RBDC as well, so it is not as OP for light parts).  Some of this will likely need testing to determine how best to move forward.\n\nIn setup it is very similar to the IPA -- has a procedural fairing that can select top and bottom radius, and the height of the taper point.  It automatically rescales the engine models dependent upon the current diameter/scale, and the engine models are positioned at the bottom of the fairing.  The taper-point starts at the top of the engine models (engine models are always mounted straight).  Engine models can be inverted though, for use as retro-rockets.  \n\nWork on the Series-C parts continues (which is actually for the -next- update, 0.3.27, a couple of weeks out).   \n\nOrbital module is modeled, unwrapped, and AO baked.  Needs to have its unity-oriented stuff added (colliders for hatch/ladder), and determine if it needs any additional detail stuff added.  Also a bit undecided if I want to \u0027grow\u0027 the model a bit to simulate the cloth covering on the real-life articles -- as the cloth covering obscures some of the other geometry details of the OM.  Will probably do a test-texture on the current geometry and go from there.  \n\nDescent module is mostly modeled -- deciding if I want to put in some form of details regarding the parachute caps.  Seems likely not; as the cloth covering completely obscures the parachute caps before it is burned/melted off during re-entry.  Will likely move on to unwrapping and UV layout for this part within the next couple of days.  The  \n\nFor the SM -- I\u0027m having problems locating reliable information regarding the position and orientation of the RCS ports -- I know there are some near the top of the SM, and some on the bottom-skirt;  those near the top of the SM are simple enough to figure out, but the ones on the bottom skirt I cannot locate any information on.  Sources list them as \u0027forward \u002B pitch thrusters\u0027, but don\u0027t tell me what orientation they are at (do they point outward, forward, or some angle inbetween?).  If I can get the RCS ports figured out, I could finish the model for the SM within a few hours of whenever I start working on it.  Anyone have more concrete information on them?\n\n![18n1pny96y3ykjpg.jpg](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BmmbVdFy--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/18n1pny96y3ykjpg.jpg)\n\n![SoythruZ.gif](http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Soyuz1Land/SoythruZ.gif)\n\nI -might- include these parts in the 0.3.26 release this weekend as prototypes / rough draft parts for initial testing and balancing/feedback.  Will all depend on if I can get the models finished or not (mostly just those RCS port positions/orientations are stopping me).  If I can\u0027t otherwise get them figured out I\u0027ll likely put them as forward-facing thrusters, as those are least-likely to mess up the RCS balancing of the rest of the craft when assembled (and would still be usable for pitch control if needed).\n\nPrototype testing on the Series-E parts (shuttle) showed that, as feared, KSP is incapable of properly handling multiple aero-control surfaces on the same part (the elevon controls would actuate in opposite directions for elevator input, and not move at all for aileron input, while the tail surface responded to elevator input and ignored yaw input).  Still quite unsure how/if to proceed with this series of parts.  Minimum part-count would be 4 if it were to be created to be usable in the current iteration of KSP aero/modules (fuselage, left-wing, right-wing, tail); which is not that terrible... though I\u0027m still unsure that I\u0027m willing to deal with KSPs joint mechanics (e.g. flex between the wings and fuselage).  Will continue to do prototype development and testing on this as I have time."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T21:54:48Z","Content":"Couldn\u0027t you make the body/wings one part and just add the control surfaces as seperate parts?

The prefab part initializes fine with non-default values, but as soon as i use the part in the editor, all I get are the default plugin values rather than the config-specified ones.  Stranger yet when I have MM do a database dump, it spits out the proper config-modified values.\n\nAnd...upon further investigation, it appears that I left the fields at default security level (no qualifier), so that while they -did- get loaded into the prefab part, they did not get properly copied into the cloned part in the editor (as Unity and/or KSPs field code only copies fields marked as public)\n\nHave fixed this dev side -- will be available with tonights bugfix release (if I get around to it)."}]}
