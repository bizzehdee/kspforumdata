But I wasn\u0027t talking about the aliasing of the city lights (which doesn\u0027t really bother me), but the fact that, because the borders of the city are defined by the one big orbit texture, you can see the pixels of the orbit texture as defined by the boundaries of the city, which makes it look, in a weird way, pixellated.\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example, from your album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V9VGDjA.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/V9VGDjA.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the detail textures are very nice and high res, but you can see how the edges of the city areas are all blocky.

I think what would be idea would be a full on proceedural system, but what would be more realistic/in scope with EVE mod, would be a mid level mask texture available, so one from great distance (currently the 8 k city mask) then a middle range one (that\u0027d determine cities layouts from a closer scale), then the cities detail texture currently in use.
