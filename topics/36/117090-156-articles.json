Maybe; really not fond of the 1.25m form factor for stations though.  Would be more willing to create an inflatable hab that could be used on top of the SC-A-SM (Soyuz-SM); a bit of a specialized size, but I might actually use it (whereas a 1.25m inflatable I don\u0027t think I would ever use).  I\u0027ll give it a bit of thought though; perhaps I can create something that fills both purposes (e.g. an optional adapter for use on the SC-A-SM with a regular 1.25m size).\n\nToday\u0027s promotional materials (am I creating any hype yet? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) ):\n\nInflatable torus, based on the Nautilus-X concept.  1.25m core, 2.5m diameter torus ring, with 10m diameter at the circumference when inflated; packs down to \u003C1.875m deflated.  Sadly, the gravity calcs ( [http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/](http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/) ) tell me that this is nowhere near large enough to be a useful centrifuge at anything less than nauseating rotation speeds; but perhaps we\u0027ll just pretend that it would work  (need like 50m diameter for anything approaching 0.5g at reasonable spin rates).  Not entirely set on the dimensions, was mostly testing out how the animation and such would work (and it works fine).\n\n![ST-HAB-T-Preview-07-27-16.gif?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-HAB-T-Preview-07-27-16.gif?raw=true)\n\nAnd... not exactly the highest fidelity recreation, but shows how these parts can all be used to good effect  \n\n-63 parts as shown, the majority of which are the docking ports; only 24 parts are the actual station parts, the rest are docking ports.  This can/will be reduced more with the multi-docking hubs.  \n\n-USOS parts are using placeholder cylinder models  \n\n-Solar trusses still have some odd cylinder adapters on them; they will have a more seamless integration when the truss-adapters are available:\n\n![ST-StationCore-Preview-07-27-16.png?raw=](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-StationCore-Preview-07-27-16.png?raw=true)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T19:45:50Z","Content":"Yeah, it would be awesome to have an appropriate diameter for at least 0.38 g or something at a reasonable rotation rate.

They say up to 4 rpm with adaptation, with 2 being optimal, right?\n\u003E \n\nSadly, I don\u0027t think there is any way to make it have realistic gravity and still be a usable part in-game.  The spin rate calculator linked above gives me the following data for 0.4g at 2 \u0026 4 rpm.\n\n0.4g @ 4rpm = 22.35m radius (~45m diameter), so approximately 4.5x larger than what I have pictured above.  Potentially doable within the bounds of the game\u0027s physics, but still much larger than I would like for integration into vessels/stations.\n\n0.4g @ 2rpm = 89.42m radius (~180m diameter), thus 18x larger than what I have pictured above.  At 180m for a single part you\u0027ll likely run into some quirks in the physics simulation; possibly still workable.. .but wow, that is a big part.\n\nThis is one of those areas where KSP\u0027s scaled down system really doesn\u0027t help things much; the diameter of the centrifuge does not change with the scaling of the solar system, being entirely physics based.  With larger core sizes for the parts it wouldn\u0027t look so odd for 40m diameter centrifuge.\n\nI\u0027ll likely just give it a 2-3 rpm spin rate and \u0027pretend\u0027 that it is enough to generate gravity; which at 10m diameter and 3rpm would actually only give 0.05g (1/20th of Earth normal gravity).  If I step it up to 15m diameter at 3rpm it would still only give 0.075g, and at 30m diamter and 3rpm you could have Moon-level gravity (~0.15g) (g scaling with radius for a given rpm is linear; if rpm=3 then ~5m-rad = 0.05g, ~50m-rad = 0.5g, ~100m-rad = 1.0g)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T21:08:44Z","Content":"Yeah...

It can be seen at the top of the images, the little dome\u0027ish looking thing.  Not quite sure on it... its kind of a cute little attachable inflatable, but I\u0027m not so sure of its use for stations.  I suppose if nothing else it is a good analogue to the BEAM module currently on the ISS.\n\nThey don\u0027t yet spin, and likely won\u0027t for the initial release.  I have to do some plugin/code work in order to get that feature working (looping animations, animation chaining/dependent animation support).  Not a huge deal and totally doable, just not done yet.\n\nOn the cylinder-inflatables I\u0027ll be including a cylinder top cap that will have a crew-hatch on it.  Debating if I should add some integrated solar panels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to these as well... thoughts/opinions?  \n\nAlso got the initial HUB part in-game; still working on figuring out what styles of hubs I should offer, and the best way to present them.  In -theory- I should be able to swap around both the core models and the docking port models *if I use a custom module specifically for the hubs*.  Not sure I want to go to that length though.  It really wouldn\u0027t add anything... mostly would just reduce the editor-part-list bloat a bit (and complicate the UI interaction substantially; lots of buttons).\n\nCurrently I\u0027m thinking that I\u0027ll offer pre-built multi-docking hubs in ROS and USOS styles (so, similar to the DOS hubs on the top of the Mir core/Zarya/Zvezda, and the US-Node1/2/3 modules), and... ???  There are no analogues for larger hubs (or even docking ports) to base anything else off of, so whatever it is will be a custom solution.  I do intend on offering a 2.5m hub, though unsure if I should have it truss or cylinder styled... or offer both.  Probably both; 4 hubs is not too many.\n\nThinking that I\u0027ll be reworking the docking port model used for the 1.25m hubs slightly to add visual compatibility with the 0.625m docking ports (already compatible in code/plugin/config, but just looks a bit odd); this means that I won\u0027t need to offer \u0027mixed\u0027 hubs.  Can likely do the same for the 2.5m hubs/ports -- add \u0027visual\u0027 compatibility with 1.25m ports as well.\n\nInitial hubs will have the docking port models -built into the model-.  So they will not have patch-swappable models initially; far faster/easier to do the integrated models for the prototype testing parts (would take a few days to sort out the configs for non-integrated models).  I will have them patch-swappable when they are finished, but it is simply not needed for the prototype testing.\n\nInflatables - deflated.  \n\nTop to bottom:  \n\n1.25m -\u003E 2.5m Dome  \n\n2.5m -\u003E 5m Transhab  \n\n3.75m -\u003E 7.5m Transhab  \n\n5m -\u003E 10m Transhab  \n\n1.875m -\u003E 10m Torus (2.5m torus diameter)  \n\n2.5m -\u003E 20m Torus (3.125m torus diameter)  \n\n3.75m -\u003E 35m Torus (3.75m torus diameter)  \n\n5m -\u003E 50m Torus (5m torus diameter)\n\n![ST-HAB-Deflated.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-HAB-Deflated.png?raw=true)\n\nInflatables inflated\n\n![ST-HAB-Inflated.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-HAB-Inflated.png?raw=true)\n\nConcept interplanetary craft demo using the 50m torus; those are all 5m tanks and double-scaled NRVs at the rear.\n\n![ST-HAB-DEMO.png?raw=true](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabsImages/blob/master/Images/StationCore/ST-HAB-DEMO.png?raw=true)\n\nThings are still looking good for a testing release of the prototype parts for this weekend.

Quite workable and usable, if a bit... garish looking.\n- Cleaned up the balancing on the DOS modules; they now have the propellant mass, storage volume/mass and overall spacecraft \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E that I intend for them to have for stock balancing (~900 for DOS, ~1000 for TKS).\n- VA capsule, engines, and LAS are in-game and ..\u0027working\u0027 (no hatch yet, so hard to get the crew out; works for recovery though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ).\n\nOnly a bit more to do regarding the prototype parts, mostly cleaning up the volume/mass specifications so that they are at least in the right range.  Still looking pretty good for an initial testing release over the weekend.  I\u0027ll lay out a set of testing goals when I get there; mostly I\u0027ll be interested in if any of the geometry is \u0027unusable\u0027 or doesn\u0027t fit right, or if there are any plugin-side problems (null-refs/crashing/whatever).\n\n**Warning:**  This upcoming update **may** contain craft-breaking changes.  My current career/balance-testing game has so far been unaffected by the changes, but there are some parts that I\u0027ve not yet used in it, so unsure on the full extent of the breakage, if any.  Will do more testing prior to the actual release and let you know how it comes out/what problems I encounter. \n\nThe biggest change is to the procedural decoupler module to make it a stand-alone module (rather than deriving from the ModuleDecouple), this was done for the \u0027procedural probe core\u0027 part.  About the only thing it should break is existing craft using those decouplers will have the \u0027decoupled\u0027 status reset; this really shouldn\u0027t matter as if it was already decoupled then there is no payload to decouple.  Might also reset the staging flags for that part (e.g. if staging was enabled/disabled)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T20:04:59Z","Content":"Hi [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I took a small brake from kerbal, but your recent progress will probably drag me back into it.

No -- it requires special animations in order to facilitate the ability to set alignment prior to full dock (e.g. needs animations for soft-dock).  The models are also created in a special manner to make it so that the attach-nodes sit flush on top of the docking ports\u0027 parent part.\n\n2.)  Incorrect; the reaction wheels are already there, the WDP sits on top of them/surrounds them.  Zero parts are replaced or moved.  Only the WDP\u0027s are removed.\n\nYou\u0027ll probably just have to play around with them after the release and see how they function. \n\nBut for the most part they are limited to specialized docking port models due to the need for the docking port to have zero height between its attach nodes (so that when it is removed there is no gap).  -Technically- you *could* use other docking ports, but you\u0027ll end up with a gap when they are removed from the vessel.\n\nSounds like what you are looking for is RoverDude\u0027s welding docking port setup -- his will work on other docking ports as it replaces the ports with another structural part when they are removed to fill in the gap.

This gives ample time to try things out / change / fix things before they get to the time-consuming hard-to-go-back stage (UV/texturing).\n\nHowever, please keep in mind that for this initial release / all the screenshots shown to date that these -are- just prototype/testing models.  There is close to zero detail work done on them aside from what is necessary for their functionality (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar, engines, animations).  All of these parts will be having substantial modeling work done on them before they are \u0027finished\u0027, probably about the same level of detail as with the rest of my parts (so... more than stock, less than raidernick\u0027s work).\n\nRight now I\u0027m concentrating on overall geometry of the parts (the size and shape), figuring out -all- of the parts that I will make for the set ahead of time, making sure that they all fit together properly, getting a decent initial balance on them as a set, and making sure the plugin end of things is working appropriately for all the parts.  That is what this weekends\u0027 release will mostly be intended for.\n\nNext will come working on the detail geometry of the first set of parts.  Not sure what set I\u0027ll work on first, but I\u0027m likely at least a few weeks out from needing to worry about that yet.  After the first set of detailing work is done I\u0027ll either move onto detailing the next set or unwrap/texturing the first set and getting them to the \u0027finished\u0027 stage.\n\nSo right now is the best time for feedback on what functions each part should have (as those could change the model for some parts/functions), or if there are other part designs you would like to see done.  I\u0027ll still be working on the rough prototypes for at least a few weeks, so you\u0027ve got a bit of time to put your ideas forward for new parts / function changes. Once I start moving onto the detailing work I\u0027ll likely be hesitant to add new parts or make substantial changes to functionality (unless it doesn\u0027t affect the model, or is found necessary through testing)."}]}
