Glad to see you\u0027re making progress. I am a CNC machinst/programmer so I understand how much a degree off can be! Usually even sloppy tolerance on angles is maximum of half a degree. I also was a clock maker/repairer a while back and got to know about gear meshing and running on centers (or pressure after center would be more accurate I guess) so they don\u0027t grind the gears. Doesn\u0027t take much to begin to wear everything so I hope you get that sorted out. It\u0027s not just the angular drift!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be interested to see how things develop with this and to see how you implement the tags like prograde, retrograde and nodes.

All you need is an Arduino plus a little Adafruit 16 channel servo board (each needle uses a single servo).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, look at the original...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/73ju1G6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002273ju1G6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zfdcPDH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zfdcPDH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, there are two servo motors on each of the three sides which has a wire that leads to the indicator needle painted on the front of the display. One needle shows the rate of change (ie the speed of the axis - it\u0027s the outer indicators on the above FDAI picture) and the other needle is drift from a set angle (the inner needles on the FDAI pictures). So when you set the node up in KSP the needles show which direction you will need to go to get to the correct attitude. They are actually BETTER than the KSP icons in fact because that system doesn\u0027t tell you which way you have to turn. Cool thing is all you have to do is send the signal to the servo and it will deflect the needle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only hard part is initially calibrating the needles. Actually, not even hard... just time consuming to make sure the deflection isn\u0027t too much that you bend the needle. I\u0027ve made some jigs so that I can hot bend the wire without stressing it and making them good duplicates so they match the three sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that is different with the needle system is that you can set the needle\u0027s scale factor. This allows you to use 2x, 1x or 0.5x the true value to narrow in on the correct attitude. You would start off at 2x so that you know which way to go but when you are getting near to the correct attitude you would use 1x and then 0.5x to make it more sensitive. I\u0027m planning on using this in my system. At the moment it\u0027s not part of the current prototype but should be easy enough to set up once everything else is working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weirdest thing about designing this nav ball is that there are SOOOOOO many different versions for the Apollo program. For example the version in the picture above has white needles but in other versions there are yellow needles. There are soooo many different marking layouts for the ball that I don\u0027t even know which one to choose from. Some are from training rigs, others from previous versions so it makes kind of sense. Then they used the same system on the shuttle too (with even MORE mods). I just have to choose one I guess... after all this is Kerbal and not Human.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact out of everything in my simulator build there is only one thing that I have absolutely ZERO idea of how to make.... and that is the tape altimeters and speed indicators (see image below). I could easily make the tape and use stepper motors to move it up and down but the big problem is... how would I do the markings. They would have to be printed onto the tape somehow.

Make holes in the one that isn\u0027t and then illuminate from behind with an LED stack and a diffuser.

I don\u0027t think there should be one in a simulated navball. In a ship, you want the ball to remain stable and rotate the enclosure around it as the ship moves. In a simulated navball the situation is inversed, the ball must move and the enclosure remains fixed. The LAST thing you want in that case is a working gyroscope.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T16:38:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jerome.tremblay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T07:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever considered another option for the ball... Make the ball with a pattern of north and south oriented magnets inside, and place a set of electromagnets around the perimeter of the ball. The ball would not be attached to anything at all, just spinning on some ball casters or possibly fluid suspended. Your control device would operate the electromagnets to create the opposing poles of the magnet pattern across the electromagnets, much int he way a sinusoidal brushless motor pushes and pulls on a permanent magnet rotor by creating a magnetic field that rotates around the stator. creating a hemispherical magnetic field that pushes and pulls the ball around was beyond the tech back then, but I can\u0027t imagine it wouldn\u0027t be possible to create a patterned magnetic field with, say a hexagonal array of coils covering the rear of the ball (like the retina of an eye), and three caster balls to hold the ball stable against the rear of the housing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that if you get creative, it might be possible to create a pattern of magnets that could create a self calibrating start up sequence. Possibly an expanding spiral of north south regions in the ball, so if you start the field confined and then expand the field int eh opposing spiral, presumably, it\u0027d drive the ball until it spins itself tot he aligned unique magnetic pairing with the controller generated field. Rotate the field, and you roll the ball, translate in one axis, and you get yaw, translate the field pattern in the other axis, and you get pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei realize it\u0027d be a start from scratch effort, but it\u0027d probably be the cheapest possible ball design possible. just a bunch of electromagnet coils in a grid, and a bunch of permanent magnets glued to the inside of a two piece ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresumably, if the magnetic pattern would not be a completely uniform, repeating pattern, and the field that is generated itself becomes the aligning factor through a sequence of generated fields designed to take advantage of that non uniformity to drive the ball into known predictable paths from an unknown start point. Another option available is to have a very uniform magnet pattern, which would allow for (I think) an easier software control if the fields, but have a CCD on the back of the ball image the ball to determine where it\u0027s at. That\u0027d require image processing though, so that more or less negates the easier control pattern... I still theorize that a magnetic pole pattern could be created that forms a self aligning startup sequence, and maintains ball position based on the rotation or translation of a polarity field pattern over the electromagnets that matches the unique, non-uniform magnetic pattern of the ball. Yet another possibility is to place some hall effect sensors to detect the pattern of the magnets passing below them. Finally, the use of a laser barcode scanner MIGHT be able to be adapted to recognize the spacing of the graduations of the ball along different scanning axes, so that it can determine the start point of the ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself am considering getting an old arcade style joystick (two I suppose), and a few pushbuttons and toggles that have safety flip top covers and making a simple keyboard replacement controller. It would literally be a gutted USB keyboard, with switches hard wired to the key matrix to recreate the keyboard keys in the appropriate switches... Not exactly rocket surgery...
