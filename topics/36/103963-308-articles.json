White edges on mountains in transition to orbit?.. I\u0027ll make proper screenshots eventually.\n\u003E \n\nHmm, so here is what causes this. The reason is in local space you have mountains and a lot of features, but in orbit the planet is spherical, perfectly so, and the tranistion between them is just fading out the moutains and revealing the flat sphere.\n\nEither in the current version or the next, fading out the scatterer effect will not look right and will always reveal brighter and whiter mountains, believe me I tried. So I can\u0027t and will not fix it.\n\nHowever a solution is to make a scaledSpace object (ie the orbit model) which matches the local space model (the one with mountains), and then everything will be perfect! Especially so in the next version of scatterer. If any modder maintaining a visual pack or a planet pack wants to fix it, this is the way to do it, and will look perfect in next release (due to new way of handling the effects on scaled Space objects, but will not look better in current). This is not scatterer\u0027s job to fix, since it essentially requires changing the model of the planet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-21T17:43:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2019 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"evileye.x","CreatedById":153755,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-21T19:27:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ither in the current version or the next, fading out the scatterer effect will not look right and will always reveal brighter and whiter mountains, believe me I tried.
