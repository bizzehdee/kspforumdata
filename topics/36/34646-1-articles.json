I used 5 meshes of about 7 triangles each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen approximating my shape for the collision meshes, should I keep them entirely within the models they approximate, keep them outside even if they stick out a little way, or compromise (as I did here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the performance considerations I should be taking into account (ie. number of triangles in a collision mesh vs splitting it into two meshes with lower count over all)? How many triangles in a part before I need to think about conserving/reducing them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there some simpler instructions for doing the attach nodes the new way somewhere? I can\u0027t really follow what is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if there\u0027s someone who likes texturing but likes the other aspects less, I\u0027d be happy to try and make some (simple) models/configs as I can\u0027t do textures for the life of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Some progress on the attach nodes. I can make them and get them the right position but there\u0027s a spurious factor of 1.25 somewhere. I imagine this is because I messed up in blender thinking 1.25m parts were 1.25 units and not 1 and had to rescale in unity, but unity is doing strange things with the scaling that I can\u0027t make sense of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also can\u0027t seem to change the size of the attach node (which I gather has some consequences with regards to the physics as well as being important to work right with FAR and the aesthetic issues).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-25T01:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2013 01:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SchroedingersHat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T14:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture as well helps, some peoples KSP installs can take a while to start up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unity documentation recommends using multiple primitive colliders (box, capsule, sphere) over a single mesh collider, but how much of that is because of fewer faces and how large the mesh collider fixed overhead is I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
