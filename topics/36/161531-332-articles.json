The takeaway is that if you want to beam lots of power in the atmosphere, you need to use microwave or laser far-IR. Of these two, microwave might seem somewhat easier to do because of the diversity and capacity of the parts, but it has a big limitation, which is that it looses power very rapidly with distance. A laser-based far-IR setup works better if you want flexibility in being able to capture larger amounts of power over greater distances (or if you\u0027re using real solar system scale). Some of the mod\u0027s thermal receivers can accept power from any beamed wavelength source, of course factoring in the usual path and atmospheric losses, so it\u0027s fine to have complimentary networks.

Getting your relay in orbit is also a lot easier when you\u0027re only trying to orbit one large dish, instead of two.

I\u0027m also thinking it\u0027d be a lot easier to build a power station around Jool and use that to relay power to the moons rather than beaming it all from Kerbin since it\u0027s hard to tell how far my beams can go and what happens when they arrive. I have a few more questions now, though. \u00A0Is it possible to beam thermal power directly or does it always need to be converted to electricity first? And about the relays, if you use one of the mirrors do you need any other parts on the ship\u00A0other than a probe core, battery, etc?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"proteasome","CreatedById":156190,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-12T10:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222983248\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022100190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489307296\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175617\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Popetastic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Popetastic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible to beam thermal power directly or does it always need to be converted to electricity first?
