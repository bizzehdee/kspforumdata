Works like a charm.\n\nOk so...\n\nive responded to others with the same issue already, I have indeed fixed the wheels but forgot to put in update. \n\nThese wheels are a temporary set until I get mine finished. \n\nalso as I posted when I released the canadarm I mentioned that it will do as you say and needs quantum struts or the KAS struts to hold it in place because it wobbles. This will also happen to RKE kanadarm or any object that long. Seriously.\n\nThese struts can be turned on and off to hold and release. \n\nI intend to set them as \u0027physicsless parts\u0027\n\nAlso the rke kanadarm I have but didn\u0027t use because the one included is what the shuttle used unless ofcourse they used it in a updated orbiter?\n\nI did say it wasnt realistic but so far I have got positive feedback on it .\n\n I set it as a starting point and would make adjustaments from what people think it should be/ shouldnt be.\n\nThanks for letting me know about the rcs. I have been told and will fix it asap.\n\nLet me know what adjustments you want done based on that update I posted\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Took update 6 for another spin, it flew surprisingly well, even with some \u0027oh ....!\u0027 moments because i messed up the point of reentry...it was no problem to get a touchdown on an Island...well ok, Bill complained all the time and muddled stuff about women and Valentinas flight skills....\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E OMS is really weak now (as it should be)and doesnt apply considerable torque to the shuttle. good job guys. :]\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E i forgot: at least in the one part cockpit rcs doesnt respond.\n\nPlease note that the aero fix that Jeast has made and seems to work well has not uet been applied yet so it should be even better.\n\nSo update 6 is old now...\n\nrcs is getting fixed tonight.
