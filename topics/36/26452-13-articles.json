In my particular case, I\u0027m working out a plan to bootstrap production from the lightest launch vehicle I can make, and the plan is that the delivery vehicle drops the launchpad, launchpad prints a crane from rocket parts brought with the delivery vehicle, which moves a freshly printed empty container for rocket parts off it, \u003Cem\u003E(which is problematic right now as I can\u0027t seem to print anything with sliders set to zero without having debug mode turned on, but it appears there are fixes to this end in github -- do they work?

I even made arrangements in the plan to drain fuel into a separate storage tank, but according to the code, fuel will also count as part of the total mass of debris and get converted into rocket parts directly. Is that wise? This permits one to indirectly convert kethane into rocket parts... A more reasonable way would be to drain all drainable resources from debris into the launchpad\u0027s own resources and only then recycle the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warsoul","CreatedById":58082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T13:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made somes models for my expansion pack.
