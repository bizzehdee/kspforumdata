Recently I\u0027ve been creating a mod that adds multiple gas giants. The answer to my question may seem obvious, but remember: Jool only has a surface gravity of 0.8g due to the fact that the Kerbol System is scaled 1:10 (for context, I intend to scale the system curently in development to 1:5).

For instance, Kerbin and Earth have the same surface gravity despite being at very different scales. To get the surface gravity of a 1/5 scale planet, you just need to calculate the surface gravity that a real-life planet with 5 times the radius would have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224300827\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218303\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688866746\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022229837\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StavraDev\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, StavraDev said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool only has a surface gravity of 0.8g due to the fact that the Kerbol System is scaled 1:10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not actually caused by the 1/10 scale factor. Jool\u0027s surface gravity is indeed lower than what it would be in real life, but this is because the stock KSP system was created without too much attention to whether the densities were exactly realistic. (Eve is 45% denser than the otherwise similar Kerbin, a difference so substantial it would be very hard to explain in the real world.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to find out what Jool\u0027s surface gravity should be, we could compare it to Saturn. Jool has just over 1/10 the radius of Saturn, which has a mean surface gravity of 1.065 g, so Jool\u0027s surface gravity should be slightly higher: somewhere around 1.1 or 1.2 g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal gas giants never get much larger in radius than that, unless they\u0027re rotating quickly or puffed up by heat from a very close star. As the mass of a planet increases beyond about that of Saturn, it starts getting compressed, and nearly all of the new mass ends up increasing the surface gravity rather than the radius. For example, Jupiter has 1.2 times the radius of Saturn, but 2.4 times the surface gravity because it is so much more compressed. Above 10 times the mass of Saturn, the radius actually starts shrinking as more mass is added!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following chart (taken from\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.planetary.org/space-images/mass-radius-diagram-wide-seager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) shows the relationship between mass and radius for a range of different compositions. Typical gas giants are near the dotted light blue line, which represents a composition of mostly hydrogen with some helium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220190126_seageretal2007massradiusdiagram\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022133.25\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/web/assets/pictures/20190126_seageretal2007massradiusdiagram.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get the surface gravity, divide the mass by the square of the radius.

(For example, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/184880-1121-jnsq-0100-23-sept-2021\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EJNSQ\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s planets\u00A0were constructed at 1/4 scale, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/122020-1125-bluedog-design-bureau-stockalike-saturn-apollo-and-more-v1120-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-13jan2023\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EBDB\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s rockets were balanced\u00A0at that scale.) Of course, the scale of your mod is entirely up to you, but choosing 1/4 scale could potentially lead to better integration with other mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StavraDev","CreatedById":229837,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-09T15:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much for the response!

Ice giants consists of higher density gases which gives them higher density.
