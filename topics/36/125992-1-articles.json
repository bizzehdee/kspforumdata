Now, how to solve this?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) You have your Fairing/whatever model setted up in Unity. Now, you duplicate your model file, and call it \u0022modelname_collider\u0022 or something like that, that doesn\u0027t really matter. Now, you open the file.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) In Blender, I select all faces, except for these in the middle:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xOP3Djw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xOP3Djw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese faces get deleted, so that only a few faces in the middle remain, like shown above. Also, you should be careful, that only the outer faces in the middle remain, make sure that you also delete the inner middle faces.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) After that is done, you start splitting the faces into individual, seperate objects. To do this, you select faces which form a certain shape, which this image should make clear:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vBE2p97.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vBE2p97.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe faces marked in red belong together, the green line represents where the collider will be. To split faces onto the individual groups, you select a category of faces which you think should belong together, and hit \u0022p\u0022 on your keyboard and click on \u0022selection\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) After I splitted the faces into their own groups, it looks like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iLMTzDP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iLMTzDP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) Now you import the collider into Unity, create a new gameobject, call it whatsoever, and make the collider meshes be a child of that gameobject. Then, make the gameobject with the colliders be a child of the gameobject with the fairing you want to export to KSP. Where exactly you put that collider object, that\u0027s your decision, but it has to be a child of the parttools gameobject at least. Adjust the rotation so that the fairing meshes point in the same direction as the fairing itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6) Now, you add a mesh collider to each of the individual mesh objects of your fairing colliders, and set them all to convex. After that is done, remove the Mesh Filter and the Mesh Renderer components, that only the mesh collider component remains.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7) Now you select the parent object of the individual collider meshes, duplicate it and always adjust its rotation on the vertical axis, that your fairing is covered. You do this until the complete fairing is covered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n8) After 7) is done, it should look like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nsqCcRH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nsqCcRH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, simply hit write, make your config and done! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow you have a nice fairing collider, which will also work in 1.1. It\u0027s a bit of work, but it works really good for me! I hope this tutorial helps you guys, if you have the same problem, and I hope that you understand what I did... o,O\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T21:24:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed images\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fairy","CreatedById":152892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:58:35Z","Content":"\nThank you Kartoffelkuchen :) Great tutorial, and easy to understand.

I spent the last hour or so re-doing colliders for my interstages, fairings and other parts that would otherwise behave destructively with convex colliders in 1.0.5. Now I just need to repeat the process a couple more times and then all my parts and launchers should be good to go with both 1.0.5 and 1.1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks again Kartoffelkuchen :) Here, have some rep.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T21:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks for the tutorial - looks like I have my work cut out for me this Christmas...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
