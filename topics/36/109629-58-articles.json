Dragon used to tell us not to use them because they were buggy. They used to unleash the Kraken from my experience. So maybe take a look at them. The Mir Solar panels look just fine on the ISS. Actually all the solar panels that Bobcat did are actually astonishingly beautiful, considering when they were made. They are better than most Solar Panels released. Also just a friendly reminder please make sure all the textures are DDS please. Also if you are working on getting the Soyuz in game raidernicks launchers are beautiful as well. Although I still thinks bobcats soyuz spacecraft is still the best looking and functional, his launchers leave something to be desired. Raidernicks proton should be suitable for launching the Russian segments. I am glad raidernicks mods got saved and are being maintained. I mean when you are done with the ISS a few of his mods are gonna be important. He even made an Antares and Cygnus.
