The problem there is, at least for me, DSR doesn\u0027t seem to work in KSP. I can select the resolution from the options but it doesn\u0027t appear to apply itself. I run a number of (older) games at pseudo 4K this way and the results are fantastic. I suspect you could get round this by setting your desktop resolution to 4K but I don\u0027t really want to go down that route, same as applying FXAA in the drivers might help which I might try at some point but it will apply itself all over the UI and potentially make things all fuzzy, which I personally don\u0027t like....my ageing eye sight doesn\u0027t need any help there."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T14:08:58Z","Content":"Found one more bug, if you happen to have a part with flag transform underwater then the flag itself is visible through water, i.e. drawn on top of it.
