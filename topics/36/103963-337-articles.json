Not at all sure why.\n\u003E \n\nProbably scatterer terrain shadows?  Turn them off from the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view if you have them on with the toolbar... or if you have them off, then that\u0027s a mystery to me.  They should be off right now as they are just buggy enough to work, but mess with you.  Besides, stock KSP has basic terrain shadows in the standard settings now anyways, so they sort of aren\u0027t needed.\n\nThe atmosphere transition is because literally the \u0022Far away\u0022 space trackingcenter camera and the camera your ship uses are the same now.  We have to kind of ease into that new idea graphically speaking, and it\u0027s tough to get the transition from \u0022near\u0022  to \u0022 far\u0022 right without two seperate cameras like we had before.  It can appear jarring where it tries to switch the clouds over, which is what you are seeing at 200,000m or so.  I may try improving that a little later, but not right now, I\u0027m pretty happy with the result as far as being safe enough to use (and yes, I \u0022eat my own dogfood,\u0022 been playing with this all day lol).\n\nI\u0027d say overall though yes, it\u0027s a lot better than -force-d3d12, that\u0027s for sure!

Release Candidate is a fancy way of saying beta, and newer = better.  We\u0027re pretty close to release-grade now.  The only buggy thing is terrain shadows.  You might want to turn those off (KSP provides it\u0027s own anyhow).\n\nJust drop the folder in and merge with gamedata like any mod.

Right now scatterers own terrain shadows glitch out like crazy, I just had to temporarily disable them (they can still be turned back on for testing, but most wouldn\u0027t want them) until we can fix them.  Glad KSP 1.9 at least offers SOME terrain shadows stock to replace them!\n\nBut yeah, the best experience will come officially.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-26T03:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2020 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-26T08:13:22Z","Content":"I just released RC8.

RC4 was working well for me but I didn\u0027t get to say anything before these new updates. I\u0027m about to try RC8, but I\u0027m not expecting any issues. \n\nThe only issue I had was my sunflares of maar flare was not working at all in RC4. It was mostly working in the first dev build, only failing to appear when focused on my very large space station, but then it stopped working all together. I was playing around with the install a bit to fix it, so maybe I borked it, but Kabrams flares work fine, so IDK.\n\nI will update with results from the latest build shortly.\n\nEDIT: I definitely borked the maar flares. They have their own path. I may have just had a conflict with the scatterer flares. We\u0027ll see if I can get everything working correctly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-26T09:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2020 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by WallHaxx**\n  \nbork"},{"CreatedByName":"WallHaxx","CreatedById":196661,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-26T10:39:44Z","Content":"Good news.
