Lots of fun and since my grafics card went BBQ and DCS is of the menue, KSP now fills that gap too :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course do i have a lot of suggestions myself. You will notice that i am an IVA junkie :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe targeting pod struck me with awe. I have been waiting for something like that since the demise of Lazor mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one coolest thing to add would be integration with RPM. Immersion and stuff like that. That also would make some other features possible like tagging Pylons (center, left wing 1, right wingtip and so on) and have their attached parts shown on a RPM page. Maybe in collaboration with some IVA modders the RWR could become (besides a dedicated RPM page) a prop to place somewhere in the cockpit. Of course a HUD that is not just a simple transparent prop but projected to infinity (or at least dozens of meters in front of the craft) would also be cool. since this is not quite the core of BDA, an integration with the targeting system would still be awesome. (Gun funnel, CCRP, ILS, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso abusing the mavericks as tageting pod with limited gimbal, like the A-10A uses, available only as log as there is at least one maverick attached, would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for kOS integration, i hope there will be a cromprehensive interface.

Using the default KOS interface (ie, going through the available GUI controls) the only things KOS can see are \u0022toggle weapon\u0022 and \u0022fire\u0022 (the missile version). I don\u0027t see a way to get KOS to fire guns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also playing around with guard mode since I\u0027m trying to see if I can get my mechs to fight each other. On one mech I turned off smart guards, selected a weapon for it (a \u0022stocK\u0022 BD vulcan with a couple of ammo boxes for testing purposes), set it to active, switched its team to B and enabled guard mode. I had a team A mech parked out in front of it. I then sat and let it do its thing. After a few seconds the selected weapon switched over to \u0022none\u0022, and that was it. I also did not see it select the parked mech as a target. Not sure whether or not I should as I\u0027ve actually never used guard mode in earlier versions, but I was facing directly at the other mech so I would have thought it would have been picked up as a target even without guard mode active. Switching to legacy targeting didn\u0027t change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably doing something wrong but just in case anyone else has seen the same issue, can you point me in the right direction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I think I see what\u0027s going on.
