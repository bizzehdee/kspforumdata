The mod(s) that make it do something are - RPM, last I checked, is still working in 1.7.3.

We have several mods for navigation now: NavUtilities, KerbinSide, MAS, ASET each having its own database of nav data. If we had some common standard to represent and externalize those data, the mods could work interchangably and without the need to import/convert/addapt/update. How cool it would be when KerbinSide adds a few runways they were naturally usable by NavUtilities and by every MAS-based cockpit, and ASET cockpits too. I have thoughts of creating a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch that forces ASET props to use configurable nav data instead of its inner hard-configured ones (now the idea is years old). The main question is the data standard.\n\nHaving that we could move further and introduce, for example, an ATC that universally works with every runway and navaid added by every mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-17T13:21:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2019 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-17T12:13:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Ser said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t it be better to develop a universal data format for all of the aircraft navigation needs: runway coords, ILS positions, markers, beacons and so on?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027d be fine with a universal data format.

I was trying to configure Kerbin Side Remastered: Airports airports for [this mod (which I recompiled for use in KSP 1.4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95338-wip-air-traffic-control/)), which adds ATC. Because KSR:A has so many airports and I would have to manually copy all those values from a spreadsheet, I scrapped that idea. If in this situation a universal data format had been present (and somehow easily integrated into that mod), I would easily be able to fly in KSP with ATC. Furthermore, if that mod could use ILS data from NavUtils due to the universal data format, flying in KSP would be even more realistic. Then, one of the only problems would be the lack of airplanes that are realistic enough, but that is a topic for  another day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-18T11:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2019 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Bottle Rocketeer 500**"},{"CreatedByName":"that plane guy","CreatedById":201075,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-27T20:13:08Z","Content":"so, i have just made a T-6 Texan ii, and want to make a custom cockpit for it using the airplane plus fighter cockpit. the problem is i don\u0027t know how to edit it and customize cockpits. i don\u0027t know if i\u0027m just a idiot or what, but i cannot find anything anywhere online on how to customize the cockpits. i have tried blender, and have yet to do so on unity, but."},{"CreatedByName":"Satellitefanatic","CreatedById":202670,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-06T07:08:23Z","Content":"**[Necropost]**\n\nI do believe that documentation is available on the forum thread for ASET props"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-07T09:53:46Z","Content":"and seeing as it\u0027s no longer a necropost, I\u0027ll add...\n\nWe still love you [@alexustas](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78632-alexustas/)! ![:wub:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_wub.png \u0022:wub:\u0022) Take your time with life and we look forward to welcoming you back when you pick up the hobby again ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Distortion28","CreatedById":210323,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-18T12:23:48Z","Content":"In the notepad for the ASET\\_HUD, how what do I replace the SURFSPEED readout with in order to change this to orbital speed?"},{"CreatedByName":"CassetteTape","CreatedById":220258,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-19T17:07:46Z","Content":"Can anybody tell me what files do i put into gamedata?
