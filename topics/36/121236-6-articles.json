I\u0027ve been watching all the crazy stuff with KerbalStuff going down and SpaceDock taking over.\u00A0 I\u0027ve also been slowly rebuilding my KSP mod library so I can get back into this stuff a bit here and there.\u00A0 This also means I\u0027ve been slowly getting back into C# programming (school has be stuck in JavaScript right now... which really sucks.\u00A0 For instance: C# has data types.\u00A0 JavaScript has... Vars.\u00A0 What the heck is a var?\u00A0 A var is EVERYTHING... \u003Cem\u003Eat the same friggin\u0027 time!\u003C/em\u003E So annoying.) and that means a renewed interest in KSP modding.\u00A0 I won\u0027t say i\u0027m back in action or anything, but I think it\u0027s time to start poking the body... so to speak.\u00A0 Try not to think about that one too hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... to answer some questions...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003ERight now there is no official release.\u003C/s\u003E (EDIT: Holy Jebediah!\u00A0 I did not notice that there was a new release on there.\u00A0 Awesome!\u00A0 However, I am not the one to ask about this as I am only a mascot for the time being.)\u00A0 In fact, even when KF was in full swing, we never made it our of the alpha stages.\u00A0 I was going to take us into \u003Cem\u003Ebeta\u003C/em\u003E stage... but we all know how that worked out.\u00A0 I\u0027m considering doing a temporary release sometime this month if the new administration is alright with that and if KSP 1.1 doesn\u0027t drop on us before then, but it won\u0027t be a full-features release really.\u00A0 Just something to get the basics up and running again with all the new 1.0.5 features and such taken into account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the wheel stuff...\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, the wheels in KF work a bit differently than the stock wheel modules.\u00A0 They aren\u0027t a complete departure of course because they\u0027re still implemented in much the same way for the basic functionality of being round, being able to roll, and being able to support a vehicle that wants to interact with the surface of a planetary body and/or static surface (aka. bumping into it and changing momentum... aka. going up the hill instead of going through the hill... okay, I\u0027ll stop there) but that\u0027s where the similarity ends.\u00A0 Steering is the first thing you\u0027ll notice.\u00A0 It\u0027s a lot smoother and, when using... say 6x6 wheel configurations... you\u0027ll notice that not all the wheels turn the same amount.\u00A0 This creates a much more efficient turning system for the vehicle, as in less scraping of certain wheels and a more reliable center of the turning radius compared with wheels that all turn the same and rely on whatever wheel is grinding with the ground the hardest to determine the pivot point of the craft.\u00A0 Next is the suspension which is wheel-specific and travels a lot further than the stock suspensions.\u00A0 Also, KF suspension can be modified to raise and lower the vehicle and helps to reduce rolling of the craft in higher speed turns..\u00A0 Finally we have the RPM readouts and the way it all interacts.\u00A0 One goal of KF was to create a smoother transition between the differing acceleration levels of the vehicle.\u00A0 This reduces cases of flipping due to a wheel motor going from dead stop to full power immediately, and also helps the steering and anti-roll systems.\u00A0 This does result in slower overall velocities, and slower acceleration overall, but it makes for a much more stable ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the differing data for these wheels compared with stock is quite necessary, but I would also note that it makes it a lot harder to create a new wheel and, considering I started as a simply collaborator on this mod, I lack the knowledge of how to go about doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the source code... you and me both.\u00A0 I\u0027m working on getting all my old sources back on one computer so I can take stock of what I have and what is going on right now.\u00A0 I\u0027m still hopeful that the new administration can come up with a stable release, especially post-1.1, but I\u0027m working on getting back into things one step and a time.\u00A0 In the mean time, there is a utility you can search for called ILSpy which would let you decompile the DLL and take a look at how things are done either in C# or even VB apparently.\u00A0 That won\u0027t include any of my old WIP projects within the KF code that weren\u0027t ready to be compiled yet, but the functional stuff is all there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... you guys who were going to take

I\u0027ve been out of the code for a while now) changes.\u00A0 Max speed, however, is going to be a bit more of a bugger for you.\u00A0 In my testing, I\u0027ve never been able to get a KF rover even close to the speeds I could with the standard wheels.\u00A0 However, I also couldn\u0027t get a KF rover to flip or freak out nearly as much as I could with the stock wheels... so it still pays for itself in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was actually looking at AutoRove recently (and would like to take a look at the source sometime soon) and liked the idea behind it.\u00A0 Considering we don\u0027t change how the craft is controlled at all, you might not even really need to integrate anything unless you keep really close tabs on what each wheel is asking for in EC.\u00A0 Though... one thing worth mentioning is that we don\u0027t actually call it EC consumption or anything similar.\u00A0 I made it much more broad so that future modders could make the wheels run on different fuel types without having to change the code at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T01:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222442230\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022121236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457133266\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111158\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Gaalidas said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d actually like to know that myself, and whether or not this person can truly claim that this mod is fully functional in 1.0.5.\u00A0 If so, I\u0027m cool with it for the time being... but I\u0027m really just a mascot right now so it would have to be taken up with the rest of the team if they\u0027re still on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually noticed it wasn\u0027t any of our normal guys, or at least not the names I remember, after making my last edit here and thought to myself \u0022who the heck is \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the moment, I\u0027m holding off pointing CKAN to that Spacedock entry.
