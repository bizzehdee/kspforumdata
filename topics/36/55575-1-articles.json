I.e. - we know that LF and Oxi are a 45:55 ratio - but I do not know how much LF will fit in a cubic meter. Same with water, O2, CO2, etc (using the TAC Mod). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I\u0027m asking this is to develop realistic fuel quantities available for a particular model. I\u0027ve been using Wings3D and Blender - no issues in UV mapping, or importing - I just can\u0027t for the life of me work backwards from existing models to figure out how much fuel should be in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very new to modelling, and to mod development in general. I\u0027ve been poring through posts and other searches through the Internet, and have not found this data yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T07:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends. Is your model a single pressure vessel in which only one resource will reside, or is it like the KSP tanks, where they\u0027re actually the outer shell, inside which are multiple (two, for rocket fuel tanks) actual tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint two: you need a conversion ratio between m^3 and KSP Volume Units (KVU). Based off LF/Ox mass and volume estimations, I am of the opinion (and MFS uses the ratio) of 1 KVU = 5 liters (1/200 m^3).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint three: resource densities are provided for all resources; check GameData/Squad/Resources/Resources.cfg for the definitions. Stock, both LF and Oxi have a density of 0.005t / KVU, or (per above) 1 ton / m^3, aka 1 g/cc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rule of thumb is that if it\u0027s a tank like the Rockomax or FL-T line, approximately 80% of the volume of the cylinder is the actual tank volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut all this together. Let\u0027s say your tank is going to hold LF and Oxi. For that reason the \u0022tank\u0022 you\u0027re modeling is actually a (part of a) rocket stage, with internal pressure vessels. Let\u0027s say the volume of the model is 4 cubic meters. (1.25 x 3.25m). That means it has 4 * 0.8 * 200 KVU of useable volume, or 640 units. That means 288 LF, 352 Oxi.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarge18","CreatedById":95408,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T01:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks - I think that will work. The KVU part I hadn\u0027t found yet. I\u0027d been looking at the \u0022real\u0022 volume (i.e. - single vs. double pressure vessel and the loss of volume with shell and internal structure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat conversion ratio was something I wasn\u0027t achieving by digging apart the configs and figuring out potential volumes based on stock components and mods - and of course, some mods are just a SWAG. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreatly appreciate it - going to use this to relook capacities in some of my tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T03:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreys has been looking into real capacity as well, and MFS will eventually switch to it.
