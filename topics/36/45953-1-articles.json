The kit I have isn\u0027t that... accurate when drilling. I really need to get a better pillar drill tbh. The problem is the axles are either too close together and end up binding or they are too far apart and have horrible slack. I\u0027ve been cheating and having the main axle fixed and then the other gears are on slide paths so that I can move them in or out and then tighten them down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI miss my old rock solid pillar drill that I had at my old place. That with my small XY table meant that I could get gear axles perfect first time. Now it\u0027s cheat city lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any suggestions when building gear trains?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
