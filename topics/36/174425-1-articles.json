Thus I began to delve into IVA development - boy did I pick a doozy as my first go-round. But, here we are. It\u0027s my first, so be gentle...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis IVA was heavily influenced by the ASET Mk1 Landercan IVA. I loved the retro looking props and their obvious basis on the Apollo and Space Shuttle era hardware, besides being a huge space nut in general (big surprise, eh?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGoals:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate a fully immersive and playable IVA. As much as possible, the controls should function and be discrete (limit the number of \u0022dummy\u0022 controls), and the only time you\u0027d have to pop out of IVA would be to map mode to plan maneuvers (I justify this by thinking that Apollo had mission control pre-compute all their maneuvers (directly or via Pre-Avisory Data) anyway), and perhaps to control some specific part of the craft that wasn\u0027t (or couldn\u0027t be) mapped to an Action Group\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the obvious concessions to the way KSP works, and gameplay, stick to the general layout of the real-life Apollo CM, with an emphasis on placing controls in about the area they would be (for example, power subsystems in front of the right-hand seat where the LMP would fly)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nControl over the internal model lights present in the .mu (cabin flood and tunnel lights)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIndividual breakers control individual things or groups of things (for example, a breaker that controls power to the DSKY, another breaker that controls the FDAIs (8-balls), etc)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEnhance the general ambiance by the inclusion of misc static props (manuals, storage bags, etc) without overdoing it\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMod support: At the moment, concentrating on anything that has plugin hooks in RPM. Focusing on Chatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and RealChute (because I use them all). I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be integrating any MechJeb controls into the IVA (for lack of room, and in the spirit of the technological level of the Apollo CM), but if there\u0027s a lot of demand I may reconsider.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFunctioning Caution/Warning system (including a lamp/test function), closely mirroring that of the real Apollo CM C/W system\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAction Group support: The base layout is envisioned to have 10 AG buttons (with RPM AGMEMO support), but I\u0027m also working on an optional patch to tweak the layout a bit and include some more specific controls tied to specific AGs (for example, a yellow-striped guarded switch intended to fire an AG which would separate the CM from the SM)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWrite up and publish a user guide (so folks know what all these dang doo-dads do)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgress (last updated 4/2018):\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see from the pictures, the layout is basically complete, barring some minor tweaks here and there. There remains a lot to do on the backend (individual breakers are proving a particular challenge). I\u0027ve been learning as I go, and some of the early prop configs \u0026amp; tweaking is... well, it ain\u0027t pretty. I certainly want to get a lot of that cleaned up before I\u0027ll be comfortable even doing a beta release. I also need to thoroughly test this (my development copy of the game is still on 1.4.0) with the current release and mod dependencies. I also need to make sure I\u0027m squared away on all the license stuff (and pick my own license to boot). So, a release is probably gonna take a while...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the mean time, feedback and questions are encouraged and appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERelease\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Es\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTBD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDependencies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105821-14x-rasterpropmonitor-still-putting-the-a-in-iva-v0300-14-march-2018/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EJSI Raster Prop Monitor\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116430-aset-props-pack-v15-for-the-modders-who-create-iva/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EASET Props Pack\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-30T00:26:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2018 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by akardam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged Imgur embed to direct link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-30T04:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, this is *censored* GLORIOUS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCount me in as a test pilot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sufficient Anonymity","CreatedById":57923,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-05T11:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks excellent - would be very happy to help with testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"akardam","CreatedById":144039,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-05T20:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ve finally got the Caution \u0026amp; Warning system working the way I want it to (except for the breakers, more on that below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImgur album: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/PNRYkP0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/PNRYkP0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe C/W \u0022lamp test\u0022 function actually came out of my wanting an easy way to make sure the C/W panel looked OK (instead of trying to simulate all those conditions at once), but then of course it dawned on me that usually when you have a set of indicators you have some way to light them all up to make sure they\u0027re all working, and as far as I can tell the Apollo crafts had such functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs seen in the album, the C/W MODE switch has three settings - AUTO, TEST and ALL MUTE. The AUTO setting (the default) will fire off the C/W indicators and the Master Alarm as necessary (if conditions warrant). The TEST mode lights everything in the C/W system up regardless of conditions (sadly there\u0027s no sound, but the 2nd tile in the album shows this in action).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe MASTER ALARM MUTE pushbutton is actually where the Master Alarm audible alarm comes from. It lights up under the same circumstances as the big \u0022MASTER ALARM\u0022 tablo indicators, but if pushed while lit it will silence the audible component of the Master Alarm (at least until another one comes in). If the C/W MODE switch is in the ALL MUTE position, this button\u0027s operation is inhibited (it will neither light, nor make noise). This button functions using the RPM \u0022alarmSound\u0022 and \u0022alarmShutdownButton\u0022 and is bound by the limitations of those facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next hurdle is the breakers. I learned a lot about RPM custom variables in my work on the C/W system, and I think I know how I want to incorporate the breakers - the main challenge as I see it is to do this in a way that won\u0027t break any of the \u0022stock\u0022 ASET props and/or other IVAs. It\u0027ll take some work (which for me is limited to some nights and some weekends), so everyone\u0027s patience is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, suggestions and feedback are welcomed and appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OversizedIsBestSize","CreatedById":174905,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T02:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, please do add mechjeb, otherwise first person launches with very close-cut amounts of fuel etc will be very annoying.
