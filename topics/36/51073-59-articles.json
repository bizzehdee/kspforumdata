I\u0027ve seen people mentioning a specific commit where the change took place and the compatibility broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that dropping the version numbering on the .dll wouldn\u0027t fix it in and of itself: the new one would still register as \u0027different\u0027, but if the version number didn\u0027t change after that, and the functions that were being hooked into didn\u0027t either, each subsequent version after that would continue to work after it\u0027d been recompiled once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, if my understanding is correct, you could make your versions of scansat work as a drop-in on the unmodified RPM simply by setting it up in such a way that your .dlls always came out with a version number of 1.0.5.32015, the version of the release that RPM\u0027s been compiled with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not great practice, and it\u0027d remove the ability to tell what version you had by checking the plugin... but it should allow it to work without having to rebuild RPM constantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-08T00:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2014 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T01:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBasically what happened was this: Mechjeb\u0027s version numbers are hard-coded in the code itself, and are only changed when a release is pulled.
