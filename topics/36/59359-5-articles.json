Most would argue that \u003Cem\u003Emoar parts is moar better\u003C/em\u003E, but it also causes the parts list to be quite cluttered up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that springs to mind right now is that all your trusses and tubes are multiples of each other. I think this limits their usefulness, as you are only capable of creating things that multiples of (for instance) the first trusses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera). If the second smallest would be 1 1/3\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E sized, you would be able to create a lot more intermediate sizes (1, 1 1/3\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E, 2 1/3\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E, 2 2/3\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E, 3, et cetera).
