The aim is to get the experiments back to Kerbin. It suppose to present a bit of a logistic problem and makes space stations a bit more practical as well. So you will be flying up new science equipment and test samples to the station. Then bring back the test material for analysis on Kerbin. It encourages people to think about service missions to space stations. EVA play also gets a bit of a boost because there stuff to collect and move around. There is supposed to be a reward for returning test samples back to planet side. At least that is how the contracts are supposed to work.\n\nOriginally this tied in with the concept behind [Station Science mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50145-112-station-science-v16/). Which has similar game play mechanics and also expands space station play. Take material into orbit and put it through a test program. Then return the material back to Kerbin for a reward. It is possible to do the analysis in orbit in Station Science but it required lifting about 100 tons of advanced lab, particle accelerator and test chamber up there. Initially it is just easier to come up with a economic taxi service for crew, equipment and test material. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T16:38:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis2**"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T09:17:40Z","Content":"Does this work with 1.1.3?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesecake","CreatedById":138400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T10:13:35Z","Content":"Yes, it works."}]}
