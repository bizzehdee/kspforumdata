Will be looking into the rest of the ShipCore series parts next (ICPS, HUS, BPCs) to bring them in-line with stock-built equivalents; after that will be all of the \u0027general\u0027 parts (decouplers, fairings, etc).\n\nAlso swapped over all of the service modules and command pods to use the \u0027Hypergolic\u0027 fuel type for their engine and RCS.  The only things still using monopropellant for RCS are the ICPS and HUS... because if I understand correctly the actually did/would use a cold-gas thruster for attitude control (not technically \u0027monopropellant\u0027 but close enough...).  So mostly appropriate.\n\nHave been debating on if I should add VolumeContainer support to the command modules and service modules; does anyone see a need for swappable/alterable resources for those parts?  E.G. removing some propellant to add KIS storage, or include some different resources (no clue why on that one).  Could also potentially make adding Life-Support supplies a bit easier as they could be added as a second sub-container that would allow for the player to adjust the amounts/ratios of the various LS supplies (or remove some in favor of more KIS storage or otherwise).  Thoughts?\n\nOn the note of cleanup (sort of) - am working on implementing a thrust-curve editor for the MSRB parts;  this will be an in-editor tool where you can either use some pre-made thrust curves, adjust the premade ones to your liking, or come up with completely new thrust curves of your own.  About the only thing I haven\u0027t figured out is how I\u0027m going to \u0027save\u0027 the custom thrust curves into the part; there is very limited / no support for saving complex config-node data and I may have to hack it all into a single String variable to save it into the persistence file for that craft/part.  Might also offer a \u0027save as premade curve\u0027 option so that you can easily add additional premade thrust curves (will need to learn/figure out c# disk IO for this one).\n\nWill be continuing the balancing and cleanup throughout the week, with the next testing release likely put together on Saturday; should give time for a reasonable amount of balancing and updating things."}]}
