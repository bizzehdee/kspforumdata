Due to its inherent awesome, I\u0027m basing this pack in a large part on the \u0022Project Longshot\u0022 spacecraft from Civilization 5 (the ship you build for the Science Victory). Looking at it from a rocketry perspective, this craft makes sense for inter-stellar missions. My idea was to downscale it to ease inter-planetary missions in KSP. This was inspired in a large part by \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20732-Building-the-Alpha-Centari-ship-from-Civ-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread.\u003C/a\u003E However, I fully plan to add in my own personal style to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic mission plan works something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A combination of SRBs and Tordial Aerospike engines launch the Longbow system into Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The large ion engine cluster fires, accelerating the ship towards its target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Halfway to its destination, the ship turns 180 degrees and begins firing retrograde\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The ion engines are left in orbit around the planet as the Longbow Shuttle detaches from the ion engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The shuttle lands on the planet/moon(s) and performs !!Science!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Once its time to go home, the shuttle launches, reconnects to the ion engines, and flies back to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind this is both my first project in KSP, and my first time using Blender for 3D modeling. Expect the models to suck (at least at first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the rough concept for the Longbow Shuttle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img846/6617/longbowshuttleprerender.png\u0022 alt=\u0022longbowshuttleprerender.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T06:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice! what are you going to break the shuttle into, partswise? also, which docking clamp mod are you looking at?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage Baneblade","CreatedById":37495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T01:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MaverickSawyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MaverickSawyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice! what are you going to break the shuttle into, partswise? also, which docking clamp mod are you looking at?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, my preliminary plan is to break the shuttle into the following parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS thruster nosecone, ASAS, Command pod (carries 6 of the 10 crew of whole system), Fuselage fuel tanks, wings (possibly fuel tanks), winglets (for the end of wings), tailfin, control surfaces, landing gear, docking port, 2 radial engines for the back (think the current radial engine), and a large engine for the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny way you slice it, I\u0027ve got my work cut out for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazurkri","CreatedById":16624,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T04:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this was going to go interplanetary distances by itself, it would be using either AM or some application of fusion technology, not Ion Engines; Ion engines are great for small ships.
