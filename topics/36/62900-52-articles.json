You can safely unlock\u00A0the node again and it won\u0027t cost anything. I can\u0027t leave the node as \u0022purchased\u0022 because then you\u0027d get access to the parts, so I manually lock it again, but the way I unlock it no longer updates the R\u0026amp;D UI right away. It seems like I might have to unlock it before the R\u0026amp;D screen opens. I may be able to tie into an event if there\u0027s one that fires between the button press and the UI opening, instead of using the event that fires when the UI is opened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"danielboro","CreatedById":166078,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-06T23:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwat will cause kct to do a recalculate of all vessels construction \u00A0time\u00A0in construction list?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfound this in out_put.log\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/generated/common/runtime/UnityEngineDebugBindings.gen.cpp Line: 42)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInput is null for field \u0027initialName\u0027 in config node \u0027MODULE\u0027\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at System.Environment.get_StackTrace()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at ConfigNode.AddValue(System.String name, System.String value)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at BaseFieldList.Save(.ConfigNode node)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at PartModule.Save(.ConfigNode node)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at ShipConstruct.SaveShip()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at KerbalConstructionTime.KCT_BuildListVessel..ctor(.ShipConstruct s, System.String ls, Double bP, System.String flagURL)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at KerbalConstructionTime.KCT_Utilities.RecalculateEditorBuildTime(.ShipConstruct ship)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0at KerbalConstructionTime.KerbalConstructionTime.EditorRecalculation()\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlong story:\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter installing the MKS update, the new changes broke my ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\ni recalled a ship from the launchpad and did an edit to fix it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nwen i presed ,save changes, the ship disapeard.\u003Cbr\u003E\ni didnt see it ready or in the construction list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni edited the construction list to be faster (*30000) and spend the 300K on a new ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFF for 30 game minutes then edited the the construction speed back to nurmal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter lunching the ship i started getting messages that ships are ready and noticed that ships that are sopuse the be ready in 23 days will now be ready in 1-2 hours\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow can i fix the time without editing every ship in the list (i have a long list. ~18 ships)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-07T07:24:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2017 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by danielboro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T14:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222947188\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002262900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486423888\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166078\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022danielboro\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, danielboro said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwat will cause kct to do a recalculate of all vessels construction \u00A0time\u00A0in construction list?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ship being completed causes all of them to recalculate, ironically it\u0027s because of the part inventory/part tracker which isn\u0027t currently in the mod. Unfortunately, the only way to fix it is to either roll back to a previous save (KCT makes one when you recover to storage that you could load) or edit all of them in the save file since they\u0027re all stuck with the new BP value.

Just open up the save in a text editor, search for the ship name and look for a line like \u0022BP = 8234723.3723\u0022 and change the number to something fairly low. Then open the save and it should be nearly complete. The line in the save might be something different since I don\u0027t have a save file to reference right now, but it should be close to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T21:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeen using this in my new career game with plethora of other mods, so far no issues. \u00A0Anything specific I should check to make sure it is working right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fobok","CreatedById":73999,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T22:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright, reporting an issue.
