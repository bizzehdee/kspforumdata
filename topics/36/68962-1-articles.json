Most likely just a sub-scale test bed, but it sure looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve currently done it to real world scale, I haven\u0027t kerbalized the dimensions, mainly since there doesn\u0027t seem to be a set standard. As you can see in the album, having it this scale makes the cargo bay marginally useful (and maybe there\u0027s space for a passenger module or two!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe screenshots in orbit show the boilerplate version, with all the separate meshes still as one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d never really modeled anything before, but helldiver\u0027s Mini Shuttle was crazy inspirational.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model is done and textured (although I\u0027ll probably take another crack at the texture, add a normal map and some more detail), all parts are animated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s almost done, right? HAHAHAHAHA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started the process of getting the meshes into the game as individual parts, but it\u0027s been kind of a struggle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, getting the correct orientation in Blender and Unity and getting it to show up facing the correct direction in the game has been a fight every step of the way. Does the rotation and facing in Blender matter? Does rotation and facing in Unity matter? I\u0027ve tried parenting the meshes to an empty Game Object in Unity and rotating that, but it has inconsistent results. There are just seemingly dozens of places the rotation and position can be set, and it\u0027s been hard for me to pin down what I need to do. I feel like I\u0027m making it harder than it should be. Does it matter if the position and rotation are applied? And every time I try and reposition the parts, apply their rotation, the animations break, so I get to fiddle with that. I\u0027ve been using the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/181870-Blender-gt-Unity-Rotation-Fix\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea plugin for Blender that swaps the coords for Unity\u003C/a\u003E, but it also resets the position of everything, which makes my animation keyframes wrong, so I get to do those again, and it still doesn\u0027t work all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, progress is being made. Attachment nodes aren\u0027t bad, and and basic configs are set up. Currently the nose and fuselage are in, cargo bay animation is working, and landing gear are mostly working. I\u0027ve been looking at the example images for landing gear floating around, but the default gear module is too finicky for my tastes, so I\u0027m trying snjo\u0027s Firespitter plugin. I got the gear part working, as in the wheel collider and open/close animation works, but my gear mesh has decided it wants to rotate around the z axis instead of the x axis. That seems to maybe be because the wheel is parented to the landing leg. I know that\u0027s not how the example landing gear images are set up, but I need that parenting for the animation to work. I also found out that breaking the parenting of the meshes in Unity breaks the animations, so I\u0027ve had to set up dummy objects in Blender to preserve the parenting relationship. Good times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to get a post up, at least, since the lack of progress recently has been kind of discouraging.

On top of this, every time I would apply transforms, or rotate the model to fix how it appeared in the game, I would break my landing gear animations, which required doing them again from scratch. Not terribly complex animations, but it got old quickly. I imagine I was doing something wrong, but I have no idea what. I got as far as getting the fuselage, nosecone, and tail pieces to align correctly without fiddling in the VAB, and the nose landing gear at least partially working using the Firespitter plugin, but not 100%, after a week or so of work trying to get the stock landing gear module working with my gear and failing. Just getting the wheels to rotate in the correct direction with the wheel collider was a couple nights of work, reverse engineering from screenshots scattered around the forums. It also seems I\u0027d made a mistake in not making the landing gear separate parts, which would require chopping up the model again. Then I got to the wings and control surfaces, which again, did not align correctly, and the wings showed zero lift when aligned correctly. So, seeing the amount of work left, I\u0027ve given up. It\u0027s obviously possible to get parts aligned correctly, landing gear and wings working, as a number of successful mods have shown, but it\u0027s no longer worth the frustration to me.

I got seriously burnt out after a few weeks straight of late nights trying to get the separate pieces aligned and working correctly in game. After all that, I\u0027m still not sure I understand how the coordinates swap from Blender to KSP/Unity. I tried rotating the models in Blender, in Unity, setting them on the origin in both, applying and not applying transformations in Blender. I read a number of tutorials and found some mentions on the forum here, but I can\u0027t seem to wrap my brain around it.
