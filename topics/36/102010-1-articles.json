Our scientists have found two experiments that will return useful data from the resulting explosion.\n\nThis mod has two new science parts, the Bangometer (seismometer) and flashometer (spectrometer)\n\n**Bangometer**\n\nThe bangometer is available in the Space Exploration tech tree node\n\nThis experiment will analyse the seismic waves generated by an impact in order to get information about the interior of the body.\n\n1. Land a vessel with a bangometer anywhere on the surface of an atmosphereless body.\n2. Crash a second craft into the body as hard as you can. (You must be controling this craft until impact)\n3. Switch back to the landed craft. There will now be an experiment registered in the bangometer.\n4. Recover or transmit the result back to KSC\n\n![b4Z9GqY.png](http://i.imgur.com/b4Z9GqY.png)\n\nA seismic study on the Mun\n\nThe amount of science resulting from an impact is proportional to the kinetic energy of the impact. Once you have achecived a high enough energy to get the maximum science no more impact will give any further data.\n\n**Flashometer**\n\nThe flashometer is available in the advanced exploration node\n\nThis experiment analyses the spectrum of radiation emitted by the debris thrown up by an impact\n\n1. Put a vessel with a Flashometer in low orbit around an atmosphereless body\n2. Crash a second craft into the body. (You must be controling this craft until impact)\n3. The craft with the Flashometer must be above the horizon in order that it can see the ejecta\n4. Switch back to the orbiting craft. There will now be an experiment registered in the flashometer.\n5. Recover or transmit the result back to KSC\n\nThe science from this experiment is not related to the impact speed (although there is a minimum energy in order to create the debris). The science is linked to the biome in which the impactor crashed and is repeatable for each biome.\n\n![WSrzImI.png](http://i.imgur.com/WSrzImI.png)\n\n**Career mode**\n\nIn carrer mode you will be given contracts to perform impacts on bodies you have previously visited. Both are completed by receiving the required data back at KSC. Bangometer contracts will specify a minimum kinetic energy required to complete the contract (KE=1/2mv^2^). Flashometer contracts specify a minimum latitude where the impact has to occur.\n\n**The models for the parts are currently placeholders**\n\nIs there anyone with some model building skill who would like to come up with something better?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T10:30:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tomf**\n  \nrelease thread"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T14:01:21Z","Content":"pics or it didnt happen."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T14:30:47Z","Content":"well the bangometer is already a thing for anyone using KSPI but the flashometer is a cool addition. moar science!
