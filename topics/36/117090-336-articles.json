So, you can swap between a list of meshes and/or textures, but that is it.  I need -multiple- lists of meshes/textures per part, *and* code to glue it all together in a logical manner.  It also notably does not support diameter/model scaling.  And finally, it requires that all meshes are compiled into the same model -- which I think is pure dirty-ugly-hack territory.\n\nIt is actually one of the new features that I\u0027m most disappointed in.  Because now I\u0027m going to have to forever answer questions on why my texture/etc doesn\u0027t use the stock icon-based preview stuff.  I would if I could...\n\nEdit:\n\nIf I were to use the stock mesh/model switching... SSTU would be limited to having a single diameter of fuel tank per part (so would need a unique part for 1.25, 1.875, 2.5, etc), with no adapter/mount options, and only a single texture-set option.  Also no recoloring or PBR textures.  Pretty much would lose all of the things that make SSTU what it is.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-19T20:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2018 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Electrocutor","CreatedById":109593,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-19T20:20:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No.  It is so limited that it is entirely unsuitable for my uses.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Namely you can only have a single set of \u0027variants\u0027 per part -- you cannot have multiple PartVariant modules or whatever they called it (part variant stuff is implemented at the Part class level, and there is only one field for \u0027current variant\u0027).
