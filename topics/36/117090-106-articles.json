The 1.05 branch would not see any further *-development-*, and would only exist for bug-fixes and archival purposes.  I aim to allow the 1.05 branch to become stable at this point... so it might be possible to start including craft files for those still on 1.05.  This is mostly because I expect the update to take at least a month (two weeks of pre-release, and likely a few weeks after that as there is a -ton- of stuff I need to do during this update... including full balancing passes), and would like the mod to be usable for at least some KSP versions during this time.\n\nSo, as soon as the pre-release is available, development will be frozen on the 1.05 branch and it will see bugfixes for major issues only; the majority of my development time will be devoted to the update."},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T21:12:17Z","Content":"Sounds great..\n\nLook forward to any and everything you put out.\n\nGreat stuff Shadowmage.\n\nCheers."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T21:38:15Z","Content":"Finally managed to get the RD-0110 unwrapped/laid-out/AO-baked; next stop, texturing...\n\n![RLUDH1n.png](http://i.imgur.com/RLUDH1n.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T21:45:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Finally managed to get the RD-0110 unwrapped/laid-out/AO-baked; next stop, texturing...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![RLUDH1n.png](http://i.imgur.com/RLUDH1n.png)](http://i.imgur.com/RLUDH1n.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nLooks good."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T23:23:29Z","Content":"I have a new bug to report:\n\nI created a Shuttle in SPH using the FSX.
