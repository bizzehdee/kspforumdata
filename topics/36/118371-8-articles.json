You\u0027ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette, so during development there\u0027s often things that are left broken while you\u0027re getting something else working. During the course of this week I\u0027ve had hatch holes flipped 90 degrees, the player occasionally being fired 100m from the craft during loading, colliders floating off into the void, parts being completely impassable, lots of Z-fighting, and colliders being confused about what \u0022vertical\u0022 means:\n\n![6yko35p.png](http://i.imgur.com/6yko35p.png)\n![I7JOsP9.png](http://i.imgur.com/I7JOsP9.png)\n\n(This is still KSP 1.0.4: The \u0022Development build\u0022 tag comes as a result of [setting KSP up for debugging](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114241-KSP-Plugin-debugging-for-Visual-Studio-and-Monodevelop-on-all-OS).)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really enjoy popping on here every once in a while and being pleasantly surprised to see new images uploaded to the album.

I\u0027ll have to make some tools to speed up the creation of the remaining 18 IVA-able parts.\n\nHere\u0027s an analysis of each part\u0027s state with regard to Free IVA:\n\n- Mk1 Cockpit: No room to IVA, not crew-passible. No idea how to deal with opening cockpits at this point.\n- Mk1 Inline Cockpit: No room to IVA. No way of transferring crew through it in spite of the hatches on the ends. No idea how to deal with opening cockpits at this point.\n- Mk2 Cockpit: No work done yet. Needs a rounded-corner rectangular hatch mesh to be made (could make the IVA hatch\u0027s window transparent too!)\n- Mk2 Inline Cockpit: Internal IVA and EVA hatches don\u0027t match external model, can\u0027t be pathed through in spite of hatches on the ends. Likely can\u0027t support this without redesigning the IVA.\n- Mk3 Cockpit: No work done yet. Needs the same hatch as the Mk2 Cockpit. The IVA hatch\u0027s window isn\u0027t present on the external model, but could be retrofitted. The EVA hatch is a different shape on the outside compared to the inside ([just like the real Space Shuttle! !\\[:D\\](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)](http://members.optushome.com.au/julieaylward/images/JSC/shuttle%20trainer-1.jpg)), so it will need a fancy hatch model made.\n- Mk1 Command Pod: No work done yet. No room to IVA and not crew-passible, but the EVA hatch is already a separate prop! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n- Mk1-2 Command Pod: IVA colliders and transfer hatches done. EVA hatch not done. IVA and EVA hatches not present on internal model: Needs hatch models made.\n- Mk1 Lander Can: Hatch mask added. No colliders done. IVA hatch not present on internal model: Needs a hatch model made.\n- Mk2 Lander-can: Hatch mask added. No colliders done. Hatch is slightly smaller on the inside than the outside, but that should be ok (outward opening plug hatch). IVA walls extend beyond the part into the next one, which can look bad. Not sure how to work around this yet.\n- PPD-12 Cupola Module: Hatch mask added. No colliders done. The handle on the hatch is the same prop as all handles inside, so they all disappear when the hatch is open.\n- BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point: Needs simple cylinder IVA model to be made.\n- Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector: Needs complex IVA model to be made.\n- Z-4K Rechargeable Battery Bank: Needs simple cylinder IVA model to be made.\n- Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port: Needs simple cylinder IVA model to be made.\n- Clamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port: Needs simple cylinder IVA model to be made.\n- Clamp-O-Tron Sr. Docking Port: Needs simple cylinder IVA model to be made.\n- Inline Clamp-O-Tron: Needs complex IVA model madeto be. May not actually be pressurised (no crew hatches on the ends, but could be replaced with the same end as the Mk1 Inline Cockpit), nor big enough to be passed through.\n- Mk2 Clamp-O-Tron: Needs complex IVA model made with moving parts. Not passable while closed. Mind your head while passing through.\n- PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container: IVA mostly done. Needs model for the EVA hatch.\n- Mk2 Crew Cabin: No work done yet. Needs a rounded-corner rectangular hatch mesh to be made.\n- Mk3 Passenger Module: No work done yet. Needs a rounded-corner rectangular hatch mesh to be made.\n- Not listed: These parts don\u0027t appear to be pressurised or crew-traversible (e.g. tanks full of fuel). Alternative parts will be needed to fill these roles, such as [Stockalike Station Parts Expansion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just thinking, if the config file is easy enough to operate you could probably \u0027hire\u0027 a few people to add colliders for you.
