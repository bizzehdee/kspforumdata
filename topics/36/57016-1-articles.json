This leaves the decoupler attached to the upper stage, but that leads me to ask, is there any way then to detach it from the upper stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decoupler I created also has ullage motors that fire at separation, which I suppose complicates things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T10:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can think of two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse two decouple modules, with different explosive node IDs (could be difficult as spacebar will activate both).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr use a regular decoupler and set the engine above\u0027s fairing jettisonmodule to \u0022isfairing = false\u0022 and set its jettison direction to downward. if you separate the engine and decoupler in staging, the lower stage should decouple on the first hit of spacebar and the interstage should fall off on the second.

When the fairing jettisons, it kind of pops off the engine instantly, travelling retro the extent of the engine itself, then sort of stops and falls away naturally after that. It does not appear to be colliding with anything. I\u0027ve reduced the jettisonForce by a factor of 10 and it didn\u0027t make any discernible difference. I will experiment with a stock engine and see if it does the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the ullage motors, I think I\u0027ll come up with a small part that remains attached to the main rocket body, and translate the trust transform or the fx to the correct visual location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T15:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tried setting the isFairing attribute of ModuleJettison to true for the skipper engine, it cause catastrophic failure and the same error \u0022Ignore collision failed\u0022.

First one should be a normal, slim decoupler and the other should consist of an interstage shroud, KW-style. The first one would decouple the fuel tank (if you\u0027re modelling the S-I you could even integrate it into the tank, as long as the engines are split off, which you should do anyway) and the second one decouples itself. Ullage motors can be radially attached to the upper decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T16:00:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand what you\u0027re describing correctly, I think KOSMOS URM interstage behaves the way you want. You attach an interstage part (a cylinder that surface attaches) to the fuel tank above the engine, and then you attach a regular decoupler below the engine. You can trigger the in-line decoupler to separate the lower stage, and you can separately trigger the interstage decoupler, which will then fall clear of your rocket if you are accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T16:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, pretty much what I meant.
