Stopping a little early is often safer than stopping a little late. Solid rockets alone will never be the softest landing, but I\u0027m not going to go out of my way to make the landings rougher.

StayPut mode was added to do just that. The engines will wait until the lander absorbs the initial shock of touchdown, and then fire to keep it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Desrtfox\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ll look into it.

Because you\u0027re often coming in so fast with landertrons, a fraction of a second difference in firing time can result in hitting the ground at 20\u002B m/s. I try to keep the average height of zero velocity at exactly ground level, but there seems to be some variance in how different ships perform. Stopping a little early is often safer than stopping a little late. Solid rockets alone will never be the softest landing, but I\u0027m not going to go out of my way to make the landings rougher. If you want a harder landing, the heightmultiplier and offset variables are there in the part.cfg file to allow you to tweak the performance to your liking. Setting them to 1 and 0 respectively should result in few if any early stops.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh well, sorry about the misunderstanding.

If I can find an easy way to do it, I\u0027ll try adding the vent\u002Bstayput as an option. However from what I\u0027ve been able to figure out so far, it looks like pretty complex functionality to code. I\u0027m not convinced it would improve landings, and it doesn\u0027t seem any more realistic than a multi-directional venting that results in no net forces. In addition, the basic functionality is already there with the StayPut mode. So long as I can\u0027t see any added value from this proposed mode, it\u0027s not going to be a high priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for more modes to add. I started playing around with a launch escape mode that fires automatically when it detects a part of the ship breaking/exploding. However so far, I think it might be a bit too hard to accurately determine which circumstances actually warrant an abort. Many minor mishaps can be recovered from. Without this automated functionality, the Landertrons would just be firing on command which is no different than sepratrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall progress update: Tweakables for heightmultiplier and offset are working, and Landertrons will draw electric charge while armed.

Use the icon color to determine if they\u0027re armed. The new method should cause fewer conflicts with other mods too. Also, after refueling a blank stage will be added to your staging, which means you don\u0027t need to move the Landertrons around manually before activating them again, just hit space once or twice.
