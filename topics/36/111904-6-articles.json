The problem is the ISS Solar Arrays\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI found something else. I put the whole station in orbit, then launched my two docking test probes and put them within 200m of station, and i couldnt dock them. Which means one of two things things: the glitch with the solar arrays prevents docking within the 200m sphere, or the lag caused by the solar arrays prevents docking. either way, it seems to be the solar arrays causing the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralSirJohn","CreatedById":84184,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T23:58:09Z","Content":"Have you tried it in the 11-30-2000 configuration (P6 and solar arrays docked to the top of the Z1 - as seen in [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Sts097-704-074.jpg/894px-Sts097-704-074.jpg))?"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T00:40:11Z","Content":"I\u0027ll try that right now\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\ntried it, couldn\u0027t dock.
