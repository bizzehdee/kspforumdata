That said I want to broach the topic of the old xenon RCS thrusters, Moore from what I understand they no longer work on our electricity which in my opinion they shouldn\u0027t, they require xenon. Now my understanding of ion engines is limited, but from what I gather they use charged particles in this case xenon to generate propulsion. charged particles don\u0027t provide a ton of thrust but do provide a long period of continuous thrust. So using ion engines as RCS thrusters is a little far fetched but we will say it\u0027s a giant leap forward in ionic engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that the problem is identified what a solution, well mecrisp set the generator generate amps set thruster to on that, which works but does really them like engines.

There are many parts floating around that generates units of a resource with another/other resource/s and I thought that could be perfect! What if the advance in ion propulsion came in the form of a precharge chamber that creates \u0027chargedXenon\u0027 or \u0027chargedArgon\u0027 as a resource, or created \u0027chargedIons\u0027 and uses a different radio for each with one creating more than the other (I think the Kspi argon us more effective but heavier than xenon but I have to check and in on my phone atm) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the ions created in the precharge chamber than stored in tanks that cannot fueled before launch but the orchards chamber some board off with ...this is fuzzy part of this for discussion balance of course. I feel like it should not be able to be stored a tank long... charged particles like to discharge and could spark the ground in lfo rich environs could catastrophic... anyways... what do y\u0027all think....?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T11:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fix by Mecrisp is a bit of a hack really as all it does is create a fake dense electric charge, as we all know by now in KSP no mass equals no thrust. Prior to involvement with this project I have messed around with almost every type of thruster design, from arc-jets to hall effect thrusters, and in reality done of them are as effective as a std monoprop thruster, OK for moving satellites around but not much else. My solution to this point has been to have thrusters run on whatever the main fuel of the vessels is, be it good old liquid fuel, xenon or even jelly beans if thats what you use, and supply them with a good amount of the electricity. After all it\u0027s not real. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome research has lead me to the conclusion that it\u0027s more technological restrictions rather than physics that prevents these exotic thrusters producing a useful amount of thrust, the only real solution is to either suspend belief and not worry that your RCS is using some fantasy to make thrust. Or to bite the bullet and and incorporate some mono storage in your design and scrap the fantasy thrusters full stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m certainly no rocket scientist and am in no way bright enough to understand all the equations you\u0027re presented with when investigating the properties of engines operating in a vacuum, but what I do know is that we\u0027ve been playing with some very inflexible rules in a very flexible way while enjoying KSP and long may it continue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T13:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid u fix the lag they caused when opening and them facing backwards to sun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T13:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo lag noticed in testing, and non reported so far.
