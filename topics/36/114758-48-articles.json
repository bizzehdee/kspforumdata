For example, Asbestos comes from an ore).  The actual definition of Ore is simply \u0027valuable stuff extracted from dirt or rock\u0027.  And in the case of KSP, our Ore is modeled after hydrate-rich rock that we can crack oxygen/hydrogen from and transform into valuable fuel products - similar to some of the plans to use asteroids for refueling (and asteroids were the primary use case, but we added planetary support as well since it already existed in the mod I based all of the stock stuff on).  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Go into your back garden, and dig a shovel of dirt.

One part with the bases etc and one for the storage system so they could coexist. Also thought about splitting the parts that were added for mods into a third sub-mod...or lets say a mod-suppor- addon so one has more options to decide what to use and what not.\n\nBut this would have been a pain to maintain and also would eventually break the mod for everyone that has used it before...so this was not a good idea. But the rover would be in a separte mod."}]}
