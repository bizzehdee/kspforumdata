It\\\u0027s shape hardly can be called esthetically pleasing. When compared to the Dynasoar or the shuttle on the image you\\\u0027ve mentioned, it is in fact ugly.\n\nBut you\\\u0027re not obliged to model the Hermes. No shuttle has ever been launched by an Ariane rocket, therefor you\\\u0027re completely free to design a shuttle to YOUR liking. Personally speaking, i would love to see a spaceplane/shuttle launched on top of an Ariane 5 (even if it would fly like a lead ball in KSP). By the way, your work so far is brilliant!"},{"CreatedByName":"tadeass","CreatedById":16874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T13:52:30Z","Content":"Today, I made a render of that surprise.\n\nI present you l-1011!\n\n\u003E ![14991338.png](http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/7654/14991338.png)\n\nIt will be vehicle for Pegasus rocket:\n\n\u003E ![Orbital_L1011_Pegasus.jpg](http://www.satnews.com/images_upload/279921201/Orbital_L1011_Pegasus.jpg)\n\nAnd maybe it will have my favourite plane paint:\n\n\u003E ![ed_force_one_in_flight.jpg](http://maiden-world.com/images/articles/ed_force_one_in_flight.jpg)\n\nAlso, for the poll.
