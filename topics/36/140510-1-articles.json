Basically, the Apollo LES that these parts are modeled after featured a automatically deploying\u00A0pair of canards that, when extended,\u00A0caused the escaping CM to re-orient itself so that the base of the CM is\u00A0pointed towards prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like my part to model that behavior. \u00A0I suppose the first question is: is this even possible? In real-life, the re-orientation resulted when deployment of the canards moved\u00A0the CoP ahead of the CoM of the escaping module. To me, this suggests that my nose-cone part needs to have some kind of aerodynamic module applied to it, one that essentially creates no drag or lift until it is deployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have another vague notion about drag-cubes somehow possibly\u00A0coming into play, but that they exist is about the limits of my knowledge of\u00A0them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve updated my model in Blender\u00A0so that it now has the canard bits and looks the way I want it to and created a simple animation to show the canards in the initial and deployed states. The canards are two separate sub-objects in the Blender model, children of the base nosecone..\u00A0I don\u0027t really know how to procede from here, or if this is even correct for what I am trying to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an idea to create a simple plugin to manage the timing of the various actions in the abort sequence. But if modeling the canard behavior\u00A0is going to be problematic I see little point going there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any advice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T22:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps this is not the ideal forum? \u00A0Will a moderator please\u00A0move it to the plugin help and support area?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
