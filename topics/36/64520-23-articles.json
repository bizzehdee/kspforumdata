The navball does not switch when you press control from here, however like i said it docks just fine. For the docking port is it possible to have fairings generate like and engine when you put a decoupler underneath it? A few other recommendations for the future can you make a toggleable fuel cell to generate power. Power isn\u0027t really a problem but I can foresee it being one. Could you consider making a built in mechjeb or maybe even a small mechjeb box for the ship? Finally the perpendicular flying really is a problem at least for me. I can be lined up with the runway and ship will fly sideways and if I try to correct it just keeps going, and if the ship isn\u0027t pointed exactly prograde when it lands, it explodes.
