Finally got home, and .25 installed and its full of awesomeness! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how the conversion will fair once roverdude updates karbonite for .90 and regolith(havent had a chance to read up on it yet) But ill keep my eyes out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(workshops also updated to not freeze up when scrap metal is full)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liquid5n0w","CreatedById":129089,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T16:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is no longer needed as MKS/Karbonite now includes EPL support? Is there anything this would do to help?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T17:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing, it makes EPL work if you \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E have MKS/OKS installed. This is currently the case with my install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also makes the EPL parts (augers, smelters, workshop) work as they should, although the version available in the first post doesn\u0027t work on any of the drills or augers right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem causing the drills/augers to not work is that they use the wrong module name. Changing it to the right module name makes it work correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix is simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Open up the MM patch config file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wherever it reads \u0022name = ORSModuleRailsExtraction\u0022, change it to \u0022name = ORSX_ModuleResourceExtraction\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Enjoy your working drills and augers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added the appropriate SCANsat sensor to the Karbonite scanner, because the Karbonite scanner already had the right hardware for it, it just needed a firmware update to tell it what to look for. That\u0027s my RP reason, anyways. Sending up another 20-odd mapping satellites didn\u0027t exactly seem like fun to me, and they all had Karbonite scanners already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
