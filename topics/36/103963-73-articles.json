It looks beautiful near the ground but when you get up in space, well my neighbor has a power blue Prius that is darker blue than the planet and the land masses are way to washed out.\n\u003E So, is there any way to adjust this so that the planet looks more like [Earth](http://i.imgur.com/SVMSdgO.png) or [Astronomers Visual Pack](http://i.imgur.com/npKy4yF.jpg) instead of [this](http://i.imgur.com/DBkCnlm.png). I really want to use this mod for the effects near the surface (plus Astronomers isn\u0027t being updated anymore and I want to use nuEVE), I know it seems small but it just drives me crazy for some reason.\n\nDid you try tweaking the UI settings to make a new config? You can just fade the effect out by the time you get to orbit if you don\u0027t like it.\n\nIt looks like you\u0027re in the weird area between PQS and scaledspace, that one looks pretty bad right now but I\u0027ll be making the transition better soon.\n\nAlso, the washed-out landmasses have always been a problem, I have a couple new settings, but I\u0027m also working on custom textures that compensate for the scatterer effects so it may look better in the next version.\n\nPictured texture is a WIP by another modder that I tweaked the contrast and colors for, you can see it already works better.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
