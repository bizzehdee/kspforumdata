At least it would be enough for me; but I have always been a \u0027function before form\u0027 type person, and aesthetics are generally the last concern on my list (if a concern at all). \n\nWhich is why it is so aggravating for people to request so many purely aesthetic models;  I already don\u0027t enjoy modeling (never have, never will), and having to sit down and do a set of parts that have zero functional difference.... makes my brain want to explode/melt.  It kills my motivation and willpower, and generally results in me wanting to do something else... -anything- else... like housework and other unpleasant tasks....as at least I get something useful out of that work.  The last thing you want is me having bitter feelings regarding doing modding work, as that is the single fastest way to make me quit.\n\nSo.. by all means, feel free to suggest stuff for models, but please keep the above in mind.  I\u0027m making a huge compromise by even considering doing a few aesthetic variants for some of these parts; please don\u0027t abuse this by requesting absurd numbers of variants.  2-4 is about all that I have patience for for most parts.  Also... there is nothing stopping anyone else from doing these aesthetic-variants/models if they **really** want them; it doesn\u0027t require any special training (I don\u0027t have any for modeling/texturing), and I have intentionally designed my plugins so that they can use models from any source.\n\nHow about this -- I will add in the plugin-level support for angled and vacuum-variant nozzles, but I will not be modeling them for this initial set of parts (however, the ones I have modeled/am modeling will be angle-able in the VAB with the adjustment/slider).  I already have enough to model with all the SRB segments, nosecones, and the already planned/started nozzle geometries (looking at something like ~55 or so new .mu models for this set of parts; though will likely come down to only about ~20 distinct meshes spread across 3 textures in Blender.... which is still a bit of stuff to manage)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T18:00:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 49 minutes ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E about angled SRBs, I\u0027m not 100% sure of that, but I remember reading that the Saturn MLV concepts, and other post-Apollo designs were going to use unchanged versions of the UA 1205 and 1207, so I don\u0027t think they were adjustables  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I might be wrong though.... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nYou are likely correct regarding their intended use/re-use; my statements were based purely on logical inference for the reasoning behind the angled nozzles.   \n\nI could only think of two reasons -- ensuring exhaust is sufficiently clear from the center stack to prevent damage, and corrections for thrust differentials.   \n\nThe first should only be of concern for rockets where the nozzles of the solids are mounted above the bottom-plane of the core stage, or where the engine bells from the core stage might protrude into the exhaust stream a bit.   \n\nThe second would mostly be of concern where either the payload or SRBs were not setup symmetrically.  Fairly certain I\u0027ve seen some pics of Atlas / Delta type rockets with odd/offset booster arrangements (e.g. I think I ran across one yesterday which only had a single SRB mounted on the core stage), where the vectored thrust should run through the COM to minimize torque.  I could be completely off on this though... I\u0027m not really a rocket scientist/engineer... I just play one on the internet once in awhile.\n\nAnyhow... I\u0027m working on getting the plugin-side support for all this finished up today (as apparently I need a break from modeling).  This will include support for both vacuum and angled nozzle variants, and any combination of the two.  Will also include support for manually angling the gimbal while in the editor for any of the included nozzles, though their default orientation will be straight downwards (the angled ones will by default be angled).\n\nAs with the fuel tank/engine mounts, the rest of the nozzle designs and variants can be added over time/in the future as I have the time and patience to get them done.  There should be nothing preventing them from being done in the future, and it is only time/patience that is preventing me from doing them for the initial offerings.\n\nLooking like I probably won\u0027t have a mid-week update this week, and the initial prototype of the MSRB part(s) will have to wait for the weekends\u0027 release.  I have not made sufficient progress at this point to warrant an updated testing release, and there would be nothing new to test.  However I should be able to have the prototype (untextured) model geometry done for this weekends\u0027 release, for at least a couple of variants -- should give sufficient usability to the MSRB parts that they could be tested for functionality."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T18:21:16Z","Content":"Mage, don\u0027t go all out to the point of raging.

Perhaps a bit frustrated at some times, but that is a why I make those posts -- to at least express a bit of that frustration before it becomes too much of a problem.  And yes, a good portion of it is probably due to me seeing suggestions as... something a bit more obligatory than they are intended to be.  That is a personal failing of mine that I have struggled with for... ever... but have only had limited success in suppressing and minimizing.  Once in awhile it gets the best of me, and you might see frustrated posts such as those.\n\nSo... thank you for your suggestions -- they are appreciated at the end of the day, even if they might frustrate me in the morning, and I\u0027m sorry if I seemed a bit... aggressive regarding them; it was not intentional nor directed at any particular person.  \n\nIn-Editor Nozzle Angling --  won\u0027t be / isn\u0027t / wasn\u0027t too hard.  I believe I already have it mostly implemented, but will need to do a bit of testing on it once I\u0027m home from work.  It -should- allow the gimbal to be pre-angled between a range of angles set in the config for the nozzle.\n\nOn that note -- I have realized that an in-flight gimbal trim adjuster might be useful for other engines in general (okay, so, specifically for shuttles so that the default trim for just the main engine can be adjusted while in-flight).  Will give this a bit more thought over the next couple of weeks to see if it is truly needed/useful.\n\nI\u0027m still debating over the vacuum/atmo nozzle differentiation stuff -- it is certainly doable, but I might need to talk with Stratochief and/or NathanKell regarding the implications for RO patching and setup.  Would like to keep things compatible if at all possible.\n\nDon\u0027t worry about the modeling stuff too much, unless you are seriously interested.  I would only recommend looking into learning modeling if it is something you think you would enjoy, and are prepared for some pretty steep learning curves.  However, if you are truly interested, feel free to contact me through PM and I\u0027m more than willing to offer some pointers and help you get started (and can even offer .blend / model files if you needed reference material).  \n\nNote that I\u0027m also not looking for or asking for people to contribute models or time to SSTU -- I\u0027m mostly iterating that the plugin itself can handle whatever (properly built) models that are thrown at it if someone wanted to use them in their own personal games (or even released as a third-party add-on-parts pack for SSTU).\n\nAnyhow... back to ~~coding~~ work for me for a few more hours."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T19:40:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So... thank you for your suggestions -- they are appreciated at the end of the day, even if they might frustrate me in the morning, and I\u0027m sorry if I seemed a bit... aggressive regarding them; it was not intentional nor directed at any particular person.\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s good that you do, as it means it\u0027s eating at you and will only pile up if we (the horde) are not stopped.

Good point / method.  Will see what I can do about implementing this.  Would still require fully re-unwrapping and laying things out.  Might be more work than just un-mirroring things; this way I need to manage both mirrored and non-mirrored portions, and somehow deal with the seam on one of the edges (or both edges....).  Hmm.... perhaps not the best choice then (I cannot stand visible seams, and doing it this way would mean I could not use any noise-textures, or else the seams would become readily apparent).\n\n2.)  I had used this method in the past (on the old Series-A/B/C stuff).  Generally I found it not worth the hassle (and draw-calls); managing multiple meshes and materials just for some text.  Creates far too much work in the end.  It -does- work, and could be a potential solution, but not one that I want to get back into.\n\nThe other potential option would be to duplicate the avionics tunnel onto the other side of the segments (so it has a tunnel on both sides of the SRB), and use rotation-based-mirroring for the main segment sides.  However, this would result in text being visible on both the front and back of the SRB rather than just the back.  This would allow for using the existing UV layout, and would not require re-unwrapping much/at all, but I\u0027m not sure that I want tunnels and text on both sides (would prefer the text is opposite the tunnel so that it gets hidden when the SRB is surface attached)."},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T22:07:37Z","Content":"Liking the look of the SRBs, especially as they\u0027re customisable length...like procedural srbs but prettier! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) \n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nAny news on the shuttle? :3 \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T22:08:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MrMeeb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T22:50:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d say see what you can do without doubling the texture area.

I\u0027m really not fond of the workflow, but I cannot see any other way to reasonably pull it off.  And it would allow for the decals to potentially be disabled or replaced though plugin and/or texture alteration.  It also saved me from having to re-unwrap/layout the UVs... so at least that\u0027s something...\n\nWill -hopefully- have some initial test parts put together tonight to see how it all looks in game."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T01:13:29Z","Content":"What is SatelliteCore?

The SRB segments will have basic first-pass texturing only, but all should have at least some texture on them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T15:43:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:04:27Z","Content":"5m segment x 4 segment, testing basic textures...\n\n(there are also 3.2m and 2.5m long segment - segmented SRBs, for a bit of variety; you\u0027ll see those with tomorrows release)\n\n![wPfpAn9.png](http://i.imgur.com/wPfpAn9.png)\n\n![XqXDHs9.png](http://i.imgur.com/XqXDHs9.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:11:15Z","Content":"Shut up and take my money! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:25:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Shut up and take my money! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nNo that\u0027s wrong\n\n![shut-up-and-take-my-funds_by_hayoo.jpg](http://www.spaceflightonline.net/images/shut-up-and-take-my-funds_by_hayoo.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:35:14Z","Content":"Whahahah!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T20:06:03Z","Content":"Dude that was so funny!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T20:09:56Z","Content":"No idea who posted that image first, actually.
