Since it\u0027s range is only a couple thousand meters, having a BTDT on something that\u0027s only going to be in orbit is useless. I only put them on planes and rovers. In that case, the percentage done has never been more than 0.8% or so for me, as it would take a huge amount of time to scan an entire planet like that, the range is too low. I just fly/drive near the anomalies and get those to show their names and consider it done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my rovers and planes only have the map traq to show the map and a BTDT, and they might not even need a map traq if they have a BTDT either. No sense having any of the other sensors on low altitude vehicles like that, they won\u0027t scan at that range anyway. Orbital satellites have the rest of the sensors, and I change the orbit to get the best scanning done, then leave it in orbit or move it to another body in the system if it has enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a couple screenshots showing my rovers and the BTDT scan completion. Since these rovers don\u0027t have any other sensors on them, those are listed in gray, the BTDT in green and the percentage done. I\u0027ve visited a few anomalies on Kerbin and driven around quite a bit, plus flown planes around and it\u0027s still only at 0.8%. Getting 100% coverage with a BTDT would be quite the feat, and pretty much useless since the only information that it supplies, that I know of, is about structures and anomalies and once you\u0027ve gotten close enough to scan all of them on a planet, it\u0027s pretty pointless to scan the rest of the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, spoilers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img689/4189/4xsw.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to picture that contains anomaly.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img35/2020/ks5a.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to picture that contains anomaly.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis better shows what I\u0027m trying to illustrate anyway, the BTDT scan progress and status indicator.

This issue might be in displaying the data in a useful way... idk if the \u0022sea-level\u0022 altitude is hard-coded or logic-driven. If it\u0027s hard-coded, then I think the entire map might be \u0022max altitude\u0022 color. If the color scale is logic-driven however, then you might be in business.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"griffin247","CreatedById":58122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T17:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso been using this a few weeks now and wanted to say thnks well done etc and especally iam glad it works so well as i gave up on the other scanner mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T18:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrandom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jrandom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHoly mother of ISA MapSat replacements!\u003Cp\u003EQuick question: does this mod work correctly with the Real Solar System mod (eg. with the 10x larger planetary bodies)?

You don\u0027t even need to adjust the values in the .part files. I suggest you do though, A range between 100km and 500km orbits is really small in RSS terms.

I dare say no one will ever scan a complete planet with the BTDT, maybe one of the smaller moons like Gilly, but I don\u0027t think there are any anomalies on Gilly, so it would be pointless.
