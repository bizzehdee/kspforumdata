They will be generally designed to be interconnected with other frame elements. Otherwise Zodius\u0027 wheels should fit nicely under newly designed FHXn extrawide frame (and generally under flat frames) so player has more choice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think there might be nice a out-of-the-box balance of those wheels so player can use one or another set depending on design and task;)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"not-a-cylon","CreatedById":63398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T02:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love that this is still being worked on!
