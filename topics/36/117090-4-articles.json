As a result there is not much to show for an updated test release at the moment. I got the procedural model for the decouplers \u0027working\u0027, but it is lacking in features and balance - such as it currently does not update mass, cost, or ejection force based on its physical attributes, and it is still using the same texture that the procedural fairings use. Will hopefully have a good system figured out and coded in the next day or two, and issue an updated test release at that point. \n\nBalancing parts will be the focus for the next week, in preparation for public beta testing. I\u0027m pretty sure I have all of the modules in a usable and stable state (aside from the procedural decoupler), and do not think that will be doing any geometry/model additions or changes in the immediate future, so there should not be any more save-breaking changes after the upcoming private test release.\n\nTLDR:\n\nUpdated private test release in a day or two for the last major code and config changes, and if all goes well, move on to public testing hopefully next weekend.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s strange; I didn\u0027t encounter space-bar staging problems by making decoupling nodes top or bottom (last week I made 2 new parts for my mod that use top and bottom stack decoupling modules). I agree on dV calculations.\n\nThe problems only manifest because I purposefully disabled staging on the decouplers; as they were on the top node of an engine/fuel tank combo -- you would hit space to stage it and it would activate the engine and the decoupler simultaneously. I\u0027m just trying to put too many functions on a single part ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s very interesting observation also when it comes to docking ports. So for example one could create a standard part with rigidbody/colliders (i.e. habitation module\u0027) that have i.e. 2 \u0027holes\u0027 for physicless docking ports that you can attach in editor. Then when launched those 3 parts would count as 1 part with 2 docking ports (performancewise). That could be partial solution to the performance problem. It would come with some ceveats though (player would not be able to click on docking port parts - no collider, so generally no option to undock a part?, probably those parts wouldn\u0027t work well with KIS system etc). \n\u003E \n\u003E This however could be solved by hybrid system, so one part is normal and has integrated docking module (i.e. habitation module with one side docking port) and other side you would just pluck physicless docking port. Then when docking other parts with integrated 1 docking port you could always undock ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).\n\nYou can still have colliders on physics-less parts. For example most of the small stock science-experiment parts are still physics-less, but you can mouse-over and right click on them. But yes, they often just explode if you drop them on the ground via KIS/KAS, and can exhibit other strange behavior when used as the root part on a craft. I believe I have even seen them collide with terrain on a vehicle / be torn off/ destroyed, so there might be some special handling of the colliders with the physics-less parts.\n\nWill definitely be investigating this stuff more in the coming weeks. Will have to do some good testing regarding what kind of side-effects the physics-less parts can have, as that seems to be the easiest solution to alot of the station/docking port issues, and could be done with a simple MM patch."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T07:34:51Z","Content":"\u003E You can still have colliders on physics-less parts.

Very interesting findings. Especially the fact that the shielded docking ports have less of a performance impact (when working properly) compared to a normal docking port. This tells me that docking ports have performance implications above and beyond the standard rigid-body/physics calculations that are present for every (physics-enabled) part.\n\nThe differences between the stack and surface-attached ports performance is likely related to the same bit as the shielded docking ports. I\u0027m guessing that there is some not-insignificant overhead in the docking port \u0027magnetism\u0027 code, and this code only runs when the docking port has nothing attached to its attach-node. The shielded docking port likely uses the same code but has a bug during re-initialization on re-load where it does not update the shielded/searchable status properly.\n\nI\u0027ll poke into the code on the docking ports a bit and see what I can find out about why they do not work when physics-less. It might be something collider/trigger related that could be worked around through a custom plugin/module. Would certainly be nice to just be able to use stock docking ports.\n\nOn the \u0027multi-port\u0027 docking port -- still working through the concept on this, but I think I have enough code implemented that I can try some experiments soon (just want to get the current WIP stuff to a releasable state before I start on any more experiments). Currently I believe you can have multiple docking port modules on a part as long as they reference different \u0027docking transforms\u0027; the problems stem from there is no way to tell them apart on the right-click to tell which one you are undocking. What I have done is create a slightly customized docking port module that allows you to add a \u0027port name\u0027 to the right-click options; so instead of saying \u0027Undock\u0027, it would say \u0027Undock Port1\u0027 (or whatever you labeled them as in the config). This would have to line up with the model/textures to enable you to tell the ports apart, but so far the concept -seems- like it will work out.\n\nWill also investigate what I can do to duplicate the good-performance aspect of the shielded docking ports (and fixing the inconsistency). Seems that a simple \u0027activatable\u0027 docking port could be a good solution for most single-port vessels; it could at least help with a tiny bit of performance while not performing docking maneuvers."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T17:36:56Z","Content":"\u003E On the \u0027multi-port\u0027 docking port -- still working through the concept on this, but I think I have enough code implemented that I can try some experiments soon (just want to get the current WIP stuff to a releasable state before I start on any more experiments).

Adding several empty \u0027dockingNode\u0027 gameObjects in Unity and then ModuleDockingNode modules in cfg lets you undock those ports. However docking is possible just to (I think) the first mentioned in cfg docking port. Similarly undocking works perfectly without rigidbodies, however docking again is not possible.\n\n*edit:* another possible thing (however unlikely) that might also slow down shielded docking ports performance might be not disabling their animation when they are open and scene is loaded. \n\nI recently had similar problem with BDanimationModule that animated container according to its \u0027fullness\u0027. So possible solution here would be to set [objectAnimationStateName].enabled = false upon loading scene.\n\n*edit2:* oh yeah, last thing that might help understanding ModuleDockingNode code would be to look at AdaptiveDockingNode by toadicus:\n\n[https://github.com/toadicus/AdaptiveDockingNode](https://github.com/toadicus/AdaptiveDockingNode)\n\nforum thread and license:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79128](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79128)\n\nI think he rewrote much of KSP ModuleDockingNode code adding functionality of docking different sizes ports.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T17:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T19:17:58Z","Content":"another thing: dunno if this is useful for your purposes, but decoupler module seems to get decoupling force vector from Center of Mass of base part, not actual part one wants to decouple.

Compared to the current balance, the new numbers should increase weight substantially (~35%), but also increase the dV budget for a design by %20. Tankage mass fraction has stayed consistent (and is inline with stock values), but the tanks now hold more fuel. The new fuel/volume/mass numbers are based off of an idealized fuel-tank for each size (rather than the previous balance pass that was based on the actual volume of the individual tanks in any particular part). This brings the fuel tanks to be more in line (volume wise) with the cargo parts (and allows me to add a resource-switch to the cargo parts to allow them to carry fuel as well, without being overly OP compared to the other fuel tanks).\n\nI\u0027ve also aimed for single-stage capable landers for -most- situations. I\u0027ve found it is barely (if any) more efficient to build a 2-stage Mun lander than a single stage (using stock parts at least); so I\u0027ve saved the multi-stage setups for planets/moons that really need them -- Duna, Laythe, Tylo, Kerbin. Most other moons and planets have low enough gravity /dV requirements that a single stage lander is small and light enough that designing a two-stage lander for the purpose really only increases part count and cost (you -might- save a slight bit of mass on the two-stage design).\n\nAny thoughts on this information? Does it seem like these parts would be overpowered, underpowered, or just about right? I have tried to maintain stock balance values for tank dry mass ratios, and am staying within the volume constraints of each part (e.g. it does not magically contain more fuel than it could by exterior volume).

There -is- an (optional) attach node on the very bottom of the engines, so you can always use traditional staging. The engines are designed as very low-profile (\u003C1/2m tall), and the descent engines are built in ring-style clusters (with a hollow center section). All of the lander-designed engines have an ISP of 355 (intended to represent advanced hypergolic fueled engines which would be in use for these types of designs with potentially long loiter times/long surface stay times). Thrust is as-yet undecided; though there are 6 engines (3 ascent, 3 descent), so there will be a variety of thrust levels available. As they are engine clusters, they will all be multiples of the thrust of the single engine which is used for the smallest ascent-engine (LC2-ASCE). Currently the thrust progresses such as: Ascent: 60 (x1 engine), 180 (x3 engines), 240 (x4); Descent: 240(x4), 480(x8), 720(x12)\n\nSo, to answer your question - yes; in multiple different varieties and capabilities, including the normal stock stack-staging (with fuel lines). The openings in the tanks have also been designed to be large enough to accommodate stock engines (1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m), though most might look a bit strange and not fit exactly (as the lander parts are slightly smaller than stock diameters, at ~2.4, ~3.65, and ~4.9m).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T18:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T18:13:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My actual design for a range extender would be an \u0027upper\u0027 drop tank, using the existing docking port on the pod; skycrane style (perhaps even with the upcoming skycrane parts that have integrated engines).

Will keep this in mind when I am moving on to tackling the IVA stuff. \n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure there is any way to get a true \u0027downwards view\u0027 while still having isntruments in view; at least not with the current pod geometry. About the best I can do is the view-switching. Or I guess I could move the kerbal seats -way- upwards. The overall geometry though is flawed in regards to Kerbals; It works/would work for humans IRL, as we can move our head around to look out the window, and move it back to look at instruments if needed; not so easy to do with a Kerbal in-game. IIRC, that was how the Apollo crew flew the LEM - standing up with their noses pressed into the window, moving back and looking around at instruments as needed (or relying on the co-pilot to relay vital information). Unfortunately, it is a bit hard to do that with a Kerbal.\n\nStill, I\u0027ll see what I can do. Can\u0027t promise perfection, but I\u0027ll try to at least make it more usable than it is currently. Thinking about saving the pods to work on last for texturing, in case I need to make any model changes to accommodate an improved IVA experience.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *edit1*: - Engines - \n\u003E \n\u003E Since everything is more or less balanced against a single LC2-ASCE engine, just couple of my observations:\n\u003E \n\u003E It has the size of 0.625m 48-7S engine, however it has slightly more power and ISP than larger 1.25m lv-909 with only 60% mass of a lv-909.

I was waiting to finalize the masses on the pods before working over the engine thrust and mass values. 40 or so will probably be about right for the single engine; It just needs to be powerful enough to be used as an ascent engine for the LC2-POD\u002Bascent tank (updated full/wet mass value of 2.82; 40 thrust would give a vacuum TWR of ~1.41). Might even bring it down a bit further; the single engine is at most intended for low-gravity worlds, so it likely doesn\u0027t even need a 1:1 TWR on kerbin. Will investigate something like 28-30 thrust, should allow it to still be quite usable for the low-gravity worlds, and possibly allow for a slight mass reduction as well.\n\nI\u0027ve based the ISP on real world examples for upper end/higher tech hypergolic fueled engines; specifically a scaled-down [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-0124](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-0124) (~ 0.5t, 300kN thrust, 359 ISP). Yes, it is one of the highest ISP RP1/LOX engines available; why would you use anything but the most efficient engine available for a real lander design? However, the ISP might come down slightly (350?), as I believe the performance #s of the parts with their new fuel/mass values might be a tiny bit -too- good. Might make this during a second balance pass; will probably keep the ISP as-is for now, and look into adjusting in the future if needed.\n\nThe engines will start to be available about 1/3 the way through the tech-tree (45 or 90 science nodes); one or two nodes deeper in than the most similar stock counterpart, but still early enough to make the landers useful in a (still developing) career game. They should be all set into the tech tree currently, but some of the current positions will likely be adjusted during this balance pass.\n\nOn the note of tech-tree nodes; If you have any suggestions as to where to place the higher-end parts (LC3, and mostly LC5), I\u0027m all ears ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). It seems the current standard is to stuff any/all high-end parts into the far-upper-right tech-node (don\u0027t remember what it is called; very-heavy rocketry or something), but I would much prefer to have some variation as to the placement of the parts.\n\n\u003E edit2: After short testing I think that using JSIPartUtilities switchable nodes solves KSP bug with attachment nodes being too close.\n\nI\u0027m not familliar with JSIPartUtilities (will take a look!), however I do have a custom part-module (SSTUSelectableNode) that allows for adding/removing/inverting attach nodes while in the editor that I will be adding (back) onto a couple of these parts.

Might also add back in the rest of the \u0027optional\u0027 nodes to the parts that had them (using the node switch module)... such as the upper-middle node on the engine clusters.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the feedback and info.

I think I have things to a more usable state though.\n\nParts are still balanced using stock balance mechanics - actual measured volume, 85% fuel mass fraction for tanks. Raw engine TWR is identical to the LVT-45 (13.3)(which is quite terrible, compared to skipper/mainsail(21,25), but very slightly better than lv-909(12)). Pod masses have increased fairly significantly for the LC2 and LC3 pods; though still lighter than the stock 3-crew command module, they are heavier than using multiple stock 1-man lander cans; so I feel they are probably in the right ball-park for mass balancing (additional mass could be explained by the inclusion of RCS and solar panels).\n\nHad a heck of a time trying to enable an Altair-styled Tylo-capable lander.

Hoping to get a few moments to re-create the example ships for this release, as I think I\u0027m nearing the stage where the parts should be stable enough that the examples should not be breaking constantly.\n\nIf no large problems are found with this test release I will probably open it up as the first public beta release, likely Monday or so.\n\nEdit:\n\nWhile doing balancing, I found the need (desire?) for oversized ascent fuel tanks for the LC2 and LC3 pods, so they can act as dedicated ascent modules in multiple configurations. For example in the previously mentioned Altair-styled lander, I had to use an additional fuel section below the pod to enable proper ascent dV; with a larger ascent tank this extra fuel section is eliminated, reducing overall mass of the lander and resulting in a much cleaner looking 2-stage setup (and proper RCS balancing without the extra mass hanging below).\n\nSo, I -will- be doing up a second mesh-switch option/variant for the LC2 and LC3 pods. However, these will likely come with a future update; expect to see them along side the skycrane and service modules in a 1.1 update (after all current stuff is -finished-).\n\nMore Edit:\n\nAdding some updated images (if it ever updates...):\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
