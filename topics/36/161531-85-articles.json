It\u0027s a fun mod but is not easy - the parts are balanced about right to make it challenging. A good example is that when driving the DT Vista with fusion reactors on a long journey, it makes sense to shut down the fusions between burns. But to do that, you need enough power on hand to bring them back up, which in my case meant an MSR powering an Omega, the Omega powering the big fusion.

A whole bunch of experimentation to learn the new mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing on that - it\u0027s hard to experiment in sandbox, because AFAICT you can\u0027t \u0022downgrade\u0022 a part to the earlier version.
