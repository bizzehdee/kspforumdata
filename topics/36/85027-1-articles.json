Over time I\u0027d like to add configs for mods to fit into this rebalancing as well, as I enjoy playing with a heavily modded setup. I\u0027d love feedback from those who are interested in using something like this and am open to reworking things based on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESo what is it?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a set of Module Manager configs designed to make the game a bit more challenging and to change the tech tree progress into something more loosely realistic, starting with manned atmospheric flight and small, unkerbaled, suborbital rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to match parts to nodes in a more logical way. Many parts have moved from their stock tiers and nodes or stayed in the same tier but have changed nodes. Some nodes also have very few parts or only one when not fleshed out with mods. This wasn\u0027t originally intentional, but I decided it made sense. Some breakthroughs in science have very specific implications, some are very broad and far reaching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to make use of the extra nodes at the end of the tree as well. If you\u0027re not aware, Squad has included nodes at the end of the tree that require 1000 science to research, they do not show in R\u0026amp;D unless there\u0027s actually parts assigned to them. Not all of these nodes are used if you have just stock, but they continue to flesh out as more mods are added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience has also been rebalanced a bit, but total science values are mostly no longer affected by this mod as Squad added the functionality to change this in game with the difficulty settings introduced in .25. You get a fair amount of science the first time doing an experiment (60% currently) with diminishing returns thereafter, mimicking initial discovery and confirmation of scientific findings. Data amounts have also been reworked. This was based on Science Revisited by CaptRobau, but most of the values have been reworked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESensor experiments like the temperature scan, now transmit 100% of their value. This will affect any mod part using these modules as well. On the flip side of this, sample return type experiments like the mystery goo experiment, have had their transmission values lowered even further to force either a proper return mission or use of the lab. To go with this, the lab\u0027s boost to transmission value has been increased. The lab also consumes more power during processing though and most sample return experiments will not transmit at quite 100% even after processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo new experiments have also been added. \u0022Low Gravity Environment Experiments\u0022 are available on the Mobile Processing Lab and provide science comparable to a seismic or gravity scan. It transmits at only 40% to encourage you to process the experiment in the lab to get 100% transmission value. \u0022Probe Situation Report\u0022 has been added to all properly configured probe parts and provides a very small amount of science, even less than crew reports. It does transmit at 100% however, and is meant to be the telemetry and operational data you\u0027re ostensibly using to pilot the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the non shielded solar panels are no longer retractable to help give some differentiation. All solar panels using the default squad module will now also use the curve created by CaptRobau in Science Revisited to follow the inverse-square law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS systems have been rebalanced to be far less powerful than their stock torque values. This is to bring them more in line with the real life use of SAS systems. Currently this is a pretty basic across the board reduction by 75% with a few specific tweaks here and there. For instance, the 2.5m SAS part was hugely overpowered and so has been further reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain command parts have been deemed only for atmospheric flight. If you only have stock parts this means only the Mk1 series of cockpits. These parts have had SAS removed entirely. If you\u0027re using a life support mod these parts will also not have any innate capacity to store the relevant resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod also adds several parts that are rescales and in a few cases, repurposing, of stock parts. This is mostly to help fill gaps at the beginning of the tree by adding more .625m parts. Compatibility configs for mods that provide similar parts will come in time and if you\u0027re using them instead, the parts created specifically for filling this size gap are all in Parts/0625m Parts and you can feel free to delete them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://u.cubeupload.com/Pirsig/KSAEATechTree.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSAEATechTree.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAdditional Info\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI approached this with a philosophy of wanting the mod to play nicely with other mods as much as possible. Everything is done within the confines of the stock Squad defined tech tree, no new nodes have actually been added or values for the nodes changed. While tree placement might be odd for parts in a mod I haven\u0027t made configs for, nothing *should* break in any mod because of this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also tried to put together everything in such a way that it can be easily tailored to your personal needs, separating different aspects of the pack into different configs so they can easily be removed individually. They are also commented to be easily understandable and searchable for your own modification. All comments use the part name displayed in game, allowing you to search for parts both by their actual part name as well as the display name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started this without having any idea about Stupid_Chris\u0027 Stock ReBalance project, and originally had some of the same things implemented alongside the tech tree rebalance. This included solar panel changes, rebalancing of probe cores, and a few other odds and ends. As I was looking at getting deeper down the rabbit hole into rebalancing many more parts, I found SRB which prompted me to remove most of that stuff from the mod and start working specifically with SRB in mind. I\u0027ve since decided to back away from that idea and re-implemented many of these original balance changes as well as expanded further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of MM run order, anything SRB does should run after me, so if your using SRB changes to the same properties *should* take precedence over mine. For the same reason, if you want to use SRB, but want my values for say, SAS, you\u0027d need to delete the relevant patches from SRB. The compatibility for SRB provided with this mod ONLY moves SRB\u0027s part rescales to appropriate nodes. In the future I might offer a patch to run after SRB and convert conflicting changes back to KSAEA values, but for now the only support I\u0027m willing to commit in this regard is assisting you in which parts of SRB to delete to get KSAEA values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhy?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause no other tech tree mod did what I actually wanted and Tree Loader seemed to be a complete mess to me. Sure it functioned, but hitting an outside database, poor maintenance of the plugin, and it\u0027s eventual decline into not being actively maintained left a very sour taste in my mouth. I\u0027m grateful for many of the wonderful plugins R4m0n built the foundation for, Tree Loader was a major miss for me though. There\u0027s plugins out there now taking tree loader\u0027s place and they\u0027re fixing some issues, but I\u0027d still have to rely on an unproven mod to stay maintained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand it\u0027s pretty clear Module Manager isn\u0027t going anywhere. It also has the lowest possibility for any sort of conflict with another mod. Basically, the best way to make sure this plays nice with everyone\u0027s setup is to use MM configs and type out a lot of stuff manually. Most mod authors already know how to use MM as well and can easily make configs for their mods to follow this rebalance if they wish to do so without having to learn anything extra really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking this approach of not using any plugins outside MM itself does set certain limits. I can\u0027t modify EVA kerbals for example, which is why they still transmit surface samples at the stock %. Though I\u0027ve decided in my head that the extra data is the kerbal\u0027s description of the sample \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. I also can\u0027t change the research values for nodes in the tree or add new nodes, but honestly this just causes more room for compatibility issues. In the end, it creates different approaches to a similar problem many of us have with not being satisfied with the current tech/science setup and it\u0027s up to you which approach you like best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat\u0027s New?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, so just a quick and dirty update for .90 to cover all the new parts. I also added a small wing and control surface to start for controlling small rockets. I did not mess with any of the new SAS level stuff yet, I\u0027ll add that to the SAS rebalance for .5. I also did a couple of quick patches for small mods, MechJeb, RealChute, and SCANsat. I did not mess with science values for SCANsat at all since that has it\u0027s own thing based on % scanned and stuff that all makes perfect sense and I felt no need to mess with it. There\u0027s also a couple tweaks to existing reaction wheel values and the SKGU.\u003Cp\u003Ev .43\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tech Tree Rebalancing for SCANsat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tech Tree Rebalancing for Real Chute Parachute Systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tech Tree Rebalancing for Mech Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SKGU Probe Core Electric Charge increased, consumption rate decreased\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MK2 Drone Core SAS torque has been decreased to .75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Probodobodyne OKTO SAS torque is now equal to that of the Probodobodyne HECS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The new MK3 Cockpit has had SAS rebalanced and is now governed by the global reduction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New Aerodynamic parts for small rockets, includes FAR \u0026amp; DR support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tech Tree Rebalancing for new stock parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, next version should have the new approach to the upper tier construction nodes I was talking about as well as rebalancing for probes. This currently involves changing weight, power consumption, and adding decent amounts of onboard electric charge. I\u0027ll also add the new SAS level stuff to the rebalance, and probably break out the reaction wheel stuff to be its own config. The ridiculous capacity of the MK3 passenger section is also something I plan on remedying.

Individual experiments can still be easily tuned, but there\u0027s now global values to control total science, initial science, and transmission %, which was split into two categories. One for sensor type experiments like the temperature scan, and one for sample return type experiments like mystery goo observation. This means that it will be super easy from now on to raise or lower these overall values, yay easy balancing! Thanks Sarbian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of this change most experiments have had their total science decreased even further, which I don\u0027t think is an issue after finding out that the stock game has around 75k available science excluding asteroids. Even if all the extra squad provided tiers are used there\u0027s only 20kish science needed. This leads me to think there\u0027s still plenty of room to come down even more, while still leaving plenty of extra science for mods that use it like Kerbal Construction Time. The two new experiments have not had any values changed yet, I\u0027ll probably rebalance them to be in line with stock numbers in the EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION and then use a separate config to govern them under the same globals as the rest of the science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now though, without further adieu I give you .20: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ql0k00bfb1t18u7/KSAEA020.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T22:31:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pirsig\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T13:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, is this .25 compatible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirsig","CreatedById":73323,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T02:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I totally feel like an idiot for not paying attention to what was coming in KSP .25, which added difficulty sliders for a bunch of stuff including total science from experiments. However, it\u0027s super awesome that they\u0027ve done this so it\u0027s all good. Because of that I\u0027ve removed almost all of my rebalancing of total science values. Surface Samples are still worth a bit less than stock. Other than that I was using MM to accomplish the same thing that setting the science reward slider does now, with a value of 80%. All the rest of the science changes such as transmit values and the like are still in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also decided to back off the idea of designing the mod with Stock ReBalance in mind as it ends up doing a whole lot more than I maybe want. That\u0027s my fault for jumping on the bandwagon with it before really messing with it too heavily. I\u0027ve decided to re-implement some of the stuff present in my original versions of this mod that does a few similar things, but on their own are much more simplistic than SRB. For now that only includes changes to solar panels, all non shielded versions can no longer be retracted and all solar panels using the default module will follow the inverse-square law. In the future this will include some changes for probes (onboard electric charge) and antennas (transmission values) to have a sense of progression. I\u0027ll also be implementing these changes into other mods as necessary when I do compatibility for them. I don\u0027t have any intention of messing with mass rebalancing of weights, part costs, drag or other such things like SRB does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of MM run order, anything SRB does should run after this mod, so if your using SRB changes to the same properties *should* take precedence over mine.

For the same reasons, if you want to use SRB, but want my values for antenna progression and such you\u0027ll need to delete the relevant patches from SRB. When SRB updates to .25 I\u0027ll probably take a look at it and make a patch to handle this instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I\u0027ve also added support for some more mods: TAC Life Support, Remote Tech, and Procedural Fairings.
