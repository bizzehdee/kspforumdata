(1.25, 2.5, mk2. requires electricity.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A Heat Pump that sucks up heat and waste heat, and redirects it to radiators. (it cools the attached parts significantly, and subtracts a constant amount of waste heat while running. heat will be converted to waste heat. (1.25, 2.5, 3.75) requires MW or eqiv charge)(requires radiators attached to part to run)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A powered vent (basically an engine with no thrust) that cools the attached part and subtracts waste heat depending on the temperature and amount of air added. ideally connected to a precooler and air intake. (0.625(rear), 1.25(rear and inline), mk2(inline). would have two models for 1.25/mk2; one requiring electric charge, one with waaay more power that requires MW (it might have an KSPI arc-jet RCS that only works with atmosphere.). both would count as radiators.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthese are the missing parts for making reliable heavy SSTO\u0027s, or anything with a powerful hot engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m totally imagining these parts just using the stock squad models (and the mk2\u0027s expansions precooler)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now this is no more than jumbled text in a cfg file using stock fuel tanks for parts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, I put this under development because i very well intend to do this myself one i figure out how.\u003Cbr\u003E\nany and all help/direction appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-23T06:08:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2016 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Rushligh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
