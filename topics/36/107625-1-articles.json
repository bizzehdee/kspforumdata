This is my plugin, that enhances the realism of Kerbal Space Program. In the real world people have limits. One from much is acceleration due to gravity (G-Force). When i played KSP, I said, Kerman is immortal. Falling from a great height survived, extreme G-Force survived and this plugin fixes this.\n\n![APVsbeD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/APVsbeD.jpg)\n\n![XVD4jSv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XVD4jSv.jpg)\n\n\u0022Kerbal Space Program/GameData/GForce/Plugins/PluginData/GForce/config.xml\u0022 is configuration file.
