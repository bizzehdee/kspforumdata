[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo reasons - one, visually, where would the monopropellant fit in the part? Looking at the size of the stock 40 unit mono tanks - this heat shield isn\u0026#39;t significantly larger than a stock 2.5m tank, so where\u0026#39;d the fuel go? The capsule has plenty of room (and it fits the existing precedent where most command pods have monoprop). Two, I think the heat shield should be specifically focused on reentry. The RCS thrusters are used for reentry (historically) as well, so they fit in with the purpose, but fuel doesn\u0026#39;t seem right.
