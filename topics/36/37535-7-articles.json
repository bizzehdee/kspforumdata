The name Kerbin was chosen because it was a combined effort of several companies throughout, Kerbin. So instead of preferring a local name, the consortium chose Kerbin (the name of the planet) to represent the combined effort. However, the VEG design group traditionally named their space vehicles after the planet or location they were designed to operate on, for example Mun L-12 (the 12th version of their Mun lander), KLV-54 (the 54th version of their Kerbin Lift Vehicle), and so on.

Two center screens will be used as MFDs which would bring up space-flight data and information. Those two center screens can double as Camera screens for orbital maneuvering to make up for the lack of visibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZRM, how viable is that? Are you able to program an ADI? ADI stands for Attitude Director Indicator, HSI stands for Horizontal Situation Indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HSI is on the left the ADI is on the right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wNlH9Ec-lp0/TJuRog_5bSI/AAAAAAAAA7M/Cji-gr8vqGw/s320/Airplane\u002Bstuff\u002B007.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wNlH9Ec-lp0/TJuRog_5bSI/AAAAAAAAA7M/Cji-gr8vqGw/s320/Airplane\u002Bstuff\u002B007.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to use the Ball used in KSP and prefer an ADI glass display. Better visibility and we can put all information on it, Altitude, AoA, KIAS (or true airspeed if the game simulates any of that). After a certain altitude, airspeed converts to meters per second, and altitude converts to meters (or it could all be switchable by the player).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HSI would allow you to set nav-points (I know there is no VOR or ILS systems in KSP) on the ground around Kerbin. Maybe have it so you need to deploy one? You would use the HSI to glide back to specific spots you set. On inter-planetary missions perhaps the HSI could be used to set nav points in reference to that planet\u0027s magnetic north? You would need to be at a specific altitude over the planetary body for it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the HSI and ADI, there will be two MFDs in the center of the control panel. These can be used for all flight data (turning on and off lights, opening the cargo bay, flight information, RCS status, etcetera). Additionally these two MFD\u0027s can be used to display visual from the cargo bay and from the front lower portion of the cockpit (for ground and orbital operation clearance visibility).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would also have the analog gauges (radar altimeter, magnetic compass, airspeed indicator, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have an image of the flight deck a little later, I\u0027m still brick and mortaring the master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think you should skip on the HSI, however the ADI is a great idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T23:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe the mini shuttle is cutting edge technology and abandoned the old hatch profile. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, come on.
