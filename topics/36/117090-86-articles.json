The engines are built into the model, using trimmed-down/specialized engine geometry (no use rendering all the plumbing if you\u0027ll never see it); so they are not easy to replace.\n\n1.) Use a plugin to edit the hierarchy, removing the engines meshes/game objects, replacing them with your chosen meshes through plugin or MODEL node, or just adding attach nodes.\n\n-or-\n\n2.) Re-export the part from Unity minus the engine mesh objects (requires access to the blender, .fbx and/or unity files)\n\nEither method would also require removing the engine module(s) from the part, and potentially the engine-heat animation modules as well (if they are present); gimbal modules, and anything else engine-related.\n\nYour best bet is to wait until I\u0027m done, and see if I release a no-engine variant as well -- I might... it will depend on how the AO bake goes / how much texture space I would lose to duplicate faces / how much texture space is available.  Ideally I would only need to double up on the rear-plate and engine mounts; but that depends on if the \u0027no engine\u0027 variant still includes OMS pods.  If I remove the pods, that is potentially an entire fuselage worth of duplicated faces that need their own texture space.  So, if/when I do, it seems likely that it would be just no engine-meshes, but the OMS pods would remain intact (all engines would be replaced by attach nodes)."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T22:50:17Z","Content":"from me you won\u0027t hear any complaint about the OMS shoulder pods ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\nall I want is to be able to make a Buran-like setup, with just two engines and nothing else, so I really don\u0027t mind about the shoulders staying ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) (I wouldn\u0027t even try to remove the shoulders if I tried to remove the engines, that would mess with the RCS pods)  \n\nbtw, I noticed that the hatch was modeled, does that mean we can see a opening hatch (either for eyecandy or to actually remember to open it before going EVA) or that would involve a lot of work? not a request or anything, just wondering ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"DarthGav","CreatedById":138161,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T23:01:50Z","Content":"I think I broke it, the extra textures don\u0027t work, and I can\u0027t build a lander without the lander pod attaching itself halfway into the tank and it wont attach at all if I use the decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"The Intelligent Bubble","CreatedById":159428,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T23:21:11Z","Content":"Hi\n\nI\u0027m having an issue with the decoupler.
