In the shots above please ignore the MFDs. The HUD you see is also the old place holder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the version I have was rather buggy, or perhaps I forgot to install something. Other than that, it was a dream on several counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-VAB was a charm. The KSO snapped together really easily. Not too many issues, however you have to rotate the vertical stabilizers 90 degrees in order to get them to snap properly into a V-tail configuration. A Ship file of a fully constructed KSO will be included so you don\u0027t have to worry about that of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The KSO itself flew perfectly. This thing wants to fly and with very little skill I was able to glide it four times into a perfect landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-HUD VIEW IS JUST ALL SORTS OF AWESOME! My first landing was doing it the old fashion way, external camera. The 2nd and 3rd landings were all done with the HUD view seen above. The 2nd landing I switched to external right after ground effect. The 3rd one was done all from IVA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The KSO is currently very buggy. Most of the connections are very flimsy, obviously we still have more work to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The vectored engines aren\u0027t properly vectoring at first. It required that I fidget with them before they finally started responding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RCS Nozzles like the Cargo Bay doors should start retracted. The RCS nozzles required I do an action group to get them to pop inside. Not a big deal, but would be cool if they default to retracted. Just one less thing to worry about before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I love the landing gear. Players will have to get used to the idea that these landing gear mean business and will blow up your ship if you deploy them while the EFT is still attached. Conversely, the G key didn\u0027t work to deploy them. I had to use the mouse to click on the Gear icon to get them to deploy. Not a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The KSO has issues sometimes sitting on its nose. It\u0027s so perfectly balanced that it can easily tip onto its tail. You have to be careful when coming to a full stop making sure to turn off all RCS/SAS and using the breaks. Always land towards the ocean and on the runway. So far doing this has prevent it from tipping over onto its tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The KSO itself is very fidgety when on the ground. I noticed the entire vehicle being jittery all the pieces shaking. Looked really strange and I suspect it may be collision issues? It isn\u0027t that noticeable along the cockpit and cargo bay. But it is very noticeable along the engine bays, the engines, the landing gear, and the control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-During launch I had difficulty controlling the vehicle as well as getting into the proper angle for a gravity burn. Once the two LRBs got done the vehicle went into a spin. No RCS effects, so I\u0027m wondering if that is a bug or we forgot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Actually, the only time I was able to control the vehicle correct was during the descent flight. During launch the controls are a bit erratic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy the shots guys, and please keep in mind it is all still a work in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis album was originally posted by Helldiver near the beginning of the month.
