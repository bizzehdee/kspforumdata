The time required to run an experiment depends on many factors, spread across various configuration files and different objects at runtime.

The \u0022correct\u0022 solution is to calculate the time at runtime and inject it into the description.\n\nI\u0027ll look into it in more detail but it\u0027s not a quick fix, unfortunately.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/20/2018 at 10:26 PM, Zah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003EThe \u0022Install\u0022 and \u0022Move\u0022 buttons for the experiments are only available if it\u0027s possible to perform one of those actions.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E The thing that irritates me was that I added experiments to wedges, saved and left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, came back to the craft and only found \u0022add experiment\u0022 in the wedges.
