Shader packs can be real resource hogs but in my experience if you stick mostly to lighting and color adjustments youre only giving up a few frames on most cards and zero if your card has any kick, its when you start to get into the ENB style depth of field and other heavy graphic effects that things start to really weigh on your card (you should see my skyrim install, that one gets my humble gtx 760 ready to explode) . KSP just doesn\u0027t have the demands to really tap on even more modest gpus, without the 64 bit workaround youre gonna cap your ram well before you have enough other things in the graphic pipleline to really tax the card.
