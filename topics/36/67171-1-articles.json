I have a little engine texture now that I\u0027m going to call an antimatter engine and make it have unrealistic efficiency and thrust (because that\u0027s what I want to do). I checked in the parts.cfg of the Mainsail engine, and everything makes sense except this: How do you set engine efficiency? You can set it to have massive thrust, but it runs out of fuel very quickly even with the Jumbo tank. Also, why is it impossible to have a decently light fuel tank with \u003Cem\u003Elots and lots\u003C/em\u003E of fuel, so that I don\u0027t run out of fuel with my antimatter engine.

I believe the first number is the ISP in atmosphere, and the second is the ISP in vacuum. For fuel tank cfgs, you define the empty mass of the tank, and the amount of the fuel in the tank. The reason your tanks are collapsing is because the mass of the fuel itself if just crushing everything. You can try tinkering with the resources cfg file but then you\u0027d be changing the fuel for every tank.
