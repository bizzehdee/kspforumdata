It ionized the powder, used magnets to hold it in a ball, then flowed hydrogen around it. Some uranium was lost to the flow so it needed to be replenished. I believe it was intended to be a plasma around the core, contained by a pinch field mag bottle. Honestly the last time I read anything on this was twenty years ago so I may be misremembering some of it, but it definitely was a real design, though I believe never built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you made it use mostly hydrogen with a small amount of uranium (or Blutonium to be more Kerbalish) I think that would represent a gas core nuclear rocket fairly well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHadn\u0027t thought about gas-core. The Wiki article I linked above does talk about them. Gas core does involve the loss of nuclear fuel (unless you use a \u0022light bulb\u0022 design), but it also involves spraying highly radioactive uranium and fission products out with the exhaust. If you\u0027re going that far, a nuclear salt water rocket is a more efficient choice.

But if you wanted to model a gas-core nuclear rocket that consumed liquid fuel, a small amount of uranium, and had an Isp of 3,000 or so that would reflect a physical possibility that is way beyond our current engineering capabilities.

Hmm, well it was a long time ago I read up on them. 3000 seems a little high for a nuke, but maybe so. Or maybe just too high to match in with KSP. I was thinking more 1500 or so as a mid ground between ion and nukes, with the add on of severe radiation exhaust and extra, rare fuel needed as well as the hydrogen reaction mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T19:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn Isp of 3,000 is actually low for a gas-core, it could range as high as 5,000.

The nuclear fuel is not retained, drastically simplifying the design. However, by its very design, the rocket would discharge massive quantities of extremely radioactive waste and could only be safely operated well outside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere and perhaps even entirely outside earth\u0027s magnetosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T21:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joshiewowa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Joshiewowa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it was the liquid core that mentioned spraying radioactive exhaust everywhere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of them will release nuclear fuel and fission products (FFP) to one degree or another. The solid core or the nuclear light bulb designs use a physical containment, so they would only lose FFP if that containment were damaged. The liquid and gas cores use some form of soft containment (centrifugal force, magnetic fields, etc.) so they will reduce their losses, but inevitably some of the FFP will make their way into the exhaust in these designs. The NSWR is the worst because it makes no attempt at containment at all. It deliberately ejects all of its unspent fuel and fission products into the exhaust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, to be completely fair, the exhaust from the solid core and light bulb designs would be slightly radioactive as well. Neutron absorption will convert a small fraction of the hydrogen reaction mass into deuterium or tritium.

The good news with fusion is that the fuel itself doesn\u0027t produce any long-lived byproducts like fission does. But, depending on the actual fusion process it may produce neutron activation in the surrounding equipment, with cobalt-60 being the primary concern. So a fusion reactor won\u0027t produce any high-level fuel waste that needs to be offloaded, but when it reaches end of life the entire primary will probably be classified as high-level waste.
