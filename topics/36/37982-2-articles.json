So if thats the case fine, I can see how the 4M version will work with the 70T Block I Crew version. But for the 105 and 130T versions they are supposed to be using a Large cryogenic stage. I cant find too much information on this, wikipedia has it at 5M and thats what I have been able to find online. I just am not sure how it fits into what they have shown in the diagram is the entire stage housed inside a covering and those are jettisoned? I havent been able to find anything on this. So if anyone could point me in the right direction it would be very much appreciated. Also the upper stage of the 130T version has 3 J-2X engines now? Is that correct?
