Skycrane? Built in rockets?\n\u003E \n\nRegarding your question, personally I would have to go with parachutes whenever possible. They have low mass, allowing more base per mission. Problem is that there less acurate than the alternatives. In the case of a body without an atmosphere, things get a bit more challanging. In these cases, a skycrane is not a bad idea, but a skycrane can end up having a fairly high mass. The base landing rockets can also work wonders here, but the low fuel supply means that some form of additional fuel storage is needed.\n\nIn a nut shell, it all depends on the destination."},{"CreatedByName":"Rafael acevedo","CreatedById":84946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T23:52:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Cdodders said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E what is the best way of landing these bases?

The amazing parts in this mod with their low center of gravity once the modules are extended allow for the construction of very stable rovers.
