Maybe some combined module with animations when the docking transforms get within \u0022attraction\u0022 range and with support for a seperate type of transform for the prongs. (As im writing this im thinking i should probably post my wip docking port model so its easier to understand) i have two types of docking ports ideas now: one that just extends and has a big lever some distance behind it that supports the docked module (meant for docking stuff radially) and the one with the 4 prongs on the \u0022a\u0022 side part that grab on to outside of the \u0022b\u0022 side.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-03T17:38:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2014 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T18:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdded loop was promising but as it is now, it\u0027s too much tied to Kethane and I don\u0027t think an \u0022all-in-one\u0022 package/very specific was good, I mean it would be better to have one loopanim module which only deal with loop (start/stop loop), and another for deploy/retract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now and as-is, loop anim are just what they are and are always activated (both in VAB/SPH and outside).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T19:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the loop animation to be used when other modules are active (like when a comm dish is deployed), I have to write the module to specifically check for that.
