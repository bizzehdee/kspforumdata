TechNodes can be created within the tree (seems like there will be just a few stock). The features preview video leads on that it will be rather simple for mod devs to put parts into the tech system. and for the ones that dont bother Im guessing it wont be hard to do on ones own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention mods like ModuleManager, that Im sure will have edit packs for popular mods that arent tech updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaRocketCat","CreatedById":32377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T18:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to HarvesteR\u0027s profile and look at his posts from some time back.

Once that node has been researched you can use the part. A node can have multiple parts. There are several hidden/unused nodes that mod authors can assign their parts to, I assume they\u0027ll show up in the tree if parts are assigned to them but I\u0027ve heard nothing about how they appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use your favorite parts in career mode you have two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
