Looks outstanding!\u003Cp\u003EFew personal notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Outstanding choice of the Liquid boosters. That alone makes a successful ascent far more likely, as you can throttle down to make sure you don\u0027t exceed terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The pairing of the absolutely beautiful interior and the sleek exterior with the new MFD system is one of the best features of this mod.

I\u0027m lucky to be collaborating with such a talented artist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb sort of works with it, but due to the off-centre thrust vector at the later stages of the launch it can be quite inaccurate.

Then, from LKO (80-100Km), so that you don\u0027t re-enter too fast, you want to perform the de-orbit burn opposite where the KSC will be when you reach periapsis so that the landing predicition moves over KSC. I find that it does not have to be exact. It\u0027s best to overshoot slightly, then burn off any excess velocity by performing S turns (like the real Space Shuttle) on approach to the runway. In the first stages of re-entry (hyper/supersonic) a 20 degree angle-of-attack (AoA) seems to work well enough (and looks cool) without making the vessel skip back to orbit, then later on at slower speeds you can adjust the AoA to stay on target. You want to touch down at 80m/s (180mph) so that you don\u0027t stall, whilst also reaching a low final sink rate. You will need to perfect your glideslope and the timing of your final flare to reach this at the right point, though there is quite a bit of leeway as the brakes on the shuttle let it come to a stop after only 3/4 of the length of the runway. All in all, once you know what you\u0027re doing landing the shuttle as it is right now is quite forgiving and reliable, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that was the semi-realistic and efficient way to fly it. If aerodynamics-induced stress and heat damage were accurately modelled in this game it would also be the only way to fly it. The Kerbal alternative is to simply deorbit late at a steep angle and pull up to circle around the vicinity of KSC at around 3 Km up to bleed off speed until you are slow enough to line up and land. You still need to pull off the flare well to get to the right final sink rate and landing speed. Chances are that this descent profile would not work well with FAR (expect wings to rip off) or Deadly Re-entry (expect everything to blow up). Please note that I have not yet experimented with support for either of those mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, the shuttle flies well with the above suggestions only if it has the V tail configuration. For some reason one stabiliser is not stable enough right now, resulting in a shuttle that likes looking everywhere but where it\u0027s going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CpPolar268","CreatedById":75534,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T22:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo: helldiver or ZRM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we get a full mod list needed to fly this awesome shuttle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T03:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fonso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fonso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe scientific world uses the International Sistem, no m/s speed lectures love for us?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHDG Mode (the one you are probably seeing) is in Feet, and Knots Indicated Airspeed.
