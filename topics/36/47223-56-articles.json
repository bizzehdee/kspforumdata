Would make the floor thicker, effectively, and then you could surface attach stuff without having it clip through the floor. Green bit in the image is supposed to be a stack node, blue part is the cross-section of the piece, landing gear for example. Bonus: geometrically simple to model, hopefully simple to texture!

Using a similar plane to my previous tomfoolery, I was able to easily get up to 13,000 meters and cruise maintaining an 8* AoA. I was also able to break Mach at level flight below 9000 meters (though the fact I had 4 of them when 2 probably would have sufficed for most tasks definitely contributed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECargo Ramp:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new sliding part and its folding \u0027finger\u0027 ramps do not have colliders on them. I assume you\u0027re aware of this and I\u0027ll reserve any official advice until we have a completed model for it. 45 seems to be the magic number for it using the \u0027large gear under blister\u0027 configuration many of us are. While the fingers are cool, I sense they may present a problem for vehicles with very low ground clearance. Anything that requires a 0 setting may get high-sided on that hinge. Memory serving, didnt the old cargo ramp extend perfectly straight (minus the main hinge on the door)? Actual testing will be required (I have not deployed rovers through it yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFAR Patch:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least for me, the FAR patch was functioning even without the presence of FAR. Something was definitely screwy with my install in general with noticeable symptoms of messed up thermal sim so I will verify on my newly reinstalled version to be certain. If someone else can verify this, however, that\u0027d be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy SSTOs:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran into issues with take-off on heavy SSTOs. Often they\u0027d have a hard time pulling up and thus pick up more speed on they runway than they needed to (often 200m/s\u002B). The planes don\u0027t handle pitch-up maneuvers ASL at those speeds gracefully (and by not gracefully, I mean RUD-level ungraceful). This may be partially correctable by adjusting the node sizes (which are currently size 3) to 3.5 (since KSP does use that to some effect in joint strength calculations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears I somehow messed up my install of Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix Modules which apparently did massive damage to KSP while it was running.
