The issue here really lies with Unity. The problem is, that the HLSL-\u003EGLSL transpiler is not able to properly transpile matrices of constant values.\n\nInstead of simply outputting constant value hardcoded matrices on the GLSL side as well, the transpiler\n\n1. allocates a dynamic (aka: non-constant) array the size of the matrix for each fragment (\u0022pixel\u0022) . This is done in global scope, so this array has longer lifetime than the shader\u0027s individual functions.\n2. for each fragment (\u0022pixel\u0022) re-initializes this array with the hardcoded values at the beginning of the shader\u0027s main function.\n3. has the code use the value in that array (even though the same value is there, hardcoded, and used for initialization...)\n\nNow, this is a problem, because, if the shader compiler does not have a custom workaround for that broken behaviour of the HLSL-\u003EGLSL transpiler, the shader compiler will do as told, and allocate a bunch of vector registers to store the matrix for every fragment (keep in mind, that the code generated by Unity\u0027s HLSL-GLSL transpiler just tells the shader compiler, that there is a matrix of floating point values that could in principle be different for every fragment, and that that matrix is in global scope, so it has longer lifetime than any shader function and therefore cannot be optimized away).\n\nFor small matrices this is bad, because in an ideal world, several waves (meaning: groups of fragments, vertices, whatever) should be scheduled on the same SIMD computation unit, to allow it to hide memory latency by working on a different wave if one wave is waiting for data. This is not \u0022true\u0022 multitasking, meaning, that also registers of \u0022background\u0022 waves are kept directly at the computation unit. If now one wave takes a lot of registers, less waves can be scheduled for that computation unit, increasing the impact of memory latency. While this is not optimal, it\u0027s not a full catastrophe either.\n\nIf, however, the matrices are big, we go from bad to (much, much) worse. The shader compiler now is running out of registers in which to store the matrix. Instead the matrix gets placed in video memory (aka. \u0022register spilling\u0022). If this happens, the shader\u0027s performance goes from acceptable to \u0022What do you mean, I should draw a picture? You just told me to spend most of my time copying numbers between video memory and registers!\u0022.\n\nI did report this issue to the Unity developers, but made the report from my personal (free) account (because I noticed it at home, while working on Scatterer\u0027s OpenGL performance). Of course the bug report was ignored...  \n\nI should have really posted it at work, using our Unity premium support accounts...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-01T13:25:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2020 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource**"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-01T13:55:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, VoidSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm... while not specific to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E (or any other location), if things are way too dark and you\u0027re feeling you\u0027re hunting a black crow (there are white crows too, just saying) at night, this mod helps:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3695636122\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190080-18x-minimum-ambient-lighting-updated/\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:209px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Go ahead! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThanks but I remember changing it in the cloud settings in a previous version but on tekto in opm.
