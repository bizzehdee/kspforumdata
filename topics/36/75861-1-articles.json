So you require a mod that implements joints which can rotate freely. You could make MS parts to facilitate the suspension; and wheels that use attachnodes and have rock solid suspensions so that it\u0027s all put on the rocker-bogie, or you could make an alternate plugin which does this specifically; but I believe you would still require separate wheel parts I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note, because Unity\u0027s WheelCollider system uses linecasting instead of actual round things to make the wheels work; and the glitches that happen when the linecast is not perpindicular to the terrain, a rocker-bogie\u0027s two linked wheels will behave strangely more frequently than normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T19:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! To fix the line casting issue would it be possible to make a plugin that gives a wheel mesh resistance so that you could use Magic Smoke/IR to turn the wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T22:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the rover is heavy enough, you can use something squishy like batteries in the suspension and make a makeshift rocker-bogie, but you\u0027ll probably need a plugin if you want this to be the same size as Pathfinder or Curiosity or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mathers42","CreatedById":165976,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T22:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made one in KSP a few months ago, using Infernal robotics and internal collisions: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mathers.ovh/me/?custompage=ksp_rover\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mathers.ovh/me/?custompage=ksp_rover\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
