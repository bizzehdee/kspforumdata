My plan is simple:\n\n1. Define a resource called \u0022QuantumVacuum\u0022\n\n2. Make QuantumVacuum and ElectricCharge the propellants for the Q-Thruster\n\n3. Use ModuleGenerator to create a generator that generates QuantumVacuum faster than the engine uses it.\n\n3. Use my q-thruster for fun and profit ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI just can\u0027t seem to get the generator to work. No matter what I do, it won\u0027t appear.\n\nHere\u0027s the config file if it\u0027s any help:\n\n    PART{name = QthrustMPDmodule = Partauthor = Stevie_Dmesh = model.muscale = 1rescaleFactor = 1node_stack_top = 0.0, 1.6575, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -3.705, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2fx_exhaustFlame_blue = 0.0, -0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, runningfx_exhaustLight_blue = 0.0, -0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, runningfx_exhaustSparks_flameout = 0.0, -0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, flameoutTechRequired = interstellarTechFusionPower2entryCost = 14000cost = 100000category = Propulsionsubcategory = 0title = Advanced Quantum Vacuum Thrustermanufacturer = Kerbin Aeronautics Space Agencydescription = A larger and more efficient cousin of the ion engine, the more hippy-minded boffins at KASA claim this thing runs off the air of the universe itself.attachRules = 1,0,1,1,0// --- standard part parameters ---mass = 8dragModelType = defaultmaximum_drag = 0.2minimum_drag = 0.2angularDrag = 2crashTolerance = 7breakingForce = 200breakingTorque = 200maxTemp = 3600RESOURCE{ name = QuantumVacuum amount = 10 maxAmount = 100}MODULE{    name = ModuleEngines    thrustVectorTransformName = TT    exhaustDamage = False    ignitionThreshold = 0.1    minThrust = 0    maxThrust = 1800    heatProduction = 10    PROPELLANT    {        name = ElectricCharge        ratio = 0.2    }    PROPELLANT    {        name = QuantumVacuum        ratio = 1        DrawGauge = true    }    atmosphereCurve     {        key = 0 11213    }MODULE{    name = ModuleGenerator    isAlwaysActive = true    OUTPUT_RESOURCE    {       name = QuantumVacuum       rate = 2    }}\n\nEDIT: I solved the problem!
