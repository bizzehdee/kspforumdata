Thanks for re opening the thread \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stopped playing the game for a long time due to no 64 bit support that was really killing my enjoyment due the limitation on mods. But with the 1.1 pre release I decided to pick it up again, and now I can finally enjoy the game with all the mods I like \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0With that, I decided to pick up this little project as well.\u00A0I don\u0027t have a new release for you guys yet (mostly because I just spent a whole week fighting KSP to import an animation), but I wanted to open the thread again and post some previews.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, the next release will break saves. I\u0027m taking the opportunity to fix some naming conventions that were wrong and re organize everything for future parts. So if anyone is hoping to get the new update on older saves, you\u0027ll need to do some cfg juggling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts wise, I\u0027m updating a couple of textures and taking the opportunity to convert everything do DDS and also working on some new stuff. The engine I was working on last year is on hold for now. I started to texture it but kinda froze doing it. Not sure I really like the design anymore. For now, I\u0027m working on Solar Panels to go with the ship which are almost ready. In addition to the retractable stuff, I\u0027ll also doing fixed ones just in case. I still hope to add some kind of engine, but I suspect it\u0027ll be something a bit more conventional. This is for next release. Later on, I hope to add some more things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, enough talking, here\u0027s a screenshot \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lHdUoMt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lHdUoMt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe textures are not final yet, and there\u0027s probably some more mesh work to do. The hardest part is over though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and I finally got around to adding support to other mods. For now, USI-LS, UKS and Connected Living Spaces are done. I\u0027ll take a look at adding support to TAC-LS, Snacks and some others. Any mods that you guys would like to have support to, let me know and I\u0027ll see about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it for now.
