It\u2019s mostly CME based, which requires a simulation of solar weather, which doesn\u0027t seem hugely interesting, or does it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have a readout, with a graph, activated by a part, which would give you a nice prediction... that\u0027d be pretty cool. Let\u0027s table it though, it would be very complex.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGCRs:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmbient radiation from GCRs\u00A0is more or less an omnidirectional\u00A0increase in radiation flux, attenuated by the local planetary magnetic field. Anywhere in the universe, your exposure to cosmic rays is primarily a factor of your magnetic field and the amount of the sky that is not occluded by a gigantic massive planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo work out the complete solution you would essentially have to raycast outwards from the part in all directions with a decently high angular density, attenuate those rays through the parts, and from that figure out the total exposure of the crew pod. Additionally, scale the total flux by the strength of the planet\u2019s magnetic field at that point. Essentially...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nIf (Sv/s) = I0 (Sv/s) * tau* sum(rayIf)/nRays\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf = dose at part surface\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI0 = GCR mean dose, as from MSL (say 300 mSV/year)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nrayIf = final attenuation of ray once propagated (0-1)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nnRays = number of rays cast\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntau = attenuation scalar of magnetic field at vessel distance\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would allow full simulation of using parts to attenuate GCRs. It\u2019s conceptually doable but adds a bunch of computations. Every time a vessel is changed or moves relative to another set of parts, the ray burst has to be recalculated for accurate simulation, which could be quite lag-inducing (though conceptually you could spread this out over a few frames and optimize it a bit). Not ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that a simpler model is to have each part work out the approximate visible size of the local celestial body\u00A0and use that to scale the total flux from cosmic rays, as that is the main driver of cosmic ray exposure (attenuating GCRs sucks without a lot of mass). Additionally, scale the total flux by the strength of the planet\u2019s magnetic field. This would be kinda...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nIf (Sv/s) = I0 (Sv/s) * ((4*pi) - Psr (steradians) )/ 4*pi * tau (scalar)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI0 = GCR mean dose, from MSL (say 300 mSV/year)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf = dose at part surface\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPsr = size of planet in steradians at vessel distance\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntau = attenuation scalar of magnetic field at vessel distance\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is computationally simple so that\u2019s great. The problem with this solution is that of course it does not take into account parts of any kind. This means that you have to rely purely on the crew pod\u2019s shielding and the planet\u2019s magnetic field. Another approximation might be calculating the \u0022real\u0022 sky visibility from a part, but then that would not take into account the ray path through parts, which means it\u0027s pretty much inaccurate too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m leaning towards the second option, mainly because i\u2019m already heavy on raycasts for the point simulation and want to save that power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESurface radiation:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be bundled with GCR simulation pretty easily using the inverse of the second method, it\u2019s easily possible to calculate the fraction of the sky that is \u201Cplanet\u201D and use that to scale the total radiation. Local radiation could easily be sampled on a per-biome basis (eve\u2019s seas could be radioactive, for example).

If you\u2019re in the radiation belt, it can be assumed that the incoming radiation is omnidirectional.\u00A0This can therefore piggyback off whatever GCR model is being used. The issue is how to model the seed value for the strength of the radiation belt. Typically the radiation belts are weirdly shaped depending on the magnetic field distribution of a planet (Kerbalism has good examples).\u00A0What\u2019s the value in semi-accurately shaping the magnetic fields versus modeling them with a altitude based curve? A curve can be sampled easily which makes it pretty simple. Arbitrary shapes are harder to evaluate and visualize, but could make for some interesting gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T23:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see where this needs to be so complex.

In the case of more than one ship, the list of events is potentially quite high... consider how frequently the geometry between two nearby ships changes.
