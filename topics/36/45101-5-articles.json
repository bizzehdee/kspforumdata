Next jet pack concept is this; twin jet engines, small wings, ion engine in the middle with a deplorable solar array similar to the Baka solar array that folds up inside the pack. All in, it should be about 20,000m/s of dV in atmosphere, and 7000m/s in vacuum. Thinking about a deployable heat shield to surround the pilot and pack for aero captures. This pack will rely very heavily on the fire spitter animation module, but will be a 1 part ship from the launch pad to Laythe surface, and back to Kerbin without refueling. Will also be able to land on some of the smallest moons as well with the ion engine I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gameguru","CreatedById":83605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T19:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay!
