Let me explain. Imagine an ice cube in a square box with wheels. The box has a motor. The box is now traveling at 10m/s. Everything in the box is traveling at the same speed. The box brakes and launches the cube forwards in the exact same way that you are lauched forwards in a car when it comes to a sudden stop. When you have your seatbelt on it slows you down with the car becasue the seatbelt is attached to the car in which the joints on the missile are. Then we you disconnect said joint the same thing happens when you don\u0027t have a seatbelt and no seat to behind you to hold you in place. Since a human can\u0027t accelerate when sitting in a moving car you can\u0027t keep up with the car. But now imagine that you have rocket boots that are faster than the car. A missile has that. That makes the missile already have the planes speed plus the acceleration it now gets from it\u0027s \u0022rocker boots\u0022.
