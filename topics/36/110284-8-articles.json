With this update, Pathfinder introduces resource scanning tech earlier in the game- assuming it works. Additionally, the Geology Lab can do things that the stock surface scanner can- and more if you staff it right. Finally, the new Outback gives you a handy way to haul small amounts of resources around without lugging the Buckboard.\n\n**New Parts**\n\n- Added the T.E.R.R.A.I.N. Geo Scanner. If it breaks down, you\u0027ll have to repair it. Don\u0027t want it to break? You can change it in the settings menu.\n\n- Added the Outback Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP). It\u0027s great for hauling a small amount of resources around, and it\u0027s EVA friendly. It can be attached to the exterior of a vessel by pressing the \u0022H\u0022 key, and detached using the \u0022G\u0022 key. Anybody can use it.\n\n*Ponderosa*\n\n- Cleaned up the Ponderosa right-click menu and moved a lot of functionality to the Ponderosa Operations window. Access it via the Manage Operations button in the right-click menu.\n\n*Pathfinder Geology Lab*\n\n- The Geology Lab is now controlled through the Operations window. Simply right-click on the Ponderosa, press the Manage Operations button, and press the Show button to manage the Geology Lab.\n\n- The Geology Lab can now perform a surface analysis of the biome if properly staffed.\n\n- If you have the Impact mod (I recommend it), the Geology Lab can lend its seismometer to the cause if properly staffed.\n\n*Templates*\n\n- Added the Prime Flux Battery template to the Buckboard and Outback, named after Prime Flux, who suggested the idea. Thanks Prime Flux! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*ToolTips \u0026 Settings*\n\n- Added a tooltip to remind players that the requirement to pay for redecorating/inflating the Ponderosa can be turned off.\n\n- The Settings window can now be toggled using the modifier key (which defaults to the Alt key on Windows) plus P instead of being hard coded to the Alt key.\n\n*Resources \u0026 Storage*\n\n- Added the PhotoMaterials resource for taking pictures.\n\n- Adjusted the Buckboard\u0027s storage capacity when not being used to store KIS items.\n\n- You can now access the Chuckwagon\u0027s inventory from inside the module.\n\n*KIS/KAS*\n\n- Updated the saddle to account for the latest changes in KIS.\n\n- Thanks to the latest version of KIS, non-engineers can attach the drill to a vessel with the \u0022H\u0022 key and grab it with the \u0022G\u0022 key.\n\n*Recommended Mod*\n\nImpact: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...eroids-30-6-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-1-0-Impact%21-impact-science-and-contracts-v1-1-0-With-Asteroids-30-6-15)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T00:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:20:11Z","Content":"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI just had a thought...

The Gaslight is designed to be compact, cheap, and available early in the tech tree, so it needs to avoid dish antennas.

I see people attaching these to their craft as the primary battery source with the intention of never removing them. This extra power is really a major issue early in career games but has no real effect later on. I don\u0027t know if you have a way you could scale the power up with increasing tech levels or not but that would be the ideal solution. Otherwise, just simply toning down the power and providing a pack that has between 150-300 EC still gives a significant advantage at the 45 science level. Additionally, that advantage would quickly disappear after just a couple more purchases in the electrics line when the 400 EC battery opens for stock and many other mods like PP give even more advantages. \n\nOther than that, the balance on all the other selections for the Outback seem to really be in line with other tech available at this level and provides that tiny bit of extra flexibility you need for various types of setups.

I see people attaching these to their craft as the primary battery source with the intention of never removing them. This extra power is really a major issue early in career games but has no real effect later on. I don\u0027t know if you have a way you could scale the power up with increasing tech levels or not but that would be the ideal solution. Otherwise, just simply toning down the power and providing a pack that has between 150-300 EC still gives a significant advantage at the 45 science level. Additionally, that advantage would quickly disappear after just a couple more purchases in the electrics line when the 400 EC battery opens for stock and many other mods like PP give even more advantages. \n\u003E \n\u003E Other than that, the balance on all the other selections for the Outback seem to really be in line with other tech available at this level and provides that tiny bit of extra flexibility you need for various types of setups. Really a great addition to this whole package...keep up the great work!\n\nGreat feedback, thank you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Consider the MC-16 communications link to be a part of the Gaslight. Yay reduced parts count! I have some other ideas in mind for next update to help keep the base\u0027s part count low as well, but still work with KIS/KAS.\n\nI currently don\u0027t have a way to scale up the EC based upon tech level, but I can tone down the storage. The Outback actually stores about 1/4 the EC that the Buckboard does when configured as a battery. I\u0027ve been thinking about this for a while, and I think an alternate solution is to require RocketParts to switch to the battery template, just like it takes RocketParts to switch Ponderosa templates. That would also mean you need an Engineer to perform the conversion (both of which can be turned off in the Settings window). I think a combination of the two- lowering the EC levels on both the Outback and the Buckboard to EC amounts appropriate to the tech level, and requiring RocketParts to make the conversion, will solve the problem."}]}
