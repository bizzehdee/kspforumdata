Unfortunately I am having another problem, and I\u0027m not sure if its a problem with the mod or a problem with my game.... I used hyper edit to put the station itself (pre-assembled) into orbit, and then put a progresses in orbit behind it. For some reason, I can\u0027t dock... I tried everything I can think of, including checking the persistence file. The best conclusion I can think of is that either the lag is somehow preventing docking, or there\u0027s a bug in the mod itself. I remember back when the ISS project was started, the PMA part had a bug that prevented all docking on any ship with a PMA part. That bug was squashed, but I think the same bug may have popped up again. If my memory serves me right, it think that bug was caused by the part having two docking ports on the same part.\n\nEdit:\n\nNot lag. i launched a new craft with a high enough part count to induce far more lag than ISS, and i was still able to dock with it. I\u0027ll continue my tests to try to find the cause. If it is an issue with the mod, i want to make it as easy for you to solve as possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T04:10:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sciencepanda**"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralSirJohn","CreatedById":84184,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T04:23:13Z","Content":"That could be type of port used.
