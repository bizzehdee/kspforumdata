Likely related to the new method that I am using to store the persistent radius data and/or how it re-initializes from the persistence. If you can make a list of the steps needed to reliably trigger the problem, that would go a long ways towards helping me track down the cause and getting it fixed. I certainly did not see anything like that during my routine testing, though it is fairly limited to build, launch, revert to launch, revert to vab; build, launch, go to space center, return to vessel, revert to vab. These steps generally catch all of the KSP loading scenarios, but there may well be something that I\u0027m missing.\n\nWill open up an issue ticket and work on getting this one cleaned up for the next release."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T04:48:05Z","Content":"The wobbling SRBs happens even when I use KJR too BTW.\n\nPS: What I mean is when I ignite the Rocket boosters, they flex forwards.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T04:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T07:59:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The wobbling SRBs happens even when I use KJR too BTW.\n\u003E PS: What I mean is when I ignite the Rocket boosters, they flex forwards.\n\nAs stated earlier this is stock behavior and even KJR cannot eliminate it entirely, you need more struts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you think it\u0027s really weird try it again with a clean install.

If the wobbling is the same, I guess there\u0027s unfortunately nothing that can be done at this moment.\n\nSo, I did not notice any wobble or flex in my dev setup with KJR installed when I was testing it yesterday (yes, in stock/no KJR, they are really bad). It seemed to work exactly as I would expect given KJR... no flex, no wobble, even under thrust.\n\nBut, to be fair, I have received one other report of joint flex even with KJR installed, so I will be doing some investigation on that point throughout the week. There is likely either a difference in the KJR configs (as joint stiffness is configurable with KJR) or some other mod conflicting/causing KJR to not do its job properly.\n\nTo help out this cause, I will likely ask for some screenshots of a specific setup / craft file, along with logs \u002B a dump of your current KJR configs; but, I need to do one more round of testing and prep before I will have the test-case/craft ready. Will hopefully get to this after I get home from work tonight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The SSTU RO configurations are now in an official release, for anybody interested.\n\u003E [https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E The landers are still WIP, but much progress has been made.\n\nAwesome, thanks for your hard work and willingness to contribute ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nWith all the work you guys have put in, I\u0027ll probably be giving RO a try in the near future as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Shadowmage, do you have a patreon or paypal for donations? The scope of content you have made in such a short time is amazing and I want to give something back.\n\nThanks for the offer, it is much appreciated. I don\u0027t currently have anything publicly accessible/easily available to link. Will look into adding a Paypal link/button to the OP. \n\nThough, I am kind of averse to the whole monetization of mods and modding, as that was a part of the cause of my exodus from Minecraft modding. I\u0027m not doing it for the money, nor would it be realistic for that to be any part of my motivation or reason to continue modding. The problem I ran into with MC was mostly ending up with a feeling that I was obligated to do modding work... which is not where I want to be this time; it results in sub-par work being done lots of \u0027rushed\u0027 features, and general feelings of resentment for the entire deal.\n\nBut I have nothing against letting people buy me a drink or meal once in awhile, as it were. So if you (or anyone else) would like to send a small token my way, I would have no problem with that; it would be much appreciated.\n\nWill get the Paypal button added to the OP sometime this week; please keep in mind though that you are in absolutely no way obligated to make donations, now or ever.\n\nSpent a bit of time playing around with skinned mesh renderers yesterday. Powerful stuff, but I think it is likely overkill for my needs / the purposes I had intended, and would probably end up decreasing overall performance. I could likely get it implemented to be a good stand-in for the current fuel-line mechanics; but would need to implement nearly the full IK chain in order to get it looking good. Probably not worth the dev time to sort it all out and deal with the added complexities just for some minor visual improvement. \n\nWill keep it in mind for the future though; it has some very interesting capabilities (and applications) that I might find myself needing elsewhere. At least it opens up new opportunities for solving some problems, and being a bit more familiar with it, I will likely run across some good uses for it before too long.\n\nOne decent alternative that I thought up for creating the fuel lines would be a custom procedural plugin that created each fuel line dynamically and managed updating its bones/geometry, but again it is probably not worth the work/effort to develop given how minor the feature is / how small the geometry is.\n\nWill likely aim to get at least one more engine finished up this week (F1, J2, other?), along with perhaps a couple of mounts for the RS-25 (mk3/shuttle, new SLS style 2/3/4/5 engine mounts). From my initial look over things, most of the mounts will end up being at least slightly engine-specific. Many will be re-usable for other engines, but will be more \u0027optimal\u0027 for the engine they were designed for.\n\nFor example; the SLS style mounts won\u0027t work very well if scaled up to proper dimensions for the F1 engines (and actually have a different engine layout). Nor do the F1 style mounts scale down very well for use on an SLS inspired build (and in fact they look quite different).\n\nSo.. my initial list of mounting options will probably be fairly short, something like:\n\n(stack size - preferred engine layout)\n\n6.25m - 5 x F1\n\n5m - 5 x RS-25\n\n5m - Tapered, round, to be used for 2/3 engine mounts (and reusable/rescalable for other stack sizes and other engines).\n\n3.75m - 2 x F1B (could possibly also be used for 3-inline engine configs where the outside engines slightly protrude).\n\nMk3 - 3x RS-25 (if I can find a good way to make it work/if it will all fit)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T16:20:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The SSTU RO configurations are now in an official release, for anybody interested.\n\u003E [https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E The landers are still WIP, but much progress has been made.\n\nCan you make Real Plume configs for stock?"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T16:58:53Z","Content":"I could use a F1 mount on a SLS using RS-25, but it sure would mean moar (4x) boosters like the MLV projects ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T20:13:41Z","Content":"A few previews of more mount geometry work; this stuff seems to be getting closer to final geometry.\n\nGeneric Engine Mount - 5m base size, but could be rescaled.
