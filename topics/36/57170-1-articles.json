All files got written by the PartTools plugin alright (.MU file and the two .MBMs), since the part is a rather simple fueltank thing and i know the right scale (i read up on those as well) i took a CFG file from the Squad Parts and modified it (replaced names and descriptions, and the attachment node offsets (i read up on those too). I triple checked the folder structure and now i\u0027m running against a mental wall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt simply won\u0027t load into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did i missed?

I mean it looks all fine in unity. It also lools as if everything ets converted right (including the MBM texture conversation) the CFG file i checked a dozen times now (interesting question: does the name in the CFG file needs to be the name of the actual model file name shown in unity before import?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that may have been it. funny enough. the part shows up in the list LAST and not first like other mods. but that may be the loading order (the folder name is Test and that comes after Squad). now it is just slightly too large. but that might be because unity thinks that i used maya\u0027s default centimeter scale. easy fix tho\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-21T17:54:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2013 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Aeon-Phoenix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFigured it out\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
