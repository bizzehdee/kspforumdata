I\u0027ve been quite busy with real life work, but I do plan on continuing work on this whenever possible. \u003Cp\u003EThe only real new question i\u0027ve seen pop-up is concerning file size. I\u0027ll be releasing 2 versions of the mod, one for potato-laptops, and one for current-gen hardware. The meshes themselves wont contribute much to filesize bloat so I\u0027ll keep them the same across both versions, instead it\u0027ll have different textures to cut down on resource usage. The potato-SRI will probably use tweaked halfsize textures (sharped and touched up, to ensure readability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar Mod compatibility was brought up at some point in this thread I believe, and it is a possibility. I might end up releasing a tweaked tech tree to allow it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on developing my technology along a divergent path that Interstellar takes (Magnetic/laser and nuclear beam pumped based propulsion) so the tech tree integration might be a little strange, but shouldn\u0027t be too much of a stretch to imagine integrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry, no pretty pictures this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Daemoria stated a couple of weeks ago he is busy with RL work and his time for dev work on this is limited.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Espresso","CreatedById":68432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T07:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daemoria","CreatedById":103696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T19:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to post here for closure\u0027s sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t devote as much time as I first thought to this mod, and still balance my job and game-dev workload.
