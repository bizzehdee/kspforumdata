I didn\u0027t notice the entry for FOV. I think I was also confusing with Kethane sensors, which have a \u0022detecting period.\u0022 Logicly, a larger FOV will increase the width of the scan path. For example, the BTDT scanner has a FOV of 1, while the SAR has a FOV of 5. Appears to be generally inversely proportional to level of detail available. Basic scan has wide path, specific scan has narrow. Functionally, this means the most efficient scan coverage should be at maximum height (to cover widest area, taking fewer orbits), but that will be slower due to orbital velocity at higher altitudes. Lower altitude would cover a narrower area, but may be compensated by traveling over the surface faster (taking more orbits)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe you can calculate the actual width of scanned area by plugging the scanner altitude into a triangle formula, using the FOV number as the angle of the top of the triangle, and the altitude on both sides to derive the base (or viewed area)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will effect scan pattern on other bodies, because the diameter of those bodies are different from Kerbin. At 750km, a the basic SCAN RADAR Altimetry Sensor (fov 5) will cover approx 65km wide path regardless of which body its over.
