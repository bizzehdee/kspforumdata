Might need larger-volume greywater tanks IRL anyways, and cylindrical tanks help with that. As far as keeping them liquid goes, some pretty thin MLI and a little electric heater may do. It might make sense to let some waste tanks freeze anyways to limit leakage problems in storage as long as you can still get stuff into them. An occasional thaw-out for transfer to reprocessing/garbage disposal might be reasonable. IIRC, some of the more-solid stuff has to be refrigerated anyways so that bags of ...stuff don\u0027t generate gas and eventually pop.
