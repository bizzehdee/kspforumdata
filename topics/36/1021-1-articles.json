Right now we have SAS modules that overcompensate ridiculously for small craft but won\u0027t bother shoving a large craft full-force until the aerodynamics already have it circling the drain. If you could match them perfectly to the acceleration characteristics of your craft you\u0027d have rock solid flight"},{"CreatedByName":"cjameshuff","CreatedById":152,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T23:19:04Z","Content":"See this thread:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=650.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=650.0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-27T04:54:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They are used to help stabilize the aircraft/spacecraft.

Note that this is not due to instability - I try to remedy that issue by shuffling parts around and adding winglets, if the problem arises - but due simply to the fact that I no longer have sufficient authority to STEER the ship anymore (especially in view of its massive positive stability)."}]}
