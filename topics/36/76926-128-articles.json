Missions- Pulling from the quoted suggestion by tetryds, and going from my own suggestion that it is in reference to, I want to be able to give the autopilot missions. I want to tell the autopilot, \u0022Hey, see that bomber? Don\u0027t let it die\u0022 or \u0022Hey, see that area over there? Go destroy everything in that area.\u0022 or \u0022HOLY CRAP!

RUN AWAY!- Another thing, when things are going unfavorably for it, (it sustains heavy damage, it\u0027s low on fuel and ammo, it just fired all of it\u0027s missiles and all of them missed, etc.) that the autopilot will try and disengage. When things aren\u0027t going well for it, I want the autopilot try try and run away. In connection to the above suggestion, the autopilot will also try and retreat if it fails in it\u0027s mission, depending on what that mission is. (This idea came to me when I pit two fighters against each other, and they proceeded to trash every single missile shot and ended up in a gun battle that only ended because one of them ran out of fuel.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow the weapon manager treats the weapon depends on if it says bomb or missile in its name.
