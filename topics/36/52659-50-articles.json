If you\u0027re flying a big monster for lifting a major truss into orbit, or doing anything that involves leaving Kerbin orbit, 150 units of monopropellant is nowhere near enough for most work. Even with the new ion drive system. (though we really need a short fuselage section with xenon, battery, and an RTG to be set aside for a deep space mission pack.) And yes, theoretically, any shuttle could get away with an itty-bitty amount, but I\u0027m not crazy enough to do docking without a pretty massive margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitworks","CreatedById":97023,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T03:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPorkjet, I\u0027ve loved your inflatable habitats for a long time, but I\u0027ve always avoided the SP\u002B because I\u0027ve never been one for planes.

It gets even better if you add the Improved Chase Camera mod. Either way, any kind of analog game controller will give you a much better flying experience with planes. Oh, and Environmental Visual Enhancements! Nothing like flying through volumetric clouds. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
