station.Zoom out until you see your star\u0027s orbit.Focus on it and open the Kittopia menu by pressing Ctrl\u002BP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect your star\u0027s name under \u0027Planet Selection\u0027.Once you did, scroll down and click the \u0027Modify Starlight Data\u0027 button.Once you did, below click the button \u0027Add Starfix To:\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you did, you will have 4 options: Flare Color, Light Color, Emit Color and Spot Color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlare color determines the color of the light your star will emit.Light color is practically the same option as flare color, don\u0027t touch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmit color determines the color of the star itself.And spot color determines the color of the star\u0027s surface and the color of it\u0027s sunspots, however, the sunspots will remain black and unchangeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you click on every option, you will see 4 sliders on each option.Now here you can have fun.Moving these sliders changes the colors of you star, play around with all 3 options until you are satisfied.Once you are, click \u0027Save Data\u0027 in the kittopia menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, glad you asked xfrankie!
