The latest version of SVE does not overwrite anything except the atmo cfgs of the bodies. It does not overwrite the sunflare or the ocean shaders any longer. Now the control over performance and options is in the users hands. Also, SVE no longer bundles a sunflare due to too many people complaining about not knowing how to replace textures. Go download the latest version 1.2.5.0\n\nAlso, [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) I doubt it\u0027s intended, but using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E to make scatterer use my cfgs works but the file directory for my cfg is always set to Laythe so I can\u0027t save any changes directly to my cfgs in game. I have to manually go back and make any changes I need.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-13T00:50:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2017 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"blorgon","CreatedById":159569,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-13T00:47:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/11/2017 at 3:30 PM, StickyScissors said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ~~I\u0027m curious if im the only one having this issue with sunflares since updating to 1.3: [http://i.imgur.com/m3bbCzt.png](http://i.imgur.com/m3bbCzt.png)~~\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Nevermind, this is an SVE issue, as it adds the sunflare which overwrites scatterer\u0027s native one.\n\u003E \n\nNot sure it is.
