In the VAB, the Kethane survey units say they can detect everything (kethane, minerals, ore, substrate, water). However, once I get them in orbit and activate them, they detect kethane just fine, but nothing else. I.e., looking at the planet, with \u0022kethane\u0022 selected, I can see the usual white / green hexes showing what areas have been scanned. But when I flip through the kethane menu to display minerals, ore, etc., the grid is completely blank, and nothing is displayed. When I mouse over a hex, it displays something like \u0022Kethane: 534.24, Minerals: (no data), Ore: (no data), Substrate: (no data), Water: (no data).\u0022 And it does not seem to just be that there are no resources in these cells - because some hexes display \u0022Kethane: (none), Minerals: (no data), Ore: (no data), Substrate: (no data), Water: (no data).\u0022\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s relevant, I am playing in career mode (I have unlocked the advanced sci tech node with all the MKS modules), and I hyperedited the scanners into orbit to make sure they detected MKS resources before an actual launch. I tested them around Kerbin, Minmus, and Duna. What am I missing?

At least, none of my test ships have disappeared since upgrading to 2.0.7, although it\u0027s still to early to determine whether that was a direct cause, or perhaps an exacerbating factor. I\u0027m rather tentative on this, since my understanding is that the 2.0.3 bugs were primarily UI-related. Then again, I don\u0027t really understand technical details of the 2.0.3 problems to begin with, so....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be testing things out further before committing any serious mission tests with MKS modules as root parts, but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone else who experienced this issue is (or was) running MM 2.0.3 as well. If it does turn out to have been the cause, then that would explain why the problem wasn\u0027t experienced by those using older stable versions of MM like 1.5.7 or 1.5.6 (which I presume has been used for development, since it\u0027s included in the MKS.zip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe question of \u0022grey\u0022 distant marker labels\u003C/span\u003E that I mentioned in an earlier post turns out to have been a non-issue. The marker color for \u0022base\u0022 type objects seems to be a very light blue (almost to the point of being grey, tbh). It just looked \u0022debris-grey\u0022 to me because of the blueish-green backdrop of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThoughts on parts:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is there any real reason to drop the old 4-way connector hub completely? The newer caged 6-point node is a great addition, but falls short of a full-on replacement. It looks great in direct conjunction with the caged base modules, but it\u0027s too visually busy to look good as a junction for longer tubes or peripheral base extensions. The simpler red caps of 4-way hub rhyme well with other base elements without directly competing for attention in the way that the caged hub does in those applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speaking of visually busy, the Kerbtrails look a bit off when used for longer runs. The levels of bandiness and puffiness all kind of add up to the point of being distracting from the overall aesthetic balance of a construction. Since the texture isn\u0027t just wrapped simply around the tube, I guess I need to spend some time learning about Unity and PartTools in order to start playing around with some different ideas directly, but I\u0027m currently thinking of a pair of the gold lines running lengthwise down the sides to separate the \u0022top\u0022 and \u0022bottom\u0022 halves of the tubes, with the \u0022bottom\u0022 remaining as-is to provide a sense of structural support but removing the banding portions from the \u0022top\u0022 half in order to break things up visually enough that it isn\u0027t so.. well... \u003Cem\u003Ebandy....\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also, speaking of those red caps: having some stack caps/node covers with that same basic red-dome geometry and texture to put on the ends of various tanks and things would make it easier to integrate them into the MKS-colony style. The top side of the geometry you\u0027ve been using is flat enough that they could double as part-size adapters without having to make special provisions for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMechanics questions\u003C/span\u003E -- stuff I haven\u0027t been able to find or figure out yet that would be helpfull for planning moving forward:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How exactly does productivity affect production rates?

Past 100x warp, TAC will only burn a fraction of it\u0027s listed energy consumption rate, and it becomes more and more \u0022efficient\u0022 the faster you go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you noticed anything like this happening?

RE stupidity levels - consider that (roughly) a really stupid Kerbal is as valuable as half of an average one, and a smart Kerbal is as good as two average ones. So airlock the stupid ones first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProxy Logistics Updates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one I changed due to performance issues.

This can be observed as you do the transfer - you\u0027ll see Kerbitat go up, and Storage-B hover around the same number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Antenna does the same thing for PunchCards (So you don\u0027t need to launch a bunch of Colony Hubs).

As a benchmark, I think having enough to operate on PDU and batteries for a night cycle for four average modules would make the most sense, with solar panels to replenish the batteries. These are large factories, and need serious power (this plays well to the reactors in KSP-I) I\u0027ll do some tweaks in that direction. Warp wise, I usually go full-bore for warping, but will do some time tests at 50x to make sure the effect is consistent. Especially if it\u0027s the case that I am over-consuming. These balancing parts do not include drills, because those are some power humgry beasts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are specific modules that are draining power, let me know. It may be something weird with how TAC-LS works since I subclass off of the TAC GenericConverter. It could also be tied to having a module stuck at \u0027Active\u0027 but missing parts, and when the parts arrive, it tries to play catch-up, thus draining your battery. This may be related to another issue I am chasing down where it thinks there is no space for stuff when a module first kicks in.

Dunno. We\u0027ll see. As I posted earlier, though, I haven\u0027t lost any MKS ships yet since upgrading MM from 2.0.3 to 2.0.7 earlier this week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERegarding energy consumption:\u003C/span\u003E \u0022a night\u0022 can be pretty variable depending on where you\u0027re setting up shop. You might consider starting with a specific target and mission and look at balancing from there -- your Duna walkthough Pioneer Mission concept, for example, has got kind of an iconic feel to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpanding it to 1x Colony Hub, 1x Construction Hut, 1x PDU, and 1x Supply Hut, it looks like you can build a nice little paradrop mission payload that fits into a single 3.75m expanded KW fairing, rolls together on the ground, then pops off the wheels once it\u0027s in place (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5TIT1Gp.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERough concept sketch\u003C/a\u003E -- assumes mining and survey gear were sent on ahead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission profile would be to get Rapid Construction and the PDU\u0027s generator up and running to lay the foundation for future expansions, etc. That\u0027d provide 80k batteries to get through the night, plus 27k/hr once the PDU gets online. The question then becomes: how much do you want to be able to support with that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway...
