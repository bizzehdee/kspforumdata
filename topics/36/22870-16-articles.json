Just as parts have breakingForce and breakingTorque, attachment nodes cause the creation of attachment \u003Cem\u003Ejoints\u003C/em\u003E which also have similar properties: breakForce and breakTorque. You cannot set those, they are created automagically based on attach node size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the 201 has attachment nodes of size -1. So it\u0027s not just that it has no strength. It has NEGATIVE strength.
