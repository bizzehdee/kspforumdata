DustFX was a derivative from CollisionFX (pizzaoverhead) that I made and then integrated into KF after a few months of work.\u00A0 It barely resembles its original form now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I won\u0027t put it past the detection and auto-adding of the DustFX module being the culprit here.\u00A0 It\u0027s possible that it\u0027s still adding multiple copies of the module to a part, though I have no idea why it would still be doing that.\u00A0 Can anyone confirm that removing the definition for that module from the part file fixes the issue?\u00A0 If so, I\u0027ll put extra effort into disabling the auto-detection and adding of the module from the KFModuleWheel code and see if I can get it to function with a part-based definition again.\u00A0 In that case, you won\u0027t want to remove it from the files anymore, and if you still want it turned off you\u0027ll use the GUI option I made available to disable it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best theory right now is that everything \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E working as intended, but it\u0027s working \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E well.\u00A0 if the DustFX detection system in KFModuleWheel is failing to detect it properly when initializing the part, or is trying to detect it before the DustFX module has been initialized by the flight scene, then it is trying to add it a second time.\u00A0 When you pause, the first of the modules properly sets the pause state for the module.\u00A0 The second module updates itself in the mean time and detects that it doesn\u0027t have the paused variable set, and so continues doing its thing.\u00A0 The KFModuleWheel module continues to make calls to the DustFX module it thinks is the proper one, which is the one it added when it couldn\u0027t find the original one, and that module happily keeps on deploying particles to a paused game, which causes the game to not remain paused.\u00A0 From there, all hell beaks loose and you get these erroneous paused-but-not-paused states for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan now is to start working on the code again over the next few weeks and try to get this thing properly rebooted sometime before the holidays kick into gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for MM patches in general, I don\u0027t think spaces in the \u003Cem\u003Efile name\u003C/em\u003E are a concern here.\u00A0 Your file name can be anything you like as long as it\u0027s a legal file name for KSP to load.\u00A0 What matters is what is in the config node itself.\u00A0 Once the file is read by KSP, the file name no longer matters.\u00A0 As far as this related to KF, I\u0027d suggest you be careful with that.\u00A0 Once I get this all ironed out, you\u0027ll want to leave the DustFX module in the part files alone because I\u0027ll have togglable in-game and hopefully not doubling itself or breaking paused states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222320316\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022121236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449970193\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147594\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CommanderSpock\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/12/2015, 5:29:53, CommanderSpock said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit does for me.

dependencies/conflicts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere used to be a Beta_19.b(typo) on KS, which set the major version to 19, so ckan was ignoring the latter versions like 1.9defg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, you deleted that release version off KS altogether, after which I asked for the epoch (invisible thing before major version) to be bumped in CKAN, so everyone who had the 19.b installed would still receive the auto-update to now objectively latest 1.9g (and whatever else you next plan to release in the same

taught me one valuable lesson.\u00A0 I\u0027m not ready for the big time when it comes to mods.\u00A0 Put plainly... I\u0027m burnt out.\u00A0 in fact, I think I burned out around the same time lo-fi did.\u00A0 So here\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking... there are a lot of talented modders out there who have the skills in both modelling and plugin development to make this thing shine.\u00A0 I\u0027m simply too focused on my education right now to be that person... and, besides that, I have nothing to bring in the modeling department beyond removing objects that are unnecessary from RAM hogging models and some simply re-texturing (recoloring really, and crappily done too) here and there.\u00A0 So... with the approval of lo-fi, if he\u0027s concerned with it at all, in the basket... I would be willing to pass everything i have to such an individual who is qualified and not burnt out on KSP at the moment... with just one catch.\u00A0 I don\u0027t want to simply pass it on and go my separate way.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to maintain access to the project so that I can make some of my still-brewing ideas see the light.\u00A0 I joined this project when I simply wouldn\u0027t go away (not that anyone was asking me to) and it\u0027s become a pretty solid part of my KSP identity.\u00A0 DustFX was, while a derivative work based on CollisionFX, a labor of love so to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also watch a lot of YouTube stuff these days which, in a few cases, has featured parts from this mod and I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want to maintain support for those who do that sort of thing.\u00A0 I absolutely love watching \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBilly Winn Jr\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and I know he has a love for KF tracks and those smaller little wheels (I think they\u0027re literally called \u0022small wheel\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a number of concerns I have with features of KF right now interacting with the game environment as it stands in 1.0.5.\u00A0 Water is now more... um... liquid?\u00A0 I imagine, if someone were to activate repulsors while under the water and attempt to rise, impact with the invisible water slider would happen near the surface and cause some issues.\u00A0 Especially since I don\u0027t think it truly goes away if you disable the repulsors again, nor does it take into consideration your floating depth when sitting on the surface which could cause the slider to spawn inside the craft if it floats really low in the water and cause some spectacular unplanned dis-assemblies.\u00A0 Also, now that one can easily scrape the bottom of the ocean, I\u0027m unsure how the dust will function.\u00A0 The camera method of grabbing the colors may not react too well to the water color or the light conditions under the water and, to provide support for water-surface dust (spray... sorta...), I actually have a hard-coded color override for the water-covered regions of the planet (whichever it may be) which will likely override the sample from the under-water surface.\u00A0 There\u0027s also the pause-thingie to deal with, and various other things including tech-tree and mod distribution that I simply never had any interest in supporting.\u00A0 Finally... KSP\u0027s move to Unity 5 looms in the distance, which could screw everything over royally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, I still want to see these useful features made more common in the KSP world which means creating some way that other plugins can reference KF and extend it for other projects.\u00A0 These are things I work on as I learn how it works in school... but it\u0027s a slow process because my mind works out various ideas quicker than the educational material becomes available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m putting this out there.\u00A0 I\u0027m not going away permanently anytime soon, but I can\u0027t be as active as a mod author should be.\u00A0 Something like KF should be given far more attention than I can give it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T20:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already guessed it\u0027ll be like that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuring the time I programmed a bit for KF I saw you jumping\u00A0at every issue, bug, etc. This kind of affection coupled with a few programming difficulties and at the end being the only dev can cause a lot of stress.
