Edison was still a great inventor. In fact the story about Edison conning Tesla out of money is not verified and most likely utter bull****. And remember, While Edison may have been wrong regarding DC over AC (which turned out to work well for certain cases), Tesla didn\u0027t believe in the Theory of Relativity. Both people had their faults. Another example, Edison refused to ever make an invention that would be used for war, whereas Tesla at some times seemed almost obsessed with it. I like Tesla, I do, but to say yay for him, but screw Edison is wrong, short-sighted and moronic. And don\u0027t try to defend your view as most people on the internet do when caught in something they thought they knew about but actually don\u0027t, cause I will tear any argument apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokker","CreatedById":15359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T20:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022THX-1138\u0022 data-cite=\u0022THX-1138\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot really, Edison was mainly a businessman and secondly an innovator to the likes of Steve Jobs and/or Bill Gates. Tesla was the inventor and innovator way ahead of his time, something like an odd mix of Wozniak and Musk bundled into one person and then some! The real A-Hole during Tesla and Edison\u0027s time was J.P. Morgan, read about him and what he did to both of them!\u003Cp\u003EBy the way Bobcat, really appreciate your great efforts since the early days of your very first mod. Keep up the superb work. I am a big fan. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, last time i checked Edison has the 4th most patents of anyone in the world while Tesla has 1/10th the number as Edison. Tesla honestly did very little inventing, and like Edison, was mainly an innovator who\u0027s most common work was simply improving the work of Faraday. Overall, while some of Tesla\u0027s inventions/innovations were amazing and leaps and bounds ahead of his time, for the most part, he is somewhat overrated, mainly because the Internet loves to blow **** out of proportion. Was he great, yes, was he some amazing super genius who was always right and we would have teleporters and free energy if Edison didn\u0027t hold him back, no.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
