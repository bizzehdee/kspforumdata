Now again I ask, help me make Solaris Hypernautics even better! The mod has begun to mature, but it has plenty of room to grow and adapt. Feel free to throw around whatever ideas you have for the mod, though suggestions that have already been implimented will be ignored. And again, thanks for all the downloads guys!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-16T07:45:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2017 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Carbonjvd**\n  \nUpdated Another Long Overdue Version"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T18:28:29Z","Content":"Super fun mod! Just wanted to say thanks to you, and also curious if you had plans to at some point include a probe core/command module with particles included?"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T19:10:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been tinkering around with the idea for a little bit now. If it does get implimented, I may have them run on virtual particles. New ideas are always welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T21:18:38Z","Content":"I would definitely be ok with that. Would also like to see a larger command module with dust converter included if you did go forward, would be very useful!"},{"CreatedByName":"HANNIBALLA","CreatedById":129997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T09:05:57Z","Content":"First off, big fan of your mod. It\u0027s a lot of fun. I\u0027d like to suggest either tweak scale support or some smaller part variants. Like the VEX-Type Flux Magnetic-Drag Array. It would be awesome to have a smaller version of that."},{"CreatedByName":"Revenant503","CreatedById":130479,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T08:22:21Z","Content":"Lovely mod...the only thing I think it might need is CTT integration"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T08:44:25Z","Content":"@Revenant503 Though it doesn\u0027t have compatibility with CTT yet, it is almost completely integrated with ETT! Probus is the mastermind by that mod, which is better in my humble opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"Chase842","CreatedById":148989,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T16:58:57Z","Content":"First off, I love this mod, and I don\u0027t know how I ever lived without it before. Hats off to ya!\n\n   I\u0027d to make a suggestion to change the magnetic \u0022Arcturus\u0022 engine and its 3.75m variant(forgot the name), into a hybrid engine that uses electric charge, magnetic charge, and liquid fuel. While in it\u0027s liquid fuel hybrid mode, the engine should consume magnetic charge at the same rate at which it can be recharged, or allow for a part to transfer magnetic charge into the engine. I don\u0027t like the idea of having unlimited fuel, assuming you have the parts for generating virtual particles and magnetic charge, and I think there is a better way to balance it, instead of setting it so you can only use it for a few seconds before it has to recharge. You can leave that mode \n\nThis engine looks way too cool to only be used for niche purposes. I\u0027d like to see this engine see more uses through adding versatility or a completely new magnetic engine altogether(using the same model, and textures though).\n\n     - For balancing and so the engine doesn\u0027t feel like cheating, I would suggest making the \u0022Arcturus\u0022 engine and its 3.75m variant (again forgot the name) have an ASL of 800-1000(or close to the Ra engine) and roughly 5500 isp in a vacuum, wherever in liquid fuel hybrid mode.\n\n     - Also for balancing while in hybrid mode, I think the Arcturus should have a bit more thrust than it currently has, but its 3.75m variant should have a lot less thrust.\n\n   I love the way the Arcturus engine looks, it looks so great as my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s main engines, but I never use this engine because it runs out of magnetic charge way to fast, and can\u0027t be replenished by other parts. I think it is too niche, and can be made into a more versatile and balanced engine. I can\u0027t remember right now(i\u0027m at work) but I don\u0027t think it has sound, like most engines from this mod. If someone could give me a quick crash course on how to add sound, and knows some good sounds to go with these engines, I\u0027ll do that too! I\u0027m a little obsessed with building my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E right now, and I think these changes would make this engine a great \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E engine.\n\n   I know how to edit some XML stuff at a novice level(idk if it\u0027s an XML type thing or similar), so if you point me in the right direction and tell me a little what to do, I\u0027m sure I can make this change for you if you\u0027d like. Although I am pretty bad at balancing in games, so I would need someone to help me with the numbers.\n\n     A separate suggestion is to make a smaller/more compact variant of the magnetic drag array(awesome idea btw). This way I could cleverly place them on an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E reentry with realistic atmospheres and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E!\n\n    Let me know what you think about my suggestions and if you could show me how to make the changes, I\u0027ll do the work and test it out to see if it\u0027s balanced!"}]}
