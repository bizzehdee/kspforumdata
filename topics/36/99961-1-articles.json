There are multipliers for the contract\u0027s celestial body and for the contract prestige. The multipliers are applied regardless of the type of reward (so the same multipliers get applied for funds, science and reputation).

For many contracts, it\u0027s fairly easy to get a good idea of how much it will cost the player to meet the contract by just building the typical vessel(s) required to meet the contract in the VAB/SPH and looking at its cost. Obviously this approach is easier for a contract like \u0022launch a satellite in LKO\u0022 vs. \u0022build a massive Eve outpost\u0022. Use this number as a guide for the minimum reward that your contract should offer. I find it can be convenient to just apply a multiplier to this number to reach a possible value for the full reward. You can also use this as the contract advance.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer time commitment required\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother aspect to look at is - what is the real playing time commitment that is required of your player. It is \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eappropriate to give a 1,000,000 funds reward to the player for testing a part on the launch pad - as that takes about 5 seconds (and to the point above has a cost of zero funds because they can recover the vessel immediately). Because of this I consider the stock landed part test contract to pretty much be an exploit - there\u0027s no good gameplay reason to keep them. More appropriate is giving a large reward for something that takes the player a couple hours of gameplay time to accomplish - like launch a big station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EBalancing Science\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a lot of contracts, balancing science is easy. Set it to zero, and be done with it. The existing system of gathering science through experiments/crew reports is a much better gameplay mechanic for getting science. Also, as it stands science is reasonably easy to get - dumping a ton more into the players economy via contracts may not be desirable. If it makes sense to have science as part of the contract reward, then read on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ER\u0026amp;D Tech Unlocking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only use of science in game is unlocking tech (again, aside from horribly broken strategies, which I\u0027ll get to soon). So the best way to determine how much science to give is by looking at the tech tree and the approximate tech level a player using your contract should be at. The early nodes require 5-45 science - so unless you want the player to be able to unlock a lot of nodes from the one contract, keep the early contract science rewards low (20 or lower). The highest nodes in the tech tree cost 550 (or 1000 for the special nodes that aren\u0027t used in stock KSP) - so gives an upper limit for how much science should be rewarded - but I would argue that at that point in the game the player can get lots of science in other ways and doesn\u0027t need a ton from contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with funds, keep the player time investment in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EBalancing Reputation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation is easily the hardest thing to balance, for the following reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIts use in game is limited - better rep really only means more/better contracts get offered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe amount of reputation a player has is not made obvious to the player (the slider goes from -1000 to 1000)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe amount of reputation a player receives changes based on how much reputation they currently have. I don\u0027t have the formula handy, but if a player has 900 reputation, and you try to give them 100 more, they will end up with a total of 950 (or something like that). Effectively, a player can never reach 1000 (or -1000) reputation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStrategies are broken.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo because of all these factors, most players will see reputation as next to useless, and just apply it towards the \u002BFunds or \u002BScience strategies, thus ruining your careful efforts to balance Funds/Science. So my best advice - keep the reputation rewards low. Reputation has minimal gameplay impact and only ends up breaking the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFailure is not an Option\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe last thing to talk about is the contract failure values (for funds and reputation). I usually don\u0027t even bother. Most players will just quickload or revert, which gives very little purpose in attaching failure values to the contract. In fact, it just gives players \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Emore\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E of an incentive to \u003C/span\u003Equickload\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E/revert.

For example, a scenario where the player has two optional paths in a contract (perhaps implemented as two contracts where only one can actually be completed). Then the failure \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ebecomes tied to a player choice - rather than an excuse to quickload. This could also be used to give reputation a little bit more meaning.

(eg. stay in orbit with TAC-LS for 1 year, but launch other missions during that time). Then quickloading may not be an option. However, I\u0027d still consider this very carefully - the failure penalty may be viewed by the players as \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Epunishing\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E, and may turn them off of the contract completely.
