Any reference to \u0027speed\u0027 here refers to how much space is translocated, not velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can generate exotic matter through a lot of Gigantors. Kerbin to Duna without the generator running can be done on a single charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Secondary fuel tank is large, so you should not need to top off the xenon too often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If your warp bubble collapses, you will start stripping bits off of your ship, the severity of which is controlled by how \u0027fast\u0027 you were going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stuff outside the warp bubble will explode - both on your own ship and anything within a 2KM radius - if the bubble is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You may experience G forces and spinning as the drive shunts on and off, and G-force hiccups as you shunt into lightspeed. This is normal, be careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No energy is required to maintain the bubble (we assume the drive\u0027s built in reactors handle field setup), just EM for movement. Wanted to keep this simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, if you drop a reactor on this you can go almost indefinitely until the Xenon runs out. That\u0027s ok - it\u0027s by design, because for this drive, fuel conservation is not a factor in balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Default altitude cutoff is 500KM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should cover the bits for now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpan110","CreatedById":110778,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T14:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo here we go - it\u0027s done.
