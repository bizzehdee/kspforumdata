Looks very futuristic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch order of bombs and missiles can be manipulated. Think first in first out. For instance my B-2 had numerous bombs and missiles inside. But the first bombs dropped the mk-82\u0027s. Where the first bombs placed in the whole thing. Or the cruise missiles which were side by side. Again the first one fired was the first one placed. The other thing about the Skewer in the B-2 is each of the bomb standoffs where place individually by first. Building the skewer, then setting no limits on the Rotatron or the Uncontrolled Rotatron, but setting presets at 60 degree intervals from -180 to 180. Then cycle between the presets one at a time placing a payload of your choice with the angle snap tool on, from your start position to the final payload. Then in flight it will fallow the same sequence. So set your weapon manager on the first payload and it will automatically cycle to the next when you run out of bombs / missiles in that slot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a symmetrical payload of bombs or missiles this is far simpler. Just setup the skewer as stated above. Then simply place one bomb standoff with a payload of your choosing, under the skewer with radial symmetry turned on and 6 of them mirrored around the skewer. That\u0027s how my first B-2 with 6 cruise missiles was built. So the \u0022first\u0022 one placed will be the \u0022first\u0022 to fire. This would be the one exposed when the bay is open. Then between BD\u0027s bomb clearance check and the rotation of the skewer it works like a charm. If the firing order is reversed from the rotation of the skewer just invert your action group advance / return buttons and cycle it in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, if you want to post pictures and info about your plane you are working on.

At a quick glance it looks like there\u0027s a conflict between BDA and one of the mods or it could be something is up with modulemanager if you removed a mod. I would recommend a second KSP install if you can (don\u0027t delete your original KSP) and add BDA only - this is to check that BDA will work on your machine. Then add mods 2 at a time until it doesn\u0027t work; once you\u0027ve got the problem again, delete 1 of the two mods you just added to see which one is causing the conflict: if it works, then you know that the mod you removed is the culprit; if it doesn\u0027t then you know that the mod you kept is causing the problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T22:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dasoundofdapolice","CreatedById":148252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
