This will result in Kopernius using the textures of the templated planet for the scaledspace, and the scaledspace *only*, the actual surface will look different and will change upon arrival at the planet to the proper look.\n\nIn the config, begin adding PQSMods. All you need is one heightmod and one colormod. An example that would result in a Mun-like planet is the following construction:\n\n- VertexSimplexHeight\n\n- VertexHeightNoise\n\n- VoronoiCraters\n\n- VoronoiCraters\n\n- VertexSimplexHeightAbsolute\n\n- HeightColorMap\n\n- VertexSimplexNoiseColor\n\n- LandControl\n\nNow, if you\u0027ve coded a planet that shows up in-game, do the following: install HyperEdit and Kittopia. HyperEdit any probe to a low orbit around your planet. Open Kittopia with CTRL \u002B P, select your planet and, if necessary, start editing it. When you\u0027re happy with how it looks, press the \u0027save\u0027 button, this will generate a file in the KittopiaTech/Configs folder that, although it won\u0027t work when loaded, does contain the edited PQSMods, simply copy-n-paste those into your planet\u0027s \u0027actual\u0027 config. Next, you can ask Kopernicus to export the textures of your planet, which you can then find in KittopiaTech/Textures. Move the color and normal map over to your planet\u0027s mod folder and use those to update the scaledspace. You don\u0027t need the heightmap because the surface is already working properly.\n\nAnd that is how you make beautiful, stockalike, HD planets using only KSP.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Astrofox said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well, I am quite a noob at Kopernicus, and that\u0027s exactly why we had a dev team.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another reason for this is because I haven\u0027t seen updated tutorials on this in such a LONG time.\n\u003E \n\nWhich is why I wrote these guides:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129540-a-beginners-guide-to-kopernicus-the-basics/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131655-a-beginners-guide-to-kopernicus-gas-giant-edition/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132622-advanced-kopernicus-textures-from-pqsmods/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132484-a-beginners-guide-to-kopernicus-pqsmods/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThey\u0027ll teach you the basics of Kopernicus modding as well as the basics of procedural planet making."},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T21:47:48Z","Content":"I\u0027ve heard of it, but was never given proper instructions.
