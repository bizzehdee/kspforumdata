Both require knowledge of programming, which is all available through Google.\n\nAlso, the part you make needs textures (reading into development will mention this). Any image editing program will do. I personally recommend Paint.net, Inkscape, and GIMP. All of those are free.

New *PartTools* pack allows to create animations in Blender and import them into the game; but you\\\u0027ll need something to *trigger* these animations. E.g. v0.15 airplane landing gear is retracted/deployed in response to a key press; game code (or plugin) detects that user pressed a key, and launches an animation.\nSo, most likely, you\\\u0027ll need to learn C# programming language.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E and one last questin is .. whats the utility thing? is it needed to do parts? cuz thats only a windows program.\n\nUnity is the universal game engine *on which KSP is built upon.* Using [KSP PartTools for Unity](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11795.0) gives a full access to new v0.15 features like different materials, animations created in 3D modelling program, and such.\nBut you still can create parts *without* Unity, and implement all the animations programmatically, in C# plugin code (that\\\u0027s how all the *existing* plugins were made).
