I\u0027ve never done any work with the any of the planet mods but I did recognize some major typos that when corrected fixed most of the issues I\u0027ve experienced. amarius1, the most common problem with the configs I saw was having the wrong path/extension for the texture files. Quite often you\u0027ll refer to a png file when in actuality the file is a jpg. Also, as _Augustus_ mentioned, the file path for Lyvara\u0027s texture\u0027s were wrong.

Is this on purpose? Is the texture defined some other way that I\u0027m not seeing?
