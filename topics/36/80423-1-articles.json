I\u0027ve built enough code to know it\u0027s possible, but nothing close to ready for sharing. It strikes me that the contracts have created a few problems with the flow of career mode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience rewards have made it possible to mostly ignore science in order to fill out the tech tree. This wouldn\u0027t necessarily be bad, as it permits more playstyles, but because you must do some contracts in order to secure funds, it privileges a career where science gathering is deprecated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHaving to pay for each launch out of a stockpile means that players are penalized for trial-and-error, or for spreading a mission out into several launches. This restricts player choice for no good reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELikewise, paying for part recovery deprecates several previously viable (and perfectly \u0027realistic\u0027) design strategies, particularly expendable boosters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a brief discussion a couple weeks ago on the BTSM forum for ways to mitigate these weaknesses in the contract career mode flow. One excellent idea was that instead of players having a stockpile of funds that is depleted in order to buy rockets, they get a per-launch budget. (We considered a per-time-period budget, but this would be easily made useless by time-warp.) I\u0027m throwing this idea out to see if there\u0027s enough interest for me to devote any of my quite limited time to development. I envision a mod with the following features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENo science rewards for contracts - this is trivial to accomplish.

Building and launching rockets will not deplete the amount, but a rocket that costs more than the budget amount cannot be launched. (I\u0027ve implemented a rough version of this. It works, but it\u0027s slightly buggy still.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe fund budget can be increased by increasing reputation and by earning science.
