Will -I- be modeling them?  Not likely, at least not initially. \n\nI had briefly considered making an alternate propulsion module that was intended more for SSTO use; with a set of rapier/sabre/multimodal engines (and intakes in place of the OMS pods)... but then realized that I\u0027m still not sure if I\u0027m even progressing with the shuttle stuff -- had to make so many compromises just to get it usable... the entire situation leaves me feeling a bit... bitter.  Such as having to split the propulsion module off at all... there is no legitimate reason that should have been needed.  It was only needed to compensate for the buggy method that stock uses to calculate the gimbal direction; using the parts origin location compared to vessel COM rather than the gimbal transforms origin location compared to vessel COM.  Same with the wings tail, and control surfaces... there is no legitimate reason why they should need to be separate parts -- only because of bugs and poor aero \u0027guesstimation\u0027 of stock (that would be a \u0027simulation\u0027 that \u0027guesses\u0027 instead of simulates; maybe I expect too much that a physics simulator actually \\_simulate\\_ physics).  Heck, there is no legitimate reason why this -shouldn\u0027t- work as a single-part craft; only poor and/or buggy implementations in un-moddable and un-fixable areas of the game.  Going to stop now before I work myself up and decide not to finish those parts, or get myself banned for saying unkind things.....\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ah, I didn\u0027t see that.

It was initially implemented this way, but was causing null-refs during a GetComponent\u003Cmoduleengines\u003E() call -- so I couldn\u0027t even -test- if the engine module was null (would crash while trying to find the module; probably because the event was being called while the module was in the process of being added, this was during an OnEditorShipModified event callback during vessel creation/load).\n\u003C/moduleengines\u003E\n\nWill take another pass over it, but not sure of any other non-tick-based way of doing it (options are Events for event-based, or Update/LateUpdate/FixedUpdate for update-tick based; I try and stay away from tick-based stuff unless absolutely necesary)."},{"CreatedByName":"Joco223","CreatedById":92530,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T16:54:51Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Everything expect the landers.
