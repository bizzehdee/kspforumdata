One large continent stretches from the north pole to the south pole. Ecosystems range from tropical rain forest to arid grassland and frozen tundra.

What used to be a cold red planet is, well, slightly less so. Katney, named after Mark Katney (a famous Kerbonaut who survived being stranded on Duna for over a year), has a moderately-thick atmosphere with oxygen and water present at the surface due to a comfortable temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. While\u00A0Katney currently holds no lifeforms, it may very well do so in the future. The conditions are near perfect, all it takes now is the right trigger and plenty of time.

Pol heated up from the combination of Tidal forces and Jool\u0027s light. Pol is\u00A0heavily volcanic, so although beautiful as this\u00A0moon may be, life will of course never be possible here.

A layer of single-celled photosynthetic organisms covers the entire surface of the planet, giving it a uniform appearance and a vivid green color.

While life will never be possible on Tylo, it does offer a unique sight in the night sky of the rest of Jool\u0027s nearby moons.

As for compatibility, it\u0027s a simple fix any user can do (as this is how I learned the basic mechanics of Kopernicus). The reason why no other planet packs work with KGR is the fact that the \u0022sun\u0022 is the black hole, thus re-pairing Kerbol to orbit the \u0022sun\u0022 makes it a planet to the games code, the planets are moons, etc. The way to fix it is to go into the .ini file for a body, and change the body it orbits from = Sun, to = Kerbol. This should fix any problems with planets orbiting EXTREMLY close to the black hole instead of around Kerbol. (And make sure to put other mods later in the load list than KGR!) Also I plan to make two versions of the mod - one with stock bodies and one with my modifications to them.
