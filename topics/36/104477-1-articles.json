Since every scene change requires saving and loading everything in your save file, which can get really big when you start piling on addons, this can be very slow.\n\nBuildings like the R\u0026D center, the astronaut complex, or the strategy building are OK, since you don\u0027t normally need to interact with these during a mission. But the Mission Control building is something you might need to get to while in flight, or even in the tracking station.\n\nI\u0027ve created a working backbone for a Mission Control UI that can be accessed from the Space Center, Tracking Station, or while in flight. It tracks all offered, active, and complete contracts, and adds any newly offered contracts to its list. The basic idea is to create something similar to the Mission Control center (along with a few improvements, like sorting, hiding those nonsense briefings, etc...) that you can access anywhere. I\u0027m not sure if it will work properly in the VAB/SPH, since vessels and Celestial Bodies aren\u0027t loaded in that scene.\n\nSource for the project can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/CapCom).\n\nThe project is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T15:38:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**\n  \nKey change"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:48:12Z","Content":"This is a great mod!

It\u0027s nice to be able to play the game without dealing with the abysmal loading times in the middle of a mission, just because I forgot to add an objective.\n\nHowever, you may want to make a note suggesting to players who frequently hit the memory limit to not use this mod for the time being. Because of the way Unity handles loading and unloading of resources, the scene changes de-allocate the memory used to store assets and other such things. Due to the memory leaks in the present version of the game, staying with your spacecraft for an extended period of time may result in crashes that otherwise wouldn\u0027t have happened - a good amount of the leaked memory that would be freed up by the scene change will no longer get freed up."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T05:22:37Z","Content":"An early build is available for download and testing now, get it on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/CapCom/releases/tag/v0.1).\n\nThe core functionality appears to be working, but there are several features missing, in addition to the list of planned features in the first post.\n\nBlizzy78\u0027s toolbar is not currently supported, there is no ability to re-size the window, or any of the UI content.
