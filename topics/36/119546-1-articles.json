After some discussion with mariohm1311 (who will now be working with me) on this thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132120-1-0-4-Mk3-Hypersonic-Scramjet-update%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132120-1-0-4-Mk3-Hypersonic-Scramjet-update%21\u003C/a\u003E and some questions kindly answered by Porkjet, I decided it was necessary to tweak some of the parameters on the scramjet. First of all it had to be much more massive, to fit with the predicted performance of actual scramjets. But also, and perhaps more importantly, it was necessary to shrink the velCurve, since mach numbers in Kerbin are a much larger fraction of orbital velocity than they are on earth. It\u0027s now very hard to go past mach 7 with large Mk3 planes (which is what it was designed for, after all), even if the engine itself is designed to operate at higher speeds.
