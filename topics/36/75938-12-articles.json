There is no net translation force on the vessel, the outside wheel increases its force on the ground, and the body of the vessel rolls towards the inside wheel. To check, this is the same net result as increasing the spring force? I think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m away from my development computer, but looking through the unity scripting API, there\u0027s an attachedRigidBody member of WheelCollider. I think for all intents and purposes that\u0027s the same as the main part collider. If you add a force to the attachedRigidBody and an equal and opposite to a force added to WheelCollder.collider (or whatever the actual wheelcollider is), this should produce the anti-roll behavio(u)r you\u0027re looking for.

As I thin I mentioned before, the repulsors were born out of my work with wheels and a silly forum conversation. I had _no_ idea how popular they (or any of the bits I\u0027ve been playing with) would be, I just posted up with the wheels because I thought it was a goofy enough to be fun(ny)! There are some custom collider projects in Unity, but I\u0027ve seen none that are ready to be pugged in and \u0027just work\u0027 and I\u0027m not experienced enough to write from scratch yet.
