The issue itself is odd, because it manifests differently depending on how you flip and scroll through the editor tabs; sometimes a part-icon will get cropped, sometimes not; leaving the editor and re-entering, and performing a different set of actions with the editor tabs and scrolling will manifest in a different set of parts being effected.
