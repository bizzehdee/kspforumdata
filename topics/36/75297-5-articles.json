Tried these out extensively. Absolutely love the ultralight (have one running off a firespitter propeller and fusion power pushing me well past 0.5 mach and it weighs less than 3000 kg). Still trying to think of a design where the Cyclops (larger) pod would be useful but that\u0027s more a lack of creativity on my end than anything wrong with this mod. (replacement cupola perhaps? It only having a bottom node feels weird to me) Also the pictures here don\u0027t do these justice; the emissives at night are gorgeous.

Interior lighting is quite dim still, I need to adjust the lights a bit more. The RPM is dim intentionally and is lit with interior lights during night time. Alternative is setting the rendering to emissive layer, which works well at night, but is overblown during the day time. Not an issue with OpenGL. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I think I can find a decent compromise with interior lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to have to roll back on the number of RPM driven gauges and revert to stock dials and the like. The frame rate drop is too much. If I have 1 of each transparent pod in the scene, frame rate is acceptable, only after a very long initial load time, during time warp the frame drops below 10fps. 4 panopticon pods will crash the game with KSP complaining about too many internals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have another dev version out tomorrow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shad0wCatcher","CreatedById":98819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T04:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally?
