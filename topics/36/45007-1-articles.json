Some people are all about engines, others about awesome lifters and I\u0027m crazy for command modules. I use the mk1-2 pod for pretty much anything and I figured out what bothers me about it - it\u0027s not symmetrical and attaching radial parachutes to it makes it look unseemly. The Apollo project is probably my favorite spacecraft of them all so I\u0027ve set out to make myself a replacement and I\u0027ll be looking for help because I have no idea how to do some stuff and I could use an opinion on others. Side note - I\u0027m not making a perfect replica of the Apollo craft, close enough is good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I have so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2l8yTFv.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u00222l8yTFv.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not yet textured and detail hasn\u0027t been added for normal mapping because I still have to get it in the game to see how it fits with other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a pretty long to do list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Test it in game, as it is right now, it will probably comfortably fit a junior docking port, but I\u0027m not sure, would I be better off making a new docking port that fits on top and make it behave like a standard docking port for stability and usability?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Model in details for the normal map and figure out how to make the door a crew hatch in Unity. Also, can Kerbals latch onto the handles over there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Create a texture for it. I suck at it and will probably take me just shy of forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Turn the \u0022cap\u0022 into a LES and figure out how to make it work in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The docking port cover is planned to be an actual parachute - if it\u0027s possible to make a single part have three canopies that work well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Can I make it have a flag decal in the back? That\u0027d be neat, but I\u0027m not sure what I need for it, I believe it\u0027s an extra mesh that has to be either a part of the model or added on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maybe make a decoupler that fits well into the heatshield, but I\u0027d also like to keep part inflation low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll most likely take me a while to get everything done because I\u0027m new to anything more advanced than getting a simple model into KSP but I\u0027d love to hear your advice on stuff like the docking port and parachutes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H25XaDv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H25XaDv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T12:22:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ledenko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T11:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the Orion capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CERVERUS","CreatedById":15589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T12:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs nice,and i am crazy and fan of command pods too,but i believe like this is so usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an alternative suggestion if you care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood begining my friend! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://falsesteps.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/fuji-cm.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://falsesteps.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/fuji-cm.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.shokabo.co.jp/author/8758/fujicore2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.shokabo.co.jp/author/8758/fujicore2.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T12:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CERVERUS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synthesis","CreatedById":26557,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T15:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks good so far, have you given any consideration for IVA/interior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, you\u0027ve mentioned having a heat shield--I\u0027d recommend a unique decoupler that makes it fit well with K\u0026amp;W, but it\u0027s your decision of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T16:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds promising if you can get the textures and IVA right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone is asking for their favourite pod instead... but what I\u0027m going to suggest is, endeavour to only have three parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECapsule with integrated docking port, compatible with stock size1, integrated parachutes, integrated RCS (Apollo command module had it\u0027s own RCS!).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELaunch escape tower to match with integrated decoupler.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHeat shield with integrated decoupler on both sides if you want it to be detachable.

Drag coefficient translates into an actual drag loss depending on mass of the part.

If the parachutes are integrated in the pod itself, this can look silly. You can move the 0,0,0 by using MODEL {} node, and you can move CoM by using CoMOffset config parameter, but neither option might be ideal for other reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ledenko","CreatedById":57833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T08:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a feeling the docking port bit would be easy, I just passed out before I could test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the parachute...
