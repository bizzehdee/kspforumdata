A great example of that is Tiberion\u0027s NovaPunch tanks and stack decouplers, which are all over this in six or seven sizes. But there\u0027s only four different textures for the tanks and one for the stack decouplers, so a few cfg\u0027s here and there are all that\u0027s needed. I would be able to condense it all down to a certain minimum mass, it wouldnt be rediculous, but I cant give you an exact parts count right this moment.
