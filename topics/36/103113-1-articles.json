Go to the new thread:https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114618-0-90-shipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-IVA-Sound-Effects-v0-1?p=1817770#post1817770[**http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114618-0-90-shipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-IVA-Sound-Effects-v0-1**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114618-0-90-shipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-IVA-Sound-Effects-v0-1)\n\nHello! I\u0027m a new lad in the forums, for weeks I\u0027ve been reading pizzaoverhead\u0027s thread [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55227-Kerbal-Sound-Overhaul-Project](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55227-Kerbal-Sound-Overhaul-Project) . And I was eagerly waiting for someone to step up and do the interior dynamic sound effects \u0022ship stress sounds due to g-force, creates creaks, rattles, vibrations and alike\u0022\n\nI couldn\u0027t wait so I did it myself. I\u0027m a newbie programmer but with a little bit of reading and reference I figure\u0027d it out. It works by using the gforce data and converting that to be a usable dynamic volume control.\n\nCurrently working on some sound assets and mainly focused in IVA.\n\n**UPDATE(04.02.15):**\n\nFinished editing and creating the sound assets! Going to work on the plugin now and will rewrite it as well.\n\n**Download** \n\nsource included | licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4jqumjcppiwwif/%5BWIP0.9%5DShipEffectsSoundMod.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4jqumjcppiwwif/%5BWIP0.9%5DShipEffectsSoundMod.zip?dl=0)\n\nJust extract the folder inside gamedata\n\nHere\u0027s a video demo:\n\n[http://youtu.be/mYwNFhj0wyo](https://youtu.be/mYwNFhj0wyo)\n\nBest experience if combined with these mods: KerbQuake, Atmospheric Sound Enhancement, CollisionFX and FAR/NEAR(MORE GFORCE YAY!)\n\nIf someone could help me with the programming, that\u0027d be great! It\u0027ll enable me to focus more on the soundeffects sampling myself.\n\n**Future Plans**\n\n**Situations:**\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Low Gforce\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Mid Gforce\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 High Gforce\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joint Stress Light\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joint Stress Heavy\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Engine Thrust\n\n**Layering** (add on top of sound base (light) to create variaty):\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Medium Mass Layer\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Heavy Mass Layer\n\n**Possible Layers of sounds:**\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Low rattles - *done, only a rattle to be used both for low and high intensities*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Vibrations - *done*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Window shakes - *done, part of vibrations*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Heavy Rattling - *done, same asset for low rattles*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Flexing/Stressed Sounds - *done(no flexing sounds yet)*\n\nSound are Loops, We could add more final random chances of sounds during situations ontop of base sounds to randomize the sound.\n\nMight give an exception to Joint Stresses they may fire only once the conditions are met.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T17:34:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T10:15:27Z","Content":"Hi ensouensou, and welcome aboard!
