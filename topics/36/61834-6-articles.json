Yet history shows us this only gets you to a certain point. There comes a time you will only learn more by putting men or machines on the ground - or at least close by. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe examples you give illustrate that beautifully. Venera landers 3 through 6 were designed with a hull strength of 25 atm and subsequently, they all failed upon entering the atmosphere (although 5 and 6 were relabeled as atmospheric probes). It was not until the Mariner 5 probe did close up measurements that we realized that Venus has a surface pressure in the realm of 75-100 atm, a lot more than anyone expected. Not only did we learn about the circumstances on Venus by sending probes there, these first probes were in fact ill equipped to deal with the Venusian atmosphere. They were built to our best knowledge, which turned out to be not so good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for the first Martian probes. We had some rough ideas what to expect, but a lot of it came down to an educated guess. It was not until we sent some probes there that we got a better idea of surface pressure and temperatures, water content and more basic stuff like that. You mention Curiosity, but that is of course a rover that has greatly benefited from previous missions. I doubt that such a complex undertaking would be possible without prior knowledge - and thus measurements - of local circumstances. Let us not forget that about 60% of Mars missions failed, most of which in the earlier years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this makes me feel that surface pressure is a magic number provided to the player. Let us not forget that we are dealing with an in-game universe similar to our 50\u0027s or 60\u0027s. In real life, our discoveries and knowledge were hard won and I feel it should be not different in the KSP universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I try to do all my measurements myself - even stuff like Kerbin weight and size - but I do very much understand that this is not for everyone.

You don\u0027t have to go pull up the info tab in the map view if you don\u0027t want to, but it\u0027s there for players that do want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that you\u0027re asking for everyone to have to play it your way. There is nothing about having the data there that stops you from playing it your way by just not using it. There IS something about insisting that it be removed that DOES prevent others from playing it their way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t agree with the idea that kOS should never incorporate any information from the later days of the space program, because Sandbox mode exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you feel about this idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Sandbox mode, the body database has everything fully populated up front, because, hey, it\u0027s sandbox mode where the presumption is your space program has hit the top of the tech tree and knows everything already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in Career mode, the body database masks off some of the data, but detects when it\u0027s been measured by you in game and flags something inside kOS to remember that you\u0027ve already gotten the measurement for it already, and then allows it to become unlocked after that (*). Thus the code would work properly and cleanly, and represent that your space agency has updated the data in the database like they *would*, rather than stubbornly insisting that the database must be frozen and never be added to and any new information needs to be put in a new, second database, which makes for ridiculous code. If this was done, it would be ridiculous, and incorrect, to assume the space agency knows nothing about the mass of a body or its radius and its orbital parameters and position data before sending a probe. Those are learned BY watching the planet from afar - it\u0027s mass being deduced from the effect its gravity has on the motion of other things, it\u0027s radius being deduced from the angle in the field of vision it takes up at a known distance, and so on. Even the atmosphere IS known to some extent beforehand - just not precisely. (It\u0027s not like they were expecting Venus to be barren without air.) So to simulate this you have the data produced by the body atmosphere database be present but imprecise and \u0022wiggly\u0022 until after the probe was sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above may be too much work to implement, but if it is, then erring on the side of giving too much information is less ridiculous than erring on the side of hiding known information that the space agency already has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*) If this was done, perhaps the way to detect that the information is already learned is to just hook into the science experiment logs. The game already tracks whether or not you\u0027ve done a particular experiment before and gotten information back about it, so you look for things like \u0022obtained barometric pressure reading from Eve\u0027s surface\u0022 in the science logbook to decide whether or not that data is available in BODY:ATM or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would satisfy your complaint without adding the annoying insistence that the BODY database must be implemented entirely out in the script language with each user having their own different set of function calls for doing it. See, I like sharing code, and I\u0027d much rather be able to say \u0022here\u0027s a neat program I want to show off, and it will run in sandbox mode, or in career mode if you have previously visited Eve and taken a pressure reading from its surface\u0022 than have to say \u0022along with this program you must also get my own body database because there is no standard for how to do that so you need my body database too and even if you made your own it probably doesn\u0027t have the same interface as mine does so it won\u0027t work with my code.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I am 100% convinced would happen if you removed the BODY database from kOS: the user community would replace this lack by sharing their own community-made body database instead of each user making their own, putting things right back where they were before. Why am I convinced this would happen? Because I\u0027d do it. I was on the verge of doing it before when Kevin went AWOL and I waited to see if kOS had a future before deciding to do it, and then erendrake\u0027s version clearly was heading toward having a fully populated BODY database so I stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T09:46:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 09:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T15:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo im ready to release v0.11.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis release is mainly about Direct flight control, and enabling autonomous docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/erendrake/KOS/releases/tag/v0.11.1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/erendrake/KOS/releases/tag/v0.11.1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will go up on spaceport soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T05:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m happy to see thrust limiters implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWRT docking scripts, is there already a way of getting the relative situation of targeted docking ports?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T07:25:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
