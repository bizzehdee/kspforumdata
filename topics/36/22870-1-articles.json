Keep the shape inside of the trusses/struts as it is now. No need for animations, just a simple part. If the user is able to create the texture of the inside by himself, you have a magical part which can be used for several purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several useful mods which require a \u0027specialised\u0027 part, f.e. battery, reactor, RTG, instrumentpackage, SAS, ASAS etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffcourse everybody can ask you to create a new part for every specialised function. It requires (a lot of) time and work. The endresult will be a large number of parts which will need support and maintenance. My reasoning was: Create a small part which every user can modify to his liking by changing the (inside) texture and the part.cfg. It will make the Tri-Hexagonal Structural Strut concept much more flexible. Take f.e. The BFT mod. All shapes are the same, the texture is slightly different (the color of a stripe), only the part.cfg\u0027s are different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tallinu","CreatedById":57810,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T09:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Semni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Semni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey are not shown for ... no particular reason because I am a derp.
