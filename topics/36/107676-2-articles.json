If you have time, can you point me the code line and the file?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have a companion project called the Solar Sail Flight School to explain the physical principals of solar sailing. I agree that this plugin assumes a lot of knowledge in its current form. It\u0027s similar to how professionals plot trajectories. What do you think about adding some tutorial features, like I have in the flight school? A realistic attitude control mode, with solar torque, is another possibility. [http://flightschool.solarsails.info](http://flightschool.solarsails.info)\n\nNice page you have there. You are a solar sail fan or you work with something related?\n\nIn that tutorial is not mention how the solar sail move and how to realize the most basic maneuvers. I can try to make a resume if you want. About a realistic attifude control mode sound great, but not sure how much time would take to the sails to turn, those are days that may change severely your preditions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m working on some illustrations to explain the reference frames and angles. The \u0022Cone\u0022 and \u0022Clock\u0022 angle are common terms used by pros. They are relative to the frame described here (though, mine are a little different). \u0022Clock\u0022 rotates about the position vector of the sail from the sun. \u0022Cone\u0022 then rotates about the orbit normal vector (after it\u0027s been rotated by the \u0022Clock\u0022. I\u0027ll add more illustrations soon. [https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Reference-Frames](https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Reference-Frames)\n\nYeah I saw that in solar sails books, you can extract the same image from those, they have a better perspective were is easier to understand the reference frame.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I like to allow up to 90 degrees Cone angle, because it lets you \u0022turn off\u0022 the sail without retracting it. When building trajectories, you want to flexibility to dramatically reduce thrust, so that you end up in the right place. The example trajectory I have in the tutorial goes up to 75 degrees cone angle. [https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Trajectory-planning](https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Trajectory-planning)\n\nOk, so you use higher angles as a way to \u0022throttle down\u0022 instead add 90^o^ sections on the orbit?\n\nI hope you can find moders willing to help you with the new parts or models that you may need in the future.\n\nTake care..

Generally, you just need to numerically integrate the force equation of a sail. The logarithmic spiral is the rare case of an analytical solution. Unfortunately, it\u0027s not very useful.

It would work by calculating the optimal sail angle for maximizing the change in semimajor axis, inclination, eccentricity, etc. There are analytical solutions for those steering strategies.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah that, and some intermediate tutorial resume about how a solar sails work..

Seems CKAN only looked at the first folder (SolarSailNavigator) in the .zip file.

Do you have Module Manager installed?

I appreciate suggestions on making this easier to use. I\u0027ll put those on my \u0022TODO\u0022 list.
