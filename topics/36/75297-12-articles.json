I\u0027ll keep you posted on my progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Works like a charm! The only thing I might struggle with is breaking the symmetry in the editor so the arms can be changed independently, but I have one or two ideas for that. If there\u0027s a mod that gives you toggleable in-flight CoT/CoM gizmo\u0027s, that would be the icing on the cake too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGotta say, it\u0027s absolutely stunning in-game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of adding multimode engine for either LF/OX or Mono fuel option. is that gonna interfere with your plugin? I\u0027m also thinking of MM patch for KSPI mechanics... not sure how it\u0027s gonna go with Radiator, Reactor, and nozzle modules all in one part... guess we\u0027ll find out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T18:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, unless it\u0027s messing with animations anything is fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E multi mode would be really cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T01:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool.

They extend out to the point you\u0027ve set, scroll in and out within limits when you mess with the slider, and retract back from wherever they are left. You could probably do all kinds of other crazy stuff with animations rigged and driven like this - it\u0027s certainly going to open up some cool options for landing legs and landing gear \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a little caught up playing with symmetry shenanigans, but I\u0027ll get the group system and some action groups sorted and get something back over to you for testing very soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving an engine has a pretty powerful effect on the CoT btw, it\u0027s really cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T01:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edag nabbit lo-fi, you never cease to amaze.
