I really do wish they would have just held out and finished off 1.1 (rather than doing all the prep/experimentals work on 1.05), as the community needs 64-bit far more than it needed whatever changes came with 1.05.

Less detailed (though, that could be a good thing), smaller (e.g. not 64% scale), and less powerful. Also continues the stock inaccuracies regarding engine geometry, with its complete lack of upper-end/combustion chamber, and poor representation of the gimbal mechanics (it doesn\u0027t pivot in the right place, or even close to it; the pivot should be at the top of the MCC, NOT halfway down the bell).  \n\nNothing stopping you from making your own engine clusters using the stock KS-25 though.

Also the overall function is not quite up to the same level as the rest of my part. I already have it scheduled for a refresh/rebuild, but it will be awhile before I can get around to it (likely sometime in like Feb. of 2016).  \n\nGeneral question --  \n\nHow does the thrust feel on the RL10 engines?   \n\nThey seem a bit... underwhelming to me; though, it really is a fairly tiny engine IRL. Still thinking I might do another 10-20% buff on the LH2 engines thrust across the board.
