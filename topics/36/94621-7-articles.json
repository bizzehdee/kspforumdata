I might look at it later, but just as with proposals about more properties and more fine-grained control over various parts of the wings (like separate configuration of top/bottom leading/trailing edge surfaces), I need to figure a way to radically rework the UI first - otherwise I risk making UI an unreadable mess of endless properties that is hard to use efficiently.
