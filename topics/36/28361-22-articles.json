Neither name is particularly clear on the purpose. Logistics tends to refer to coordination of many people or things, and we don\u0027t really have a concept like that in the game. Mission Control is where all logistics takes place, really. I think I would just call it \u0027Storage\u0027 and \u0027Life Support\u0027. Anyone that wants to use TAC or any other life support extension of the game would just add it into that module anyway, so I think eventually it will become that as Squad adds it to the game. NASA would call them Logistics and Utilities, but that\u0027s really just so things sound better when they talk to Congress about money.
