Lower, Intertank, and Upper sections all configurable independently.  Select the intertank you want to use, then select the length of the upper and lower tank segments -- basically a \u0027build your own ratio\u0027 type setup.  Potentially requires a few more button clicks to get to the desired tank configuration, but might offer more overall options/combinations.  Also uses more of the \u0027module\u0027 slots for fuel tank models, leaving only the basic \u0027nose/mount\u0027 slots for adapter options.  \n\n2.) Single \u0027tank\u0027 model with pre-built ratios (defined in config files).  Select your tank variant (hydro, cryo, kero, etc..) to specify the ratio, then select the tank length.  This is basically how the tanks are setup in current releases (but here will likely be a few more ratio options due to how easy they will be to create).  Potentially requires fewer clicks to select your tank setup.  Also leaves two more \u0027module\u0027 slots for extra adapter/etc model options.\n\nFor awhile I was leaning towards #1 for the greater level of configurability.  But even I am not sure I want to do a bunch of extra configuration when I just want \u0027a fuel tank\u0027.  The setups are not mutually exclusive either -- it is simply a method for how the configs would be structured and how the UI would be used, and both methods could actually be used in a single part (though I will likely stick to one or the other for consistency).  Perhaps going with the simpler setup (#2) in the beginning, but offer an optional \u0027advanced\u0027 mode patch sometime down the road?\n\nAnyhow, wrapping up the new fuel tank modeling bits now -- working on the AO bakes, and will likely be running the new models through PartTools over the weekend and creating the initial texture sheets.  Might actually be able to get them in-game and start doing some real testing on the new plugin code over the weekend.\n\nOne other thing that I\u0027m going to be investigating, is any \u0027official\u0027 support needed for KS3P - the KSP Post Processing project.  I haven\u0027t gotten a chance to try it out yet, but from the screenshots that I\u0027ve seen -- absolutely beautiful.  Combine all of the fun post-processing with good support for PBR shaders, and it really does look like an entirely new game.  I don\u0027t think there is much that I\u0027ll need to work out, or really any incompatibilities to fix, but I do want to take some time to see if I can enable HDR rendering for a more realistic bloom effect when post-processing is enabled (the current bloom effects look to be some form of exponential ramp applied to standard-range lighting values to \u0027fake\u0027 the bloom producing sources)\n\nIf you haven\u0027t already seen it -- check out some of the in-game screenshots from the thread.

New models have been UV\u0027d, run through part-tools, and are now loading in-game.  Configs are going to take a bit longer to finish, as I\u0027m still figuring out precisely how to \u0027construct\u0027 the fuel tanks with the new segmented models while avoiding texture seams in the \u0027seamless\u0027 textures (gold/foam).  Also noted some oddities with the new plugin code that I\u0027ll need to investigate and cleanup, but I have some fair ideas on where the problems exist and how to solve them (UI interaction / validation stuff), so should just be a matter of time to get it cleaned up.  If all goes well, I should likely have the first in-game screenshots of the new system\u002Bmodels\u002Btextures sometime this weekend.\n\nAnd then I got the news... that I\u0027m getting a promotion at work.  So the rest of this week and likely the next few will unfortunately be very busy -- moving to a new office, getting computer(s) setup, and most of the other fun that would come with starting a new job.  Thankfully I think that after the craziness during the transitional period that I should end up with more a bit more freedom in daily scheduling and likely more free time in general.  The generality of it is that I\u0027m moving from a full-time production position with part-time development work, into a full-time software development position.  Less time spent cleaning up other peoples messes/mistakes every day, and more time spent coding/developing -- should likely be a much less stressful work day on average (which will mean more brain-power that I can devote to modding *after* work).\n\nWhat this means for upcoming releases is that they might be delayed longer than I would desire.  Depending on time constraints in the next few weeks, I may end up needing an extra week or three to get SSTU usable once KSP 1.4 drops.  Not really the way I had wanted things to go... but it is what it is."},{"CreatedByName":"T-10a","CreatedById":176203,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-28T21:36:13Z","Content":"No worries Shadowmage.
