I\u0027m asking because I have the 1/10 size Real Solar System config file, but the atmosphere still extends to 130 km. (It\u0027s not a bug, the person who made the config decided to keep it that way.) I would like to make Earth\u0027s atmosphere 70 km high like stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T20:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#Atmosphere\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#Atmosphere\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;= pressure calculation\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T20:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECryzrndm: please read *all* the post before responding. :]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elivefree75: The table will be in the RealSolarSystem.cfg file--find the Kerbin {} node, and inside it find the pressureCurve.
