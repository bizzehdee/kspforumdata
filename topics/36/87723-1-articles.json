The one thing I\u0027ve always read in the thread and elsewhere is \u0022gee, I really love these parts but golly the joints just wobble, is there anything you can do to fix it?\u0022 Short answer is Unity just won\u0027t be nice. So I\u0027ve been off and on for roughly a month in conjunction with getting parts to move in the VAB/SPH a new Infernal Robotics ARM mod. I\u0027ve been sharing my progress on the modders irc channel but I figured I would give a preview here of what is coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes this special?
