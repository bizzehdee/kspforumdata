I\u0027m not very good at making mods so if someone thinks this idea sounds cool, have a go at making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically it would be a really large module- maybe 4-5 metres and would require a massive electric charge snd perhaps some kind of fuel to operate. You would design the ship in the VAB and then the module would slowly print a design from your saved ships that you would choose. There would probably have to be a limit to what pieces could be printed and a size limit and all fuel tanks would be empty when printed and no kerbals would be present when the ships were printed as I suspect printed kerbals would be even more incompetent than normal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel Free to leave any suggestions or comments and if you are a modder and would like to have a go feel free! I would try to help you in any way needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-tHarvey303\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T17:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I understand your request.
