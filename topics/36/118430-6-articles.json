Congrats man ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022). \n\nQuick question on a possible configuration. I\u0027m planning on starting up a \u0022career\u0022 stream (After a 6 month break) but with some very... *unique* settings... For simplicity, I\u0027m going to call it \u0022Careerbox\u0022. It\u0027s essentially going to be a sandbox game, but with science reports enabled and science points as a scoreboard and a monthly budgeted income as a means of preventing instant rocket building tied in with Kerbal Construction time to limit that as well. It would replace a vast portion of the grind with simple time-warping and be a very compelling form of career mode for other veteran players since it would start with all parts unlocked (or possibly locked until you take time to research them).\n\nThere\u0027s a couple of core pillars that this \u0022gamemode\u0022 would be based around. The most complicated bit, \u003Cu\u003EFunds would be reworked to be based around a monthly income, and with each deposit you lose a bit of reputation\u003C/u\u003E. Contracts would still be a means of gaining reputation and funds, but not required to progress. Only there if you want them. Also, \u003Cu\u003Ethe higher your reputation the more money you receive with each deposit and the lower your reputation the less money you receive with each\u003C/u\u003E. This way if you do well you can progress quickly, but if you start dropping below the norm, it could take you years of extra time warping to gain enough funds for your next big projects. The last point is that \u003Cu\u003Eall parts start unlocked.\u003C/u\u003E You would still gain science though through reports and other usual means, but you wouldn\u0027t spend it. . It would be a sort of *\u0022scoreboard\u0022* for your game.I\u0027d probably include No More Science Grind or another mod to prevent having to revisit the same locations and reducing boredom.\n\n**The end goal for this setup is simply to collect all science.**\n\n- I\u0027m curious if this kind of thing would be doable with B.R.O.K.E? I would definitely be playing it with a minimalist KCT install as well as another means of limiting how quickly you could build rockets. I sadly can\u0027t code and I\u0027ve got no clue how I would attempt to add this type of thing to B.R.O.K.E. though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-24T16:39:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2016 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T22:20:02Z","Content":"Well, I just get a disappearing BROKE UI and a whole bunch of NRE\u0027s whenever I try \u0022Warp to Next Morning\u0022 now.

There have been quite a few new entries into this space that are pretty good and I\u0027ve already been bad enough at maintaining my fully functional mods. However, if you (or someone else) wanted to cover maintenance I maybe could swing it. I need to unbreak KCT before I even consider looking at this though, which means getting an actual release AND a new inventory system.\n\nThe fact that OnLoad runs so much earlier than before also broke KCT (I think it now runs before Start). I managed to work around it there (off the top of my head I don\u0027t remember what I did. It was either moving into Awake or doing better instantiating of things so they don\u0027t break, or moving some of the OnLoad code into Start. I don\u0027t remember.) I also had to redo how I create the scenario, but that might not be an issue with BROKE depending on how we did it. I vaguely remember doing it the \u0022correct\u0022 way for BROKE using attributes instead of manually inserting the Scenario like KCT did.\n\nYour solution might work and sounds like the \u0022better instantiation\u0022 fix by just moving the actual entities out of Start/OnLoad and updating their state at the appropriate time. OnLoad will run before Start, but I think the first FixedUpdate runs afterward. Though FixedUpdate should check for a valid state before doing anything anyway. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to basically lazy load everything and just not act on anything until a valid state is reached, if that\u0027s how you were proposing doing things.\n\nFor some similar alternative mods, see: (Monthly budgets covers a lot of what I wanted to do by default, but isn\u0027t as \u0022core frameworky\u0022 as this)\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/147010-121-monthly-budgets-221-24112016/\u0026page=1\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138917-12-altfunding-v030/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxRebo","CreatedById":158856,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T23:14:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 53 minutes ago, magico13 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For some similar alternative mods, see\n\u003E \n\nWhoa, I actually didn\u0027t know of those... well since I\u0027m not in a position to actually become a maintainer, I\u0027m pretty much with you on phasing this out in favor of similar mods that fit the same bill.\n\nI\u0027m still determined to get this working in 1.2 though, if just for the educational experience.
