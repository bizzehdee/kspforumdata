Just add this to the bottom of your part.cfg to make it crewable. Keep in mind, that without an airlock your poor kerbals won\u0027t have any way to get in or out!

It works very much like the parts do. Where the main folder is called Internals\\Spaces\\ and the sub folders are for each internal space. You can open the internal.cfg files to see the names of each internal space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn here you\u0027ll see a familiar structure. The main file is the internal.cfg.

Feel free to open up your local copy of the file to see how the rest works if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese files follow the structure of all modules, they\u0027re using the new configNode system.

Their files are in the Internals\\Props\\NameOfProp\\ folders. In there, you\u0027ll find the standard model.mu files, model.mbm texture files, and a new file. The prop.cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prop.cfg contains all the information for a specific prop. These props are then added the internal.cfg files of an internal space. Where you provide the position and rotation information for them. A prop only needs to be defined, once, and can be added over and over again to an internal space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an example prop.cfg file for the 3 handed altimeter gauge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike all the prop files, it mostly consists of some information that the prop needs to work. In this case, it needs to know the name of each hand\u0027s game object, so it can find it and rotate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPROP Start of our prop definition\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = AltimeterThreeHands The name of our prop, should match the prop\u0027s folder name, though its technically not necessary.
