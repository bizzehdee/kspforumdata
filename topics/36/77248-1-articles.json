I do not wish to make a replacement to his mod or even a mod that would compete with his. I post this only to ask one question really about the feasibility of my idea. If I did somehow manage to make this mod, which is highly unlikely, it is even more unlikely that I would release it to the public. I would keep it for personal use. I mostly use the term Kethane Lite as a reference and to give an idea of what I would like to accomplish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:End Disclaimer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is basically you land your craft anywhere, deploy the drill and it will mine up whatever fuel the drill was made for. There would be no scanning, no hunting for deposits, and this would be a completely cheaty way to obtain free fuel for your craft. I realized I could do this by simply making the drill a fuel generator that takes electricity and generates fuel while the drill animates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, is there a way for my generator to know, without making a plug-in to tell it, that it is \u0027in flight\u0027 and thus NOT \u0027landed\u0027 and make it unable to generate fuel? The moment the craft is landed, it unlocks the drill and now the drill is free to generate all the fuel you have the time and electricity to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize, this should most likely be in plug-in development help and support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T02:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T03:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could do this with Kethane by defining a custom resource generator that uniformly places your desired resource all over the planet.

I thought perhaps of combining the converter functions directly into the drill parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also considered perhaps somehow making a Module-manager cfg that would somehow add mode-switching to (nearly?) all stock engines so they could Kethane directly as a fuel, but then I would need to redesign stock tanks to somehow hold Kethane as well, if I didn\u0027t want to replace my entire fleet of ships with Kethane tanks instead of stock tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you notice the theme here, the idea is to remove the scanning processes, and either streamline or remove the converting processes. By cutting out the converting processes you also wouldn\u0027t have the need for tanks as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I may ask, can resource deposits in Kethane be linked to biomes? It might would be cool that only the (Great-)Flats of Minmus contain frozen Kethane (or pick your resource). The polar cap\u0027s of Duna contain water (if you\u0027re using a Life-support mod and Duna eventually gets Biomes as well).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T06:54:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 06:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
