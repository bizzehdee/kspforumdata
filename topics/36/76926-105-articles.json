Make 1 or 2 sizes for different size guns. Although I\u0027m sure that would mean using IR code for moving the gun with the turret. Seems like a cool idea though, to have a manually rotating and elevating 20mm (or similar) turret. By manually I mean mappin controls to a joystick or even mouse, so that instead of point mouse and shoot you have to move the mouse to move the turret. It would make things a bit more interesting.
