Air Maintenance Technician?\n\nYepper, same deal, Aviation Maintenance Technology which ended in an FAA Airframe \u0026 Powerplant rating. Depending on what kind of school you go to (and in which country) the length of the program varies, but you generally receive the same number of hours of instruction (per federal regulations). I took my classes through the local community college, and most of the time was spent sitting around at the airport pretending to rebuild our O-290\u0027s while everyone bs\u0027d. I didn\u0027t slack off quite as much as I could\u0027ve, and ended up getting to rebuild and run the school\u0027s R-985, TPE331 and PT6 (and I\u0027ve scarcely come close to touching anything as cool since). A lot of it was downtime, but it was a lot of fun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T23:03:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris P.
