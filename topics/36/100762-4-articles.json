The plan is to get something out in the next week and subsequent builds over the coming weeks to progress Papa\\_Joe\u0027s grand plans for this mod.  \n\nThe next version will include:  \n\nUpdates to bring RM up to 1.0.5 speed including what Papa\\_Joe mentioned around kerbal renaming and profession renaming.  \n\nI am working on making some gameplay alterations (these of course will be configurable) with regard to profession management. These will be optional free, or cost you funds going forward. This is the interest of gameplay and future ideas around being able to train and re-train kerbals to different professions rather than just switching them. Of course, you can always set the config to just change them without cost.  \n\nOther changes in the next version will include:-  \n\nSalaries (settings configurable). Yes - you will have to pay your kerbals (that you recruit). Salaries can be configured to be paid monthly or yearly. If at any stage you are unable to pay your kerbals then they will go into a contract dispute mode and request a pay rise to continue working. You can accept or not. If you accept the pay rise takes effect and back-pay will begin accumulating. This can occur for three pay periods, at which time, if you are still unable to pay them all their owed salary they will stop working for you (become tourists). Until such time as you can pay them in full all owing monies, at which time they will stop being tourists and become available to work for you again.  \n\nAge (settings configurable). Yes - your kerbals will age over time, and yes they will eventually die of old age.  \n\nOf course, if you have respawn on in your game settings they will respawn as new freshman. These config options are available to you, the player. Age in future versions will affect:- performance, experience, influence on crewmates whilst on missions. You can stop the aging process by Freezing your kerbals using my DeepFreeze mod if you have it installed, RM will be completely compatible with DeepFreeze in this regard.  \n\nThat\u0027s all that is planned for the upcoming version, but as I said, the plan is to continue expanding this mod out to include, aspects regarding training, experience, and other stats and potential other mod integrations. So stay tuned, and hopefully I can get all the testing done and a version out in the coming week.  \n\nCheers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T20:21:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T17:59:43Z","Content":"I can\u0027t wait!

JPLRepo is working on the final touches.   no promises as to timing, (we all know that christmas is just around the corner for those who celebrate) But we are in close contact daily\n\nGood things coming.\n\nOnce we do get a release, I will be refactoring the plugin and preparing it for the next phase, I need to work out some framework issues to support a more modular approach to adding features.

I\u0027ll be releasing JPLRepo and my efforts as the next update within hours.\n\nVersion 0.2.0.0 05 Dec 2015   \n\n - Compatible with new KSP 1.0.5 Kerbal Traits/naming process.  \n\n - Up to date with DeepFreeze Mod integration.  \n\n - Fixed Filter tab at top of GUI, and added Frozen filter (if DeepFreeze is installed)  \n\n - Added Salaries option to Settings, also in settings you can set salaries to be paid monthly or yearly.  \n\n   - Salaries are set via Training - Experience Tab in the GUI. Default value is 10000 funds.  \n\n   - Salaries are deducted monthly or yearly, but if you do not have enough funds then the kerbals who aren\u0027t paid will go into a contract dispute mode.  \n\n     - Contract Disputes occur when kerbals are not paid their salary. Each pay period the kerbals who aren\u0027t paid will ask for a payrise (which goes up each time they aren\u0027t paid).  \n\n       All un-paid salary will accrue each time they are not paid.  \n\n       The user can accept the payrise and the kerbal will continue to work for you. However, this will only occur for 3 pay periods. At the end of the third occurrence of them not  \n\n       being paid the kerbal will go on strike (Become a tourist). Until such time as they are paid all owed money.  \n\n     - A Contracts Window is available to see all kerbals that currently are in contract dispute and allow you to accept payrise, decline (they go on strike). Or if you have  \n\n       funds available you can re-pay them all owed monies and they will go back to work for you.  \n\n     - Each month or year (salary period) funds are checked and if there are enough contract disputes are automatically resolved.       \n\n - Added KerbalLifeSpanInfo including Age and lifespan processing setting for each kerbal.   \n\n   - If this setting is on all kerbals in the game will age over time and eventually die from old age.  \n\n   - If the Repawn kerbal option is on in the main game settings then they will respawn when the die (but as a new freshman again).  \n\n   - If you also have DeepFreeze Mod intalled then freezing a kerbal will stop the aging process whilst they are frozen.  \n\n   - Each Kerbals age is shown in the Attributes Tab for each kerbal and the main roster list. But the age cannot be changed.   \n\n - Refactored code, cleaned up code style, standardized variables and usage.  \n\nNext version will include some architectural changes and additional features.  That will likely be after the US holiday season.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T00:08:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**\n  \nspelling"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T21:18:32Z","Content":"Ok, 0.2.0.0 has been released.

Here are my steps\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Start new career\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. fire all hired crew\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3. go attempt to build new vessel\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4. now I can\u0027t exit/launch/ build or simulate -( Kerbal construction time)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5. Restart game to see if it fixes it (no)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6. Now I can\u0027t enter VAB. I can  however enter the R\u0026D building but cannot exit.\n\u003E \n\nI still can\u0027t replicate the error by following these steps which makes me think this is some conflict between Roster Manager and another mod that is causing this issue.  \n\nLooking at your list of installed mods can I ask that you try removing these mods one by one (in this order, as they seem the most likely that would cause the conflict from the list of mods you had installed in the log you supplied) to see if the problem goes away or if you can repeat the problem and report back?\n\nKSI (Astronaut complex overhaul)  \n\nKerbalRenamer  \n\nFinalFrontier\n\nI couldn\u0027t see that you had kerbal construction time even installed in the log you supplied before?\n\nCan you also download this dev DLL from here (when you click the link, then click on the \u0022View Raw\u0022 link this should download the dll file for you.\n\n[https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/RosterManager/blob/Dev/RosterManager/Distribution/GameData/RosterManager/Plugins/RosterManager.dll](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/RosterManager/blob/Dev/RosterManager/Distribution/GameData/RosterManager/Plugins/RosterManager.dll)\n\nCopy it into \\GameData\\RosterManager\\Plugins folder (replace existing file) and let me know if this fixes the problem or not?  \n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T09:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"}]}
