I\u0027m working on a part module that gathers telemetry data from the vessel (alt, gforce, atm pressure etc) during ascents/descents and allows players (well currently just me) to transmit and graph the data.

The only issue I\u0027ve noticed is that during graph resizing to a larger Rect, the background grid texture will resize to the new Rect, but the resolution of the texture is the same (since it was created at a specific x \u0026amp; y with the KerbalGraph constructor), which makes the background grid texture blurry/pixelated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-04T19:53:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2014 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PaidLeber\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schmonzo","CreatedById":5728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T18:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso is this going to be similar to the graphotron 2000?
