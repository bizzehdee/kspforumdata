You should create a pair of retro thrusters in the style of XanderTek\u0027s Landertrons using BD\u0027s animation plugin for auto deployment.

I\u0027m all about the Ravenstar though. I\u0027m desperate to fly the XR-2 as my second shuttle program.

Maybe replace it with an ALTEA or leave it as a flag setup. Then again, it\u0027s tough to go wrong with white, gray, or black.\n\nIf there\u0027s any way I can help with this, let me know. I\u0027m learning Unity and I\u0027m not bad with coding. I\u0027d love to give you a hand if I can. \n\nAwesome work so far. \n\nMy advice - don\u0027t go crazy with the controls and IVA. From past experience, it\u0027s easier just to complicate a mod that works than it is to make a complicated mod.\n\nIf I get to launch components for a long-range space cruiser with an XR-2 with my own flag and name on the side of it - that would literally be the realization of what I\u0027ve dreamed of since I started playing KSP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T18:36:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Odyssey**\n  \nfound better link"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T19:47:26Z","Content":"Y\u0027know... since you can do texture switching using Firespitter...

THAT would be cool.\n\nProbably terribly difficult, though, so I\u0027m not expecting that to happen any time soon."}]}
