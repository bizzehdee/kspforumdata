No antenna system for 1.1 -- I was quite looking forward to this, and was going to add proper short range (orbital) antennas to all pods, with some parts having longer-range antennas (service modules).  Ohwell, suppose I can still add the antennas, they\u0027ll just be a bit overpowered.\n\n\u0022we pushed the antenna and telemetry system back meaning it won\u2019t be a part of update 1.1\u0022 \n\n![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\n2.) No updated PBR shader/rendering.  I\u0027m honestly not sure what they were referring to with that one, or how that is going to work out.  Can we use the \u0027standard shader\u0027, or not?  Suppose only time will tell...\n\n\u0022On the flip side, the new (PBR) lighting model will also have to be pushed back to beyond 1.1 over performance concerns with the real time reflections. We\u2019ll be looking into creating a more efficient, custom solution for this problem at a later date.\u0022 \n\nAnd... even more ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)  (was actually far more excited about the rendering updates than I was the antennas...).  So.. sadly, there -still- will not be any reflective/shiny textures.\n\nBut.. on the bright side, this means that I likely won\u0027t be spending weeks/months doing texture updates for 1.1, as it sounds like they are using some sort of hacked shader/rendering that should be compatible with existing textures and setups.\n\nSo... there goes the 2n\u0027d and 3\u0027d most important features from 1.1 for me (the first being 64-bit support).  At least they haven\u0027t cut the GUI system updates out.... those are fairly important to me as well, though I have a hard time getting excited about them -- would love some nice GUIs... but ugh... GUI work generally sucks (AWT/SWT/Swing/WinAPI... every GUi system I\u0027ve coded with... all are terrible; I\u0027ve never found a GUI library that was pleasant to use... either they are too simple to do anything real and usable, or too bloated, complex, and too much of a cluster to efficiently/quickly work with)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T17:08:14Z","Content":"Yeah, I figured Squad would back down on all the things they promised, and I think 1.1 will be full of new major issues/bugs judging from their devnotes.
