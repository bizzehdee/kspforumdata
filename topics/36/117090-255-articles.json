Should I use action groups for that?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the great mod.\n\u003E \n\n1.)

Literally should be just select your main fuel type (for whatever engine you attached), and hit the launch button.\n\n2.)  Hollow colliders -- you know how the decouplers **look** like they are hollow?  Well, they are not in reality.  Hollow colliders are extremely performance intensive to simulate, so they are only enabled when explicitly needed.  When would you need them?  Anytime you need something to go -through- the decoupler (be it an engine, an entire stage, whatever).\n\n3.)  There is no staging setup -- use action groups or right-click menu to decouple the payload (the staging action only activates the opening of the petal panels).  This is a limitation of the stock systems, where parts can only have a single \u0027staging\u0027 action (once staged, you cannot stage a part a second time)."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-03T17:45:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 28 minutes ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I do not use it much, it tend to induce inaccuracy.\n\u003E \n\nIt hasn\u0027t been that bad in my experience.
