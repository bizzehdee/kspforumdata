A good thing to point out is this can be affected by other installed mods. For example the Sabatier process does not need CO2 which is atmospheric. TAC life support and Universal storage provide a way to run it using life support provided CO2. NASA is using the Sabatier reaction to recover water from exhaled carbon dioxide and the hydrogen previously discarded from electrolysis on the International Space Station. \u003Cp\u003EI have also have been trying to go the other way and power nuclear rockets with tanks of water! Using the added electrolysis systems to make hydrogen and oxygen. The Oxygen goes in life support storage and the hydrogen can be feed into fuel tanks using TAC Fuel Balance. I also have cryogenic tanks from the Near future Propulsion mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a technical note the Peroxide process is chemically correct now but full of danger. In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive decomposition if heated too much. It also tends to be very corrosive and hard to store if my memory is correct.

Do you think they should be able to create propellant fuel from vacuum? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that that I have already removed a lot of parts by resizable parts. The main reason I did this was not to reduce clutter, or improve customization but to lower maintenance. The list you propose is very specific to your needs as it contains both reactors, science parts and power distribution technology. I suggest you manually remove the parts you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need or use an auto pruner utility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding integration/compatibility with other fuels, I already took several steps to improve KSPI. For example, The Fission reactor now run on EnrichedUranium instead of UraniumFloride. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Idea for using DSEV\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Fusion pellets is interesting. KSPI Confinement Fusion Reactor has the option to switch between many different kinds of Fusion Mixes. I could simply add DSEV\u0027s Fusion pellets as an additional mode. For The Vista it actually makes for a preferred fuel/propellant as it really uses pellet for propulsion and it it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s always in the correct mix. To facility it further, I would be useful to allow production of the pellets in the Refinery or Vista Engine. Allowing it to create Pellets from Deuterium / Tritium. This is not a trivial thing as Tritium is a very expansive resource and is most effectively created in any neutronic reactor. Also Tritium is radioactive and spontaneously converts into lithium again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMegajoules are required to maintain stable power control.

Basically any resource that is shared by multiple systems has the problem of unintentionally beeing used.

One solution, is to introduce new resources specially for propulsion which can be freely converted, or at a specific energy cost between their counter parts. An good example would be Water. For propulsion, we could create a LqdWater resource which has the same density/cost as normal water except it would be specificly be used for Propulsion. It could be freely converted to TAC Water, create LqdWater from TAC water. The same could be applied to Hydrogen and Lithium. LqdLithium would be the propellant counterpart if Lithium which would be used to breed Tritium which LqdLithium could be used for propulsion. To achieve this, I want to add a reservoir abiity to the Interstellar Fuel Switch part module. The reservoir would also function as the boil-off buffer, allowing you recover a limited amount of boiloff.
