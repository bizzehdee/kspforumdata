The main problem I am hitting is that any super heavy launch platform is way too expensive per launch to use in career (which is what I am designing for) or if I use cheap chemical rockets, the whole thing is too intensive for my meh computer.

However, after reading some of this forum I hear that the ATILLA is way better. I did some quick tests and it seems to be good, but I haven\u0027t been able to get it quite up to the level of thermal turbojets and their air-breathing ability. My goal is to get 100-1000 tons into orbit at once, with minimal cost. I am using FAR, so I can\u0027t just bring up absurd payloads. The main problem I am hitting is that any super heavy launch platform is way too expensive per launch to use in career (which is what I am designing for) or if I use cheap chemical rockets, the whole thing is too intensive for my meh computer. Because of this, I designed it as an SSTO with atmo flight capabilities to land on the runway, but it is really hard to fly and only lifts 100 tons. Any and all tips/advice are welcome, even if I am going about this completely incorrectly.
