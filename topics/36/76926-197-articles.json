In the early days of SEAD, Wild Weasels (WW) on an Iron Hand mission used the target tracking radar (TTR) illumination to determine the location of the SAM site, of which the SAM crews knew better than to simply leave their TTR on all the time. What they did was basically turn them on for a few seconds every minute or two, and only left them on when they had a contact. So, aircrews would deliberately allow themselves to be tracked in order to keep the radar on long enough for their early anti-radiation missiles (ARM) to fly to target - note that being tracked is different from being locked on to. This inevitably ended up with aircrews flying into range of the SAM\u0027s fire control radar (FCR, or \u0022locking radar\u0022 as it is apparently called) which would in fact lock them up if the ARM hadn\u0027t taken out the TTR; this is how most of the aircraft attacking SAM sites got shot down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the TTR was down, cluster munitions typically made short work of the SAM site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern SEAD, while just as dangerous, uses a combination of ECM and towed decoys to create big juicy targets for the TTR to illuminate while the aircraft remain mostly undetected and can lob their ARMs with relative impunity. Clever SAM commanders know the tactics aircrews use and will reposition their TTR radar every 8 hours or so (in the Balkans, some SAM commanders repositioned their TTR every hour) in the hopes of misdirecting a WW mission and bagging them an airplane or four. Never happened, of course, but not for lack of trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if a SAM site leaves its TTR on all the time, WW don\u0027t need to bother with the whole \u0022get them to leave their radar on by tracking us\u0022 schtick.
