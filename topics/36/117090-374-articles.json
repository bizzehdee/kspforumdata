This is stock \u002B SSTU only.\n\nAs an example, the LC5 has a listed cost of 6400 and a mass of 3.4 tons. When placed in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E its cost is 1320 and its mass is 7.021\n\nThe mass discrepancy is undoubtedly because the part has no resources on its prefab: When stripped of its resources (and external tanks removed) its mass becomes the listed value of 3.4\n\nThe cost at that point drops to 675. If the containers are configured to remove the resources outright (as opposed to using the sliders in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E) then the cost drops even further to 14 funds\n\nThe LC2 and LC3 behave similarly and if stripped of all the resources and tanks their costs drop to 9 and 14 funds respectively.\n\nHere\u0027s a log for you if you want it\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ovw2dkdalpkvdi6/SSTU-LanderCore_testing-output_log.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ovw2dkdalpkvdi6/SSTU-LanderCore_testing-output_log.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-28T14:43:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2019 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Korb Biakustra","CreatedById":53854,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-30T20:11:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/20/2018 at 1:25 AM, T-10a said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@mechanicH](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167929-mechanich/) Use the Soyuz OM\u002BDM\u002BSM parts (maybe up the crew capacity in the DM to 3 seats, like the real TMA soyuz), and attach the escape tower to the OM.
