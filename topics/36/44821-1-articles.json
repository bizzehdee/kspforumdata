That way you could back up under the hitch, raise/lower one vehicle to dock them (with landing legs or something), then raise/lower till you have free motion and drive off. This way you can connect in the field and the hinge will provide the movement you are looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T14:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PringleMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PringleMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you tried putting a clamp-o-tron on to the hinge?

I wonder if such a thing would be possible?, Something along the lines of having the draw bar and articulated joint as part of the one item and then a micro docking port (invisible) at the trailer end witch would attach to another micro docking port on the trailer. These would then be permanently integrated on the back of the vehicles/trailers. Ultimately Id be looking to the wheels of the trailing vehicle to having steering to like in the Modular Multi Wheels pack. Done a bit of 3d modelling before however the tow bar would need some sort of dll im assuming, which I know nothing about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole idea is to have a tractor unit with various different trailers for mining, comms etc forming a road train which all share a common chassis with different payload packages on top e.g. tanks, drill bits etc. This would cut down on the part size and allow easy deployment by skycrane or maybe some kind of custom lander can like the recon part of the HOME system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T10:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gristle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gristle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use the Ram part in TT Multiwheels for raising/lowering.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad someone does, that\u0027s exactly what I put them there for!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
