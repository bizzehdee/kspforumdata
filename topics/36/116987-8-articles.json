The only mod that must be installed is Module Manager because I use it to check what mods are installed and adjust the config accordingly. So with just KD and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E you can do what the integrated modules in KSP allow, mostly resource mining and conversion. With every additional mod installed, the functionality is expanded. If for example you install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026 OSE workshop, the 3D-Printer will be able to produce MaterialKits and the Mobile \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E can produce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-items/parts. Still, without EL the launchpads have no special function and can be considered dead weight.\n\nOne downsides is that this is not the easiest way possible but I think it\u0027s the best trade-off. Another point is that I can\u0027t test every single combination of mods before an update but so far I was lucky ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nFor 1.3 compatibility, I haven\u0027t checke anything yet (just downloaded KSP 1.3 today) but from what I\u0027ve read, there seem to be no problems."},{"CreatedByName":"The-Doctor","CreatedById":163802,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-23T23:06:32Z","Content":"[@Eleusis La Arwall](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116286-eleusis-la-arwall/) if I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed but not OSE, will the 3D Printer still be able to make parts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E?

(look about same size in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E)\n- Use all MKS resource chain cargo types, remove rocket parts, scrap metal and replace metal ore with metallic ore (assumes MKS EL patch for MK based production)\n- Change 3D printer, chemical reactor and furnaces to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E style resource converters\n- Add \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS resources/hab/recyclers to crewed parts where I feel they are appropriate"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T15:16:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Aelfhe1m said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Use all MKS resource chain cargo types, remove rocket parts, scrap metal and replace metal ore with metallic ore (assumes MKS EL patch for MK based production)\n\u003E \n\nJust as a note on this: With the advent of PatchManager, I\u0027ve submitted a reorganization of the MKS EL patches - which splits up the integration into several separate, independent parts.  One of these parts is the conversion of the resource chain for EL upon installing MKS - so in theory there might be MKS players using RocketParts etc. in the future.
