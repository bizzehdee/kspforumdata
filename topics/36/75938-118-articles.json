However, as with most MM stuff, I cannot guarantee that all will go as planned due to the fact that CollisionFX, in its currently released state, will add its module to the KF parts, and then my patch will remove them again shortly afterwards. Somewhere down the line I would be great to figure out how to simply have the DustFX override the CollisionFX instead of having to rely on MM. Especially considering eventually I would like to further integrate DustFX into the core KF wheel modules and eliminate the need to use patches at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the compass, surely you could provide Unity with alternate textures to use, or at least use a development package of those props with the old texture formats available or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T13:07:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWheeeee \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGaalidas, I\u0027ll add you into the repo I keep with all the source models, textures and everything.
