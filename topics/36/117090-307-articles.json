I build a launcher with too little fuel for this size. Later i noticed that I used an cryo-tank (rightclick-menu) for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E. But the cryo-tank has a lower volume (approx 2000 Units) for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E as the Standard-Tank (approx 3000 Units). ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nSo, the problem is solved by using the standard-tank of SSTU.  \n\nThanks for your fast help."},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T16:52:51Z","Content":"not looking for authentic..looking for the sizing to match up, far as pics go..standby."},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T17:05:16Z","Content":"[![24873843478_ba1dd9936c_n.jpg](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4580/24873843478_ba1dd9936c_n.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/DU1X5j)[docking port issues](https://flic.kr/p/DU1X5j) by [XRaiderV1.7](https://www.flickr.com/photos/24689442@N07/), on Flickr  \n\nI\u0027ve prodded at the available matching set of docking ports and the rescale sliders appear to do precisely bubkiss"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T17:08:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Mike\u0060 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Talking about satellites and probes, what do you usually use for attitude control of those?\n\u003E \n\nI sometimes run a mod to nerf the rxn wheels and require me to include \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
