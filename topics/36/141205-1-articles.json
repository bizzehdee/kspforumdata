The ESLD Beacon network will get your Kerbals from point A to points B through Z in no time at all, presuming you\u0027ve positioned and fueled them, read the warning manual and installed all necessary safeguards.

The hailer allows you to open a dialog window with the active beacon, where it will tell you what other active beacons it can see and if it has enough fuel to send you there.

True to the maxim that you can choose two from the list of fast, cheap and high-quality, the jump fuel that makes the system tick is incredibly costly, to the extent that most transfers the beacon system performs are more expensive than or comparable to traditional rocketry-based solutions. Time is the ONLY thing you save with beacons, and some players may even plow more into logistics than they would otherwise have cause to do if they feel like maintaining an accessible and fueled beacon network at all times. The mod includes a cfg to allow players to use stock extraction parts to obtain Karborundum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll put this here for my own sanity: if you\u0027re playing career, at the start your beacons won\u0027t be able to safely transport Kerbals, Karborundum or a variety of other high-energy resources. There will be warnings in the pre-jump window if something bad is about to happen.

release!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been following this with some interest for some time, and though I am by no means an old-timer, there are a couple of things I can throw at you from the annals of history and elsewhere to continue to discuss some of the questions that have come up here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFirst\u003C/em\u003E, the hard-coded dependency on Karborundum, as I understood it, was created because this mod invented Karborundum. \u00A0 When he released Karbonite, RoverDude left an open invitation for people to expand it, and TMarkos took him up on that invitation with this.\u00A0 Karborundum\u0027s reason for existence was to be a fantastically expensive, more fantastically difficult-to-harvest unobtainium\u00A0to balance what otherwise amounted to an in-universe\u00A0Hyperedit, and ESLD was built around it with that mentality. \u00A0It tied the acquisition of Karborundum into RoverDude\u0027s Karbonite/ORSx, then Karbonite/Regolith resource framework (which\u00A0is now essentially the stock resource framework) as a way of outsourcing\u00A0the drilling/mining part, leaving TMarkos to focus on the beacons and their operation\u00A0instead. \u00A0RoverDude, in turn, liked the idea of a super-powerful, super-difficult-to-obtain, essentially-endgame resource, so he incorporated Karborundum into his mod constellation as K\u002B and expanded it with other stuff. \u00A0Using it as some kind of equivalent to \u003Cstrong\u003E(warning--nerd moment)\u003C/strong\u003E Stargate\u0027s naquadah and naquadria for\u00A0engine fuel, for example, was RoverDude\u0027s idea.\u00A0\u00A0That\u0027s why this mod ships its own Karborundum\u00A0tanks instead of using the ones that are now available in K\u002B; you originally needed Karbonite (so TMarkos could use Karbonite\u0027s\u00A0drills and ISRU converter) but there was no way to store Karborundum\u00A0because there was no other mod that supplied it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that the hard-coded dependency is not so much an error to be fixed as it is a feature of the mod, in much the same way that beacons are a feature to use instead of\u00A0Hyperedit. \u00A0Given what it\u0027s supposed to do, calling it shameful to be hard-coded\u00A0is equivalent to saying that it sucks that Kethane is hard-coded into the Kethane mod, or that Oxygen is hard-coded into TAC Life Support. \u00A0That being said, so long as you can maintain some balance\u00A0in terms of Karborundum\u0027s availability and value versus what the beacons do, there\u0027s nothing keeping you from setting up ESLD\u00A0to use something else and having it work just as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as availability, there are still configuration files for putting Karborundum in other places (I recall that Tylo, Dres, and Ike were the locations used) as well as a file for letting you purchase it in the VAB, if you want to use what already exists. \u00A0The next-most-expensive resource, I think, is Xenon, and Xenon is currently available in stock only in the VAB. \u00A0There may be opportunities there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only remaining issue, then, would be those players who simply do not wish to contend with another resource when they already have resource-adding mods such as Kethane. \u00A0The way it used to work was that if you had RoverDude\u0027s full suite of mods, those \u003Cstrong\u003E(warning--nerd moment)\u003C/strong\u003E Stargate-esque engines would be completely overpowered if Karborundum was easy to get, so\u00A0you had to harvest Karborundum from Eve, Eeloo, or just above the surface of the Sun. \u00A0However, if you only had Karbonite, then the only thing that used Karborundum was ESLD and so you could turn Karbonite into Karborundum with ISRU at some awful efficiency. \u00A0(\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022

for every thousand Karbonite--I never bothered with it and went sundiving instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, the easy thing would be to simply declare the dependency, but\u00A0all of the functionality that Karbonite provided exists in stock parts now (essentially unchanged, even), so changing\u00A0things to use the stock drills and ISRU instead of the Karbonite drills and distiller is certainly a valid course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe short version is this: \u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EKarborundum is a dependency for reasons of balance, and eliminating that dependency requires the mod to use something similarly expensive to maintain that balance. \u00A0No such resource exists, so doing this\u00A0may create more problems than it solves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESecond\u003C/em\u003E, on the subject of interstellar beacons, without knowing the scale of distance between stars for the various packs that use multiple stars, you might have the best luck by saying that the energy cost of beacon transfer over arbitrarily large distances approaches some asymptotic value rather than trying to calculate distances that, themselves, are likely completely arbitrary, or worse, having to write some detection code to identify stars, catalogue stars, determine whether two stars are a binary system, rewrite it all and scream in frustration when someone puts up a rogue planet pack for Kopernicus, \u0026amp;c. \u00A0If need be, you could\u00A0even technobabble your way out of it by saying that the beacon works by taking advantage of an inverted\u00A0relationship in physics: \u00A0in orthospace, the speed of light is finite-but-large, and\u00A0it takes infinite energy to accelerate a mass to that speed.\u00A0\u00A0In whatever hyperspace the beacons use, the speed is infinite and\u00A0it takes finite-but-still-large energy to accelerate things to that speed (more likely, it enters at that speed as some sort of superneutrino, because in a universe with an infinite speed of light, space, time, and matter cannot exist). \u00A0Once this is done, well, speed is infinite, so the cost to go to the next star is the same as the cost to go to the next galaxy--or to the other side of the observable universe (because when there\u0027s no time and space, getting anywhere is a snap). \u00A0The caveat and balancing cost\u00A0in these ultra-long-distance cases would be more that the receiving equipment (and the fuel for it) has to be sent there the slow way first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIn short:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 just set some high, fixed, base price for interstellar transfer (defined as anything beyond a minimum distance) and leave it at that. \u00A0Correcting for the disparate stellar velocities\u00A0will keep the costs random enough to avoid being too predictable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAdditionally\u003C/em\u003E, there is\u00A0a market for some sort of long-range in-system beacon. \u00A0Anyone who plays with OPM or RSS-scaled systems will have much larger distances to cover, though it should not be too difficult to work out those distances and, on detecting the mods, use MM patches to scale the costs and capabilities accordingly. \u00A0The cost modifiers in the configuration files are esoteric but understandable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

posting without coffee in the system leads to embarrassment): but I think he means shameful from a coding perspective (I think you already get that; it\u0027s a strong word, but he can clarify). I\u0027m the classic case (e.g. notepad jockey), where if it doesn\u0027t happen in a config that I can open with a text editor, then it might as well not exist.

Admittedly, that\u0027s not the best CV for someone to be writing a patch on something like this, but it seemed like a fine idea at the time. The reason I think Kethane might be feasible, in large quantities, as I understand it, is it\u0027s resources are finite, but I haven\u0027t played with that mod in a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is to not make this content already more restrictive than it already is. I mean that tech wise, cost wise, time wise, and mod dependency wise.

If it\u0027s not nearly impossible to obtain, this mod easily becomes overpowered. If a player can just launch a beacon already fueled, they may as well just have HyperEdit. This is why I\u0027m somewhat reticent to make patches changing it to any existing resources because they can\u0027t be hard to obtain because regular players need them around. That being said, your suggestion of using XenonGas is a good one, because it is hard to produce, costly to buy, and, if required in ludicrously huge quantities (which I would want) difficult to store/transport. Despite my misgivings about changing the resource consumed in jumping, I went ahead and provided the ability to change the resource required (and the amount) in a subnode (or several, for multiple resources) of the part module. \u003Cu\u003EThe download has been updated to reflect these changes\u003C/u\u003E, so feel free to test them. This change is backward compatible in that if no resource is specified for one of the existing beacons, it adds Karborundum by default. \u003Cem\u003EFor new beacons, however, if no resource is specified in the config node, it should (haven\u0027t tested this) jump for free *cringe*\u003C/em\u003E (for configurability\u0027s sake).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom this point, ModuleManager should be able to edit the node for those who want to use something else instead.
