I won\u0027t be able to test it until the SC-E stuff is back and working.  Currently I think -should- work, but you may need to set baseResourceQuantity = 0, and it may leave you with an empty resource-entry.\n\nAs to the rest of your questions regarding scaling the heat-shield module --- (see the fluxMult entry below)\n\n    Part-module definition:\n    MODULE\n    {name = SSTUModularHeatShieldresourceName = AblatorablationStartTemp = 500heatShieldVector = 0, -1, 0heatShieldMinDot = 0.2heatShieldMaxDot = 0.8ablationEfficiency = 8000 // increase this if you are running out of ablator; it will not prevent overheatingfluxMult = 1 // increase this in rescale systems if you are overheating/exploding, it will not effect ablator usebaseResourceQuantity = 250 // determines the resource value with a resource multiplier of 1.0 (Medium shield type)shieldMass = 0 // how much mass does the shield have for the Medium shield typecurrentShieldType = LightareaAdjusted = true  // this states that it should multiply the input curves by exposed area skin area, allows for most parts to use the same curves//at least one shield type must be specified (else it will default to Medium)//these determine the max heat-load, and are a reference to the heat curves and multiplier stats in the heat shield typesSHIELDTYPE{\tname = Light}SHIELDTYPE{\tname = Medium}SHIELDTYPE{\tname = Heavy}\tSHIELDTYPE{\tname = ExtraHeavy}\n    }\n\n    SSTU_HEATSHIELD\n    {//name of the shield type, as referenced above in the SHIELDTYPE blockname = Light//multiplier to the PartModules baseResourceQuantity value for this shield typeresourceMult = 0.5//multiplier to the PartModules shieldMass value for this shield typemassMult = 0.25//unused currently, but will determine tech unlock for the shield typetech = start// the heat curve determines how the shield responds to temperatures above the ablation threshhold// the existing curves have been tuned for \u0027area adjusted\u0027 useheatCurve{\tkey = 5 0\tkey = 7.5 1.6\tkey = 25 7.5\tkey = 75 22.5\tkey = 125 35\tkey = 175 60\tkey = 250 90\tkey = 312.5 112.5\tkey = 375 150\tkey = 412.5 250\tkey = 450 350\tkey = 462.5 550\tkey = 475 800\tkey = 487.5 1187.5\tkey = 500 1225\tkey = 550 1250\tkey = 600 1275\tkey = 650 1287.5\tkey = 700 1300\tkey = 750 1307.5\tkey = 1000 1350\tkey = 1250 1375\tkey = 1500 1400\tkey = 2000 1450\tkey = 2050 1450.5}\n    }\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, SpaceBadger007 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a question on the lander core tanks, i\u0027m not sure how to configer them to have landing legs and solar panels etc back in 1.0.5 it was just \u0022next exturnal option\u0022 is it still that easy because i cant find that option when right clicked on in the vab/sph\n\u003E \n\nNegative; due to the changes to Unity wheels, those legs are impossible to do with the existing setup.  And the module switch setup was a giant hack to begin with, so I feel better that those parts and that module system is no longer around.  Yes it was very nice when it worked... but it was fragile and I wouldn\u0027t have touched that code again with a 10 foot pole and a hazmat suit.\n\nI -might- look into it again in the future after 1.) there is an alternative and functional wheel system available, and 2.) I have time to develop a functional and non-hacky module-switch implementation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Kramer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E First want to say that I love this mod; I can\u0027t contemplate playing KSP now without it. It is just about perfect.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One bug I noticed that remains with the 4.31.110 release you just made concerns the LC2-POD. It seems that the ascent tank variant disappears quite often on a reload or scene change or something. I select \u0022ascent tank\u0022 variant and they show up as expected. If I save the craft and reload in the VAB the tanks are no longer visable. It is very reproducible for me.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another question: are the lander tanks that had selectable landing legs, solar panels, etc. not supported under 1.1 KSP? I loved using those for landers and can\u0027t find them. Maybe I just am looking in the wrong place.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Thanks, Kramer\n\u003E \n\nNoted\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/308](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/308)\n\nSee the above reply regarding the lander parts.  The legs were the big motivation for the setup, and no legs meant it was easier to remove the entire hacky/fragile setup.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Kramer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am seeing an occasional crash when I hide the flag on a tank.
