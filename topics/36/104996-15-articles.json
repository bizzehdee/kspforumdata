As always, if there is something specific you would like to see made into a prop for these IVAs, post it up and I might add them. In addition to the gloveblox, I\u0027m going to be adding a laptop and maybe some mystery goo experiment to go in one of the rack sections.\n\n**Change Log:**\n\n    v0.14\n    -Added [WIP] MiniLab IVA.\n    -Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer Prop.\n    -Changed out magazine in GymHab Head to one that is more appropriate."},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T03:42:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/18/2016 at 5:06 PM, cxg2827 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One prop done.

Since I want to keep craft-breaking releases at a minimum, I want to get opinions on a possible change to the Node1 module.\n\nThe model has these 2 protrusions based on the pictures I found. I always thought it was just an extension of the module. however I now believe they are just a shroud of sorts that has the CBMs recessed within them. My question to everyone is how should I deal with it?\n\n1. Leave it as is.  \n\n2. Remove them, and just have those 2 end flat surfaces. attachment nodes will change and break crafts.  \n\n3. Make it like a shroud so the CBM sits recessed inside of it, but there wouldn\u0027t be a collider for it, so nothing can be surface attached to it.\n\n![oyzScHt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oyzScHt.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T02:36:51Z","Content":"I say option 3!"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T03:01:51Z","Content":"Option 2.

I will need to tweak the IVA a bit but nothing drastic. [@VenomousRequiem](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137373-venomousrequiem/) I\u0027ll probably include the Option 3 in the download as well if people would prefer the shroud, and you would just drag it into GameData to overwrite Option 2. Both will be interchangeable and not cause any craft breaking switching between them.\n\nAlso, last night i tried out an idea to get those SVS target stickers on the modules without having to increase the texture maps. Though it does increase poly count, I don\u0027t think it will hurt performance. No Z-fighting noticed when zooming out in flight either.\n\n![2mSdssI.png](http://i.imgur.com/2mSdssI.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-07T18:23:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2016 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cxg2827**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T05:49:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m getting close to finishing up the changes for the 1.1 Pre-Release.
