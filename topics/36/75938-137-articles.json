I\u0027ll still include my modified normal maps for some of those track surfaces if you\u0027d like, but it looks like DDS isn\u0027t going to work out. What I don\u0027t get is why all the other mods using DDS look awesome still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for normals, I scale those all the time. Locally anyway. I really have to watch my performance and the more a normal map is being used to change what is rendered, the more my performance drops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose results in your game could be due to your graphics device as well, but if you\u0027re running anything modern-ish then it shouldn\u0027t cause such a dramatic reduction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T19:20:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
