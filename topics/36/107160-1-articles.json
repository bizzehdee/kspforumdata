Squad has renamed files and folders and moved them \\*again\\* so many of the cfg files will need edited \\*again\\*. More stock parts have been added which are very similar to ReStock parts the originator (PolecatEZ) of the mod made and some that I made. One example, the small nosecone with the antennae in stock. Another one is the \u0022space pants\u0022 MK2 dual engine adapter. The original ReStock had one of those using three parts scaled and welded together. Another \u0027tweak\u0027 Squad has repeatedly done is fiddling with node locations on some parts, requiring adjustments again and again to some of the composite parts like the fuel drop tanks that are made from scaled down LF fuselage, two MK7 nose cones and a radial decoupler. The first change had the cones separated from the center. I fixed it. Next release had them buried into the center. I fixed it. Next release they were hovering off the ends again and I fixed it again. Same story with the 5-way RCS blocks and some other parts.\n\nThere is some leftover stuff in the collection to weed out. My plan is/was to redo one part at a time and have only the cfgs for the functional parts in the pack.\n\nSomething that could be added, copies of many of the wing parts with no lift and low drag so the ability to use wing parts for sculpting nice looking copies of planes like the F-22 Raptor will be possible with the new aero.\n\nThen there\u0027s the new heating and aero/drag shielding etc. Looking at a few of the 1.0.x part cfg files it\u0027s evident Squad did a massive cleanup pass. Old leftover comment lines are gone and formatting is different.\n\nIf someone is willing to step up, take charge of a mod that needs no programming, no 3D modeling, nothing but a text editor and a copy of KSP, I\u0027ll pass it on to you as PolecatEZ passed it to me.\n\n\\*I\u0027m working on things like swapping a 1991 drivetrain into a 1982 GMC truck, converting a JET 9x20 metal lathe to CNC, refitting a large knee mill with modern CNC control, refurbishing a couple of antique metal lathes, casting plastic parts for classic cars which is my main business, life in general and all the other irons I have in various fires. Gaming, sadly, is wayyyy down the list. I haven\u0027t even launched Armada Online in months. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Lucky is me if I have time for a few games of Windows Solitaire."}]}
