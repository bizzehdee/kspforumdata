Smaller seven segment display shows current altitude altitude (or velocity, can\u0027t decide which). Third LCD displays shows information about the status of the craft and flight to the user. There are two Arduinos powering this whole setup. An Arduino Leonardo receives serial info from the game, parses it, and then sends it to an Arduino Mega 2560, which then displays the information on the individual displays. The Leonardo is also responsible for sending input information to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the ideas I have been developing and programming is an automated launch system. You punch in a time to launch, and the game runs through the setup for you, starting from when you pull up the red cover and flick the big switch.
