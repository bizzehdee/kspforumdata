Whether or not you agree, I do have a couple of thoughts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still barely into understanding how Unity works, but I believe that the actual orientation of the models does not control how thrust, lift or drag works, they are defined by transforms that are attached to the models and which you point in an appropriate direction. If so the thrust could be offset to align with the centre of mass, I\u0027m pretty sure that since they will have to account for that in the real Skylon, it can be achieved in KSP.

On another note, I\u0027m a bit worried about the positioning of the wings and canard - I tried building a smaller but proportionate space plane using mostly stock parts, and with a canard that far forward, it dragged the centre of lift forward of the CoM, and that makes for an unstable plane.

My engine is always burning oxidizer but I\u0027ll quote Aerospaceweb.org to justify this and then I\u0027ll explain the actual process; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EThe purpose of both the jet engine and the rocket engine is to combust a mixture of fuel and oxidizer. This combustion process generates a high-pressure exhaust that creates thrust to push a vehicle forward. The fundamental difference between the two types of engines, however, is where the oxidizer comes from.\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in reality, a rocket can be thought of as a jet engine that gets it\u0027s oxidizer in liquid form, or alternately, a jet engine is just a rocket engine with a hole in the front that gets its oxidizer for free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using an air intake to produce and feed oxidizer to a rocket engine. How it is done is as follows;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The air intake, while open takes in air and converts it to oxidizer. This is purely a game mechanic, air is oxidizer, or to be accurate air is 20% oxygen and oxygen is by definition an oxidizer. The rate is such that one intake can feed one engine up to about 22km, after which it falls rapidly behind. At that altitude you should close the intake to reduce drag since the oxidizer collected is too little to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The fuel feed mechanism of KSP delivers the oxidizer to where it can be used, either to the rocket motor to make thrust or to a fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The rocket engine is always burning oxidizer, initially the intake provides enough but eventually it has to start using the oxidizer stored in the rocket fuel tanks. I\u0027ve modified the engine\u0027s atmosphere curve to be equivalent to the Sabre\u0027s - a jet-like Isp of 3240 up to about 22km and a rocket-like Isp of 420 from 23km up, with a brief transition between the two Isps in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA purist might point out that I\u0027m really simulating a LACE-type engine (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_air_cycle_engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELiquid Air Cycle Engine\u003C/a\u003E), but the net effect is the same as if the air was actually being consumed directly. Sabre super cools the air to allow it to function at such height and speed, but it doesn\u0027t actually cool the air down to liquid like LACE does. If you compare the Isp and altitude numbers to those quoted for Sabre, you\u0027ll see I\u0027ve cut them back by about 10%. Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere height and orbital velocities are smaller than Earth\u0027s, using the full values makes it more effective than I think it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to have a true jet/rocket hybrid, I\u0027ve been looking at Careo\u0027s HydraEngineController which is in the B9 pack.

The tail engines aren\u0027t visible in this particular picture, but higher resolution pics do show a very slight angle. The Sabre exhaust angle is larger. Given the relative positions of the OMS and Sabre engines it\u0027s easy to understand why they\u0027re angled the way they are, and it doesn\u0027t take a genius to work out that intersection of both thrust vectors must be where the CoM is. It looks to be almost in the middle of the plane, which is exactly what you\u0027d expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFig. 2 shows you the rough angle of attack and the prograde vector during the initial air breathing part of ascent. I\u0027m assuming the angle of attack needs to be so large because the wings are relatively small, but I could be wrong. It doesn\u0027t really matter, what matters is that the intake cone must be aligned with the relative motion of air to get as much air into the engine as possible. That\u0027s why the intake cone is pointing \u0022down\u0022. I\u0027m pretty sure that at this stage the main force propelling the plane up is the lift generated by the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFig. 3 shows you what happens after the intake is closed and the engines go into rocket mode. By this time the angle of attack is not as important because the main force propelling the plane is the thrust of the engines instead of lift. Since that\u0027s the case then the prograde vector drifts \u0022up\u0022 in relation to the nose of the plane. Of course the plane pitches up too to gain altitude quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFig. 4 shows you what happens during circularisation. The Sabres are not used for this (although I really don\u0027t understand why) instead we have the OMS, which has a different thrust vector, and now to move the plane in the right direction the nose must point up a bit. I suspect players wont bother changing engines for this but there\u0027s no really good reason not to include it anyway. If they do decide to use Sabres for circularisation then the nose will of course have to point down relative to prograde by the exact amount as in Fig. 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4eoLWs8.png\u0022 alt=\u00224eoLWs8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EatVacuum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EatVacuum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was thinking about scale of this thing - if you build the model true to real world scale, it will be enormous, the hull will be more than 5m radius, i.e. bigger than the Nova Punch rocket parts.

The Sabres are not used for this (although I really don\u0027t understand why) instead we have the OMS, which has a different thrust vector, and now to move the plane in the right direction the nose must point up a bit. I suspect players wont bother changing engines for this but there\u0027s no really good reason not to include it anyway. If they do decide to use Sabres for circularisation then the nose will of course have to point down relative to prograde by the exact amount as in Fig. 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am intrigued by the OMS system - from the description it doesn\u0027t sound like just a typical RCS system (which is generally a single propellant gas under pressure or a hypergolic mixture), sounds more like a lower thrust conventional rocket motor. The blurb describing it, found on the Skylon link above says; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Whilst in orbit the main propellant tanks are vented and allowed to warm to ambient conditions. Propulsion and attitude control are provided by the Orbital Manoeuvering System (OMS) or Reaction Control System (RCS). This uses a common LH2/LO2 propellant storage which is heavily insulated and cryogenically cooled. This system can remain operational on orbit up to 7 days. The RCS employs gaseous propellants supplied by the Gaseous Propellant Supply System (GPSS). The GPSS also supplies reactants to the fuel cells and the auxiliary power turbines.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second sentence makes it sound like the OMS and RCS are the same system, but then the third and fifth sentences imply they are separate. From the point of simulating it in KSP, I think we need to treat them as separate. It\u0027s also interesting that the main tanks are allowed to vent, it may be that only the auxillary fuel tank, which is very small, will have fuel for deorbit, unless it\u0027s cold enough up there that they still have some usable hydrogen and oxygen after it comes up to ambient temperature (and presumably vaporizes). That also implies a completely unpowered landing, which is pretty hard to do in KSP. Powered space plane landings are challenging enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

But on the other hand 64% only makes him 1.56m (5\u00271\u0022). I guess 64% is good, and if it seems to be the standard, it works for me.

Four RCS allows them to work in balanced pairs for most of the combinations of rotation and translation, except for forwards/backwards and roll where all four can be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething long and thin like Skylon has a higher moment of inertia (don\u0027t flame me if I\u0027m using the wrong term, university physics was a long time ago) for yaw and pitch. So it makes sense to have sets at each end to give you more leverage to rotate the thing. Given that the Skylon is proportionately much longer and thinner than a shuttle, it\u0027s pretty much going to have to have RCS at the ends. On the other hand, those wings are stubby, so you\u0027d think that if the Space Shuttle didn\u0027t need wing thrusters, then Skylon wouldn\u0027t either. But there\u0027s a couple of heavy engines going on the ends of those wings, which is going to increase the roll inertia, which wasn\u0027t the case for the shuttle. So I\u0027d think that Skylon might need them after all. That\u0027s my opinion, but it\u0027s based on some consideration and analysis, your mileage may vary. It\u0027s likely that the wing RCS are going to be implemented as separate components, based on Cpt. Kipard\u0027s parts list earlier in this thread, so I guess you will have a choice in any event.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T19:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModel looks great so far\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dizzysaurus","CreatedById":73061,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T19:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks awesome so far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
