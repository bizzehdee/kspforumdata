There is *currently* one answer to the question \u0022how do I get to an engine\u0022 and that\u0027s \u0022you call LIST ENGINES\u0022, but if there then were other ways invented later should I keep adding them to the Engine page? It\u0027s not *technically* where they belong. There\u0027s a programming principle that one should never try to do the same exact thing in two different places if at all possible because it opens up the chance for later edits of the code to cause inconsistency if they only edit one of those places. That same principle applies to making reference documentation. If, say, BODY describes how to get to an ATMOSPHERE, and ATMOSPHERE also describes how you get to itself from a BODY, then the same thing is described in two places.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand this line of reasoning, I really do. The thing is that, as it stands, the documentation is hard to understand and use if you are not already familiar with how certain things are used. Even with quite a bit of trying, reading and piecing information together, some things are at best cryptic. Although I applaud your efforts to create unified documentation - which is very valuable for reasons you explained well and should be the way to go - I feel that documentation that hardly anyone understands is not very useful, or even useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think it does not have to be one or the other. With some more detailed information, probably a couple of pages with background information on how kOS commands are internally structured and proper links (therefore it being in the place it belongs) to the information you do need to get something functioning, people should get the tools they need to figure it all out. Just the bare essentials on how a command operates and how you can get it to tick in whatever script. Like you said, everything should in essence be in there and I feel at the moment it is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETutorials, example scripts that actually do useful things and stuff like that are indeed a higher level/type of documentation or instruction. Though important to get people started and into kOS, those are a later concern. I am strictly talking about looking up a command and getting the information that is needed to implement it without much further research, guessing and all that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T22:13:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T22:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who wants to be involved with this conversation this weekend, What timezone are you in and when are you available?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Camacha? and @MrOnak? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022erendrake\u0022 data-cite=\u0022erendrake\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esweet! we have been using Google Hangouts a lot for team meetings and Although I have a lot of painting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E going on this weekend.
