I think that has the capacity to produce better results, but IDK for sure, as the patch doesn\u0027t run on my end (I have KM_Gimbal installed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the KM_gimbal modules themselves don\u0027t act funny for me, but they make MechJeb go slightly crazy. I just lock the gimbal and use reaction wheels or RCS instead, and the problems go away. I\u0027ve also heard that there are some MechJeb add-ons that allow MechJeb to work correctly with KM_Gimbal stuff too, but I haven\u0027t looked into that. Not sure if that\u0027s your problem or not, but locking the gimbal should at least help, I would imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027m having a heck of a time getting any kind of performance out of the Rontgen atomic thermal jet while using an Antimatter reactor. The only things this reactor serves are a Charged Particle generator, and this thermal nozzle. Even with 80% power going to charged particles, there should be ~20GW available for the thermal turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific problem I was having was that the thermal turbojet would flame out on atmospheric mode while I had ~10-15% left on the IntakeAtm gauge in the resource display. Additionally, when it flamed out, it would absolutely, positively, REFUSE to restart, no matter what I did. Good thing I have a couple of back-up Plasma Thrusters on it that can run in Atmosphere mode, because otherwise the spaceplane I was piloting wouldn\u0027t have been able to make it back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when I attempted to switch the thermal turbojet over to Hydrazine (the main propellant for this spaceplane), it wouldn\u0027t do anything. It would sit there with \u0022Status: Flame-Out!\u0022, even while connected to several thousand units of Hydrazine that my plasma thrusters and resistojet RCS thrusters had no problem using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was the Rontgen engine, I\u0027m sure of it. I know WHERE the problem was, just not WHAT it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there is the possibility that the above described bug could be due entirely to a long play session (2-3\u002B hours). Even tho I\u0027m forcing DX11 on an nVidia card, it\u0027s entirely possible I was starting to run out of ram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know. To be honest, my previous post was a mostly rational \u0022rage-post\u0022 if such a thing even exists. I was angry and frustrated because the spaceplane that I built that has been very reliable previously, didn\u0027t work. I can tell now that it shows in that post, and I should have given myself a bit of time to regain my composure. Maybe I would have even caught the fact that the engine patches moved on me, who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m going to do for the time being is replace the Rontgen patch with the one from v4.0.1 and see if that does anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile comparing the 4.0.1 and 4.1.0 versions of the Rontgen patch, I noticed that they are structured very differently. I don\u0027t see why they should be, as the other one was working and this one, apparently, wasn\u0027t. Perhaps it\u0027s the fact that you\u0027re adding an engine module to an engine that already has an engine module, resulting in the same kind of \u0022two engine modules in the same engine causes problems\u0022 thing we went over with the ESTOC to Plasma Thruster patches. Bottom line: The way the patch worked in 4.0.1 resulted in a functional engine. The way the patch \u0022works\u0022 in 4.1.0 results in an engine that is malfunctioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest sticking with the 4.0.1 style of patch, it seems to result in more consistently working patches. In other words, modify existing modules instead of inserting entire new modules. If you must insert new modules, make sure you get rid of the old ones first. TRIPLE check that, as it\u0027s the majority of the kind of errors I\u0027ve been finding in this mod\u0027s patches. Remember the ESTOC to Plasma Thruster patches? Same thing seems to be happening all over again. I don\u0027t mind pointing out errors, but I like not having errors to point out in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize my posts can sometimes appear blunt, accusatory, or unfeeling. I don\u0027t have any excuses for it, but I don\u0027t really mean any offense by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErrors are things to be fixed, nothing more, nothing less. I\u0027d probably be making my own kind of errors if I was trying to make one of these kind of mods, too. Probably something with the realism mods, as I haven\u0027t ever used any of those. Had my fill of needing 40km/s to get to Jupiter while playing Orbiter, and even then I was using a fusion torch star ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T03:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frostyfen77","CreatedById":150758,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T03:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Estill freezing up on loading at \u0022MX2_Reactor, even after uninstalling 4.1.0 completly and going to 5.0.0 mk2 KSPI integration.
