A number of well known mod authors were involved in coming up with those methods, as well as the input from a lot of people over time as they have been discussed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarping is initiated by requesting warp. All players have 15 seconds to click deny warp- which would allow someone who is close to a maneuver or in an unsuitable situation to refuse the warp, triggering a 2-5 minute cooldown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming nobody refuses, after all players have pressed accept or timed out, the players who pressed accept are taken to a screen where they can select warp duration, with shortcut keys to SOI change, apoapsis, periapsis, and maneuver nodes. Players who timed out are presumed to be afk, and are not prompted for warp parameters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce everyone has entered their settings, warp then takes place as a function of the lowest common denominators of speed and duration followed by a 2-5 minute cooldown so whoever reached their destination first can perform their maneuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of having an observation mode, but it should be an opt-in feature so that people who don\u0027t necessarily want to be watched can fly without being observed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my perspective of it, I don\u0027t think multi-vessel physics is even relevant. Each client calculates its own physics and provides that information to the server. Same thing with Krakensbane. The challenge is converting the resulting coordinate stream into objects on other client screens, and having those objects being updated while on rails. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready the KLF plugin is lightyears ahead of other multiplayer systems, as it shows moving markers on the map where other vessels are.

The clients stream the position of their tank to the others, and the code is made to update the positions of the others as much as possible, plus a few bells and whistles to hide some jittering. The problem is, as long as the other\u0027s vessels are far away, you just need to stream the position to display, and the velocity, so the game can make up for a short stop of the update stream. The problem is that when you are close, you cant do that. you would need to stream position, velocity, acceleration, momentum, commands to flaps and stuff. That does not seem too easy to do :/ but i agree i do see a way too. I hope i had some more time so i could collaborate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"notcomplex","CreatedById":61300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T19:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about that, since things like Docking ports and Flaps are just animations, sending just the commands (ie open/close dock) and having the other player call them may be best, all this feels like additional caveats and nothing game-breaking/impossible to do.

Where everyone has the ability to fly and launch everyone\u0027s designs. This would allow you to gather a community of people each with there own strengths and weakness. As for mods you could make it where the mods are saved to the host server or to each client. This may take a bit more coding but Minecraft being a similar style of game play, taking something that works and modifying it to work for KSP would make your life a lot easier.

Your competing say for the K-Prize which is basically getting different achievements before everyone else to get a influx of money. Multiple people can work in one of say 3 agencies on Kerbal competing for their agency. But if you say, need a rescue mission to get a kerbal from an accident in space, you can offer a reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother fun part is with the mining mods/etc, being able to trade. The space station I\u0027m working on right now is at 2m meters orbit around kerbin, designed to be a refueling station, and refinery. Designed to be ran by one kerbal, but habitation for say 20\u002B. Then base rovers which i\u0027ll land on the mun, and use the refueling station to send those out to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer could also unlock doing superstructures both in space and on planets.
