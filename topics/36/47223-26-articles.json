The measurement no longer has meaning - even with the safety off and no radiators whatsoever, it stops growing eventually and just sits patiently while SystemHeat accumulates. Ergo, might as well toss it entirely, and either save the space, or put a SystemHeat readout there. I can see that you\u0027re still internally scaling core lifetime off of core temperature, bt it might be worth scaling it off of thermal output instead - that way, there\u0027s even less of a reason to have core temperature around anymore, and the lifetime readout doesn\u0027t slightly lag behind the reactor operation status anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I recommend cutting SystemHeat storage values for all reactors by 75% or more. Right now I can cruise around the Kerbin system in a vessel with dual DS4G\u0027s (not exactly known for their low power draw and short burn times...) and a MX-4 reactor with just six GR-EXP radiators. You know, those meant for the 0.625m reactor, which have next to no weight or heat rejection ability... and I find myself thinking that I can get away with even less. Just because I can buffer so much SystemHeat and just slowly bleed it off while coasting in between burns. The reactors are kind of balanced with the mass of their radiators included (and the engine balance scales off of the reactor balance), so you might not want to let people cheese it quite this much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T21:20:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, weekend!

Right now I can cruise around the Kerbin system in a vessel with dual DS4G\u0027s (not exactly known for their low power draw and short burn times...) and a MX-4 reactor with just six GR-EXP radiators. You know, those meant for the 0.625m reactor, which have next to no weight or heat rejection ability... and I find myself thinking that I can get away with even less. Just because I can buffer so much SystemHeat and just slowly bleed it off while coasting in between burns.
