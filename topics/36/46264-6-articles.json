The problem with that version was that you had to calibrate the thing every time you turned it on... and it also tended to lose position after a while so it would need to get updated often. So that version was a fail\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I worked on 360 servo driven with a differrent incremental rotation sensor... and it worked... but the big breakthrough was when I found a little sensor package that actually knew the ABSOLUTE angle all the time... so you could turn off the thing and turn it back on and it would instantly know what angle the ball is at. With an incremental sensor you could have the Roll axis at 40 degrees but when you turned the thing off and on again the angle would now read 0 degrees. With the Absolute sensor it would say 40 degrees right away. Makes this sooooooooooo much simpler.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe test version of a single axis worked great but the roll axis burned out the servo... It was also too slow when I put the capsule in a roll so im going with a proper geared DC motor instead and making my own servo system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s this years task... buid a full scale version of the 8- ball, engrave the ball itself and make and laser engrave the front bezel. I\u0027m also using 6 servos to drive the rate and \u0022Fly to\u0022 needles so that\u0027s a simple enough task. I just need to design a stepped housing for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently I\u0027m working on updating my CNC machine to do laser engraving work as well as doing the part cutting.

Inside the ball are two motors and two angular resolvers (as in sensors that detect what angle the ball is at. I found that my incremental sensors were occasionally resetting to zero when the movement was rapid. The Block I command module only had a single 8-Ball and the astronauts weren\u0027t confident about the build quality of the hardware (which was sadly what led to the Apollo 1 fire and the loss in life of Grissom, White and Chaffee) so the Block II command module and LEM both had dual 8-Balls for this very reason. In fact they called the Block I command module a \u0022Lemon\u0022 and Grissom actually attatched a lemon to the NASA logo to point this out. Not a single Block I manned mission was flown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the Apollo 1 fire a tragedy... yes, but I truly think the redundancy they included in the Block II flight hardware is what meant they succeeded in getting to the moon, and more importantly, safely BACK from the the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T07:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmazing work and a very interesting read \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58200-neomorph/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258200\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58200-neomorph/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NeoMorph\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverlapping threads have been merged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T08:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223622766\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002246264\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561102982\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160462\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, James Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmazing work and a very interesting read \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58200-neomorph/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258200\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58200-neomorph/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NeoMorph\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverlapping threads have been merged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T08:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the absolute angle sensor... it all works on a custom hall-effect chip.
