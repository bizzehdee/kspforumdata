My post is mostly taken from the Ares I advanture, so is my conclusion. SRB are reliable, but from what I read they present a higher risk if failing. Neverless, you are right, my argument is about gameplay balance, not realism. Stock SRB, while being too cheap to my taste, do not have gimbal and thats a balancing factor. I believe it would be good if SSTU would balance SRB accordingly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does SSTUVolumeContainer have a cost multiplier field ? it would be quite easy to balance SRB if it had one.\n\u003E \n\nFirst I must note that I have not even begun working on cost balancing of -anything- yet.  Whatever values are present on parts is a \u0027first case best-guess\u0027 type setup.\n\nWell, there are a couple of ways that you can solve this for your personal games.\n\n1.) Each ModelData has a field for \u0027cost\u0027.  Currently these are all set to zero.  This is a cost, per model definition, that would be added to the cost of the part.  You could have some nozzles/bodies/etc cost more than others.  Check in the SSTU/Data/ModelData folder for these model definition files.  \n\n2.) The gimbal range can be adjusted on a per-nozzle basis; so you could have some nozzles with more or less gimbal range than the others (already setup that way, some have larger ranges).  You could make these nozzles cost more than the others.  Check in the part config files for these  \n\n3.)  VolumeContainer has a \u0027costPerDryTon\u0027 setting (per CONTAINER) that determines the cost per ton of tankage mass for that part; this is in addition to the \u0027cost\u0027 from #1.  Currently this is 750f per 1000kg (default value), roughly equivalent to the dry cost for some of the stock LFO tanks.  \n\n4.) A custom \u0027tankModifier\u0027 type could be made specifically for SRBs that had an additional dry-mass multiplier factor; not really needed though since #3 exists and is a less invasive solution.\n\nHowever as noted, SRBs really are cheap and very effective, with fairly good reliability and safety history.  When it comes time for the balance pass (no, were not quite there yet) I\u0027ll make sure these are in-line with the stock SRBs (possibly a bit more expensive because of the gimbal and built-to-order setup) as far as cost / tankage ratio / mass ratio goes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 minutes ago, Theysen said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Last time I had ProceduralFairings installed in 1.1 they somehow automatically worked with the SSTU fairing bases.\n\u003E \n\nThere -**was**- a patch written by  that @JoseEduardo that converted the SSTU fairings to use ProceduralFairings.  However this apparently was broken during the 1.1 update by some changes to ProceduralFairings code/modules, so you\u0027ll need to wait until Jose or someone else has time to fix the patch up.

All of the larger things left are all Series-E / wheel / leg related.\n\nSo... the focus for this week will be getting the SC-E wheel/landing gear parts working.  Undecided if I want to continue/finish developing a custom wheel solution or not; there are a couple... issues... with my custom solution that I\u0027m not entirely sure I\u0027ll be able to figure out in a timely manner.  (Unless there is a Unity/physx expert in the crowd that felt like pitching in some of their expertise?)  Most notably -- how to handle suspension that is at an angle to the ground without applying horizontal momentum to the vehicle?  Already have a fairly good sideways grip/slip model in place and basic suspension mechanics.  Need to figure out the forwards slip/grip/traction/friction model (based on wheel mass vs. rpm vs. suspension down force vs. side-slip angle), and solve the angled suspension-force-application problems.\n\nQuick-and-dirty image to explain force application problems:\n\n![ca8aq8Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/ca8aq8Z.png)\n\nNotice how the net suspension force points somewhere not straight upwards; this results in a general velocity increase in the vehicle whenever the wheels are not aligned perfectly vertically.  This can be seen if, for example, the compression on the front wheels is more than the rear, resulting in all suspension vectors pointing slightly forwards, and thus imparting a forward momentum to the craft.\n\nMy initial... thoughts... on how to solve this would be to only apply the upwards (anti-gravity) portion of the suspension force-vector unless the wheel is -also- colliding with something in front of the vehicle.  But...seems there are some holes in that logic...\n\nWorking very well in the Unity-Editor so far for basic test cases... but did not work very well when I did a quick port/test into KSP (meshes/positions kept ending up.... incorrect).  Could have been a hierarchy problem or code problem... didn\u0027t play around with it enough to figure it out (other than to see that it wasn\u0027t ready/working yet).\n\nWill likely just re-rig the landing gear to work with the stock module and attempt to use it for now; really not fond of the stock setup, but it should be workable now that I\u0027ve split the models off to their own parts.  Will likely a ton of reworking of the model hierarchy in order to get things compatible with the stock module (which requires re-rigging and re-animating everything... ughghhghgh...).  Alternatively I might try and use the KF wheel system if/when it is updated for 1.1; apparently Lo-fi had at least some of the KF wheels semi-working in-game; and it is likely that his module will be a better fit for my parts than the stock module.\n\nAnyhow... you guys keep playing with things, keep finding bugs and issues, and I\u0027ll keep squashing them.  Judging by some of the craft you all are posting it seems like most of the parts and functions are fairly stable and problem free, but given the complexity and interaction with some of these parts I\u0027m sure there are still a few large bugs hiding in the cracks somewhere.\n\nWith any luck we\u0027ll be able to start moving onto the initial balance passes next week, and the first stable releases probably a couple weeks after that.

I might be able to zero out any non-gravity-vector related component of the force.... but then you would lose the ability to use wheels/etc as bumpers as they would only act in the direction opposite to gravity.\n\u003E \n\nI wasn\u0027t talking about wheel colliders.  Either way, the force exerted by the ground on the wheel should be perpendicular to the ground (again, if it\u0027s not rolling) ... is it even possible to figure out the angle to the ground based on the position of the wheel?  The angle that the wheel is attached at should not matter, only vector between the center of the wheel and the point of contact to the ground.  Of course, that should be determined relative to the position of the wheel. which will be affected by suspension, but the suspension itself should not exert and external forces on the wheel assembly (rather, it\u0027s an internal thing that affects the position of the wheel\u0027s center relative to the suspension parent)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T19:54:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 40 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I wasn\u0027t talking about wheel colliders.

When at stable-state the suspension would -not- exert any lateral force; lateral forces would only be exerted while the suspension is actively decompressing (and while actively compression the lateral force would be opposite).\n\nHmm... going to need to track previous suspension compression/forces and integrate vs. those \u002B the new values.... ahh... physics are so... wonderful?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T20:04:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T20:18:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Obviously there is something fundamental that I\u0027m missing or overlooking here as real angled suspension does not impart forward velocity once the suspension has \u0027uncompressed\u0027 (and during decompression it depends on if the wheels are free to roll or \u0027locked\u0027; if all wheels are \u0027locked\u0027 the suspension would either not decompress or force the wheels to slide (which would/could impart momentum to the vehicle)).  Probably something simple...\n\u003E \n\nEvidently I\u0027m not doing a very good job of explaining this, but I\u0027ll try one more time: The suspension exerts two equal and opposite forces: one on the suspension root, and one on the wheel hub.  Those forces are both exerted on the same part, so it results in no net force.  The only external force on the part is from the ground on the wheel (ignoring joints to other parts of course), which does not care about what the suspension is doing except insofar as it affects the position of the wheel\u0027s center relative to the suspension parent.\n\nMy advice: for a first pass, treat the suspension as completely rigid.  The tire itself should act as a (very rigid) spring (and even rigid wheels do to an extent), so that\u0027s where you will get your restoring force from.  Once that\u0027s all worked out, then maybe think about how the suspension affects the position of the wheel due to internal forces."}]}
