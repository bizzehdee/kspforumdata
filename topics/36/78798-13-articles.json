Not for alpha - I want to get folks gathering and testing as fast as possible - but definitely on the books. The rub is making sure people do not game the system by going on rails with insufficient power to run their extractor and excavator. And that gets tricky with solar panels, etc. so I need to noodle over something that\u0027s nice and abstract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022togfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022togfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot sure the game engine permits that but I\u0027m guessing its possible with .... programming.\u003Cp\u003EModel is looking awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, I love this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Angel-125\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Angel-125\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDefinitely doable. When the vessel comes into focus, the mod would need to retrieve the last time it was in focus as well as the current time, then compute the difference between the two. by knowing the extraction rates, you\u0027ll know how much karbonite you\u0027ve pulled from the environment.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh - handling rates is the easy bit.

I\u0027m on a plane today, most of the core parts are done, just handling the extractor and it\u0027s animations (resolving a collider issue, need a texture). Initial parts pack is just going to be the 2.5m set - extractor, tank, and converter. I\u0027ll whip up a truss platform for the belly extractor, and that will pretty much be it.
