Ordering by Isp doesn\u0027t really work because different engine technologies have entirely different stat weights - you can find tier 4 engines with less Isp than the PB-ION (even after the nerf that NFP applies to it out of pure necessity) because there are tradeoffs between Isp, thrust, power usage, cost, fuel type and several different derived factors. And then you get to tier 4 where engines start sporting variable Isp numbers that are adjustable mid-flight... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 1: PB-ION, Gyro-One\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 2: AFTER, S-IE Twin Ion, Gyro-Two, Gyro-Quad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 3: Hi-SNAP (basic and 12-cluster), the three MPDTs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 4: DS4G, all three PITs, and all three VASIMRs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall performance differences between tiers follow a roughly 2 - 3 - 5 - 7 scale, so there\u0027s quite a major difference between a 3700 Isp KP-XL PIT and a 3800 Isp (post-nerf) PB-ION that isn\u0027t visible in the Isp at all.

They do a... tenously acceptable job at that, at least the Type 2 and the Arcjet, while the Resistojet is much weaker. But if you apply Near Future\u0027s stat calculations to them, then the Resistojet is a (weak) tier 1 engine, the Ion Type 2 is between tiers 1 and 2, and the Arcjet is firmly a tier 2 but only in one of its two modes, with the other being catastrophically understatted. I\u0027m not sure if that information helps you place them. I\u0027m personally restatting them for my playthrough anyway, since their stock numbers are awkwardly all over the place.
