The games I\u0027ve been involved with are pretty much Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Freelancer, Terran Conflict, and of course, KSP. And those are just the ones I remember well. With that being said, this is not the first time I\u0027ve seen a post like this. Now it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve seen a post like this, but it\u0027s not the first time. Posts like these pretty much plagued the Oblivion modding community back several years ago, and so many people would get wrapped up into a project that was doomed to fail from the word \u0022go.\u0022 The big warning sign was typically a new member with low post count asking for \u0022applications.\u0022\n\nThe successful projects are those of which something is on the table; the person looking for the team has already done some kind of work, and is showcasing to demonstrate that the person is serious about this. \n\nSo, you want a coder on your team eh? Ok, put something on the table then, and then we\u0027ll talk."},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:01:41Z","Content":"Britain \n\n18-\n\nStudent\n\nY\n\nI have recently been learning how to make part mods and would love to cooperate with some other moders, I also have a friend who might be interested."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:20:24Z","Content":"Ive seen a lot of these type of threads come and go. Let me tell you how I started - and you can read the Kerbal Foundries thread to draw your own conclusions... I was unhappy with wheels. Particularly their lack of suspension adjustment. I searched high and low for mods that could rectify this, asked a few questions and met with answers like \u0022oh, it\u0027s baked into the parts, you can\u0027t change it\u0022. Well, not to take anybody at their word, I started digging. I found the unity docs, which suggested otherwise, along with some outdated stuff on the wiki on how to make a KSP plugin. With little experience as a programmer and none making a game mod, I set about figuring out wheels in KSP. Along the way, people have decided they like what I\u0027m doing and joined the project. Not because I asked them really, more because they liked what I\u0027ve been doing and felt they could contribute. It\u0027s both awesome and humbling. 50k downloads and 300,000 thread views later, and I\u0027m still gobsmacked by the support I\u0027ve been offered on my incredible journey into game modding. But it wouldn\u0027t be here now if I hadn\u0027t picked up the tools and show people my vision - such as it was - for a KSP mod.\n\nSo my point is this: if you\u0027ve got a vision, pick up the tools and show it. Others will follow, assist and contribute if they share that vision."},{"CreatedByName":"JaffaFediration","CreatedById":112619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:13:57Z","Content":"Okay, good advice"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:25:54Z","Content":"LOL.
