Normally they come with more durability than wheels not to mention their advantages in rough and steep terrain, like better traction.

Think mining vehicle from the \u003Cem\u003EArmageddon \u003C/em\u003E movie - completely unrealistic in the implementation, but still cool. Also, think Jawa Sand Crawler...massive yet still mobile.
