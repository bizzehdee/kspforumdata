I think something like this would be a great benefit to animators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally with everything I have learned in the past few weeks, I can now repeat the process for the main gear, then move on to the remaining parts which I suspect will be much easier to set up. Obviously the torque arms wont animate \u0022correctly\u0022 yet, but at least the worst is already behind me. If and when the necessary means to animate them become available I\u0027ll revisit this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne outstanding issue though is animating and controlling the behaviour of the intakes. This is of course just for aesthetics, since it is the actual stock sabre engine bahaviour that determines when to change modes. Tying the animation of the intakes to the functions of the engines is something that can be looked at, but not by me because I don\u0027t code. lo-fi already offered to help with some aspects of the intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-11T19:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2014 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
