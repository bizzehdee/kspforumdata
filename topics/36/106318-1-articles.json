I\u0027ve rearranged the tree so docking, ladders, wheels, lights, fuel cells, etc. all appear much earlier. There shouldn\u0027t be any *type* of technology used in Apollo that\u0027s not available by the 90-point tier. High powered rockets and sturdy capsules, however, are not in the start node. To fill the interim, I\u0027ve included a few parts from Rubber Ducky\u0027s Bargain Rocket Parts in the first tiers, as well as a few low-end contracts to highlight these parts.\n\nIn terms of philosophy, I\u0027ve tried as much as possible to make each node stand for a conceptual development, such as *rendezvous* or *semiconductors*, as opposed to being part-oriented (*docking ports*,*probe cores*) or just super-vague (*Specialized Construction*,*Advanced Flight Control*). This is not a probe-first tree. If you want more unmanned options in the early game, I suggest using this along with USI Sounding Rockets and dtobi\u0027s Smart Parts.\n\nI\u0027ve also made a few adjustments to make career mode more palatable in general:\n\n1. Basic action groups are always available. (Some of us like pure IVA.)\n\n2. Doubled the part count limit for level 1 VAB/SPH from 30 to 60. (You\u0027ll need this for potato battery rovers.)\n\n3. Halved kerbal hiring cost. (It\u0027s their dream job!)\n\nAll stock nodes still exist and are close to their original position and cost, so other mods shouldn\u0027t be broken. Configuration is included to map Community Tech Tree node names to this tree.\n\n**Download:** [**https://www.dropbox.com/s/0efwvntf7lngxsx/WhereYouComeIn-1.01.zip**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0efwvntf7lngxsx/WhereYouComeIn-1.01.zip)\n\nThe download includes material under the following terms:\n\nBargain Rocket Parts by Rubber Ducky licensed Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nModule Manager licensed CC ShareAlike\n\nContract Configurator under the MIT License (portions under GPL)\n\nCoherent Contracts by Peter Collings (\u0022peadar1987\u0022) and William Cornwell (\u0022Xacktar\u0022) (non-standard license described in the download)\n\nCommunity Tech Tree by Chris Adderley licensed Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)\n\nAll other portions not otherwise under license are made available as Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T00:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rhoark**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:02:09Z","Content":"TBH I don\u0027t think there\u0027s demand for another one of those.

I made sure it was playable in that the nodes don\u0027t cost too much for the available science, but that was just sweeping the problem under the rug. I want the tree to promote a period of suborbital missions, but there\u0027s not enough there to make that fun. I was thinking initially of recommending USI Sounding Rockets to go with this (a recommendation that still stands), but looking at the USI catalog I was reminded of Bargain Rockets. A few select parts from that in the start node (rebalanced so they\u0027re not as unreasonably effective parts), plus some suborbital contract ideas I have, and this will start to come together."},{"CreatedByName":"Woorloog","CreatedById":116298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:28:23Z","Content":"Whoah, someone\u0027s actually doing what i\u0027m searching for?\n\nNice. Wasn\u0027t really keen on starting my own mod just to make the career mode somewhat playable.\n\nI\u0027d prefer a tech tree that does not require any additional mods though (everything needed to play should be available in one pack, i think).\n\nPerhaps you should just focus on making the tree to make more sense, and reduce the importance of historical-like progression? Not sure a \u0022period of sub-orbital\u0022 flight really works in KSP, not as there\u0027s a limited amount of things to do on Kerbin.\n\nBTW, my own ideas included having a Probe core in the starting tech but deliberately no batteries or solar panels. This way, you could use a probe core to test out crazy things without endangering your kerbals but it\u0027d also limit them quite heavily as you need a liquid-fuel rocket to provide them with constant power.\n\nHowever, I think merely fixing the tech tree doesn\u0027t really solve the problems of KSP career, it is fundamentally a hodgepodge of elements and the moment, elements whose interaction is rather limited, i think. And there are issues like \u0022What do with science once you have researched everything?\u0022, and the fact each career is largely identical as it is (on paper, IMO, anyway, not sure what others think)."},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:17:56Z","Content":"Everything core to the experience will be in a single download. Bargain Rockets is licensed Creative Commons, so no problem there. I\u0027m not going to use the whole pack - just a selection of parts that fill specific holes in the progression. I\u0027ve finished rebalancing them to more realistic levels. The original pack made them nearly as effective as regular rocket parts - now they\u0027re as terrible as you\u0027d expect given how they look. (I\u0027ve been researching such things as the adhesive force of duct tape and the potential energy of a potato battery.) That lets me fulfill the mission statement of providing a *type* of part very early, without stealing the thunder of later nodes.\n\nI don\u0027t want to force a lot of suborbital missions, but I want to make it a viable and appealing path. Grinding experiments near KSC is not fun, which is why I\u0027m making some contracts as well. I\u0027ve planned a set of 12 one-time missions (4 each with a pilot, scientist, or engineer theme) to diversify missions in the neighborhood of KSC. That\u0027s what I\u0027m working on now.\n\nI\u0027d like to enable earlier unmanned missions, but not with full real-time control like regular probe cores. I\u0027m considering one or both of two options: a limited probe core that ignores pitch/yaw/roll controls; or bundling dtobi\u0027s Smart Parts (auto-staging on timer or altitude triggers)."},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:41:09Z","Content":"This has been updated as described in the first post.
