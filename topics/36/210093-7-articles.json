I think they would be much easier on the eyes if you increased the lightness slightly and reduced the saturation a bit on both the red and yellow bands.

However, I think they lose a bit of their \u0022identity\u0022, so to say. I think Duna in particular would do well with having its hue adjusted slightly towards the red, making it closer to the stock planet in hue while keeping the more realistic lower saturation of the version you\u0027ve made here. This would make it more reminiscent of its stock version, rather than just being Mars-coloured. Maybe also adjust Eve\u0027s clouds/atmosphere \u003Cem\u003Eever so slightly\u003C/em\u003E towards purple and away from blue; the current version looks more like a blue-grey planet with a purple and green tint, rather than a purple planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOvok looks amazing, but I think Mun, Dres and Tylo must be the most beautiful among all the worlds you\u0027ve made so far.
