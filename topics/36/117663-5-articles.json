I suspect there\u0027s a problem with your default animation positions for that component.  If I\u0027m right you should be able to reproduce by simply creating any new animation (I created the animations in KSP 1.0.5)."},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T04:28:26Z","Content":"[@nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/), I looked through your animations, and you didn\u0027t use any mixing transforms.

That would probably fix your issues, although mixing transforms wouldn\u0027t at all work for animations that affect the entire skeleton.\n\nThere is a way, with code, to make mixing transforms not apply to their children bones (shoulder -\u003E arm -\u003E elbow, etc.), which would allow you exclude specific bones, (such as the jetpack bone) but I didn\u0027t include it in the UI because programming with the old GUI system is quite tedious.\n\nAlso, I bought the game off the KSPStore, so I don\u0027t have access to the pre-release, which is why I haven\u0027t started updating this mod, or any of my other mods. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T04:29:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 04:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T05:01:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 28 minutes ago, MrHappyFace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/), I looked through your animations, and you didn\u0027t use any mixing transforms.

Anyway, wasn\u0027t a major issue for me to worry about it at the time - just wanted to let you know in case it was indeed something that needed fixing on your end.\n\nAlthough I didn\u0027t try to get animator itself working, the API only needed that one change.  You\u0027ll have to add the new KSPUtil assembly reference and maybe change a handlful of references here and there, but otherwise I don\u0027t actually expect you\u0027ll have many issues.
