On most spacecraft, I see very little reason to surround the reactor with insulators (reactor heat really isn\u0027t a threat to the vessel), and the spacecraft would be much larger. Thus, my experiment - with only a reactor, pod, and wings - is unfairly biased \u003Cem\u003Eagainst\u003C/em\u003E the wings, due to the unrealistically small \u0022stealth radiator.\u0022 Balance experiments should attempt to duplicate the large \u0022stealth radiator\u0022 capacity that will be available (at no extra mass or cost to the player) for most spacecraft designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are a few situations where an insulator might be useful. For instance, if I were using a lot of high-heat ion engines, I would probably use the following basic layout (from back to front):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines - Aft section (high maxTemp parts only) - Insulator - Reactor - Fore section\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe insulator is there primarily to protect the reactor from engine heat. As such, I would probably add a heat pipe from the reactor to the aft section (across the insulator, basically making it \u0022one-way\u0022 insulator), so the reactor would still be able to use the entire ship as a radiator.
