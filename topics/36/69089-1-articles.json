There\u0027s no appreciable difference for me, though I do have a beast of a computer. KSP doesn\u0027t use much more than one core, the others mostly sit there twiddling their thumbs. The mod also disables physics alltogether on the map view instance, which makes things a lot easier. GPU wise the map view isn\u0027t very intense as it\u0027s mostly empty space. You can also configure the settings for it separately to your main KSP to reduce the frame limit, resolution, and quality settings. Probably the biggest limit for most people will be the RAM usage; as it stands I wouldn\u0027t try this mod with anything less than 6GB.

So if anyone else struggles with that, here\u0027s my suggestion: I created two shortcuts of KSP (one of the server KSP and one the client KSP) with the \u0022 -popupwindow\u0022 target added. I use these shortcuts to fire up the server KSP and then the client copy, then I use the Windows \u002B shift \u002B left/right arrow hotkey once the client KSP has fully loaded.
