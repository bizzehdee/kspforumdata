Ship-Core -- spacecraft and general parts (SC-A/B/C/E and SC-GEN parts... decouplers, fairings, rcs, science bits, etc)  \n\n2.) Tanks -- MFT tanks, upcoming MCB cargo bays, any/all future fuel-tanks and containers  \n\n3.) Engines -- All of the engines and SRBs  \n\n4.) Lander-Core -- all the lander-specialized parts (currently the lander pods, lander fuel tanks, and specialized lander decouplers; in the future will just be the pods as the tanks are going to be redone and moved into the TANKS category/package).\n\nNow, the biggest problems that I\u0027m facing are the general assets layout that I have in place and the massive amount of texture/model sharing that is done between many of these parts.  \n\n1.) Service modules use at least the textures from the engine that they are based on.  Would need to duplicate these assets across multiple distributions, or find some \u0027common\u0027 folder for them.  \n\n2.) Mounts and nosecones get used -everywhere-.  These would have to be distributed with both the tanks and engines packs.  \n\n3.) RCS models and textures -- not too much of a problem as these would be in the Ship-Core pack with the parts that use them.  \n\n4.) How to allow for a clean installation process -and- a clean uninstallation process for individual pack?\n\nCurrently I\u0027m thinking the directory setup would be such as:\n\nGameData  \n\n|--SSTU  \n\n         |--Plugin  \n\n         |--Data (model data files, resources, etc; pretty much just as it is currently, would be distributed in its entirely with most packs; text files don\u0027t take up too much space)  \n\n         |--Flags (common folder, distributed with all packs)  \n\n         |--FX (common folder, distributed with any packages that need it)  \n\n         |--Props (common folder, distributed with lander and ship core packages)  \n\n         |--Resources  \n\n         |--Mounts (models/textures; asset folder only, no part configs, would be installed by either/both of tanks and engines packs)  \n\n                 |--Assets  \n\n                 |--Data (mount model data? might just leave it in the above data folder)  \n\n         |--Engines  \n\n                 |--Assets (but how to allow the ship-core parts to use these without duplication?)  \n\n                 |--Parts (config files)  \n\n                 |--Patches  \n\n         |--Ship-Core  \n\n                 |--Assets  \n\n                 |--Parts (config files)  \n\n                 |--Patches  \n\n                 |--Spaces  \n\n         |--Lander-Core  \n\n                 |--Assets  \n\n                 |--Parts (config files)  \n\n                 |--Patches  \n\n                 |--Spaces  \n\n         |--Tanks  \n\n                 |--Assets (including all texture-switch textures; no more separate download pack)  \n\n                 |--Parts (config files)  \n\n                 |--Patches\n\nSadly, this would require re-exporting every single ~~part~~ model that I\u0027ve made (to update their internal texture url reference), which... is in the hundreds, and more work than I really think it is worth.  Would also be a pretty major disruption to the current work-flow, and would require at least 5x the amount of time to do the packaging / updating threads / posting every time there was an update (which is already one of the most time-demanding parts of modding).\n\nStill in the concept validation point on all of this stuff.  If I can\u0027t find a -clean- way to do it that doesn\u0027t require completely reworking and re-exporting every-single-model, then I\u0027ll likely just stay with one giant monolithic distribution and let users trim it as they see fit (possibly including some instructions/notes on what goes with what though to make it a bit easier).  Seeming like this is probably the way it will end up -- I cannot think of any way to solve the texture-sharing problems without a common assets folder.  (Yes, sometimes I make these posts just to think through the problem; easier to spot problems when it is all laid out in text)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T20:49:26Z","Content":"Lot\u0027s of dillemas in that kind of split. Why split the shipcore into 3 seperate mods though? There are only a hanful of tanks, plus where would the HUS/ICPS go? Keeping tanks and engines together would be most logical as the mounts are shared between all of them.\n\nThe only way to do it otherwise is to bundle the textures with each of the seperate mods. If someone installs them all, then the same folder is just overwritten.\n\nDirectory makeup example: (just for the textures, you can do they same for plugins etc).\n\nSSTU/ShipCore/..  \n\n../ShipCore/PodTextures/..  \n\n../ShipCore/EngineTextures/..\n\nSSTU/Tanks/..

Each mod will be self-contained though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T20:54:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T20:54:34Z","Content":"Honestly it is looking highly likely that I will -not- be splitting the mod up.
