My tracks come out like that the same as the large RBI tracks and I\u0027m at loss to explain why, though I have a suspicion it\u0027s to do with having a skinned mesh in the part... There seemed to be some normal issues with the skinned mesh going into Unity, so I have a nasty feeling something is seeing it as a huge open part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the icon get made by part tools and compiled into the .mu? Or procedurally in the game? Is it possible to create a custom icon without PartCatalog?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any insights you might be able to give.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T15:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to show us what you mean.
