And add the caveat like shadowsutekh mentioned, and also note that future updates may break crafts. When you get ready to release you can set up a thread in the releases section.\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027d say probably 90% of what I\u0027ve learned from cfg files I have learned reading through BobCat\u0027s, CORE, KW, and NovaPunch cfgs. BobCat and CORE\u0027s cfgs taught me how CoMOffset works to help balance heavy loads on top of a booster, and looking at stuff like the KW fairing bases helped me learn how the attach node coordinate system works. I also learned a lot from UbioZur\u0027s \u0027welded\u0027 parts using the MODEL nodes, that you can assemble a module that the game sees as a single \u0027part\u0027 that physics acts on as a whole (like right now I am developing the Mars Transfer Vehicle frame like the one in this video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUBhn3_P3hU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E), but doing so using off-the-shelf parts (since I fail at Blender). Right now I think I am using stuff from NovaPunch and the RogerCorp girder pack (which I had to do the PART {} wrapper to bring into .21) Bac9\u0027s B9 pack is also a great place, because of the way he re-uses textures and models - you can basically create multiple rescales of a part just by adding multiple configs in the same folder as the model and texture. This way the game only loads the model and texture once.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve actually been considering of building the mars transfer vehicle to be used with the SLS as a project down the line. But its something I will most likely be doing or atleast modeling. Ive been looking at bobcasts CFGs and I just get confused because Im not really sure what Im looking at and what they are referencing when it comes to unity what needs to be unity so the config can recognize it you know? Took me forever to figure out how to get my core stage off the ground. it is a bit overwhelming for me right now, since i am trying to learn unity for KSP and UDK and max right now for school. But I guess Ill have to rip the Configs a part.

A lot of the time the actual center of the part model is where KSP calculates the center of mass of the part once it\u0027s brought into the VAB. Because of this, rocket boosters that have a large payload will have a high center of mass and then your rocket will not be as stable as a balanced rocket would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to say that BobCat\u0027s method is to set the orientation (so 0, 0, 0) to the base of the rocket (say, the Ares V booster, which is a mono-block part like your core stage, the fuel tanks and engines are one piece.) So if you bring up the part in the VAB and show the center of mass, the node is all the way at the bottom, and then when you add a large payload, you\u0027ll see the COM is moved upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the CoMOffset line in the cfg does is allow you to manually move the center of mass point away from it\u0027s default position in the model. I\u0027ve had an issue with lighter payloads on Absolution\u0027s CORE series, where lighter payloads didn\u0027t move the COM up far enough and had issues maneuvering during launch (and even, if it made it that far, at maneuver nodes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way that CoMOffset works is just like the attachment node coordinates work...you have to add (or subtract) along one of the axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as an arbitrary example, say you have an object that has a low center of gravity. It\u0027s 5 meters high, and the COM is at 0, 0, 0 (where, in this example, the top of the part would be 0, 0, 5.) If I wanted to perfectly center it, I\u0027d add this to the cfg:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ECoMOffset = 0, 0, 2.5\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...because we want to move the point up (plus) the Z axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that just like attachment nodes this doesn\u0027t just work along Z axis. You can move the center of mass on a radially attached part to help bring it more towards the thrust axis, which would help balance something say, like a shuttle configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stevincent\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stevincent\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIm not really sure what Im looking at and what they are referencing when it comes to unity what needs to be unity so the config can recognize it you know?

I believe you have to add an empty object in Unity where you want the \u0027flame\u0027 to be so to speak, and then this is tied in with thrustTransform. Don\u0027t take my word for it though as I never got that far with Unity, but there\u0027s plenty of other modelers which would be able to provide better assistance in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stevincent\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stevincent\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIve actually been considering of building the mars transfer vehicle to be used with the SLS as a project down the line.
