It is normally retracted when driving in-atmosphere, to prevent damage. The 250 km antennae are used to control nearby rovers, separated MoLab modules, or to transmit basic telemetry in conjunction with a satellite with a large dish. The long-range antenna allows periodic contact with mission control or a planetary base where no satellite is available to accommodate the short-range antenna, and also allows better data transfer rates. For example, the MoLab might be driving during the day, transmitting data on temperature and atmospheric pressure and such, or its current position.
