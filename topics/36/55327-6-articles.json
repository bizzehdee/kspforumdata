It really wasn\u0027t meant at all to be used multiple times across different bodies/orbits, or really to be used at all outside of Kerbin orbit -- thus why I only allowed high orbit observations. Due to the way the science system works, I can\u0027t tie it all into the same type of observation (AFAIK), so basically my only other options are to make pitiful science returns that require you to boost the telescope to different bodies (which doesn\u0027t make sense, because you wouldn\u0027t see any difference in observations), or to outright disallow the use of the telescope around other bodies (which, as I\u0027m sure we can all agree, would be pretty disappointing).

However, this DOES give me an idea. Have tech level determine WHAT you can view. So Low Tech would be for closer things. Mid tech would be for farther/smaller things (Moons, etc), and High tech would be for smaller/further things. It makes technological sense, too, and not just in magnification. Sure, if the Hubble telescope was in a geosynchronous orbit it\u0027d be able to take FANTASTIC pictures of the ground, but it isn\u0027t.

Should I have put the parts in another (not KSP GameData) folder, as well as the ships? When I ran KSP after installing CactEye (and KAS, Hull Camera, Action Group Manager) KSP told me that the few flights in progress couldn\u0027t be rendered because all the required parts were not found. Both (un-Kerbed probes) ships just disappeared, and the VAB had no parts whatsoever in it. I shut down KSP, uninstalled CactEye, and then had to go re-research every single (previously unlocked) part in the tech tree. I knew CactEye was a WIP (heck, so is KSP for that matter) so I didn\u0027t get all aggro, but after reading on this thread it seems that other people have been having luck with this mod, so I figured that it was most likely something I had done wrong.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed with another poster, do it manually.

This is possible I think, just not when inheriting the ModuleScienceExperiment like your plugin does. You would need to use IScienceDataContainer and recreate the experiment that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this method you can point the module to whichever planet you want the science experiment to apply to. Normally you would just use something like vessel.mainBody, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any reason why you couldn\u0027t just always point the experiment towards Kerbin, so that every experiment thinks you are in Kerbin orbit, regardless of where you actually are. You can check out the SCANsat or the Tarsier Space Tech source (or mine if I can ever get it working right), those are the only two that I know of that use this method, but there are probably others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit more complicated to use IScienceDataContainer, but it gives you a lot more flexibility in how you can set up your experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
