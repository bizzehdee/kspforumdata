From the last update it seems like work on the landing gear was the big hold up? I might be late to the party on this one seeing as you already seem to have the landing gear modeled, but if that is still the hold up maybe just try use the B9 landing gear (at least for testing purposes?). Yeah it won\u0027t be ideal, but looks like you\u0027re trying to reinvent the wheel (heh) and I wouldn\u0027t want that to delay this truly awesome mod indefinitely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T16:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverything with the exception of RCS thrusters is modelled and unwrapped, that includes nose gear and main gear, cargo bay doors, and side doors for kerbals. All the doors are now rigged. I managed to make a realistic cantilever bay door mechanism and plug door mechanism of which I\u0027m quite proud. The landing gear could have been rigged a long time ago except I\u0027m still not completely sure how to make things work in unity. It\u0027s not as simple as I\u0027d like, or maybe people just aren\u0027t explaining it well. I don\u0027t see the point of using existing wheels. Afterall if Bac9 can make them then I should be able too and if I used his wheels I\u0027d have to mod them anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually a detailed noobie gear tutorial is something this community REALLY needs including all the components like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Shock absorbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Working torque arms (I\u0027ve never seen those in KSP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Turning functionality\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deployment animation (parenting, constraints etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Free rotation with constraints for multiwheel gear axle beams.
