Ideally it should operate by having the coordinates of the target designated then the munition is released where it flies to that point; like all guided ballistic ordnance as long as you give it enough energy (JDAMs are great for lofting) it should make it to target just fine. I\u0027d take a quick peek at the config and see what the drag modelling is for that baby and go from there. If it doesn\u0027t have any control surfaces, then those need to be added to the munition so it\u0027ll adjust its course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a thought, you could give it a gimbal rate of about 5-7 (I don\u0027t know what the current gimbal rate you\u0027ve been using for your JDAM) and adjust the thrust and fuel to about 1/10th TWR but give it a burn time of about 30s and set the ISP to 4000 or something so the fuel weight is minimal, which would give a decent enough approximation until someone corrects the model - the fins on the tail section are supposed to be all moving.
