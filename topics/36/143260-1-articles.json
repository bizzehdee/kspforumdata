I\u0027m trying to figure out how to do something with git, and\u00A0I\u0027m posting here because it\u0027s KSP-mod-related\u00A0and because so many mods are on github that there must be a high degree\u00A0of git expertise\u00A0here; this may be a trivial question for some of you. I\u0027ve been reading\u00A0git tutorials and guides and so on, which so far has only made me feel like I have some sort of git-specific learning disability; I still have to rely on googling \u0022how to do \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;svn command\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E in git\u0022 and praying that my situation is close enough to what the resulting blog post is doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve done so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nClone\u00A0the KerbalEngineer github onto my local disk sometime around September 2015 (version 1.0.18.1 according to the old\u00A0ASSEMBLY_VERSION, though its changes are subsumed into 1.0.19.1 in the latest changelog)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlay\u00A0around with it for a while locally (to add a US customary units option)\u00A0without running any further git commands\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLet it sit for a while, so\u00A0I ended up with uncommitted changes to an old version\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinally create\u00A0a github account\u00A0within the last few weeks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFork\u00A0the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E repo onto my github account (so, ~9 months after my initial clone)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCommit my changes to my local repository (I think? It shows up in git log, anyway)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChange the remote of my local copy from the originally cloned main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E branch to my own forked branch (I think?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPossibly some other things; regrettably I\u00A0did not take careful notes while researching and experimenting\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I stashed anything\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to bring my changes up to date and clean them up enough to submit a pull request (if that\u0027s how it works?).\u00A0Current state:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ngit diff --cached shows the changes that everyone else committed since September that don\u0027t conflict with my changes (which makes me think I must have staged those after a merge, if that\u0027s a thing)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngit diff shows BuildAdvanced.cs (whole file changed? but I don\u0027t remember what I did to it, so I\u0027d like\u00A0a better diff) and\u00A0Units.cs (my core changes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngit status says I\u0027ve staged everything but those two files, so presumably I need to resolve conflicts on them:\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn branch master\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour branch and \u0027origin/master\u0027 have diverged,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand have 1 and 38 different commits each, respectively.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 (use \u0022git pull\u0022 to merge the remote branch into yours)\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have unmerged paths.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 (fix conflicts and run \u0022git commit\u0022)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome of my changes are in neither git diff nor git diff --cached, but are present in the working copy; I hypothesize that these are the things I changed that didn\u0027t have any conflicts. So they\u0027re already committed, even though they depend on changes that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0committed yet?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I want it to be in this state; I want to see \u003Cem\u003Emy changes only\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in a diff, and all together in one diff only,\u00A0with everyone else\u0027s changes already incorporated, as if I had made my changes originally on the current branch. Is that possible? If so, how do I get there from here? Am I supposed to\u00A0\u0022cherry pick\u0022 my local commit?\u00A0If not, what\u0027s the better way? This has got to be a fairly common use case, if not the most common (clone/fork a project from github, commit/push changes, submit a pull request), so I feel like I\u0027m missing something (scratch that, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Esure\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I\u0027m missing plenty in general about git).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, how do I keep my github fork up to date in the meantime? I don\u0027t want to get out of sync and have to do this all over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any help!
