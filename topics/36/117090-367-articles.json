Perhaps one day if I\u0027m bored I\u0027ll have to dig into it as I\u0027m never fond of a mystery.  I\u0027ve opened an issue ticket on it just to make sure it doesn\u0027t get forgotten about ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/768](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/768) )."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-08T16:01:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been having a problem that might be the stock game, but I\u0027m unsure.\n\nI had a CSM, It grabs a station part from a petal fairing. The OMS engine I have on it is the next part to be staged, then the last thing to stage is the capsule icon. I hit the spacebar, and the SM decouples from the capsule.\n\nI\u0027ve had this happen a few times.
