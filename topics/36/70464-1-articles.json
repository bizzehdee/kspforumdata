[Justin Kerbice contribution]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI\u0027m speechless. The wait is killing me. I have been looking for that since, well, since approximately 1924 when I realized KSP mod community was so productive. Keeping track of updates or new mods is so difficult that I always end up giving up and having a totally outdated/broken installation.\u003Cp\u003EA few ideas, don\u0027t know if they are technically feasible, or even smart, but as you asked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Possibility to manually assign priorities to individual mods, later used when auto-updating/auto-redownloading/auto-reinstalling all mods. This would be very useful for mods or part of mods that overwrite part of the files of other mods. A \u0022ranking\u0022 or whatever column would be displayed, and unique numbers could be set for each individual mod to sort the download/installation order. Mods without ranking value would be treated normally, perhaps alphabetically, but after ranked ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add possibility to manually add an URL associated with a mod, for those not on Spaceport or those hosted in weird ways that will prevent automation of updates. That way, one could at least use a key\u002Bclick combination to reach the forum thread and check version, or any repository. Automation is of course ideal, but I\u0027m sure some mods will always be difficult to automatically update. In case of forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com thread, your application would recognize the URL and check for \u0022Last OP edition\u0022, thereby providing a dirty way of warning the user that there is something new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Some sort of patch manager for mods, I-have-no-idea-how. What I am thinking about is mods like TextureReplacer that are most often customized by users using the combination of textures they like the most, or even configuration files. Perhaps a \u0022simpler\u0022 way would be to right click on a mod an get a list of files in its GameData\\Folder, with option to lock them to current version despite future updates. That would work for texture files, but would be trickier for configuration files if the new versions bring new features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If no mod version information is detected in the mod, display date of last local update. In conjunction with feature 2, this would be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, be the ideas feasible or not, dumb or not, thanks for this great initiative.

The wait is killing me. I have been looking for that since, well, since approximately 1924 when I realized KSP mod community was so productive. Keeping track of updates or new mods is so difficult that I always end up giving up and having a totally outdated/broken installation.\u003Cp\u003EA few ideas, don\u0027t know if they are technically feasible, or even smart, but as you asked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Possibility to manually assign priorities to individual mods, later used when auto-updating/auto-redownloading/auto-reinstalling all mods. This would be very useful for mods or part of mods that overwrite part of the files of other mods. A \u0022ranking\u0022 or whatever column would be displayed, and unique numbers could be set for each individual mod to sort the download/installation order. Mods without ranking value would be treated normally, perhaps alphabetically, but after ranked ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add possibility to manually add an URL associated with a mod, for those not on Spaceport or those hosted in weird ways that will prevent automation of updates. That way, one could at least use a key\u002Bclick combination to reach the forum thread and check version, or any repository. Automation is of course ideal, but I\u0027m sure some mods will always be difficult to automatically update. In case of forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com thread, your application would recognize the URL and check for \u0022Last OP edition\u0022, thereby providing a dirty way of warning the user that there is something new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Some sort of patch manager for mods, I-have-no-idea-how. What I am thinking about is mods like TextureReplacer that are most often customized by users using the combination of textures they like the most, or even configuration files. Perhaps a \u0022simpler\u0022 way would be to right click on a mod an get a list of files in its GameData\\Folder, with option to lock them to current version despite future updates. That would work for texture files, but would be trickier for configuration files if the new versions bring new features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If no mod version information is detected in the mod, display date of last local update. In conjunction with feature 2, this would be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, be the ideas feasible or not, dumb or not, thanks for this great initiative. I guess I\u0027ll keep one more tab open for days and refresh it regularly to check for updates and download links. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Because each mod file to install is a different world (Multiple GameDatas, only one GameData, any GameData at all, Parts files inside main zip or inside a folder...), currently the software asks you what to install and what not and will ask if you want to overwrite something, so if a mod would overwrite something but you install it first, when you install the mod that was going to be overwritten you can tell it to only install files that does not exist.

You have to create your modlist carefully before sharing it with others, but when done, you know your bunch of mods will automatically install flawlessly on every machine even though some mods in your list are meant to alter files of previous ones in the list. My ranking suggestion is also for manually setting a sequence for mods detected in GameData. For instance I currently have ActiveTextureManagement, SoundTrack Editor, TextureReplacer, and the Renaissance Compilation. When updates will be published, I don\u0027t want to update Renaissance Compilation first.
