It stands to reason Kerbals do have advanced computers and data storage. So, maybe add a percentage progress bar for each body? Every sample gathering mission would contribute to filling it. Small probes would add only some data, while manned mission should be able to fill it completely. I\u0027m thinking about Eve mostly - building a lander capable of lifting off and achieving orbit is problematic. I\u0027d hate to strand a crew there just to get some data when i could send 10 unmanned probes. Data gathering would be costly and long, but risk to personnel would be minimal. But how to get data from probes to science capsule? Especially if it\u0027s hard or impossible to return them physically (Eve again, Jool atmosphere) - some sort of radio transfer would be useful. Capsule would have to stay in range for entire data gathering and analysis period. And the process should be quite long. Maybe some sort of science module? For example modified Hitchhiker: half of crew capacity, it\u0027s heavier and requires a lot of energy. And at least one Kerbal constantly present. And it could check inhabitants Stupidity level \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E - less Stupidity overall?
