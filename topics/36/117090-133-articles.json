Defined in SSTU\\_MODEL blocks, in GameData/SSTU/Data/ModelData/XXX.cfg.  The \u0027central tank\u0027 doesn\u0027t actually have any attach nodes associated with it; they are added through the mounts.  Specifically the \u0027mount-none\u0027 types add a node at a zero-height offset from the top of the tank (top of tank is defined in the tanks model config file, through the \u0027height\u0027 and \u0027verticalOffset\u0027 fields).  Other mounts use their height/offset/node specifications to determine node locations (e.g. look into the multi-adapter model definitions for info on how to do multiple attach nodes for a cap/nose/mount).\n\n2.) Again, that info is in the SSTU\\_MODEL config files (GameData/SSTU/Data/ModelData/XXX.cfg).  All main tank segments, mounts, adapters, etc, should have their volume listed in their model definition file.\n\n3.) If you want the volume-based resource handling your choices are A.)SSTUVolumeContainer, B.) RealFuels-ModuleFuelTanks, C.) ModularFuelTanks-ModuleFuelTanks.  The SSTUModularFuelTank does not touch resources, period.  You need to use one of its supported resource-manipulation-modules, (A, B, or C).\n\n4.) No, those are defined on the CONTAINER level (in SSTUVolumeContainer), further modified by container-type/modifier-type; the SSTUModularFuelTank doesn\u0027t touch those stats/cannot influence those stats.  A single part will use the same tankage ratio stats for all sub-models.  If the tank models are really so different that they would have different tankage stats, that is a good indication it belongs as a completely separate part.\n\nEdit: \n\nTankageVolume = volume lost from the raw volume due to insulation, domed tank-ends, bulkheads, etc.  E.G.  1000l tank, with a 0.15 volume loss = 850l usable space.\n\nTankageMass = a fraction of the (filled) resource mass for the tank that represents the structural mass of the tank.  This is based on the mass of the resources for the chosen fuel type and the post-tankage-volume-loss volume value.  E.g. 1000l tank, 0.15 volume loss = 850l usable volume.  Filled with LFO, this would give a resource mass of (850/5)\\*0.001 tons (0.85t, 850kg).  With a tankageMass of 0.15, this would result in a tank dry-mass of 0.85 \\* 0.15 = 0.1275t (127.5kg).  Lighter/less dense resources will thus naturally have a lower structural/dry mass for the tank.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T17:55:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T18:01:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 11:02 AM, Gordon Dry said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It seems it has something to do with\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/89214-11x-distant-object-enhancement-bis-v171-28-april-2016/\u0026do=embed\u0026embedComment=2605366\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0026page=16#comment-2605366\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Logs are there...\n\u003E \n\nTaking a look at those logs...\n\nYou\u0027ve got -major- issues with a couple of mods, but not a single error related to SSTU plugin code.\n\nThe first worrying thing, corrupted orbit information for your vessel; this will cause major issues in the game; you\u0027ll need to find whatever is causing that and fix it:\n\n    [WRN 16:28:13.345] [OrbitDriver Warning!]: GD Saturn C8 01 \u002B GD ION Engine probe 03e Debris had a NaN Orbit and was removed.\n    [LOG 16:28:13.346] ObT : NaN\n    M : NaN\n    E : NaN\n    V : NaN\n    Radius: NaN\n    vel: [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n    AN: [0.731871694933476, -0.681442456965517, 0]\n    period: NaN\n\nSecond:\n\n    [EXC 16:28:13.373] NullReferenceExceptionDistantObject.VesselFlare.Update (Vector3d camPos, Single camFOV)DistantObject.FlareDraw.Update ()\n\nWhatever is causing the corrupt orbit is likely causing this null-ref.

A few new config options that they don\u0027t explain...\n\nThe most important things to get set properly are \u0027engineHeight\u0027, \u0027engineYOffset\u0027, \u0027engineScale\u0027, \u0027engineMountDiameter\u0027, \u0027engineSpacing\u0027, and the two toggles for the upper/lower mount options.  Okay,...so pretty much every line in the configs is important to get them properly setup.\n\nGood examples of using others\u0027 engines can be seen in the SSTU-SC-ENG-NRV engines, as these use the stock LV-N model (at three different scaling factors, so you can see how easy it is to scale stuff (hint.. just change the scale value ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ).  Other examples exist from the rest of the SSTU engines, but some stuff is not applicable to them as they use specially setup/located models (e.g. the SSTU stuff doesn\u0027t need any vertical offset as the model is built intentionally for the plugin).  If you need explanations on any of those specific fields please let me know."}]}
