Not the most elegant I suppose, but would be easier for it to snap together with very little rotation needed. Another idea would be a \u0022flap and spike\u0022 approach. Basically on the female side of the CBM have a set of flaps (animated would be nifty) that are set at like 45 degrees or something. The male side has a sort of \u0022spike\u0022 on each corner (again, animated would be nifty) that fits in the gap between adjacent female flaps :3 This approach would allow alignment without dependence on initial direction, so long as the initial direction was at least reasonably on-axis xy with the area vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: will make a sketchup to better illustrate. brb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ov5CKB1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ov5CKB1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should give you the basic idea.
