I think its called experimentalMotors. As for cost they all could use a boost, I would say about 1000 for the med wheels, 1500 for the large, 4k for the tracks and 10k for the repulsors. Not sure about the repulsors really, they are a bit OP but fun, maybe even more higher cost? These are just what I am using right now based off part cost for the stock wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rivvik","CreatedById":77232,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T13:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you do, please make them controlled by IR joints!

Basically a scripted set of instructions that could be activated by action group. This would allow for \u0022effortless\u0022 activation of complex transformations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy new idea is to have certain presets available. So lets say I want to set a gantry to have three presets, one at 0, one at 50, and one at 100, and I could tie each preset to an Action group. I remember B9 an Firespitter\u0027s VTOL engines used a similar system. This would also allow for transformations but the timing would still be difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T14:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, here\u0027s the plan: I\u0027ll crank out the next repulsor alpha with the surface version included and hopefully tweakscalable.
