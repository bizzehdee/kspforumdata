But I\u0027m working in regular stock scale, so the problems aren\u0027t just associated with rescaled systems.  I\u0027d like to also add one additional observation.  People have commented that things look good once the transition to scaled space takes place.  I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it, at least not in my case.  For me it\u0027s when I cross the altitude of the final scatterer config point that things seem to fix themselves.  For example, in the following images my final config point is set at an altitude of 160000.  In the first screenshot I\u0027m at an altitude of 161000, and in the second 159000.  You can see a marked difference between the two.  In this case my PQS fades out at 140000 and deactivates at 180000, so I don\u0027t think that has anything to do with it.\n\nEDIT:  The dark artifact along the planet\u0027s limb appears between approximately, 30% cfgPoint1 \u002B 70% cfgPoint2, and \u003C100% cfgPoint3.

Thanks in advance!~~\n\n**Solved. Use the config tool on the literal front page of the mod.**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-20T01:27:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2019 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Messier**"},{"CreatedByName":"GameCheckTV","CreatedById":193031,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-17T14:51:51Z","Content":"I just installed Scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E for my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E Mods.
