We are working on a Redstone right now for when you want to launch your capsule into suborbit. It will not be able to achieve orbit. For that, you\\\u0027ll have to use the Atlas. Right now, the Atlas has not been done, because we have a lot of work to do on Redstone. I\\\u0027ll have some pictures of the Redstone when I get a basic texture going, but doing the capsule has been work enough on its own. The Atlas, of course, will be able to get you into orbit, but you won\\\u0027t really be able to fine tune the orbit with the capsule, and here\\\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMercury couldn\\\u0027t really change its orbit. It could tilt this way and that way, but it didn\\\u0027t have linear thrusters like the Gemini that could boost into different orbits. This is why a lot of people look at the Mercury as a tin can. You put a guy in it, shoot him into space and let him control very little of his orbit after the booster cuts off. This isn\\\u0027t to say this mod is going to be boring. There\\\u0027s still a lot to do and we\\\u0027re going to be putting a hatch on it. You can do EVAs from the capsule if you\\\u0027d like, but right now, no such hatch has been put on -- primarily because the part tools for hatches have not yet been released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast of all, we will be making a Little Joe Rocket.
