You may or may not have to adjust node positions, depending on what else you changed and how you did it. In theory, rescaleFactor adjusts node positions proportionally. In practice, it kinda depends on what other numbers you may have fiddled with. I think that if the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E thing you changed was rescaleFactor, and the model\u0027s scale isn\u0027t weird, monkeying with the node position numbers shouldn\u0027t be necessary, they are scaled with the rescaleFactor, in theory -- it used to work that way but I\u0027m not sure that it still does. I do know that now, if you changed any of the other scale numbers... the interaction gets weird. Particularly if you monkeyed with the MODEL scale numbers. In one particular resize I did, I had to modify the scale numbers by 0.5 to cause a rescaleFactor of 2 to place the nodes in the intended position using their original numbers -- this is because the model was rescaled by the square of rescaleFactor, whereas the node numbers are simply multipled by the rescaleFactor, when I was monkeying with the MODEL scale. Or maybe they were interacting with both. Still not exactly sure, if you don\u0027t monkey with the MODEL scale -- I\u0027m not honestly sure what it does -- could work the same way, but I\u0027ve never tried it; I\u0027m always playing with the MODEL. It\u0027s weird, but the point is, you don\u0027t have to modify the node numbers if you play with scale and rescaleFactor in such a way that the numbers balance out. Whether that\u0027s easier or harder than just adjusting the node numbers depends...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-09T23:15:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2013 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T12:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I did was change rescaleFactor from 1 to 0.5, and rename the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
