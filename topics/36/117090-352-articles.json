See link for change-log and download links.\n\nWith this release I feel the mod is about where it should be for a \u0027KSP 1.4.x Stable\u0027 release; just took a few extra months to get there....   I\u0027m sure there are still bugs and balance issues that will need to be addressed, but all of the major game-breaking bugs that have been reported have been fixed and it should be generally \u0027usable\u0027.\n\nMy plans over the next few months will be to continue the clean up effort across all of my mods, and continue with general maintenance and upkeep.  While I don\u0027t have any plans to start into new part development in the near future, I would certainly like to take advantage of the new modular part features that I spent so long working on.  Probe bus systems, modular service modules, more cargo bays and structural parts -- tons of unexplored concepts.\n\nOn the list for cleanup is (in no particular order):\n\n- Kerbal Foundries Models -- find/fix the Unity Project files so that I can actually re-export these models with updated names/settings/scales/etc.  For some I do have Unity files from older versions, others will require importing the .mu models into Blender and re-rigging.\n- Clean up of Textures Unlimited shader setup -- consolidation of shaders into fewer variants that use keyword driven feature setup.\n- Kerbal Foundries PBR Pass -- once I get the model files sorted out, I\u0027ll be able to rip these through SP for some tasty new textures.  Chrome hubcaps ftw..  (optional add-on download to activate PBR)\n- KSPWheel Conversion Patches -- set of patches for stock and other mods\u0027 wheels to convert them to use KSPWheel.\n- SSTU PBR Conversion -- Drop legacy shader support.  Create default PBR textures for all non-recolorable parts.  Aim for a more unified texture scale and color scheme across parts.\n- SSTU Tanks/textures update -- I had done some initial work on a texturing scheme for tanks that allowed for better patterning and texture re-use, but still had a lot of \u0027work\u0027 to do on it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-30T17:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2018 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Electrocutor","CreatedById":109593,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-01T00:43:49Z","Content":"Does that mean you think the 1.4.5 version will be going full release or still waiting on that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-01T11:19:51Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give 1.4 another try."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-01T14:47:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, Electrocutor said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does that mean you think the 1.4.5 version will be going full release or still waiting on that?\n\u003E \n\nAt this point I think the distinction is in name and forum location only.  Calling it a \u0027full release\u0027 won\u0027t change any of the gaps in the mod, but giving it another ~6mo\u002B for further development isn\u0027t going to change much either.  I have a pretty good handle on what will or will not be breaking changes, and have been practicing the \u0027breaking changes only during major KSP version updates\u0027 for awhile now.\n\nSo.... perhaps?  Really wouldn\u0027t change too much.  With KSP 1.5 coming out later this month, seems like that might be a good time to make the move -- would give some time for additional balance updates and cleanup, and possibly to start getting some craft files/etc created."}]}
