Especially when I mix stock parts with my own - I can place nods in a way so parts are not perfectly fit and then in most cases nothing blows up (but connections between then seem to be very very weak) or place nods they way all fits perfect and watch some fireworks :/ If someone could give me a hint how to sort this out - or how to place nods to minimize the risk of collisions and structure failures \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If someone knows: should I place node_collider as close as possible to original mesh size or it is no that important and simple box somewhere in the middle of a model is fine? and if so is node_attach - so the surface attachment node related to node_collider or same cords as node_stack_x I export with KSP Vector Tool? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Parts balance is a thing to test out (i pity those kerbals that already died due to my failed test attempts) but if someone has tips especially for engine .cfg I would be very grateful especially that my goal is high speed flight and accelration in atmosphere and from what I found on the forums it seems in 0.16 high g-force and how it affects whole structure has changed dramatically compared to previous versions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance for any help and please don\\\u0027t be to harsh on me for my English.
