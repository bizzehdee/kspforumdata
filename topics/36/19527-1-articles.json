I think its a very cool looking ship that can be launched from the surface. Instead of building a ship in orbit for interplanetary or interstellar travel you could launch it with only two stages. Obviously I would change the overall design of the ship to avoid any infringement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The first stage would be liquid aero spike boosters in order to get the ship in to space( 3 or more depending on weight, balance and stability) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The second stage would be a large ion engine that would continuously accelerate you until the half way point of your journey and then turn the ship around to decelerate.(This would be at the discretion of the user if he just chooses to wait until pariapsis) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill post details later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe command pod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.2kgames.com/civ5/images/thumb/2/21/036_SpaceshipCockpit.png/200px-036_SpaceshipCockpit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022200px-036_SpaceshipCockpit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stasis/Crew pod (this part would also be able to carry some cargo but would also be interchangeable with a module just for cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSaj49AHH13oTBqX5zds33znnI1RMwSyp1i6J8gweGw6hQUqC_w\u0022 alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSaj49AHH13oTBqX5zds33znnI1RMwSyp1i6J8gweGw6hQUqC_w\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ion Engine( Thinking about making a smaller module that goes above it that would power it, something like a fusion/fission plant)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR5BpzPl8B3r3TCenV7b7EsGag9j7L4axlIX4wMSC_Lgfy1cLGa\u0022 alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR5BpzPl8B3r3TCenV7b7EsGag9j7L4axlIX4wMSC_Lgfy1cLGa\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospike liquid boosters, would be able to radially attach as many as you need depending on weight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAmo2hiRgHFBl9OEsk7b7F6Ve6VqgmleZcvGzMCOMAeDG1VujqDQ\u0022 alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAmo2hiRgHFBl9OEsk7b7F6Ve6VqgmleZcvGzMCOMAeDG1VujqDQ\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-18T00:23:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2012 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Amilianus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPictures\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amilianus","CreatedById":33996,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T00:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would really appreciate some help from some experienced mod builders as I am a noob to this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pluto100","CreatedById":26442,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T01:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks awesome!
