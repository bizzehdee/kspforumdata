Place those that don\u0027t map back to horizon.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E The idea would be to stash some info on how transparent the atmosphere should be using alpha. Ideally, we\u0027d use one blending pass to set it to a known value for the screen, and then any elements that shouldn\u0027t have as much atmospheric effect would have a different alpha value. Then when the atmosphere goes to do alpha blending, it would use the dst alpha in its blending (likely as a modifier to the additive effect by pre-multiplying the color with src alpha.)\n\u003E \n\nI would say that isn\u0027t really necessary, as long as we can get the distance that is lit correctly, we can do the blending directly depending on this length and the results of the scattering.\n\nBtw I switched the shader from alpha blending to soft-additive (1-dstcolor, 1), coupled with a multiplicative atmospheric extinction pass before-hand, like with the orbit shader, I think it gives softer and less foggier results and lets more of the original color shine through, but looks thicker around sunrises/mornings and sunsets, because of dimmer dscolor.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-19T02:00:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2016 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T16:51:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Could you post some screens?

Also, I have to talk about the current limitations of the method so maybe we could think of solutions, and also because they would be more obvious with clouds. I\u0027ll explain with some images as it\u0027s easier to get the point across, and also for everyone else who happens to read the thread:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So basically when I do the scattering I get the scene depth from the depth buffer and compute the amount of scattering based on optical depth, assuming the whole segment is receiving light, pretty straightforward.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![TDCq6Oj.png](http://i.imgur.com/TDCq6Oj.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now when I want to render a godray, I have to get only the length of the lit section. For this I extrude the geometry edge along the direction of the light and write it to the depth buffer. This works nicely when looking straight into terrain and along the direction of the sun.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![qTBEEM0.png](http://i.imgur.com/qTBEEM0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, say we are looking sideways from a sun, and a mountain in the distance is projecting a godray, we need the length of the two lit sections, the current method only returns the length of the first lit section.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![QtJhS2P.png](http://i.imgur.com/QtJhS2P.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In practice this results in it looking like this, where everything behind a godray looks like it\u0027s in shadowa dn the transition is harsh.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![8zibkP0.png](http://i.imgur.com/8zibkP0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To get around this I though I\u0027d render the depth of the backfaces separately and then using the depth of the frontface minus that of the backface I\u0027d get the length of the unlit section, which I\u0027d then substract from the total length, returned by the regular depth buffer. This should work nicely but I haven\u0027t tried it yet. And usually with terrain the viewing angles are limited enough that one godray\u002Bscattering in the background would look believable in the majority of views.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However with clouds it gets really complicated, we now have an arbitrary number of godrays.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![uNuORnX.png](http://i.imgur.com/uNuORnX.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is what I\u0027m thinking about now, how to get the lengths of all the lit or unlit sections.
