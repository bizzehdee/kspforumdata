I\u0027d almost bet that it\u0027s KIS or TACLS more than anything else. I also run a \u0022technically outdated\u0022 mod called Science Containers that adds experiment storage abilities to all command modules yet that is far more simplistic in implementation than KIS or TACLS and less likely to be the culprit. I did discover already that if you are running KIS/KAS it\u0027s *NOT* a good idea to enter one of the modules if you have anything in your inventory. On my game that will not only certainly cause the loss of those items but it has a tendency to eat kerbals when I do that. All of these issues are no real worry though since I keep backups of save games. It allows me to test out new stuff with fully modded games to see how well things work together but it does make tracking down issues a bit tough if I don\u0027t have a lot of time to futz around with it."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:45:11Z","Content":"I pulled USILS and it still happened.
