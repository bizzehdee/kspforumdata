I will look into it. The yellow part that is the containment unit is \u0022theoretically\u0022 able to be jettisoned. The problem however is that KSPI only supports reactors that are in stack with the other parts, and if the containment portion of the reactor is attached via a decoupler on a stack node perpendicular to the engines or generator they wont function. So I had to hard attach the part. I plan to add a detail ring around the reactor area like the dual solar panel has, and add warnings for the faux \u0022explosive bolts\u0022 and I am going to try to see if there is a way to make it work, like making the housing a dummy reactor or something so that they see the two pieces as a whole piece, that could be KAS attachable, but that is not going to happen any time soon if my experience with KSPI thus far is any indication. Love the mod, but I don\u0027t know who is in charge over there at the moment, so it is making it hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking maybe a control panel to \u0022manually eject\u0022 the containment unit... I don\u0027t know if it matters if it actually does anything. I am basing the way it looks off of the building I know that this is in space, but I guess I figure that the vast majority of what goes on happens inside the ship... I don\u0027t want to make it livable because its not somewhere you want to live ... radiation... I think some day someone will make a mod, or the devs will make it so you can walk around inside the ship but until then I wont worry about insides. Could you clarify about the greyish middle? I have only ever seen one portable reactor inside my friends sub when he was working on one, and asside from it being made of metal the core didnt have any overtly grey area that I saw, of course most everthing is painted to avoid corrosion in a sub so...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T22:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok uhm i\u0027m just wondering if this works with 0.24.1? lack?
