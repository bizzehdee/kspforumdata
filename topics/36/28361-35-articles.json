Stop giving in to these silly requests. I\u0027d actually suggest taking down the Released thread, and leaving the DL in the Dev thread. People seem to think that this mod is \u0022finished\u0022 and are gripping about silly things. Look at the Kerbin Orbiter mod. That thing has 4 dependencies, plus custom ATM and BolderCo folders that make the parts look marginally nicer at the expense of my poor GPU. You have 4 lightweight dependencies: Firespitter (who doesn\u0027t nowadays?), MFT, (which also is a \u0022soft dependency, so to speak, because the resupply module is useless with out TAC-LS) CLS, and Ship Manifest.

Considering the KSP lighting model doesn\u0027t do self-shadowing very well (if at all), I\u0027d expect the net effect being that the parts with interior lighting cause everything around them to glow.\u003Cp\u003EFor the cupola part, I can see making the change, since it has large viewports already. For the cylindrical parts? Those viewports are small, and it seems like the payoff on the change is pretty small. I\u0027d have to see it in-game, and see what the performance impact is, before I could say for sure, but based on my experience with KSP, I think sticking to emissives would be the better choice for portholes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving IVA lights for the viewports was merely one of multiple reasons for implementing JSITransparentPod on the Karmony-series modules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - A while back, I wanted to make the Hab windows light up separately, to represent the four individual sleeping compartments and the galley area; until JSI RPM, this wasn\u0027t possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I thought it would also be neat to see Kerbals going about their business inside the modules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It would also be cool to have window shutters that Kerbals can manipulate in IVA; again, this is something that JSI RPM has now made possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of performance, I had a vessel composed of 30\u002B Karmony Hab modules with the JSITransparentPod enhancement, with no impact on FPS. Having more internal props shouldn\u0027t matter, and even with the internal lighting, I believe I can limit the number / range of the spotlights as to not have any adverse effects. But we\u0027ll cross that bridge when we get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EUhm please don\u0027t do this.

So that, looking in from outside, one would see what appears to be a 3-dimensional interior, but is really just a 2D image on the inside of a sphere. This \u0027view\u0027 would be attached to the VNC (Viewport Node Cover), you understand. I don\u0027t know if this would even work, you\u0027d have to work out some way of not seeing or clipping through the surface of the Node Module itself. Meaning that if one doesn\u0027t have a VNC installed, you\u0027d see the regular \u0027hatch\u0027 texture that it already has. But if one installs a VNC, it would have to somehow \u0027override\u0027 that section of the texture so that one could see the image of the interior. Hopefully that\u0027s clear enough of an explanation to get my point across. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThis, unfortunately, would be a bit too much work for little gain - I would have to model and texture a fully-fledged IVA for the nodes first, and then do the jiggery-pokery required to project a view of that on the concave surface of a hemisphere.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a thought... hatches / IACBM docking ports with windows.
