There\u0027s an entry on the bug tracker; hopefully it will get an official fix soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the meantime, I\u0027ve been trying to do a ModuleManager patch. I\u0027ve identified a key-value pair that apparently triggers the bug (as in, it seems to be a hook into the main engine where the bug actually lives). It\u0027s not in the part config, but is added when saving a craft on servos that are placed in mirror symmetry mode (only one one side of the craft though). It looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EMODULE\n{\n    name = ModuleRoboticRotationServo\n    // other stuff\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0mirrorRotation = True\n    // more stuff\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, for existing craft that didn\u0027t have this value already, the mirrorRotation value defaults to False, so the bug isn\u0027t triggered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I\u0027m trying to do is make a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch that can either delete or set the value to False at runtime, or when the craft file is saved, or something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-20T04:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninteresting - beyond me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmight want to post this in the ModuleManger thread and ping. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119688\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@blowfish\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-20T06:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, doh.
