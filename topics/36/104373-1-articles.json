There are two identical but resized Lithium storage tanks (I may or may not make them different for different size I have not yet decided) and a 1.25m and 0.625m engine (I think the 1.25m model will be final probably but i will improve on the texture, i think im going to alter both the model and texture of the 0.625m with time) \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/hsASR)\n\nthe things I need to do with these models are: \n\n- improve textures and normals\n- add custom particle FX - complete!\n- add fairing for 1.25m engine - complete!\n- add emissives (didn\u0027t work on the 0.625 for some reason even though I\u0027ve never had trouble with it before, need to go back and look where I have gone wrong)\n\nother things I need to do overall:\n\n- add Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) - complete!\n- look at how to make resources continue to deplete while away from ship\n- possibly add a Tokamak fusion generator\n- 2.5m and 3.75m LiLFA\u0027s\n- maybe add some [concentrating solar panel arrays](https://www.eeremultimedia.energy.gov/solar/sites/default/files/photo_pv_commercial_solartac_colorado_2011_high_0.JPG), bulkier, thicker, heavier, but produce a lot more energy\n- balancing the engines to make them fit their real life specs with respect to the kerbal universe (scaled at the same proportions of real life ion thruster- ingame ion thruster, and then altered a bit because if I did this they would be OP and require a silly amount of power)\n\nSince this is my first time doing something like this is am all ears to suggestions and advice, things might change around quite a lot and there are a few things I am toying with the idea of doing which might require me to delve into plugin making, I also am open to advice about integration with other common mods (especially tech tree integration mods) because I have no idea about how to do such a thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T16:57:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T13:56:23Z","Content":"Nice stuff!
