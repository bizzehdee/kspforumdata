Alternatively, hacking together a halfway decent mk2 nuclear reactor shouldn\u0027t be too hard, and would give an excuse to use the new stock radiator parts.\n\nthat would be pretty nice - at the moment, I am putting the regular KSPI reactors into cargo bays. If you make a stock-based reactor, I could put together MM configs to convert them to the KSPI reactors - there are two different generator parts, and at least 4 different reactor types in KSPI, so I would end up with 6 parts with the same model then... \n\nalthough, truthfully, I think the reactor-in-cargo-bay may make more sense in a realism sense. Also, practically speaking, I am also then able to attach small convenient parts (science experiments, antennaes, the smallest radiators) to the reactor in the protection of the cargo bay. The Electric Engines parts pack has Mk2-form batteries (they seem to not quite match up to either Squad\u0027s or your mk2 parts).\n\nThat said, that parts pack mainly has some decent electric propellor parts, and some electric-turbojet parts. They are all of the regular cylindrical persuasion though.\n\nThey are weaker than similar fueled parts (being basically really advanced propellors, rather than something like a nuclear thermal turbojet), but have the advantage of working in any atmosphere, and not requiring fuel (great for spaceplanes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)).\n\nI would LOVE to have aerodynamic solar panels - I love making tiny little electric planes in early career for Kerbin (or later for a Duna lander and the like) (or just for fun), and all the current options either have terrible drag profiles, or require me to land to recharge [without ripping off the panel]."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:26:05Z","Content":"Work slowly progresses on Mk3 stuff: \n\nWIP engine for heavy/superheavy planes, should also help with landings. \n\n![anO6rnA.gif](http://i.imgur.com/anO6rnA.gif)\n\n2.5m jet engine, with working thrust reverser."},{"CreatedByName":"TrainEngie","CreatedById":138031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T05:52:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Work slowly progresses on Mk3 stuff: \n\u003E WIP engine for heavy/superheavy planes, should also help with landings. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/anO6rnA.gif](http://i.imgur.com/anO6rnA.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.5m jet engine, with working thrust reverser.\n\nYay, thrust reversers!\n\nWait, how do you get the shadows in KSP?
