version 0.0824 you can now generate atmos directly from the in-game UI. Previous versions still need to use the config tool.**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Config tool is no longer Directx11 only, there are dedicated builds for mac and linux.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This config tool will allow you to generate new precomputed tables for the atmosphere, basically this is the only way to tweak atmosphere colors.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t updated this in a while but you can ignore the planet name field.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Rg is the planet radius (it says diameter in the tool but it\u0027s wrong) Rt is the height of the atmosphere. RL is the limit of the atmosphere but it works weird.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (Keep in mind it is not important what the actual value of Rg, Rt or RL is, what matters are the ratios Rt/Rg and Rl/Rg, Rg is automatically scaled to your chosen planet\u0027s radius, Rt and RL are scaled by factors of ChosenPlanetRadius/Rg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, you don\u0027t need to change Rg from the original value, just copy everything into KSP and it\u0027ll rescale automatically.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Half heights are the height in km that half the particles are found below. If you modify Rt and Rl you have to modify these or you get artifacts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To use this, just enter your settings and press generate, if you\u0027re satisfied with the result, copy the .raw files (ScattererTool\\_Data\\Proland\\Textures\\Atmo) and  manually open the .xml file (\\ScattererTool\\_Data) from the tool folder and copy the settings into your planet of choice\u0027s settings.cfg file in the scatterer folder and replace the files in the scatterer mod folder with them. As of scattererv0.024 (1.1 compatibility update), scatterer now uses .half files, any .raw files will be converted to .half IF NO .half FILE EXISTS. Therefore copy the .raw files like usual and delete any existing .half files, the new .raw files will be converted automatically to .half, you only need to distribute the latter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry this is a bit messy, I\u0027ll try to update this tool soon.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s an example of what you can do with the config tool: ![GGCwDqj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GGCwDqj.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And the result in KSP:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![GEiwBoB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GEiwBoB.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![yA9XJGW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yA9XJGW.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Some more ingame examples:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115408-WIP-Scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-mod-%28v0-0151-20-05-2015%29?p=1848985\u0026viewfull=1#post1848985](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115408-WIP-Scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-mod-%28v0-0151-20-05-2015%29?p=1848985\u0026viewfull=1#post1848985)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/FAswdO2.png](http://i.imgur.com/FAswdO2.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E\n\n**How to report Issues (important, please read if you want your issue taken into consideration)**:\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For correctly reporting issues read this and follow the instructions, **if you don\u0027t follow the instructions, your report will be ignored**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3151626649\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:193px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Follow the template, if you\u0027re too lazy here\u0027s the copy-pasted, adapted example:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Quote\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **KSP:** 1.3.1 Windows 64bit\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Problem:** Flickering ocean\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Mods installed:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Scatterer 0.0324\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements 1.2.2-1\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Reproduction steps:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E With ocean shaders enabled, default scatterer settings: Launch a ship from KSP, look at ocean, ocean flickers (appears and disappears) very quickly.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Log:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003Clink\u003EOutput\\_log.txt (preferably dropbox or pastebin link)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Copy this, fill it in, add your log file and submit it.

The game\u0027s traditional Anti-Aliasing (multi-sampled anti-aliasing: MSAA) is disabled and replaced with post-processing AA (SMAA) or Temporal AA (TAA). Attempting to re-enable the built-in AA in-game will result in artifacts around objects. This is done for several performance and compatibility reasons (the traditional AA limits the kind of effects we can implement). If you go back a few versions there are (older and worse) versions that offered support for both at a big performance cost.  \n\nThis post explains why this is done:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022104258\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed801204568\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip19x-112x-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-00831-01022022-scattering-improvements-in-game-atmo-generation-and-multi-sun-support/\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=3908432\u0026embedComment=3908432\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:293px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n- Shadows may look bad on the default quality preset. This is actually how the game\u0027s default shadows look, pick a higher scatterer preset for better (and slower) shadows.\n\n- Check other known issues here: [https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/issues](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/issues)\n\n**Changelogs**:\n\nSpoiler\n\n***********v0.0838***********\n    - Fix map view icons and UI elements jittering with TAA enabled (especially noticeable at low framerates)\n    - Fix scaledTextureAdjust feature causing visible seams/artifacts on the planets from orbit\n    - Fix ocean shader not working at all and forming weird geometric shapes on some mobile AMD GPUs\n    - Fix sunflare not working on Linux due to a path case issue\n    - Fix white atmo on slower iGPUs\n    - Fix some nullrefs and leaking gameEvents (thanks @linuxgurugamer and @gotmachine)\n    - Fix mod not loading if EVE is present (introduced in 837)\n    \n    ***********v0.0835***********\n    - Fix TAA breaking when using Waterfall and Tufx HDR together\n    \n    ***********v0.0834***********\n    - Fix TAA breaking with atmosphereless bodies and becoming a smearfest\n    - Fix TAA randomy disabling with TUFX\n    - Use TAA by default on the default preset and upwards, the lower 2 presets still use SMAA\n    - Expose TAA settings\n    - Fix UI window being unclickable/undraggable on lower screen resolutions\n    - Fix Bruneton tonemapper causing artifacts with bright colors\n    \n    ***********v0.0831***********\n    - Fix even slower GPUs still getting white sky and crashes (also delete your atmosphere cache folder)\n    \n    ***********v0.0830***********\n    - Fix white atmos on slower GPUs (also delete your atmosphere cache folder)\n    \n    ***********v0.0829***********\n    - Restored compatibility with 1.9.x 1.10.x 1.11.x, alongside 1.12.x\n    - Restored compatibility with systems not supporting 3D textures\n    \n    ***********v0.0828***********\n    - Fix interaction between eclipses and city lights causing white planet surface (mostly noticeable on night side)\n    - Fix \u0022missing property _MainTex\u0022 log spam on gas giants\n    \n    ***********v0.0827***********\n    - Fixed wrong scattering on ships near atmosphere edge (most noticeable as blue tint appearing on ships in orbit)\n    - Fixed flickering sky in reflections (most noticeable on TU parts)\n    - Fixed flickering clouds in reflections (most noticeable on TU parts)\n    - Fixed mirror image on scaled planets with in-game AA set to off\n    - Fix broken multi-star lighting on scaled planets with eclipses on\n    \n    ***********v0.0825***********\n    - Fixed 1/4 res scattering causing scattering to be insanely bright\n    - Removed dependency on .half files and config tool, atmospheres are now generated directly in-game and cached in \u0022ScattererAtmosphereCache\u0022 folder in GameData. Button in-game for clearing this folder if needed. Removed assetPath param.\n    - New UI to easily generate and preview atmospheres in-game, with options for easily rescaling and thickening/thinning atmosphere, and an option for a quick preview to generate a lower-quality atmo very quickly. Rescale keeps the same looking by making the atmosphere taller and thinner at the same time to conserve the same look.\n    - Rt And RL params Removed, atmosphere height is now calculated on the fly from the parameters you enter (scale heights \u002B scattering coeffs)\n    - ExperimentalAtmoScale param removed, use the rescale button\n    - GlobalAtmoScale param removed, replaced with scaleAtmosphereStartRadius in atmo generation tab directly\n    - openglThreshold param removed\n    - Fixed extinction not scaling correctly with atmosphere scale, improved blending of atmospheres (when atmos are in front of each other)\n    - Fixed horizon related issues where line-like artifacts and a break in the shading appear around the horizon level. A line can still appear on the horizon on very thick atmos, if that happens, the atmo needs to be made thinner or rescaled (taller atmo with lower scattering params will look the same but avoid the artifacts), disabling multiple scattering can also help.\n    - Fixed concentric circles/ring artifacts appearing on planets/scattering\n    - Fixed band on the horizon, previously worked around with viewDirOffset param, viewDirOffset param removed.\n    - Fix planets with tall atmos being lit on the dark side\n    - Fix clouds being lit on the dark side\n    - Added option to use single scattering if needed, or you prefer the look for a given planet. Multiple scattering can diverge and become unnaturally bright and show horizon artifacts on very thick atmos, a solution is to disable multiple scattering and to rescale the atmo to be taller.\n    \n    - New more natural looking blending mode, more hdr-like blending\n    - Removed projector mode, incompatible with new blending mode.\n    - Added uncharted tonemapping mode for the atmosphere, produces more vibrant color tones and better contrast, less haze, added ability to switch tonemappers or disable them if you want to use your own tonemapping (TUFX or other).\n    - Use the new blending for clouds, preserveCloudColors option is now mostly redundant but it will be kept\n    - Fix clouds on other planets sometimes getting dimmed when it is night time on your current planet\n    \n    - Support for light from secondary suns, secondary suns don\u0027t cast shadows, eclipses, godrays, cloud shadows, caustics/lightrays but can now light up the atmosphere and clouds\n    - New \u0022cloudIntegrationUsesScattererSunColors\u0022 parameter in planetsList: When set to false, will use the real sun colors for clouds (for main sun and secondary suns), when true will use scatterer\u0027s sun colors, defaults to false.\n    - New \u0022sunsUseIntensityCurves\u0022 parameter in planetsList: When set to true, both main sun and secondary suns will use the intensity from the star\u0027s intensity curve. Defaults to false for retro-compatibility.\n    - Make scaledSpace eclipses apply only to the main light, additional lights/suns can light up the eclipsed area\n    - Fix eclipse shader breaking secondary lights on scaledSpace planets with kopernicus load on demand\n    - Fix eclipses applying to the dark side\n    - Handle light extinctions for secondary suns in local space\n    \n    - Fix SMAA blurring text and other cockpit elements in IVA (most noticeable with ASET and rasterpropmonitor)\n    - Fix godrays too dark when looking at opposite of sun direction\n    - Fix secondary lights on clouds being too bright\n    \n    ***********v0.0772***********\n    \n    - Fixed a few issues with stuck images on-screen, in some cases during re-entry or when cheating a craft to another planet\n    - Fixed screen becoming black when crashing command part\n    - Fixed oceanFFT nullref spam\n    - Fixed incompatibility with TUFX ambient occlusion\n    \n    ***********v0.0770***********\n    \n    - Depth buffer mode: Renders scattering effect using the depth buffer instead of re-rendering opaque objects:\n    \n        * Enables CPU and GPU performance improvements (anywhere from 17% to 41% higher fps with the stock game and scatterer)\n        * Added option to render the scattering in 1/4 resolution and upsample for performance (incompatible will godrays, will auto-disable if godrays are used)\n        * Compatibility with Parallax (most noticeably underwater)\n        * Compatibility with trees and terrain scatters (they now get correct scattering on them instead of sticking out)\n        * Disables MSAA anti-aliasing because it\u0027s not compatible with the depth buffer (Added option to use SMAA to compensate, MSAA is still used in tracking station and editor scenes so keep it enabled).\n        * Depth buffer mode can be disabled in favor of the old mode if you want to have MSAA (performance and compatiblity improvements won\u0027t be available in this case)\n    \n    - Faster long-distance shadow rendering (no longer need to render an additional depth buffer for shadows farther than 7km)\n    \n    - Small performance improvements in the ocean \u002B ability to further disable foam and transparency for performance on slower machines\n    \n    - Performance presets and a preset loader in the KSC menu, to easily adjust quality/performance. It will also tell you your current preset by matching individual settings against presets. Scatterer will now default to \u0022low\u0022 preset which is just the basic scattering\u002Bocean feel free to go higher or lower depending on your specs.\n    \n    - Sunflare editor in the UI, changes made here will be lost on scene changes so copy your config. (Config will also be logged when applied from the UI)\n    \n    - New sunflare syntax (check wiki for details https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/wiki/SunflaresConfig#syntax-version-2)\n    \n        * Support for per-element intensity and scale curves\n        * Units for the distance in the curves is the parent body\u0027s radius, used to make sunflares easy to port from one star to another with different sizes\n        * Support for .dds textures for the flares\n        * More readable syntax, scales are supplied normally instead of inverse\n        * Older sunflares stay compatible by omitting the syntaxVersion tag or using syntaxVersion=1. New sunflare syntax using syntaxVersion=2 in the sunflare config\n    \n    - Sunflares are loaded directly from their individual sunflare configs (Scatterer_sunflare nodes), no longer need to have and maintain sunflare list in the planetsList file\n    -  Better error handling when loading and clearer logging, if loading fails the stock effects will load instead of having the ocean not load. Same when atmo files are missing, display stock effects instead of loading white atmosphere.\n    - Configs loaded from ModuleManager are detected as such, and no longer as coming from \u0022Laythe.cfg\u0022, config saving to disk is disabled when a ModuleManager patch is used\n    - Possibility to preview different SunColor values directly from the UI for fine-tuning (will not save to file though, you still have to manually edit the planetsList file after)\n    - De-hardcoded a gravity parameter in the ocean spectrum (previously hardcoded to 9.81 m/s^2), a value of 0 will apply the body\u0027s surface gravity. This can impact the waves look and look unnatural to us (as we are used to how waves looks on earth), old ocean configs where the value is missing will default to 9.81 as before.\n    - Fixed weirdly colored clouds in main menu\n    - Small reduction in ocean jittering in RSS\n\n    ***********v0.0723***********\n    Bugfixes:\n    \n    - Fix log spam \u0022RenderTexture.Create failed: width \u0026 height must be larger than 0\u0022 when godrays are enabled but terrain shadows and custom shadow resolutions are disabled\n    - Fix broken ocean shader on Linux/OpenGL\n    - Fix forced ship recovery from ocean working on non-homeworld planets\n    - Renamed scaled space scattering object to \u0022Scatterer scaled atmo\u0022 for Tilt Unlocker\n    \n    ***********v0.0722***********\n    New features:\n    \n    - Added volumetric shadows (godrays). Godrays use shadow information so the quality is directly tied to shadowmap resolution and shadow distance. Godray strength can be tweaked and godrays respect atmosphere density and optical depth. Only compatible with Directx 11 (requires the unified camera setup)\n    - Added underwater light rays, derived directly from the caustics textures and config. Brightness of underwater light rays can be adjusted. Light rays are volumetric and respect shadows\n    - Added craft-wave interactions. Ocean waves are now interactible/collidable. Only compatible with Directx 11 as it requires async GPU readback\n    - Added override for ship recovery velocity when splashed and wave interactions are on (by default 5 m/s vs 0.3 m/s for stock), to allow ship recovery in wavy oceans\n    - Added overrides for water drag and crash tolerance when wave interactions are on, to make ships and seaplanes experience better (3x less drag and 3x less crash tolerance than stock by default). Seaplanes are workable but require some care and timing, it\u0027s still possible to take off with the stock gull from by going in the same direction as the waves\n    \n    Fixes:\n    \n    - Fix scattering effect getting cut off in the distance for RSS/Rescale\n    - Fix bleached/white mountains in the distance when ascending to orbit\n    - Fix caustics, extinction lighting, long-distance

when using cameraTools after 250 meters distance\n    - Fix ocean secondary lights causting artifacts/squares on the planet from orbit\n    - Fix sky reflection on the ocean not respecting sky exposure and alpha settings\n    - Added configurable skyReflectionStrength setting in ocean config (can be changed from UI but need to rebuild ocean to apply)\n    \n

YOU ONLY NEED TO DISTRIBUTE THE .half FILE.\n    -Option to disable scaledSpace ambient light (celestial bodies appear realistically lit and will display as crescents in the sky)\n    -Restored the sun corona.\n    -Option to ignore renderType tags, keep this on for the time being as rendertype tags seem to be gone in 1.1 and the postprocessing shader won\u0027t work without them.\n    -No longer need to reload the tables when switching fullscreen/windowed, only ocean needs to be reloaded.\n    -Added an ocean offset reset when it gets bigger than 20000, avoids floating point precision issues resulting in artifacts or a blocky-looking ocean when traveling a large distance over the ocean such as doing a sub-orbital hop or doing a fast re-entry.\n    -Window positions are persistent.\n    -Gui keys are rebindable through the config file.\n\n    ***********v0.0235***********\n    -Quick fix to effects disappearing in scaledSpace for RSS\n    -Ocean fourierGridSize restored to 128 as default for Kerbin\n    \n    ***********v0.0234***********\n    -Fixed compatibility with planetary rings\n    -Fixed lens flare not occluding correctly on bodies without atmosphere\n    -New option to draw the atmosphere over EVE clouds: Fixes strange-looking terminators when using both EVE and scatterer and looks smoother in general, however it makes the transition from PQS to scaledSpace more problematic and introduces some new issues. Can be toggled of from the main menu or for individual planets throught the planetsList.cfg file.\n    -Fixed draw order issue where clouds on Jool render over Laythe\u0027s sky.\n    -Partially fixed compatibility with telescope mods: Will work correctly in high orbits (\u003E160 km) with the planet rendering correctly and no overlaying layers, however will get some interference from the postprocessing shader when PQS is active (below 160km for Kerbin).\n    -Visor reflections (TextureReplacer\u0027s reflection plugin) should also be fixed, with the same limitations as the telescope mods.\n\n    ***********v0.0233***********\n    -Huge memory usage improvements (100-400 mb savings)\n    \n    ***********v0.0232***********\n    -Fixed lens flare shader not working on linux/OpenGL\n    -Fixed pink square that appears near the player\u0027s craft\n    -Fixed extinction tint not working in sky shader and postprocessing shader in OpenGL\n    \n    ***********v0.0231***********\n    -Fixed completely blue screen issue when loading a craft in high orbit\n    -Fixed blue screen and tilted camera issue when entering KSC\n    \n    ***********v0.0230***********\n    -Ocean no longer disappears when you rotate the camera, do flips in IVA or get to orbit.\n    -FakeOcean removed, regular ocean stays all the way to high orbit.\n    -Added ocean alpha setting to configPoints to fade out the ocean nearing orbit.\n    -Better way to disable the stock oceans (thx to rbray89), gives a small performance bump.\n    -Added godrays: Early WIP, disabled by default, these work best with good terrain so turn up your terrain quality. Looks best with terrain shadows.\n    -Added terrain shadows: These depend on the unity shadows, if you see shimmering or artifacts turn up your shadow quality through the \u0022render quality level\u0022 slider in KSP. The default shadow Cascades setting of 4 seems to work quite well. Shadows distance has also been changed from 5 000 to 100 000, this is adjustable in the scatterer config file.\n    -Added custom sunflare shader: WIP, configurable through custom textures and config file.\n    -Added eclipses: WIP, appear only on sky and orbit only for now, no terrain shadows. You can set eclipse casters through the planetsList file.\n    -Tweaked configs for a bunch of planet, ground to orbit transition is much better on Kerbin especially. Didn\u0027t have time to redo Duna so it probably loooks really bad.\n    -Fixed custom depth buffer artifacts (threshold of 10 is enough for all altitudes now).\n    -Moved all render modes to the custom depth buffer.\n    -MapViewScale setting no longer required.\n    -PostProcessing now has extinction like the sky shader.\n    -PostProcessing blending mode changed from alpha blending to soft additive, basically it blends better and feelsless foggy during the day and more foggy at sunsets/sunrises.\n    -Sky extinction is now handled via analytic formula, this fixes the bug where sometimes extinction doesn\u0027t work with custom configs, beware that objects in the sky are still handled via the old method so this may not fix it. It also looks a bit different so you might have to redo your configs.\n\n    ***********v0.0220***********\n    -Fixed black ocean bug\n    -Fixed issue with gas giants giving abysmal fps\n    -Fixed rim exposure settings resulting in pixelated planet edges\n    -Fixed atmosphere drawing over planets in map view\n    -Fixed sunsets/sunrises looking like eclipses\n    -Sunglare hiding during eclipses\n    -Cleaner depth buffer and postprocessing in dx11 and opengl (edgeThreshold now obsolete)\n    -Main menu window for enabling and disabling features\n\n    ***********v0.02182***********\n    -Minimized z-fighting on the fake ocean\n    -In addition to their alpha and depth settings, the postprocessing and fake ocean both fade out automatically following how much the PQS is faded out.\n\n    ***********v0.0218***********\n    -Added ocean faking in postprocessing, prevents rendering the expensive ocean when far away and used in orbital view instead of showing the ocean floor.\n    -Added variables to fade out the foam and the ocean alpha with distance (seafloor no longer visible in the horizon, \u0022foam wall\u0022 removed)\n    -Added variables to control the exposure and extinction for the edges of the atmosphere separately (also fixes the atmosphere \u0022barrier\u0022 effect)\n    -Fixed sunglare visible through planet and in space\n\n    ***********v0.0216***********\n    -Fixed the \u0022halo around planets\u0022 bug in dx9\n    -Fixed engine effects displaying on top of ocean when they are behind it\n\n    ***********v0.0215***********\n    -Fixed issue were reverting flight causes effects to disappear\n    -Added control/scaling of atmosphere height directly ingame\n    -Tweaked config for Kerbin: 2x higher atmo, blue sky is visible higher\n    -1.7x atmosphere height on Laythe\n    -2.5x atmosphere height on Eve\n    \n    ***********v0.021***********\n    -Ocean shaders, first public release\n    \n    ***********v0.0195***********\n    -Fixed RSS compatibility, Any Kopernicus / RSS planetary system configuration should be auto compatible now regardless of celestial body and/or transform names and fixed a bunch of bugs, Shaders, configuration and textures are now located dynamically either by celestialBodyName or transformName defined in PlanetList.cfg (thanks to direwolf/tarsolya)\n    \n    -Added workarounds for most opengl/dx11 artifacts (24bit depth buffer can be turned on/off in planetslist.cfg, openglThreshold and edgethreshold need to be configured with config points)\n    -Fixed mie scattering in the post processing shader\n    -Tweaked configs for Jool (now green), Eve and Laythe\n    -Added sunglare scaling\n    \n    ***********Changelog for 0.019[/B]:\n

with RSS, to use with RSS replace config file with the one in \u0022RSS compatibility folder\u0022 or go into the config file planetName and change the celestialBody to Earth but keep the other name to Kerbin.\n    -New orbit shader, tweakable through the parameters sky extinction and sky extinction tint.\n\n    ***********Changelog for 0.0175[/B]:\n    OpenGL fixes:\n    -Lines in the sky bug fixed permanently (without needing forceOff aniso)\n    -Rainbow coloring/discoloration fixed\n    -Moire patterns fixed (also fixed in dx11)\n    A little better OpenGL performance\n\n    ***********Changelog for 0.0171[/B]:\n    -Dx11 compatibility fix\n\n    ***********Changelog for 0.017[/B]:\n    \n    -Full compatibility with EVE clouds\n    -New orbital effect/view (EVE clouds recommended)\n    -Celestial objects now visible in the sky\n    -Added config points as a way to set different settings for different altitudes and smooth out between them\n    -New UI for config points\n    -More discrete default settings, less foggy\n    -New, smoother depth setting function (scattering effects no longer seem to start at a visible barrier)\n    -Fixed blending issues (Black bars at the edge of the atmosphere, barrier effect when going up etc...)\n    -Fixed z-fighting issues and weird stuff at orbits beyond 200km\n    -Fixed atmosphere displaying over moon and other celestial objects randomly\n    -Fixed effect in map view\n    -Map view now has separate settings which only trigger in map view.\n    -Fixed ForceOFF aniso setting not persisting/loading right\n\n    ***********Changelog for 0.0151[/B]:\n    \n    Just a quick fix for the pink objects bug\n    \n    ***********Changelog for 0.015[/B]:\n    \n    -Lowered memory usage (I expect your feedback on this)\n    -Added persistent settings\n    Settings can be saved with the save settings button or they get saved automtically when the scene is changed.\n    -EVE clouds are now visible in the sky (postprocessing still draws over them though)\n    -Added toggle aniso button for people who are still getting the lines in the sky when using OpenGL (if you don\u0027t have the bug don\u0027t use this, if this still doesn\u0027t fix the bug try disabling aniso if you have it forced from the drivers)\n    -Terrain should no longer be low-res\n    -Fixed some minor bugs\n    \n    ***********Changelog for 0.014 Experimental version[/B]:\n    \n    -Effects no longer lag behind as you move the camera.\n    -Auto depth adjustment based on height (WIP/experimental).\n    -Kerbin no longer covered by blue sphere after altitude of 160 Km.\n    -New view from orbit faded out progressively as you approach scaled space (extremely WIP/experimental, has some artifacts)\n    -Few adjustments to the base settings, more subtle effect.\n    -UI now defaults to hidden, can be enabled with Alt-f11 or Alt-f10.\n    -The mod no longer disables anisotropic filtering and forcing aniso through drivers no longer causes artifacts\n    -Other minor fixes\n\nI do this in my spare time, if you like what I do you can support me

I didn\u0027t know the stock atmosphere had components but I\u0027ll probably disable them all.\n\nAnyway, if you\u0027re familiar with meshes, if I use a meshrenderer for my atmosphere I have a huge performance drop, everything starts running at 5 fps. What\u0027s the deal with this? I\u0027m currently rendering my atmosphere with graphics.drawmesh to get around this.
