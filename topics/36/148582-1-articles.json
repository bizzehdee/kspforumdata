The 3m/s impact durability will probably be nerfed further. Temperature is set to paper ignition level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it actually took more than a couple licks of flame from a Vector before exploding. There\u0027s a bunch of .cfg thermal parameters which I don\u0027t really understand. How can I tweak it so that it really overheats very fast, has near to no thermal capacity, and dissipates heat really poorly, while absorbing it readily?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
