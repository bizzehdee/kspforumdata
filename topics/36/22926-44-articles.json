Also, are there any plans to do a proper cockpit with IVA and instruments, etc., instead of having to use the stupid useless command chairs? The buggies would be almost perfect with that addition. And finally, I suggest/request removing the permanent red light from the cockpit section, or at least being able to turn it off, as well as having the \u0027headlight\u0027 controllable independently of whether the cockpit is open or closed. The auto-deploying built-in ladder is absolute genius though, fantastic feature there! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Lack, once again for your great mod parts, and your continuing work in support and development of them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
