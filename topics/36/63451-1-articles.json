Just slim down your development KSP environment and add a monobehavoir that directly throws you into the testing situation. Technically it might be possible to load a new version of your assembly and modify you part\u0027s prefab, but you would still have to reload the scene and make sure to remove all other global stuff like event listeners manually.

There are a few these floating around other places too if you look. You can also setup a batch file to copy the newly built .dll to your gamedata folder and start KSP, which helps a little. But between those things and deleting unnecessary parts there isn\u0027t much you can do to make the development process quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
