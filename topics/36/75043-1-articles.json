I will do CLS first as this is straightforward enough.

All this involves using a Lab module to clean the experiments, which consumes a resource called \u0027Experiments\u0027. This should add a somewhat analogous situation to the real ISS and allow science to be carried out in exchange for Experiments flow up form the ground, then return to the ground by recoverable return craft like Dragon.
