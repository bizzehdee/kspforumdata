I\u0027m trying to figure out how to create an entirely new techtree, but I haven\u0027t been able to.\n\nI tried using [Nelien\u0027s Tech Tree Editor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98942-WIN-TED-KSP-Tech-Tree-Editor-v0-2-4-ALPHA-EARLY-TESTING), but I haven\u0027t been able to get it to work with 1.0.\n\nWhat\u0027s the best way to mess with the tech tree? Is there a GUI I can use? Moving around nodes by using the coordinate system in notepad and then checking by booting up the game would be really time-consuming, and I wouldn\u0027t know how to move the parts to new nodes."}]}
