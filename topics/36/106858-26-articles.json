Perhaps a moon with an icy blue oxygen atmosphere that is fully covered in snow, with huge cliffs, canyons and mountains? Since Keelon is designed after GP3 (though the gas planet was later turned into a desert planet), it\u0027s kinda like a Uranus analog, Jool being Jupiter (Joolpiter) and Sarvin being Saturn (Sarvurn? Satvin?), Keelon would be some sort of weird Uranus analog. The moon described above would be a Kerbalized Miranda analog.\n\nWell, that is...\n\nA REALY GOOD IDEA ACTUALY!!! Should the surface be smooth and soft like Daphy will have?

I use this with OPM, Sigma Pluro-Khaton and TK. \n\nI edited some orbits to make some friends for Dres, put some stuff around OPM\u0027s Neidon and a couple more things around Plock, but have made no other changes to the cfg files for the planets.

I was able to enter orbit, descend and land on the big crater/flat side with no problems and my probe is visually safely sat on the surface, but according to the game, even though my probe is visually safely sat on the surface, all the science experiments register as \u0027in space flying above the surface\u0027 (on a suborbital trajectory) and the \u0027Land on Vix\u0027 part of the contract won\u0027t complete either.
