We are talking about and Ascent Stage and a Decent stage. You are talking about not only fuel tanks but engines, possibly science packages, landing legs, antennas. A storage place for the rover. So yes I see your point about fuel tanks being fuel tanks, however this is Alexustas. Its not just gonna be fuel tanks. It will fit into the infrastructure he has created seamlessly. Imagine a Konquest style lander. That makes me excited. So I would love to see Konquest finished and finally play with it. However if something like this is on the table I would love to see that too.
