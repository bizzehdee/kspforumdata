For those who don\u0027t know what im talking about, greebles are non-functional (or functional if you so wish) parts of spaceships/vessels/objects that provide detail and a sense of mechanics. A google search of \u0022greeble\u0022 will give you an idea, but we\u0027re talking about tubes, pipes, heat exchanges, and any other manner of bit bobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i understand that not all types of greebling would be suited to procedural generation - but im thinking along the lines of procedural tubing or piping that you can place on a craft by clicking its path, adjusting bend types and angle, textures, shape etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am happy to have a go at this myself - my only hindrance is coding. As in, i have very minimal experience of this. And modding - not done that either. I can model in 3d software - so what i want to ask of the community is outside of the resources available in the stickies, where can i start to learn about creating this kind of mod? And even better would anyone be willing/have the time to help out or just help me understand what needs to be done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-14T01:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, nobody else has said this so I\u0027ll chime in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity is an incredibly powerful engine.

Plus, for me, aesthetics and detail is important. I actually find that alot of the engine models available are too sparsely detailed for my liking. Where is the mass of tubing and piping? the various mechanical components that make the machinery itself beautiful Sure you could argue Kerbal was not intended for that - but thats what modding is for.

Sadly, it was 60% gibberish - i might need to read up on some unity coding (or just general unity tutorials tbh). In terms of a collider - i don\u0027t think the greebles would need a collider - they are primarily aesthetic. Although for larger greeble pieces it may be useful? Or if greebles are given functionality (i.e. cooling units?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223172208\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165458\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221505392748\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278435\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/14/2017 at 1:39 PM, Fengist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo problem. \u00A0This brings another idea to mind. \u00A0I believe that Firespitter does something similar to what you want here. \u00A0I believe \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57198-snjo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57198-snjo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snjo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0has helicopter blades that essentially duplicate themselves. \u00A0The user selects the number of blades and he prodecurally takes a single blade from the model and places duplicates\u00A0around a hub. \u00A0I haven\u0027t looked at his parts in a few years but I think it was he who came up with that.
