Yes it would be doable.  The problem comes down to surface attach joints and how they wobble (around the attach point rather than the center of the parent part).\n\nBasically when you surface attach something its joint to the part it is attached to is -on the surface- of the parent part.  So if it wobbles, it will oscillate around that point rather than in the center of the parent part where it should logically wobble for a part setup like this.  This can be seen (albeit a different manifestation of the same problem) when using the RBDC when KJR is not present;  the parts attached to the RBDC rotate around the surface-attach point rather than in the center of the tank.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E port(s) that are closest to the surface attach point would be most stable/move the least (just like a stand-alone \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E port), while those on the opposite side of the tank would have proportionally greater displacement whenever the joint wobbled (possibly enough to be noticeable; would highly depend on the thrust output from the ports).  Any such displacement/wobbling would result in off-axis thrust and/or an unbalanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E setup.\n\nAnother \u0027problem\u0027 facing this setup is KSPs drag calculations -- pretty sure the stock code would put the entire drag for the part as a vector centered on the attachment point rather than the centroid of the actual part/bounds, thus the parts would be extremely unstable in any kind of aero setup (in stock at least... \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E should not suffer those problems).\n\nAnd one final problem that this setup would face -- the colliders on many parts are not quite consistent enough to allow for a single wrap-around part to center itself perfectly around the tank.  The tank may have render bounds of 2.5m diameter, but the colliders may be only 2.48m (due to being 12 sided rather than 24 sided), and thus the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/engine ring would be offset by 0.02m, resulting in off-balanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/thrust.\n\nI\u0027ve contemplated doing such for both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and separation motors as I think they could both benefit from the same type of setup.  However they would both suffer from the joint problem outlined above, with the higher the thrust output the more noticeable the problem would be.\n\nPerhaps I\u0027ll put together a couple of non-modular/manually welded parts for testing of the concept.  The joint wobble/displacement might not be as bad as I\u0027m thinking, and might not be noticeable on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports at all (and almost certainly should be fine with KJR, at least for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports).

(whereas the AO map depends more on the geometry)?\n\u003E \n\nNoted... and yeah, I should probably actually make them before thinking about making them generically usable.\n\nSpecular / AO --  A single UV map would be used for both the diffuse and specular maps.  The AO in the alpha of the specular texture would use the same UV mapping as both the diffuse and specular textures.  So all of them would match up with the diffuse texture to some extent / all would be based on the same UV mapping.  The main changes compared to existing KSP shaders is that the AO texture could be disabled at the shader level, and the allowance of full-color specular setups (for example on solar panels, where the panels may have a different specular color from the frame... gold panels vs. silver frame; impossible with current KSP shaders without splitting the meshes up).\n\nEssentially I\u0027m trying to add full-color specular and optional AO support.  From those requirements I\u0027m left with two textures with unused alpha channels (Diffuse is RGB only, specular is RGB only, both would have unused alpha channels).  I can either slot the AO into the alpha on the diffuse texture, or into the alpha on the specular texture; either way would use the same UV mapping for all textures (diff/spec/nrm).  Actual alpha support seemed more logical to put with the diffuse texture (so it is a proper ARGB/RGBA texture), and AO being related to shading seemed logical to me to put with the specular texture.\n\nThe AO could even be a third (fourth if normal mapped) texture, but that seems a bit inefficient (3rd/4th texture slot in the shader, additional texture sampling in the code, and 3 unused channels in the AO texture as it is a simple grayscale texture; I have not found any specialized DXT-grayscale format, all of them seem encode 3 or 4 channels).  Although keeping the AO as a completely separate texture does open up a few interesting use options as far as the modular parts are concerned (use of different AO bakes depending upon what modules are setup/present)... however that comes with its own set of problems that I\u0027ve not yet put much thought into.\n\nIf you have suggestions though as to other texture/channel setups that might work well I would love to hear them (or other thoughts on the shader subject in general).

So if it wobbles, it will oscillate around that point rather than in the center of the parent part where it should logically wobble for a part setup like this.  This can be seen (albeit a different manifestation of the same problem) when using the RBDC when KJR is not present;  the parts attached to the RBDC rotate around the surface-attach point rather than in the center of the tank.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip\u003E\n\u003E \u003C/snip\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t get your hopes up though.

It goes on in Symmetry 2. Drag and Wobble forces will cancel each other out because the same drag/wobble is happening exactly 180 degrees out of phase (IE on the other side of your Rocket.)  \n\nApplying his methodology, assuming a quarter circle with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust point at each end, and the attachment halfway across the arc. You will have reduced your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E part count by half and you are ALMOST as accurate (in lack of wobble) as you were with the standard parts.  \n\nBut I agree with others that a modified stack mounted probe core is the better choice because then everything is centered no matter what.    can you swap node sizes out when you resize a part (for larger torque/drag resiliency on larger stack \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules?)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/7/2016 at 10:44 AM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm.. that may be a bug with the zero-boil-off tanks then;  there should be zero loss as long as you have sufficient EC generation.
