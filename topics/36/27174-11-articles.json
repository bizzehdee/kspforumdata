I\u0027d rather not compromise that in any way. I suppose it might be doable if it was used only on the command pod, though. I\u0027ll talk to aphazael about it. What concerns me is the fact that it essentially removes the texture to use a reflection cubemap, and that is undesirable on something as complex as the command pod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin actually carries the textures over.

Yea after looking at the textures, they are barely visible underneath the shininess. Don\u0027t take this in a bad way, I just have poor eyesight. That being said, I think it\u0027s best to make this mod compatible without requiring another plugin. However, adding the reflective shader to a part seems rather simple, and if people wanted a reflective surface, they would be more than capable of doing it themselves, due to the easy learning curve of the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
