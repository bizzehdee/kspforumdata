So instead I configured decoupler as part of the retro pack and I had to make it unstageable because if it was stageable it would always fire the engine and decouple at the same time which when dealing with SRB\u0027s is a very good way to make everything go very wrong. So in the end the small decoupler wasn\u0027t needed but I still included it because by that point it was fully functional any way, it didn\u0027t cost any extra ram, and people can use it to replace the stock small decoupler, and save even more ram.\n\nAs for the IVA I plan to work on that once Beale releases the Gemini/Spica IVA and I have a texture sheet to work with ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DGatsby","CreatedById":37919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T06:00:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hmm... you mean like make blue space station parts? all the concepts I\u0027ve seen of MOL seem to be white or bare metal, but that already matches up with the aesthetic already established by stock and TKS parts. so I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m visualizing what you are suggesting right.\n\nI just meant making the TKS parts blue to match the Gemini.

On another note I can\u0027t really change the speed the pod descends on chutes because the larger gemini pod needs to use that parachute as well, and I can\u0027t have two of them because it is inevitable no matter how they are textured that they will be mixed up and result in exploding Gemini\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T08:05:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If Beale wants to adopt these parts for Tanteres he\u0027s more than free too. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOr at least the link to this pack in Tantares post will be nice, I suppose."}]}
