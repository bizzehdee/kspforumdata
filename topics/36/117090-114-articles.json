Mostly that list is for gathering and comparing of stats so that I can see -if- I need to do an engine (does it fill a unique performance slot?).\n\nSo, in the end, it will come down to if that engine is needed or not.  If it is too similar to existing engines stat-wise (or if there is not enough details/images/schematics available) then I will likely not be doing it (as stated before I\u0027m not doing all this to enable you guys to build replicas;  I\u0027m doing this to enable low-part-count lego-rockets for KSP career mode).\n\nAnd... short preview of a very early incarnation of a custom wheel collider replacement solution that I\u0027m working on (almost working well enough to use in-game...):\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtqODl8MYlo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nVehicle is created from three rigidbodies; a central body, and the two side wings, joined together by \u0027fixed joints\u0027.\n\nBasic suspension works, very basic torque based wheel motor input, very simple rolling and sideways friction model.  The motor torque is quite anemic for this test case, but of course is configurable.  The left/right \u0027sway\u0027 to the body when turning is an emergent property of how the forces are being applied; if you turn left, the vehicle will roll appropriately to the side (as much the suspension allows for its current configuration).  Same with torque from motor input; if the torque is applied to the rear wheels you can watch the front of the vehicle lift up a bit as torque is applied.  Quite pleased with the results so far (and its only like ~20 lines of code!).  And so much more generically applicable than the u5 WC\u0027s; you can rotate, orient, move... whatever you want on these components.  Want colliders on the roof of the vehicle?  NO problem (can\u0027t do that with u5 WCs!).  Want some angled colliders for the front end, motorcycle style?  Again, no problem (and again, you can\u0027t do that with the u5 WCs).\n\nIf there are any game-physics experts out there that felt like lending a hand though, would be much appreciated.  Only a \u0027bit\u0027 over my head with this one, though I\u0027m sure I can (with effort) learn the concepts needed to understand the rest of the physics and get it all working.  Mostly I need to figure out how to calculate the forward and sideways friction in a way that... works a bit better.\n\nSo far... is working loads better than the u5 wheel collider.  Notice the lack of objects jumping, jittering, or flying around?  Yep, so did I ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\nFor reference I can replace my custom WC on that \u0027vehicle\u0027 with the u5 ones, and as long as I have those rigidbodies jointed onto the side it will -always- jump, jitter, or be launched into space (regardless of mass/spring/damper settings).  Something about those RBs and joints is -not- playing nicely with the stock wheel colliders.  And as KSP extensively uses jointed rigidbodies.... that kind of stuff just won\u0027t cut it.  Seriously don\u0027t understand how these things ever made it into u5 distribution in the state they are in.\n\nThe suspension end of things is simple enough to work out reliably, and will probably start integrating that end of things into KSP soon.  The friction model... well... entire books are written on that subject... so I\u0027m going to have to do some research and reading to figure out the best way to handle it.\n\nThere is no doubt that this custom solution will be slightly less performant than the stock u5-wcs (unless they are terrible under the hood as well).  Though, they shouldn\u0027t be too much worse than the standard for KSP, as they are only using a single raycast to drive the entire simulation (raycast determines hit depth, which determines spring force, which determines the \u0027down force\u0027 exterted by the wheels, which determines the friction to be applied), and only applying forces once per physics frame (per wheel); with existing KSP wheels you -still- have to do the raycast -after- the WC has already done its internal updates (which likely includes some raycasts in the c\u002B\u002B/native/physx side of the code).  So who knows, it might end up being about even in the end as long as I can keep all the other calculations optimized."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T23:09:52Z","Content":"Updated 1.1 testing release is available:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.4.31-pre2](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.4.31-pre2)\n\nSeveral fixes, a few updates... mostly just recompiled against KSP 1.1 retail .dll\u0027s.
