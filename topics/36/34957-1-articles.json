The payload bay could be a single part. Split off the airlock, but unlike on Buran, it shouldn\u0027t extend. Leave OMS thrusters attached to the engine mount, SSMEs (if you modeled them) should be done as a single cluster, but separate from the mount itself (so that 3 SSMEs are mounted as one part). The nose needs to have two parts, one for the ASAS module and the other to produce lift. I suggest doing it like on Buran, but you may also go with the CSS-style approach. The tail fin control surface can be attached to the rest of the fin (unless that prevents animating the airbrake, in which case do it like on the Buran). You certainly may leave control surfaces attached to the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-04T11:35:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2013 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SouthPhilly","CreatedById":62599,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T17:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice work so far... really looking forward to this vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vector253","CreatedById":61169,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T19:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even think of the air brake thanks for reminding me, and ill edit the textures to have no name, I think I found all 5 textures but ill just leave a area where you can add your own name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the division go I\u0027m just gonna cut it up like the buran but use only a single cargo part, the bay doors are separated but haven\u0027t been animated yet.
