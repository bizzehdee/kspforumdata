Have a decent UV unwrap for the parts, left a fair bit of room for other blanket style panels.  Will likely be making use of AO switching with these so that I can re-use some of the same geometry and still get decent shading on the other parts. \n\nHave not yet started working on the multi-panel/multi-axis truss structure, though I\u0027m thinking its going to end up being a pretty simple setup; mostly it will be the existing 3-part cylindrical portion with optional adapters.

Going to be changing substantially from how the part is currently setup -- the \u0027core\u0027 will consist of nothing more than the gimbal/bearing assembly, with the rest of the part being the optional adapters.  It will be 1.875m in diameter, and support up to 2.5m diameter adapters/trusses without visible clipping.\n\nOn that note I also spent some time yesterday creating a set of configs to MFT-ize the NearFuture OctoTruss parts.  This consisted of setting up ModelData definitions for each of the model variants and creating a new Part config to utilize the models.  The result is a new part (name undetermined) that uses the NF truss models but allows for rescaling, all while supporting the many different body-variants that the trusses have (though resources are not locked to a specific variant; e.g. the electric model need not contain any EC).  Sadly only a single size truss adapter exists (truss-\u003E2.5m), so that is all that is available for the part.\n\nWhat this all means is that I will not be making any trusses of my own in the immediate future, the \u0027Solar Truss\u0027 part will come with some simple adapters for the \u0027stock\u0027 SSTU install, and the Near-Future truss adapters will be added through a patch whenever NF-C is installed.\n\nWill be spending a bit of time today/this evening checking on the status of the KSPWheel project.  Have been procrastinating on it a bit... but **need** to spend a bit of time on it to see if things will even be workable.  As usual you can follow those developments in the Kerbal Foundries thread.  Will post an update later this evening after I know a bit more.\n\nDid a bit of play-testing yesterday on the 1.2-pre-release career mode.  Everything tested seems to be working -- engines, fuel tanks, parachutes, heat-shields, part-upgrades.  Definitely going to need to do a bit of career-mode balancing on things though as I found it almost too easy progressing through the first couple launches (orbit on launch #2 with only the 5-science nodes unlocked?);  it seems that a max-length MFT tank \u002B Merlin-1A makes a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E for a Mk1 pod.  Not really sure of anything that could be done for it though, as the same thing could likely be done with the stock fuel tanks and LV-T45 engine (though would require stacking obscene #\u0027s of the tiny stock tanks).

I was wondering when they\u0027de get serious with their Mars plans.  Seems like they are almost there.\n\nWill I be doing parts based on those concepts?  Not right now... I\u0027ll let them develop and refine them a bit further; already have far too many things planned to try and fit yet-more-parts into the schedule.  Will take another look at the concepts after a bit of my work/backlog has been cleaned up.\n\nSimplified prototype Modular Solar Truss core geometry (with not much truss to it...).  Hand-holds/ladders are there just for a bit of greeble... nothing is finalized yet.  I\u0027m not quite happy with this geometry, but really have no idea of any other way to do it.  I tried doing a more \u0027truss\u0027 like setup but couldn\u0027t find any truss arrangements that didn\u0027t look absurd... so settled on a solid piece of geometry.  Unsure how I\u0027ll be texturing this bit; may try and re-use some existing texture if I can find one appropriate (fuel tanks perhaps?).\n\n![mvPeI3I.png](http://i.imgur.com/mvPeI3I.png)\n\nI -will- be creating some round skeletal adapters though, so that the \u0027solar truss\u0027 pieces can have some sort of truss to them in the stock SSTU install (using the MCB-B full-surround cargo bay models posted last week).\n\nAfter I get these solar parts on to the next step I can finally start working on what I\u0027m sure quite a few of you have been waiting for -- the HAB parts (inflatables and torus), starting with the basic inflatables.\n\nStill awaiting a 1.2\u002B compatible Module-Manager before I\u0027ll be posting any updated testing releases.  From Sarbians\u0027 comments on various threads we likely won\u0027t be seeing it until shortly before the pre-release testing is done, at the earliest, and potentially not until after 1.2 has been finalized (which is understandable but a bit sad, as that leaves precious little time for finding and fixing mod-API related problems prior to 1.2 final, if at all).\n\nGoing to be a pretty huge change-log for the next SSTU release... this is just what I\u0027ve done -so far-, and does not include any of the as-yet-unfinished/WIP stuff:\n\nSpoiler\n\n# \nSSTU - version 0.5.33.126 - KSP 1.2 Support\n\n- **MAJOR CHANGE** - Recompile for KSP 1.2.\n- **MAJOR CHANGE** - Include updated version of ModuleManager\n- **MAJOR CHANGE** - Include updated version of CommunityResourcePack\n- **WARNING**- This release contains save-breaking changes. Do not expect previous saves to be compatible with this version.\n    - **Major Fuel Tank changes**\n        - MFT-B and -K no longer exist.\n        - Lower fairings removed\n        - Use PartUpgrade system for max-diameter unlocks in career mode.\n        - Use PartUpgrade system for min-diameter unlocks in career mode.\n    - Modular Solar Truss - Part name has changed (ST-MST-A -\u003E ST-MST-ISS).\n\n## \nBugfixes\n\n- FIX - Animation handling -- would sometimes grab animations for child parts in the editor (did not effect flight scene).\n- FIX - AnimateLight handling -- would occasionally initialize to \u0027everything lit-up\u0027 setup. Should now only light up meshes that should be lit-up. Also cleans up some inefficiencies in materials property handling (more fps). May have conflicts with part-highlighting.\n- FIX - SC-C-SMX - Incorrect IVA definition causing IVA to not be available.\n- FIX - SSTUSolarPanelDeployable now counts towards stock \u0027power generation\u0027 check in contracts.\n- FIX - SSTUModularParachute -- should now say \u0027armed-waiting\u0027 for status when armed and waiting for deployment altitude (previously said armed-unsafe even when safe and merely waiting altitude). Will still say \u0027armed-unsafe\u0027 when it is in fact unsafe.\n\n## \nMajor Gameplay Changes\n\n- CHANGE - Remove deprecated LR-81 engine config (rescaled F-1B, old part prior to the 8048/8096 variants being added)\n- CHANGE - Add all MFT-B (hydrolox) models to the MFT-A part as variants. Deprecate/disable MFT-B part.\n- CHANGE - Remove MFT-K part. Retain model-data files to possibly add as an MFT-A variant in the future.\n- CHANGE - SSTUModularParachute now goes through the stock Part.AddForceXXX methods to add physics forces for parachute drag.\n- CHANGE - Remove lower fairing from MFT fuel tanks. Still exists on MUS tanks.\n- CHANGE - Move all base color tank textures into general SSTU distribution. Add Pipe/No-pipe AO textures, standard, gold, and orange specular textures.\n- CHANGE - The following parts now use the new stock PartUpgrade mechanisms (size unlocks can be found in the tech-tree):\n    - MFT-A/D/R/L\n    - MCB-A (uses fuel tank sizing for now)\n    - MUS-ST/CB\n    - MSRB-A/B/C/D\n    - FR-N / FR-W\n    - IPA-N / IPA-W\n    - ISDC\n    - RBDC\n    - PDC\n    - PPC\n    - MHS\n    - WDP\n\n## \nMajor Code Updates\n\n- CHANGE - Add additional handling/reading/parsing/loading methods for ModelData based texture switching.\n    - No longer need to explicitly specify a mesh; by default (no mesh specified) it will apply the texture to all meshes in the model.\n    - Specific meshes can be excluded by adding an \u0027excludeMesh=\u0027 line for each mesh to be excluded.\n    - Existing configs still supported. Can use either \u0027mesh=\u0027 or \u0027excludeMesh=\u0027 for white/black list functionality.\n- CHANGE - Add handling of shader changing in ModelData based texture-switching setups (used by most modular parts). If no shader is specified it will not be changed (and remain at the last setup shader, which may not be correct, but is the only behavior that can be guaranteed).\n- CHANGE - Add of custom shader with full RGB specular support and separate-texture for AO support.\n- CHANGE - Add a pre-compiled shader pack for each platform KSP supports (Win/Linux/OSX). The shader pack is loaded depending upon which platform is detected.\n- CHANGE - Add \u0027tank variant\u0027 handling to SSTUModularFuelTank. Now allows for tanks to be grouped into \u0027sets\u0027 of the same length, and allow switching between these variants via GUI. Fully backwards compatible with existing parts/configs.\n- CHANGE - Add GUI for selection of adapters, mounts, nosecones. Parts/modules using this functionality -- MFT, MUS, MSRB, Engine-Clusters, ModularStationCore, Cargo Bays. Old slider/button based system is still available through a config change (useModelSelectionGUI = true/false)\n- CHANGE - Adjust ModelData based attach-node positioning code to use a more logical calculation. Changes how attach nodes are defined for adapters that use a non-zero verticalOffset value. A couple model definitions have been updated to the new format.\n- CHANGE - SSTUSolarPanelDeployable -- add config boolean field \u0027canRetract\u0027 with default value of \u0027true\u0027. Determines if solar panels can be retracted once deployed.\n\n## \nNew Parts / Models\n\n- NEW - Add a new no-piping fuel tank variant for MFT-A (Cryo).\n- NEW - Add a new no-piping framed fuel tank variant for MFT-A (Cryo-Framed)\n- NEW - Add MFT-S - Framed Spherical fuel tanks.\n- NEW - Add MCB-B - Full surround version of MCB-A\n- NEW PART - Config set to make a modular truss segment out of the Near-Future Octo-Truss parts\n    - Only available when Near-Future Construction is installed. Does not alter the NFC parts, only adds a single new SSTU-MFT part. Includes the NFC OctoTruss models and 2.5m-\u003EOctoTruss adapter.\n\n## \nGeneral Updates\n\n- UPDATE - Update textures for ST-GEN-DSP solar panels to be multi-sided. Convert to .dds to MIP-map support (should help with in-game aliasing). Texture still WIP, awaiting new shaders for colored specular support (and some way to set the shaders on the prefab models).\n- UPDATE - Add texture for EVA hatch (for DOS/HAB parts). Still WIP, but is UV mapped and has a texture.\n- UPDATE - Add texture for Welding Docking Port. Still WIP, but is UV mapped and has a texture.\n- UPDATE - Add texture for ST-GEN-DSP-ISS - Still WIP, but is UV mapped and has a texture."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T20:42:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/28/2016 at 1:00 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On that note I also spent some time yesterday creating a set of configs to MFT-ize the NearFuture OctoTruss parts.  This consisted of setting up ModelData definitions for each of the model variants and creating a new Part config to utilize the models.  The result is a new part (name undetermined) that uses the NF truss models but allows for rescaling, all while supporting the many different body-variants that the trusses have (though resources are not locked to a specific variant; e.g. the electric model need not contain any EC).  Sadly only a single size truss adapter exists (truss-\u003E2.5m), so that is all that is available for the part.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What this all means is that I will not be making any trusses of my own in the immediate future, the \u0027Solar Truss\u0027 part will come with some simple adapters for the \u0027stock\u0027 SSTU install, and the Near-Future truss adapters will be added through a patch whenever NF-C is installed.\n\u003E \n\nWell that\u0027s interesting!

Already have it setup so that it can load specific meshes from the .mu files for the b9-mesh-switch setup in the current models.
