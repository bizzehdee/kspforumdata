It\u0027s better than my own attempts. Yes, I can do textures, at least in theory (it\u0027s been a while), and would gladly help you. I have some ideas for parts as well, and would probably rather contribute to someone\u0027s pack rather than go through the hurdles of starting my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I had ever heard of KSP, I used to play Orbiter, and I\u0027ve always felt like KSP needed spaceplanes like the ones in that simulator (see here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://vchamp.drivehq.com/orbiter/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://vchamp.drivehq.com/orbiter/index.html\u003C/a\u003E). The B9 Aerospace pack helps out a great deal, and the parts in it are beautiful, but it\u0027s still lacking. I think Mk2 parts definitely need a two-seater cockpit with side seating, for one, and Mk1 needs a blunt cockpit with a .625m front stack mount, or built-in nose RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had taken a look at the B9 Aerospace textures. They seem to be roughly at half opacity, and use the background color of the part itself to finish the job. There\u0027s also a glow texture (cockpit lights, engine nozzles, etc). This is quite advanced, but I\u0027d love to take a swing at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know the correct dimensions/vertex counts for parts? In other words, will they stack seamlessly with others? I\u0027ve been looking for that info, personally... Oh, by the way! These are spaceplane parts, where integrity is key. The parts need cavities on the stack faces (for internal strut connections).

Currently, you can add crew capacity to a fuselage section and transfer crew via Crew Manifest, but I definitely want crew sections with IVAs. Something small, with round portholes. Also, something more interesting than just seats... Maybe a couple of submarine-like sleeping bunks, to suggest long(er)-duration mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJudging from Static Archer\u0027s other posts, he\u0027s concerned about how B9 wing sections have ugly overlaps on Mk2 parts. I agree, Mk2 needs thinner wings! The way I fix this problem currently is with Taverio\u0027s conformal RCS tanks, they fill in those nooks and crannies pretty well. One way we could go is by designing a bunch of LFO tank sections based on the same concept (4m, 2m, 1m) which would serve as \u0022spackle\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 also definitely needs a tail section with no engine mounts at all, if for no other reason than the fact that this doesn\u0027t exist yet. It\u0027ll be a flat, wide, horizontal taper, like on the XR2 in Orbiter. Another one would be a cockpit which perfectly mates with delta wings on each side (i.e. just like the delta gliders).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I\u0027ve examined B9 parts for Mk1 and Mk2, and counted the vertices. Since B9 parts are very high quality, and virtually everyone uses them, they should be accepted as the standard. That said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mk1 has 24 sides, and a flat top. The bottom 6 sides are the heatshield, the next 3 on each side are grey in color, and the top is white/silver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mk2 has 20 sides (not 100% on this) and a flat top. I should draw a diagram for this one, since it\u0027s a complex shape. Likewise, the bottom 3 on each side are the heatshield, and the next 3 are grey. It\u0027s probably worth adding that the bottom of a Mk2 is identical to a Mk3 (maybe we could expand Mk3 as well? It\u0027s very much neglected).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StaticArcher","CreatedById":3723,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T02:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@DracovaXIV: Definitely good points. I haven\u0027t imported the B9 parts yet, but I know it\u0027s -perfectly- aligned with the Stock (KSP) Mk2 fuselage, even BETTER than the B9 parts actually! Take a B9 part and put it up to the fuselage, and then take one of mine. You\u0027ll notice it looks like the B9 parts are sitting just a tad too low, and maybe a little undersized (.05 or so scale-wise). As far as spaceplane parts, I\u0027ll look into what needs done code-wise to add RCS parts, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s just transforms and a little code. I\u0027ll definitely be using the Orbiter craft as inspiration, because YES, there needs to be tail ends like the XR2, the XR5, and the TX. Putting mounts inside a part shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, but it would be up to the player not to put high-gimbal parts in there, I think. I hadn\u0027t thought of making \u0022filler\u0022 or \u0022spackle\u0022 parts before, but that\u0027s actually not a terrible idea, except for that TERRIBLY UGLY texture overlap thing that happens.

If you open one of those textures in a Raster editor, you will see what I mean. The basic texture is translucent. There\u0027s another texture (a smaller file) which determines how the part glows (inside of engine nozzles, cockpit lights, etc). Overlaying these results in something that looks weird; much darker than how it looks in-game. I suspect there is another color (navy gray? Kind of like Hatsune Miku\u0027s top) which is the base color of the model, and some kind of bloom effect that gives it the vibrant, light color that it has.
