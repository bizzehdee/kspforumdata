I\u0027m probably doing something dumb. \u00A0I\u0027m getting back into part making after a year or so off. \u00A0 But Unity works ONCE after a clean install and dragging in part tools, then when reopened.. \u00A0part tools is broken? \u00A0Broken in the sense that I can\u0027t expand it at all in the inspector to find any settings or buttons? \u00A0If I switch the Inspector to Debug mode I get the fields to set filename and directory... but NO WRITE BUTTON.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownloaded Unity 5.4.2 because I\u0027m told that\u0027s the bestest? \u00A0 \u00A0 Installed it. \u00A0 I grabbed the PartOverhauls zip, because I was told THAT was the bestest... \u00A0 dragged the assets folder in, loaded my .blend file, did my setup... eventually got it working and exported, great right? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I restarted Unity today \u00A0and parttools was broken as mentioned above. \u00A0 So... after trying the basic dumb stuff- \u00A0opening a new project, reimporting part tools and my source files, trying again... and getting the same results I deleted and reinstalled Unity. \u00A0 This time, in my research I realized that there was a new Part Tools I should be using, the asset bundle one. \u00A0 So I grabbed that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownloaded TextMesh and installed the asset bundle and it worked.... \u00A0until... \u00A0right, I closed and reopened Unity. \u00A0 And now same problem . \u00A0In the menu when I click part tools I get the window but it doesn\u0027t have tabs or the \u0027game directory\u0027 button. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a possible related note, It wouldn\u0027t let me set the 1.3 installation GameData folder as the Gamedata folder... \u00A0only my old 1.22 directory? \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
