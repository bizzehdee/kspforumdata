Yeah, the punctuation is my fault! Think I\u0027ve got a fix, will issue update later.\u003Cp\u003EI think I changed the max height of the surface repulsors, though the others\u003Cem\u003E should\u003C/em\u003E be the same as they used to be. It\u0027s baked into the model and hard coded I\u0027m afraid, so not really anything you can do with the config IIRC. You\u0027ll find that the damping changed the bounciness more than the strength, though setting a large value for strength will also help.

I brought the spring strength from 2.4 up to 4 and set damping to max which seems to have done a wonderful job of making the craft both safe to fly and have very little bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s actually safer than before despite the reduced overall height!

I launched from KSC and took some KF wheels and tracks to the dirt runway and left them as debris (just KF and stock parts), switched back to KSC, launched a new ship and flew out to the debris at dirt runway. At 2.5km out framerate dropped to single figures along with lots of red in the debug log. I reverted the flight and exited KSP at that point.

Either way, those errors and exceptions don\u0027t seem to be referencing the KF DLL or any of the classes, that I know of, contained within it.

That isn\u0027t to say they\u0027re not still a very bad idea. Other errors or exceptions seem to be related to engineering reports and issues with FSanimateGeneric and whatnot. I looked over every reference to the KF modules and found absolutely no glitches that I would know how to read. As such, I\u0027m not convinced this issue has anything to do with KF directly and might be something that would occur with other parts of similar complexity as well, or could have to do with another mod trying to take readings on those parts and it isn\u0027t recognizing something due to the unusual ways some of the KF parts do what they do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T22:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Darren, I missed your post in thread first off.

One idea to fix the current setup though would be to add a check for whether or not the vessel is a valid command-ready vessel. If there was a way to detect debris, for instance, and disable the module when it is called for upon loading a debris object, then we might have a solution to the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it is going to be a really nasty issue if we have to rely on dynamically adding the module to each part since differently sized/shaped objects need to contain some specific parameters which is easily done by making them fields for use in the config. If we can\u0027t define the DustFX module in the configs, then we\u0027ll need to create a new module that we \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E define which contains the parameters to be accessed by the DustFX module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be curious to see if we\u0027d get these kinds of errors if we passed control back to the DustFX module as to when/if it should be emitting anything or not instead of having it called up from the wheel/repulsor modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Took a look at that link, interesting stuff I suppose. Not a lot of a surprise there however. A lot of that would require building a completely new effect in Unity rather than reusing one that\u0027s already loaded into the game. The color stuff has actually always been in there, we\u0027ve just usually put the same color into each slot.

No big deal really.

You get errors about part highlighter and a few other things that look totally unrelated. Looks like other mods have struggled with this (FAR, from a little gooling), but no firm fix was found.

I don\u0027t think we even need the wheel/repulsor modules doing anything if the part is debris. There\u0027s a lot that KF does based on the vessel modules, and a lot of shared information between the other part modules, which will likely go completely haywire when the vessel is an un-controllable debris object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve coded in a check for vesseltype.Drbris and told it to remove the offending module if that state is discovered when the parent module is started, which should take effect once the parts are made active due to being loaded into physics range (I think).
