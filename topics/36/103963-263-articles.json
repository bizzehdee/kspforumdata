Scatterer can only render perfect sphere atmospheres, leaving bodies with greater distortion with bits and pieces popping through.

Then again if it was possible, there would be other visual concerns.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is to make less bumpy planets!

In the first one the atmosphere is behaving how you describe (and how I expected, too, since you can clearly see that the \u0022ring\u0022 starts at what appears to be Duna\u0027s sea level), but the second one shows the atmosphere behaving a little closer to how it should just by making a very small change in camera angle. Is it still Unity that is preventing the behavior in the second screenshot from being consistent, or does it have to do with the way scatterer draws the atmosphere relative to the game camera?"},{"CreatedByName":"Syczek","CreatedById":163803,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-04T12:18:08Z","Content":"Anyone could explain me wich one options leads to terrible fps drop in scatterer??Because my monster rig(i7-6700 k,32 gigs ram and gtx 1070 8 gig) don\u0027t handle it well"}]}
