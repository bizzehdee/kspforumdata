This came out on 13/03/15. It\u0027s called Jupiter and Exoliner. Jupiter is a space tug and Exoliner is an ATV-like cargo vessel. One thing that\u0027s really cool though is that Jupiter has a robotic arm on it that you can see in the picture so that it can transfer it\u0027s cargo, since it can stay in orbit and wait for another Exoliner to rendezvous and basically redo another mission with only one space tug. I\u0027m in the process of modelling it on blender (although I\u0027m making a few minor differences so it will be more playable in the game). Which brings up another topic of that I need someone to help me with this project in the form of texturing and I will probably need help with config files as I am not the greatest at it yet. So if anyone wants to help with that or even if you have tips and tricks that will help us get it out for everyone to use quicker. But the one thing that I cannot do at all without help is getting a functional robotic arm because that is a pretty crucial part of the whole thing, and if I cant get it then we will have to deal with a big, bulky arm made from infernal robotics (not dissing on it because it\u0027s a great mod, but I\u0027ve never been able to make very good arms\u0022. I messaged Romfarer about it because I love his in his pack, but I am doubtful that he will be able to help due to how much they are working on I\u0027m sure. So yeah... ill leave some pics of what I have and what I am using as reference below this, and I am open to any suggestions anybody has, and anything people have to say about this. I\u0027m looking forward to this being a group effort because I don\u0027t believe I can pull it off by just looking at YouTube videos. Thanks!\n\nMy model so far:\n\n[http://imgur.com/gRn7cnF](http://imgur.com/gRn7cnF)\n\nDiagram:\n\n[http://imgur.com/dKNCYPY](http://imgur.com/dKNCYPY)\n\nGeneral pics I\u0027m using as reference:\n\n[http://imgur.com/oEL7R3c](http://imgur.com/oEL7R3c)\n\n[http://imgur.com/RIyIALn](http://imgur.com/RIyIALn)\n\n[http://imgur.com/5i4tjmu](http://imgur.com/5i4tjmu)\n\nLike I said it\u0027s not to scale 100% and by the way I haven\u0027t started on the arm because I don\u0027t want to get it done and then something prevent me from making it work.\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, so I get the model done and go to export it to unity. I get it in and the mesh wont generate. So I think that \u0022oh its pretty complicated and it\u0027ll be easier to just make multiple parts anyway so I get the most basic part that can be by itself (the unpressurized module) which is literally three boxes and it says it can\u0027t do that... Any ideas? If someone could help that would be awesome.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T20:39:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GBLAKEM1999**\n  \nproblem"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T23:16:26Z","Content":"For the arm be nice if you could use DROMOMAN modular arm parts for Damned Infernal Robotics [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics) but don\u0027t is what his license is."},{"CreatedByName":"GBLAKEM1999","CreatedById":112680,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T00:07:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For the arm be nice if you could use DROMOMAN modular arm parts for Damned Infernal Robotics [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37680-DROMOMAN-modular-arm-parts-for-Damned-Infernal-Robotics) but don\u0027t is what his license is.\n\nThanks for the idea I messaged him about trying to make a special arm for this!

How much work is it to make a part like you\u0027re doing by adding it to a pack because that could also work. The arm on it is just really small and skinny and making it in the ways i know through IR just wont do it justice."},{"CreatedByName":"Niemand303","CreatedById":119422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T18:42:27Z","Content":"I can provide some help with configs, as I\u0027ve written quite a lot of them recently. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GBLAKEM1999","CreatedById":112680,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T23:21:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can provide some help with configs, as I\u0027ve written quite a lot of them recently. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nawesome thanks.
