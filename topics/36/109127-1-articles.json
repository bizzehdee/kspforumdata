Release thread is here [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123417-1-0-2-SuperStock-Ground-UP-Rebuild-of-Stock-Tech-Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123417-1-0-2-SuperStock-Ground-UP-Rebuild-of-Stock-Tech-Tree)\n\nI have been trying out various tech tree re-works and while there are some fantastic trees currently in development none of them quite meet the criteria I am looking for.\n\nSuperStock will have two core design parameters;\n\n1. Designed for 100% stock parts\\*\n\n2. Logical technological progression from part to part.\n\n\\* I will also be looking at releasing various config files to allow use of mods with stock parts - for example configs to use mechjeb, scansat, remotetech, life support... using just stock parts for those that want the functionality. This is how I already play KSP!\n\nCurrent stage \n\nSTAGE 4 - Released!... much testing to be done for future balancing.\n\nSTAGE 3 - Populating the nodes with parts.\n\nI\u0027m now on the final stage before release. The tree is finished and I am not creating the module manager file to assign all of the parts to their nodes. It won\u0027t be long before release!\n\nSTAGE 2 COMPLETE! - Creating the node file.\n\nThis is now all laid out and ready to be populated with parts. Shouldn\u0027t take too long...\n\n![K9GL60m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/K9GL60m.jpg)\n\nSTAGE 1 COMPLETE - planning, below is my blueprint for the new tree. I have methodically laid everything out first to make the creation of the custom tree config and part module file much less of a headache.\n\n![X9QVCvD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X9QVCvD.jpg)\n\nAs you can see many parts will occupy their own node with some key nodes having several.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T15:25:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mulbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:40:13Z","Content":"Reserved for updates."},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:52:03Z","Content":"Update\n\nNot too much left to layout on the blueprint.

What makes you rage... the fact it\u0027s in the docking section? Or that it\u0027s after docking ports? If it\u0027s the former, that just seems the logical place for something that docks with something else after a rendezvous... if it\u0027s the latter... pretty sure Gemini docked with Agena before Philae landed on an asteroid.\n\nOr are you just raging at Squad about the claw in general?\n\nAnyway - Update! Got through about the first ten nodes before I realised I really needed to go back to the blueprint and carefully plan out the costs for each node.... this is the bit I most expect to get wrong on the first release but will only smooth out with testing. Aiming to have a total tree cost around 20-30k to unlock... only a little more than the stock tree.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T20:57:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mulbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:31:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What makes you rage... the fact it\u0027s in the docking section?

In terms of the mechanism the Klaw is no different than a set of landing legs. They just open and close. From this perspective you\u0027d be equally justified in placing the Klaw in any branch that has opening and closing components.\n\n\u0022But\u0022 - I hear you say - \u0022The Klaw attaches itself to things\u0022. Sure, but IRL asteroid missions look nothing like this. To keep the experience immersive and avoid breaking the fourth wall from this perspective the Klaw could reasonably be placed in its own branch, still in a later tier as it is now. \n\nSo really the only reason to keep it with there is because Squad got lazy and made it out of a docking port, and as reasons go, that\u0027s really silly one.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXvsi7DRyPI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:35:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the Klaw could reasonably be placed in its own branch, still in a later tier as it is now.\n\nFortunately as it comes near the end of the tree it is very easy to change later without messing everything up! I may look at making it dependent on several technologies. The important bit for me is progression and making sure people don\u0027t have it as an alternative to researching docking ports.\n\nUPDATE!!\n\nTree nodes are starting to come together, currently working through the \u0022launch Vehicle\u0022 section of my tree and have completed some of the \u0022payload\u0022 section (specifically generic and unmanned systems so far)... will move on to laying out the nodes for aero/jets and manned exploration next. This is the biggest job involved in making the tree, the next stage once the tree is completely laid out will be creating the module file to reassign all the parts to the new node... thanks to my planning stage this shouldn\u0027t take very long at all.\n\n![9gUbLIU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9gUbLIU.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T19:00:35Z","Content":"Update:\n\nThigs are going quite quickly now on the node layout.

Many mods only include a relatively small amount of parts so a fairly short module manager file could add those parts to my nodes.\n\nI may take requests at a later stage to add support for various mods. The key thing is though that this will be built, maintained and balanced to work primarily with stock parts... but that doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t work with mods too!... just needs a module manager file for the mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:14:17Z","Content":"Update!!\n\nI have finished constructing the tree!
