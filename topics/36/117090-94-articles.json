Longer tanks -- yah, I had intended to include some alternate lengths from the start, but did not have time to work on them earlier.  For reference, the original MFT-D-3 is the \u0027standard\u0027 length for the Soyuz boosters (this is the length it starts at in the VAB).\n\nWhich brings to me -- I\u0027ve realized over the past few weeks that most of my engines/pods/etc are extremely....unbalanced?  for the stock system, at least as far as any kind of \u0027scale-like\u0027 craft are concerned.  If you create a scaled craft, it generally has scale-like performance (even with the terrible engine TWRs), resulting in ~2.5x the dV needed to get to orbit (~9kms / 3.6kms = 2.5...).

Still working on the overall balance of the craft (aero, thermal, game), and still quite a bit of detailing to do in the texture.  It is looking quite usable though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAll of this brings me to the discussion point for the day/week -- balance.  The pre-release balancing and cleanup has started, and will continue until after 1.1 is released.  This means that generally the mod should be getting even more usable and stable with every release, and there might well be a quite stable and recommendable 1.05 release before 1.1 is in pre-release testing.  If so... bonus ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nThere will likely not be too many new parts in the next few weeks; but you will likely see quite a few updates with fixes, rebalances, and general improvements and enhancements.\n\nIf ever I told you to \u0027please bring that back up during the balancing pass\u0027 -- now is the time to bring it up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nNow, on to the balancing discussion.  As stated, I have realized that the lifter parts and / or command-modules/space are a bit... overpowered for the stock Kerbin/Kerbol system.  For scale-sized craft, about 2 1/2x as powerful as they need to be.  Which sounds like it is good for a 3.2x rescale setup.\n\nI would like these craft and parts to be usable in the stock system, in a stock-career game, without them seeming overpowered, or underpowered / no fun.  So, I will likely be maintaining two sets of stats for most parts.  The current LH2 patch stats will, for the most part, be moved over to be the \u0027default\u0027 stats for the engine.  This will be the starting point of the balance for these parts.  I will also be keeping a copy of the patch around for reference, possibly just renaming it and setting it up for a rescaled system patch.  So, in short.. the stats you see now will likely be the \u0027rescaled system\u0027 stats (with perhaps some modifications... reducing engine dry mass...), and the stock system will use an all-new balance setup.\n\nI\u0027m not sure that I\u0027m going to be able to solve the \u0027overpowered scale-designed craft\u0027 problem... but I\u0027ll give it a bit of a go.  Part of why I won\u0027t be able to solve it is merely the stock setup -- try building a scaled-down Saturn-V using stock parts (S-I = 3.75m), and it will -still- be extremely overpowered for the stock system for any reasonable CSM mass.\n\nHonestly, I\u0027m a bit lost as to where to even begin on balancing things for the stock system... so if you have any bright ideas, I\u0027m listening ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\nShould I aim for a consistent payload-fraction for rockets, keeping consistent with stock setups, while ignoring \u0027scale craft\u0027 designs?  This would generally see ISPs reduced all around, command-pod/service module masses increased, and a general \u0027lead-cladding\u0027 added to most parts to increase their dry-mass to stock like levels.  I\u0027m not really sure of any other way to do it, as that -is- stock balancing... (even though I disagree with it).  This would also likely see some engine thrusts -increased- to be usable with increased mass of payloads, and others increased to just be -usable- in the stock system (cannot do orbital injection @ 0.2TWR in the stock system; the orbit just isn\u0027t long enough/shallow enough).\n\nAnyhow, feel free to chime in if you have some ideas / input / etc -- going to be at this for a couple weeks it sounds like, so should be a good amount of time to get most things sorted out.\n\nOhh, and anyone have any good schematics / diagrams of the RD-0110?

I agree that stockalike balance is always going to look ridiculous as far as payload fractions go, but this is the case even with stock parts.  I like the idea of realistic I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E values but scaled masses - stock I\u003Csub\u003Esp \u003C/sub\u003Evalues are already basically correct for modern hypergolics (~95% of what you get with kerolox) according to NathanKell.  Keep in mind that hydrolox will inevitably result in higher payload fractions, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that - hydrolox stages should have other tradeoffs (more tank volume and more expensive engines)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T18:45:23Z","Content":"Thanks for the images/references -- that is more than I was able to dig up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)   No worries on the Russian notation / writing -- I can infer what I need from the diagram given what I know of the specific engine, rocket engines in general, and the actual diagram ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  (only so many ways that the fuel flow can be setup, only one of those will be \u0027right\u0027, and can usually tell which based on the the flow of the fuel, as LOX and fuel are generally routed quite differently, with LOX often going straight into the CC after pumping).\n\nLikely the only new parts that I\u0027ll be creating in the next few weeks will be some engines to help fill in some of the gaps in the engine lineup; and these will be mostly smaller sized lifter and KLOX engines (have lots of larger stuff already).
