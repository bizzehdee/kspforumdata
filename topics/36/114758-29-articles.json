Have you tested it with multiples of each part that uses it? Fustek has problems with some of its parts when lots of them are in the scene at once.\n\nHad no problems with the performance yet. I think there were about 10 parts with IVA in one scene. But that may change when more props are added.\n\nRPM props and the transparent windows will be in different \\*.cfg files though. So you can still remove the transparency easily by just removing one file.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Having multiple transparent pods in the same craft, or indeed within physics range of each other, is one way to get a performance drop. As long as you can\u0027t actually see the other pods from the interior of one of them, however, you won\u0027t even notice that it won\u0027t show the insides of other pods when in IVA. I\u0027d be interested to see how you\u0027re handling their retracted states along with the transparent windows. I\u0027ve yet to ever see an IVA view that animated along with the outside part to reflect a change in dimensions or size.\n\nI simply make the IVA invisible until the part is fully deployed. Still have to make the windows not transparent until the IVA is visible though."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T23:06:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Had no problems with the performance yet.

Screenshots from latest base on Duna soon (just need a bit more EVA time to move the final pieces together). Had to stuff around with the wheels quite a bit - looking forward to those being fixed.\n\nI wonder, is there a mod that will show information on which direction a wheel motor will drive? Steering can be reversed in flight, but motor direction... it would save a lot of pain ...\n\nI like that there\u0027s a good choice between this and the inflatable options in other mods. I\u0027ve even combined the two in one base (well, I used the connecting tubes from MKS).\n\nCould I request a larger KIS pod please?

On reload (of any sort) the utility wing (with the rover bay and KIS containers) attachment point to the central hub (the white base part attached to the central round container which has no legs attached to it - I forget the name of it) would spontaneously explode. I couldn\u0027t determine the cause of any real stress on it: I tried any number of things to stop it from exploding. I decoupled the wing, I made sure all the wheel brakes were on, I lowered all the landing legs. Nothing stopped it from exploding. And because it was such a core part, there was no way I was going to be able to KIS repair it, so I had to hyperedit in a new core. I don\u0027t like cheating, but there was no way to save the base without it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI\u0027m running so many mods I have to use OpenGL so there\u0027s no shadows in the screenshots."},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T23:55:59Z","Content":"There\u0027s nothing disabling cross feed.
