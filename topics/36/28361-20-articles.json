However, while discussing alternative texture packs with nothke, I had a number of ideas / thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The Firespitter plugin has the ability to swap textures on-the-fly in-game, I\u0027d like to repackage said feature into my own plugin so that users can change the textures on their FusTek parts between a number of third-party created styles on-the-fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Said plugin PartModule can handle multiple instances of texture-swapping, but I decided that it would be better for users to minimize the number of mouse clicks required to do so, hence the large and somewhat ungainly atlas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SQUAD does sometimes have non-square textures in their stock parts (such as the parachutes and docking ports), but my understanding is that as long as the dimensions are in powers of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 px), the game should be able to handle it okay - something to do with inefficient memory usage if Unity has to pad additional pixels onto textures with non-powers-of-two dimensions prior to mipmap generation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T18:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup.
