I think you\u0027ll need to define where it\u0027s found - see Ore.cfg in the same directory. Then you\u0027ll need a way to acquire and store the resource - I\u0027m guessing you would create a part with a ModuleResourceHarvester (see stock drills) and another part to store it. The last step would be to use run an experiment that requires the resource - I\u0027m not sure if stock modules can do this - and if they can they probably consume the resources(rodents). May require a custom plugin - especially if you don\u0027t want to consume the resource, just require it be present.
