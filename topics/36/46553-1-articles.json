The way to think of it is that each time step, it takes a certain percentage step towards the Target rotation, allot like how when turning on Fine Controls will slow the input. High values make it more responsive, low values make it less responsive, however unfortunately it is relative to physics deltaTime as opposed to being in some form of measurable degrees-per-second. It is however a scalar, so 2 means it is twice as fast as 1, 0.5 makes it twice as slow, etc, and assuming nominal conditions it should converge in about (1/gimbalResponseTime) Seconds, converging faster when under time warp. The way to think about it is basically a scale for the speed of the gimbal, faster is faster and lower is slower, but that it works much like fine controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, gimbalTransformName simply refers to the name of the transform in your part that is actually rotating- Like how for most engines, it\u0027s only the exhaust cone that does the rotation, not the engine as a whole.

The gimballing system most likely uses Mathf.Lerp (or Slerp) to change the gimbal of the engine nozzle, and those parameters are startValue, endValue, and changeInValue. So higher values for gimbalResponseSpeed means it will change faster. It\u0027s kind of counterintuitive, but understandable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, Lerp does this: v-k = mt, where v is a function of t, k is the initial value, and m is the change (gimbalResponseSpeed).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-26T12:53:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2013 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitusII\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
