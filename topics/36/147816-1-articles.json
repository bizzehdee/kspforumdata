I never really updated it and to be honest kind of hoped somebody else would just run with the idea, but that didn\u0027t ever happen. Several versions later, I\u0027ve decided to just go and do it myself. I have a few ideas of what to do, but suggestions and requests will help really complete things, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50907-spannermonkeysmce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002250907\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50907-spannermonkeysmce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/a\u003E was kind enough to convert the old model to work in 1.1 for me: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21315217/roveryard.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21315217/roveryard.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zMdHAYl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21315217/zMdHAYl.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, it doesn\u0027t exactly look very good; being a model I threw together as quickly as I could at the time.
