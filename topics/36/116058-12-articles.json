Kronkus has a version of Kopernicus inside of it, and fully or partially overriding a new version of Kopernicus may cause this. It is happening to me too, for instance, and it isn\u0027t Kronkus causing it, it appears to be one of the other I installed...\n\nWait, no, it IS Kronkus. After installing each individually, Kronkus is the one that caused the space center to instead bring you into deep space (near Mun, you can see it orbit every few hundred days). If you instead try \u0022Scenario-\u003E Station One\u0022 or whatever with the docked space shuttle, that brings you in some area of what is likely the galactic core and unable to properly bring up the orbital map.\n\nAlso, I am getting \u00222 errors found in galacticneighborhood/core/StockFix.cfg\u0022 after installing Kronkus, despite no errors with everything BUT Kronkus installed. EDIT-EDIT: These errors may come from something else actually, without Kronkus and with the other systems it still shows up unreliably, but the game still loads the space center.\n\nIt is in fact the culprit, and I hoped the information was helpful in some way. Hope you list it in OP as bugged (like RSS) soon and figure out a patch ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T06:46:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 06:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YagiHige**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T10:15:00Z","Content":"could this be the reason for all of you that are having problems with Kronkus?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E hi mr chumley,\n\u003E I couldn\u0027t make Kronkus load (downloading it from Kerballstuff)\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the issue is that in your archive you have the folder Kronkus nested inside another folder called Kronkus as well\n\u003E \n\u003E ![b1QnQq6.png](http://i.imgur.com/b1QnQq6.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E moving the second \u0022Kronkus\u0022 folder into GameData solved the problem\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the github download is still version 0.7 (at least the name is)\n\n* * *\n\nGalactic Neighborhood Alpha v0.0.6\n\nDownload\n\n[TABLE=width: 100]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center][![5IdGJ3n.png](http://i.imgur.com/5IdGJ3n.png)](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/releases/latest)\n\n**@GitHub**\n\n[![devBuild-%40GitHub-lightgrey.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/devBuild-%40GitHub-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/archive/Development.zip)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[**report issues here**](https://github.com/Sigma88/Galactic-Neighborhood/issues)\n\nChangelog\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]\n\n    [B]v0.0.6[/B]- Fixed compatibility with RSS- Fixed a bug of particles effect on stars\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T10:17:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 10:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Derwan","CreatedById":133233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T16:42:50Z","Content":"Sorry to bother you again, but I\u0027m having another problem. \n\nI\u0027m bad at orbits, and have been using mechjeb to do my orbits like...forever. today I tried to launch my first warp-capable ship, Pioneer I, to another star.
