It\u0027s just too brain bending to figure out at this time. Fortunately, with TweakScale support on all the tracks, you can easily set up clusters of tracks where you\u0027d originally want one long one. It won\u0027t function exactly as you\u0027d expect a one-piece track to function, but it works in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think, however, that some sort of procedural track could be produced in this custom-made stroke of genius brought to you by... well... me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what you\u0027d do is make a basic procedural part that would act as the visual representation of the track itself. Not the inside wheels or anything, just the outer rubber band. This part would have a track texture and would use something like your texture animator to make it look like the track is moving. The collisions and what not would then be provided by a set of inner wheels which would be made as companion parts to the track. The track itself wouldn\u0027t have any collisions that the wheels would be able to interact with, and so the wheel parts (with a larger collision range to accommodate the track thickness) would be able to handle everything. The tricky part will then be making the procedural track attach to one of those inner wheels exclusively, so as to make sure that the orientations remain accurate, and controlling the texture animation on the procedural track to match the speed that the track would need to be moving for the current maneuver (turning, moving forward/backward, etc.) In other words, it\u0027d be re-making that whole thing about the stock wheel bug that lets people make what appears to be hovering rovers (using wheel colliders and flat panels) except you\u0027re not using a bug technically, and you\u0027re providing a visual to make it look right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I have no clue how to implement this... so good luck making it happen. You\u0027re gonna need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, by the way lo-fi, I must have mentioned by DustFX spin-off from CollisionFX right? So, I finally got it working with a complete and extendable configuration file to define dust colors for biomes and planets (and possibly as detailed as specific locations using \u0022landedAt\u0022). Everything can be controlled, including particle strength and speed (which I also made TweakScale exponents to handle) on a per-wheel basis. Well, I added the module to the repulsors, before this KSP 1.0 release screwed up all the mods (temporarily of course), and did a little testing. As it turns out, the collisions that the repulsion field create also trigger the DustFX collision detection and throw up dust on the ground when you\u0027re moving over the surface. It looks awesome, and I really wish I had screenshots or something to show.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T02:04:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, I just bumped it.

I say constant because for wheels, it doesn\u0027t change much with speed. Though as you point out, it needs to be correctly multiplied with laden weight. This would neatly nerf acceleration and top speed for heavily laden wheels and increase power usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracks probably need a rolling resistance curve, but this is easy to roll into the same config fields as wheels.
