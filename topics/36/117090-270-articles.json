Or change scenes properly.\n\nGeneral development update:\n\nSpent most of the weekend doing heat-shield/re-entry testing.  Hours and hours and more hours of it.  And then a few more hours of it.  The good news is that I think it is nearly done.  Have a couple more parts/scenario combinations to test, but compared to the 60\u002B scenarios already tested, the last few should be easy (as long as no more balance changes are needed).  (yes, that is 60\u002B distinct setups that needed tests ran on them, each taking ~3-5 minutes, and having to redo all of them after every single minor balance change)\n\nSC-V (VA) parts are nearly/mostly finished.  Probably could be released except for needing to finish all the heat-shield re-balance stuff first.  It works well, and the balance all sits about where I had intended it to.  VA\u002BTKS provides ~650m/s and once decoupled the SM provides ~200m/s for de-orbit.  In its default configuration, it should be usable for Mun/Minmus return missions (with a proper upper-stage to deliver it to mun/minmus).  Drogue chutes are contained in the SM, main chutes in the VA capsule itself (SM should be jettisoned as the main chutes are deployed; SM will continue its descent with the drogues and be recoverable as well).\n\nLate last week (friday) I was able to do a bit of work on the upper-stage SRBs.  Models are unwrapped and reduced to unique geometry, need to finish the UV layout and start working on textures.  Hope to be able to have these available within a couple of weeks, but no guarantees -- still a bit that needs to be figured out on the plugin/code end of things regarding the integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (seems to be working, but needs lots more testing).\n\nAlso spent a bit of time working on some of the mod integration patches.  Trying to get things cleaned up so that I can start up a new career game here in a few days/weeks (mostly waiting for 1.3.1 to be released).  Starting by working through MKS to remove FS and GC dependencies, and rework to use SSTU-VolumeContainer for resources and EPL for construction (and converting any usable fuel tanks to be a single-part MFT setup).  Next will be a pass over all of the SSTU parts for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS balance/integration (and second balance pass for StationCore parts for mass/resources/etc).\n\nFinally, spent a bit of time working on the conversion patches for KSPWheel -- converting all of the stock (and other mods\u0027) wheels/legs/gear to use the KSPWheel system.  So far, so good; stock is mostly done from the original testing setup work, needs to have speed/load/dust added/updated.  Put together some quick patches for the wheels for the WBI-Buffallo rover, which are working extremely well, though still need a bit of touch-up work (motor gearing/max-rpm, default steering curve setups).  Will be slowly working on finishing up the stock-conversion patches and adding patches for other mods\u0027 wheels and legs as I find time.\n\nIf all goes well I should have an updated release later this week / weekend that contains the heat-shield rebalance pass as well as the updated / finished SC-V parts.  Have a few other small issues/bugs on the tracker that I\u0027ll try to get fixed up for that release as well -- so if anyone has any issues to report, please do so now so that they have a chance of being fixed for the next release."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T17:39:26Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nNot really an issue so REAL LOW priority.

Nor should it have any impact on their functionality.  \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E should also work jut fine with the chutes, just in case you are using that.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking through the code, the parachutes are using density to determine if it is safe to open (whereas the kPa measures air pressure).  I believe this value is specified in kg-per-cubic-meter, and I think should be roughly ~1.225kg/m3 at sea level (Earth, Kerbin, other properly setup earth-like worlds).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm.. there might be something in the stock debug tools that will let you view the current air density for the vessel -- probably under the stock debug menu -\u003E aero -\u003E view aero debug GUI.  I\u0027ll try to take a look at this tonight to see if I can locate where that information might be found in the stock tools.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -- do the parachutes open at a higher altitude if you set the opening-altitude higher (higher than 1200) in the GUI, or are they simply limited to ~200m and below in your current setup?  Does setting the \u0027mainMinDensity\u0027 to a super-low value allow them to open at a higher altitude (e.g. set it to 0.00001 and see if anything changes)?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Indeed, that is a texture set intended to be specific to the StationCore parts, hence the ST- prefix.  You should be able to get fairly equivalent texture setups on the adapters by selecting one of the non-cloth texture sets and then using the recoloring GUI to match up the colors.  I\u0027ll admit that the texture / recoloring system isn\u0027t perfect (neither in function nor in config/setup)... but it is also way more customization than you will get with most other mods.\n\u003E \n\nFirst thanks for the quick and detailed replies.\n\nI ran 3 tests. \n\nTest 1) BDB Apollo Blk-IV. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E created DP-05P of 0.9375m Diameter.   Single Deploy altitude in the right click menu (more on this in a bit).....    No mater what altitude I set it to, UNLESS I click Deploy BEFORE that altitude... I get a deployment starting around 200m.  \n\nTest 2) SC-V VA capsule on TKS.   (I needed to try this out since I haven\u0027t played with it yet.)   inbuilt Dockingports have 2x deployment altitudes showing on the SC-V and 1x on the TKS...   I discovered something... tragic here.  The Chutes deploy over about 8 seconds..... 8 x220m/s = ~4000m traveled....   \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Se5yM](https://imgur.com/a/Se5yM)\n\nTest 3)  Final test...   BDB Apollo Blk-IV with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E created DP-05P of 0.9375m again.  This time setting deploy altitude to 5500m (Max allowed).\n\nWell you can see the results in the Imgur library.  The Chute is deciding the speed is unsafe and not deploying.    Cause is not my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E file as I initially surmised but the fact that SSTU built in ports have both a Drogue and a main chute whiles the add on ports only have the mains...   Add the fact that the BDB Apollo has less intrinsic drag than the SSTU Apollo.....   Yep 100% not an issue.\n\nSo I did Test 4 before posting....   Same Atlas V launch vehicle... Launching the SC-B Apollo capsule.   Interesting... On a rocket that could only get the SSTU SC-V to 453km and the BDB Apollo to 1.1Mm....  The SC-B went past escape velocity.   Judicous use of the Hyperedit Thrust adjustment tool.... and I am ALMOST escape velocity....   Landed safely 28 days after launch.\n\nSorry for raising this [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)  Maybe I should play KSP more often so I can not make these....fun... mistakes.\n\nNOTE:  The only reason the SSTU VA and Apollo capsules did not burn up was because of the drogue chutes....   I attached the 0.9375m docking port to both and they both crashed.  This was in my sandbox game so I just reverted\n\nMy Solution.... Add 4 Air-breaks to any capsule I am trying to land with the docking port serving as a parachute module.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-19T00:14:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2017 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**\n  \nBroken Imgur link"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T00:44:21Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), Some Feedback on Station Core:\n\nI have been playing a lot with the DOS parts \u0026 I would suggest 100-150% of real life mass (~17-20 tons for DOS, not sure on COS). \n\nGetting these beasts to orbit should not be easy I changed them in my game and it out that in a 3.2x Kerbin, the  Proton Rocket from Tantares puts a DOS module into a perfect orbit with just enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to circularize. \n\nI haven\u0027t played with them much but I would say the same about the modular satellites.

Yep 100% not an issue.\n\u003E \n\nThere are three settings that control when a chute is safe to deploy or not --\n\n- Has to be below a certain dynamic pressure (so it doesn\u0027t get shredded by aero forces, this is mostly governed by speed)\n- Has to be above a specific air density (so there is enough air to spool it out and deploy it, this is determined by altitude)\n- Has to be below a certain temperature (so it doesn\u0027t burn up, this is a combination of speed/density)\n\nI should also add that all of those settings can be tweaked in the config for the parachute module, and separately for the main and drogue chutes.\n\nAdditionally, and this is the really neat thing about the module, you can add a drogue parachute to those parts simply through config edits/additions.  No need for modeling, animations, etc...  If that is something you are interested in learning more about, let me know and I can work on putting together some examples for you.  You can actually use the module to add parachutes to -any- part through config edits/patches.  Fun stuff...  (also supports alternate models and textures)\n\nYes, the chutes take a bit of time to deploy (also configurable); this is to limit instantaneous g-forces from deployment or transition from semi-deployed to full-deployed.  They move from packed towards semi-deployed at the specified \u0027deploy alt\u0027 in the GUI, over the config-specified number of seconds.
