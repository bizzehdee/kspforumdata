SSTU has totally broken KSP for me, ever since first trying it out I cannot bring myself to play with out it. I agree with other peoples statements that SSTU in it\u0027s current form is plenty stable and more than feature rich enough to deserve a 1.0 release, I know with personal projects there is always something you think you could do better or differently, but this is already far and away better than the majority of mods out there, and the tools that you have created for the community in the process is amazing. So if you do decide that Squad and T2\u0027s new tack is anathema to you I hope you will consider placing SSTU into release and sticking around for a bit to at least maintain it. I realize this request is purely selfish in nature but SSTU really has profoundly changed my KSP experience."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-11T21:14:49Z","Content":"I\u0027m playing 1.4 stock a bit, but I keep looking for the length and diameter setting for the tanks to no avail.
