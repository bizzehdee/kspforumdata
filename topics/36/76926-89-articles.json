Great mod. Since squad tried to make this game as peaceful as possible, it makes a great difference. The experience is amazing, recreating famous battles etc. Works great with kerbinside for recreations. Only 1 thing to improve (and I am NOT complaining but I thought you might need to know) sometimes when I crash my planes etc it won\u0027t allow me to revert flight or exit to space center unless all of the weaponary is destroyed. NOT COMPLAINING THIS IS GOOD MOD. Just thought you might want to be made aware of this.
