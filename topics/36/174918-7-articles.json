PsiCartographer is a fork if Sigma88\u0027s SigmaCartographer which was a fantastic tool for outputting various map types from KSP. What that means is that it could be used to output the maps so that procedurally made planets actually have something to look at when you are in the map screen. The original would always overwrite existing files, but the fork can check and see if a file already exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot gonna lie: running both Kopernicus and PsiCartographer can be slow the first time you load up a universe. On my machine, generating 43 stars and 321 planets took a little over 9 minutes for Kopernicus to finish saving cache files for each body, and 12 minutes for PsiCartographer to generate the images for 55 procedurally generated planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that first load of a universe, you need to quit and reload KSP in order for the planet textures to work. The good news is on my machine that second load only took 3 minutes (since all the bodies were cached and the textures for terrain all existed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can choose not to use PsiCartographer, but the procedural worlds will look pretty bland from the map view. Note: the universe that comes with TBG 0.4.1 has been made assuming you\u0027re using PsiCartographer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-07T14:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2020 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by seanth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seanth","CreatedById":79989,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-10T06:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I have said previously, I would love to rewrite TBG in python (a language I am more comfortable in).

wants to continue in his own direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the option of converting to python, even if programming in qBasic does bring back long-lost memories of my first

unknown.\u00A0 The story for my playthrough is something along the lines of: another star is on its way and expected to merge with Kerbol in 100 years.\u00A0 The Kerbals are relatively safe until then, but the Kerbol system will cease to exist as they know it.\u00A0 Time is of the essence to catalog, explore, and colonize other life-supporting worlds before time runs out.\u00A0 Victory condition: 1000 kerbals have left the Kerbal system by year 100 and made their way to other planets that have Oxygen, water, and enough flat land to build a completely self-sufficient base with the capability of continuing the Space Program indefinitely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make this interesting, especially the habitable worlds need enough variation that once the colony ship arrives, they might find out that yes, the planet supports life, but only in the oceans because the only land mass is a giant super volcano.\u00A0 Or the only land is mountainous, narrow islands that can\u0027t properly support a base with a long, flat runway.\u00A0 Or land is plentiful, but mostly desert because water is so scarce that it couldn\u0027t support a growing population.\u00A0 These worlds might support a post-year-100 rest stop and temporary base on the continued quest for New Kerbin, but the colony ship must be repaired, restocked, refueled, and eventually continue its quest for Kerbinkind\u0027s final destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means I\u0027d need to give more knobs to turn on the number and types of habitable worlds available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, simplex noise, no matter how much you tweak it, doesn\u0027t provide this kind of variation.\u00A0 So I\u0027m considering integrating an extension of

support the various warp drive mods, but the game I want to play involves building colony ships that there is no feasible way to fit a warp bubble around without consuming all the energy in the
