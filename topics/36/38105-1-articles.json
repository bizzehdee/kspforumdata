Today, I am here to show off what will be my first real mod. It\u0027s still a work-in-progress, as the prefix suggests, though. I will be happy once it\u0027s completed. Like many other modders... Anyways! I have yet to see a mod with a Huygens probe system. I am developing a model of the Huygens probe right now. It will have some components that could be assembled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Huygens probe core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Heat shield, should function as a decoupler so none are needed to separate it once it\u0027s done being used. I also want to tweak it so it works with Deadly Re-Entry, but I think I should contact its modder first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Huygens instrument set, functions as Gravioli, Accelerometer, Barometer, and Thermometer detectors. I want to make a seperate version that has a Kethane unit and an ISA mapper. But, again, I must request permission to allow it to be compatible with Kethane or ISA\u0027s MapSat before I do upload it, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it would be assembled...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuygens Core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat Shield\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E LAUNCH VEHICLE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E AND TRANSFER STAGE,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAY COME IN THE FUTURE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems simple enough, no?

I may also model a Cassini probe to drop it off at Laythe, or some other atmospheric moon or planet. I recommend Eve or Laythe, maybe even Kerbin for fun, because of the thick atmospheres. Now that I am thinking about thick atmospheres, I thought of Jupiter and Galileo...hm...Tell me what you think! What do you want to see first? I am texturing the Huygens probe right now!
