Edition)","CreatedByName":"Nolnoc","CreatedById":83479,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T16:38:58Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Nolnoc","CreatedById":83479,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T16:38:58Z","Content":"**First up, Pics for Clicks:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/BG3jR)\n\n**What is this mod?**\n\nKerbin 365 was created with the goal of making space travel harder for veteran players, while still allowing the use of Career Mode and custom rocket packs. K-365 re-scales all planets and orbits to make both achieving orbit and traveling between planets much more difficult than it is in stock. This makes large manned interplanetary travel near to impossible with either single launch ships or conventional chemical rockets; making orbital construction and NERVA engines needed for manned travel past Kerbin orbit.\n\n**What does this mod do?**\n\nThis mod is full of changes to the Kerbol system designed to make it look and feel more like the real solar-system we all know.\n\n- All planets are now 3.2 times larger and have their atmosphere re-scaled to be 16% larger.\n\n- All interplanetary distances are 6.4 times farther, making all celestial bodies much farther from each other (includes moons).\n\n- Kerbin time is now congruent with standard earth time; 24 hour days, 365 days per year.\n\n**Why these re-scale factors?** \n\nThrough testing I found that 3.2x planetary re-scale is nearing the limits of what is possible in career mode. In 3.2x even putting a single tonne into orbit will require all 16 tonnes available at Tier 1. This plus the additional 2x re-scale to orbital distances pushes any pre-built launcher pack, such as [Beale\u0027s N1 Rocket](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81537-0-90-Tantares-Stockalike-Soyuz-and-MIR-18-16-03-2015-PPTS-Dev), to the absolute limit while still being completely possible and in my opinion, more realistic. \n\n**Sounds pretty neat, what\u0027s the download?**\n\n***THE DOWNLOAD IS HERE!***\n\n[***Download BETA v0.4.1***](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mdu8vz936n631ha/K-365%20Version%200.4.1.zip?dl=0)\n\n**\\* NOTICE! \\*** \n\n-As of Version 0.4 the config file name has been changed. Completely delete the old Kerbin365 folder prior to upgrading to the new version.\n\n-This version up-scales the size of the atmosphere on all applicable planets, including Kerbin. This means the lifting capacity of pre-built vessels has been altered, and any craft orbiting in the range of 70 to 81 kilometers around Kerbin is now considered inside the new atmosphere, and is subject to probable re-entry.

I rarely venture away from stock or Tantares with these, and they all seem to work as their real life counterpart intends as well with this scale size!\n\nThe planet distances is FANTASTIC as well. I\u0027ve been to Mun and Minmus a handful of times, and Duna once now, and each time it felt like i had to pack for a JOURNEY. Even just to Minmus (with a life support mod) i had to do a multi-launch system where i had life support station orbiter, a lander, a re-entry craft, and the burn vessel all seperately brought up and assembled (the 2200\u002B dV to get there now makes it very justifiable, as well as the fuel needed to get off the surface into orbit ... no more Toyota Corolla Landers)\n\n\\*MY\\* Main problems so far are this:\n\n1) I use Better Atmospheres (never been an Astronomer\u0027s Pack person, meh. Have you SEEN how Mun looks in BA?). Now i think this would be a universal problem for any atmo pack but, i can definitely say from BA: there is some serious atmospheric anomalies: Clouds clipping into weird circles etc, clipping through mountains causing z fighting issues when in orbit, city lights HAVE to be raised or they\u0027re invisible LOL. Putting in the good time to make the atmosphere mods work with this would, i feel, make a hell of a difference to the mod. If i can manage to get a half-decent looking BA one i\u0027ll post it here myself.\n\n2) Diversity. Maybe this is just me, but i would LOVE to have something stand this pack out \\*juuuust\\* a touch from just being a rescale. Honestly, i wouldn\u0027t mind if you went crazy like SKRX resize and did some super-hot volcanic planet, or rings to Jool, or recolors, you don\u0027t even need to add new planets just re-arrange the ones we have now. I\u0027d *really, REALLY* like to see this have a little flavour of its own. \n\n3) Deadly Re-entry, as its prone to do, and i think you mentioned this above, was either WAY WAY too easy, or insanely too hard. I kinda rolled my own config in the end that was RSS setting, with 1.2\\* to all the top modifiers. Ended up about right for me. But again thats all personal taste. I want to feel like my ablative shielding had a use, but not have it all burnt out halfway down and suddenly have a capsule explode even though i had a super shallow entry.\n\nAnd i think that about covers it for starters. Love the mod, know you\u0027re crazy busy, but please don\u0027t drop it, it\u0027d be a shame, especially once 1.0 finally drops."},{"CreatedByName":"Lucius","CreatedById":89422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:20:33Z","Content":"Hey all:\n\nBeen fiddling with configs and clouds and all manner of little things, just thought i\u0027d show off a few \u0022concepts\u0022 I\u0027ve been enjoying.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Made it much more Mars-y, and the little asteroid moons made a fun reason to float around Duna other than just the mandatory \u0022I went to Mars!\u0022 reason.\n\n-Added a LOT of environmental effects to Eve. Like you see in the album before, anything that makes it feel like a more interesting less \u0022purple\u0022 sort of planet, deadly and worth respecting in the same way we respect Venus\n\n-HEAVILY considered taking dres, slapping it with Eeloo, and making them a binary system on the fringes with some interesting effects to it, maybe adding an atmosphere to Eeloo too. Give SOMETHING interesting to make the trek to the furthest reaches worthwhile\n\n-Rings for Jool. The rings i added in those pictures are adapted from an idea from Skyrex who i have already contacted and politely consented to let the idea be distributed with this pack if you find you like it. I\u0027ll gladly distribute the atmospheric presets for Env.Vis. Overhaul that i used to get that effect, if you want to incorporate it. This just makes the Jool trek all the more appreciable.\n\nIn my tiny opinion, the kerbal system is already pretty small, if you\u0027re looking to maintain a \u0022stock\u0022ish feel just upscaled, you\u0027d do better to make each planet that already exists INTERESTING rather than cramming even more planets in. \n\nBUT, yes, its totally true that in my experiments it was damn hard to add atmospheres to anywhere without just resorting to Kopernicus.

It feels like a fun little not-crazy-realistic simulator that lets you enjoy your own personal head-canon solar system however you want to. Now this is ABSOLUTELY personal preference, and I mean no personal offense to the people who have made the incredible realism mods like RO and RSS and RP-0, but some of us don\u0027t want to get THAT in depth. There is an entire thread devoted simply to trying to design a way to get to Mars and return where people are mashing minds and problem-solving. That\u0027s great, in its own way! but its not what some people want from KSP.\n\nTHE STRUGGLE IS THIS: I like the KSP parts, i like the feel and the aesthetic and the un-realism that lets you laugh instead of get mad when something blows up. HOWEVER: I don\u0027t like being able to put a chair on top of a first tier solid rocket booster and reach orbit or even the mun with it. I don\u0027t like exactly what some videos have outlined: at tier 0 science you can fly to the moon and back on 3-4 pieces.\n\nOKAY SO WHY NOT JUST SCALE THE PLANETS UP?\n\nWell, i\u0027ve tried those too, and actually they\u0027re not bad. I really liked a few of them, REALLY solid idea. But lets briefly discuss the problems those hit, i\u0027m going to point to a few, but please remember i really love all the mod developers and i know they\u0027ve put blood and sweat into it.\n\nPQS/Scale distance problems: After about 3.2x planetary scale, planets start to look really ugly. You start to have a lot of problems in low orbit. If you\u0027ve played 64k Kerbin or even to a lesser extend Skyrex\u0027s 1/4/7, you see the problem. you REALLY see it in RSS, and its what the developer of RVE has spent so long adjusting and trying to fix. \n\nCareer mode limitations: At this point in time we do not have the ability to mod the limits of each tier of the space center, so if you\u0027re trying to play a legitimate campaign and not cheat and immerse yourself, good ....ing luck getting into orbit at 64k with stock parts. Now you have to start modding parts and adjusting the whole system. So wham, you might as well be playing RSS with RO now, you\u0027re sinking a good amount of work into fixing the game to play like KSP already does\n\nSo, okay, we can scale the planets up a FAIR amount, but not an insane amount, for example purposes lets say 3.2x. However getting into orbit at 3.2x isn\u0027t that much more difficult than stock, and you want a reason to use the big parts. You want big rockets, you want a solid reason to really build large behemoths and not just so you can land an entire colony on duna in a single launch. You want large, immersive realistic feeling rockets, but with a realistic workable kerbin that falls within the limitations sort of .. served to us with the game\u0027s confines.\n\nSo why not scale the distances between planets up? The moon is a 3-4 day journey irl, not the 12 hour journey of stock KSP, so why not make the spaces further apart, where it won\u0027t graphically affect the gameplay, and the player can still get into orbit easily with the restrictions the career introduces, but if they\u0027re clever they can combine ships together and build their ACTUAL solutions to traverse planets, like the gemini/agena solution. **I feel like, by making it easy to get into orbit but hard to get anywhere, you force the player to TRULY be creative within the confines of a system they can actually immersively work with.** And it allows you to use mods like Tantares or FASA etc and still have them work without needing to mod them. The massive amounts of dV available in stock from things like a gemini launcher (Take a gemini pod on a titan rocket to duna one day, in one launch, and you feel the pain) will still make it easy to get into space, but good luck just \u0022popping\u0022 over to Mun now!\n\nBlah blah blah i know, but i hope you can see where this sort of thing would really appeal!"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T10:39:46Z","Content":"Yeah, reading this now, I\u0027m totally convinced.
