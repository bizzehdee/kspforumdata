Making some rather major changes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Now works on altitude above terrain rather than sea-level\n- Three alarms - one for either excessive descent rate (auto mode) or descent when below a specified altitude (manual mode, similar to how it works now)\n- Alarm when dropping below 152 meters (500 feet-ish)\n- Alarm when you\u0027re about to hit the deck and probably explode.\n\nA few other tweaks too, Manuxkerb, hopefully the sound will work for you in the new version, not certain what the issue might have been but it could be related to how it was checking your altitude before (ie. against sea level rather than terrain). \n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"loki130","CreatedById":64492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T19:11:23Z","Content":"Hey, just so you know, I tracked down a bug to this mod which seems to mess with the biomes around KSC. Any craft on the runway or launchpad will report as being on kerbin shores, so any contracts that depend on these locations are impossible to complete. (Curiously enough, EVA-deployed science experiments that work with KIS will still detect the correct biomes)."}]}
