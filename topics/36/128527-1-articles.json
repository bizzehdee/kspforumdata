But that is just theory and conjecture. They were going to release information about the MCT late 2015, but that was before the launch holds due to CR-7. So I was thinking of making a couple theoretical rockets. Maybe even bring back the grasshopper, falcon 5, Falcon X, Falcon X Heavy, and the Falcon XX.
