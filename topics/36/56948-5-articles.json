The density biomass uses is 0.00000643tonnes/L (which is not arbitrary. I can explain if people want). Therefor 1*0.00000643=0.00000643tonnes or 0.00643kg of oxygen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth TAC-LS and Biomass assume 1 kerbal consumes about 0.4295kg of oxygen every 86400sec day. The 0.00643kg of oxygen in the mk1 pod will therefore be enough for 1 kerbal for 1293.49seconds, or 21.5 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short: the values you are seeing are correct for the current settings. If you wanted the mk-1 command pod to hold 1 day\u0027s worth of oxygen, the resource node should be changed to the same value as given in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62631-BioMass-Ongoing-Development/page8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econfiguration window\u003C/a\u003E.
