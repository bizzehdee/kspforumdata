Not all normal deployable MKS components have them. RD\u0027s logic seems to be pretty sound. If you\u0027re just storing a bunch of stuff in a big balloon, it\u0027s free to deploy and switch around. If it would involve swapping out intricate parts, like changing drill sifters, that has a small Specialized Parts cost. On the other hand, nobody is actually going to want to live in an empty bouncy castle... you have to inflate it and then fill it with -stuff-. Furniture, food prep, life support, etc. That\u0027s the Material Kits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy comparison, the PBS greenhouse has room for everything that\u0027s inside of it in its (slightly) condensed state. It just expands outward to make an aisle in the center and give the plants a bit more breathing room. It\u0027s like a mobile home with expanding sides. You can\u0027t -use- it with the sides collapsed, not really; it\u0027s too cramped. But to expand it out, you just push a button; it doesn\u0027t take any parts or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the balance should come in the form of construction cost and weight. An inflatable greenhouse in MKS is cheap and relatively light because it presumably contains just the algae, probably in dried form. Once you inflate it, you\u0027d then have to install all the structure inside, the racks to grow and water it, the lighting to feed it, and the growth medium, so it costs a fair bit -- in terms of the parts you\u0027d need to disassemble to get the Material Kits without having pre-existing manufacturing, about half again its cost, and four or five times its mass. Probably even more if you try to ship it up (once you account for the container and the extra engine mass and fuel mass you need to bring it with you).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... I\u0027d try to figure out the real cost of an equivalent amount of productivity in MKS parts, and base the cost and weight on that, rather than have a deploy cost, even a trivial one like 25 MK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 Ranger Agriculture Module (0.001006 output with Substrate) = 12,725 Roots \u002B 1.251 Tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B 1000 MK (in 1.25m Kontainer\u00A0= 2490 Roots \u002B 1.125 Ton\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= 15,215 Roots \u002B 2.376 Tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B Sufficient Fuel and Engine to lift Material Kits and Kontainer (because you don\u0027t -have- to lift those--the advantage of the inflatable is less up front cost and lifted mass, in exchange for more work setting up in situ resource generation to actually inflate the thing, so to offset that advantage, we should include the cost of lifting the Material Kits in the cost of the free-inflation part)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= (quick and dirty estimate in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, basically a Skipper and a Jumbo) = 11,050 Roots\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo total cost should be in the ballpark of 26,500 Roots, total mass around 2.376 tons, and maybe fudge it upward a bit to 30k\u00A0as a \u0022convenience charge\u0022 for the ease of deployment to the player, and 3 tons due to its rigid superstructur being heavier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the PBS Greenhouse does weigh 2.3 tons. The cost, however, is way, way lower... but this version of it is adding a lot more functionality and colonization oomph, so a 5x cost increase doesn\u0027t seem outlandish. Compared to that, 25 MK and some EC to deploy is just an annoyance anyway. What is that, a single disassembled landing leg or stabilizer wing, and a 400 root battery? XD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: if you want to keep a hoop for the player to jump through, maybe require EC to expand it, and a minimum quantity of Dirt, Substrate and/or Water, rather than Material Kits?

Still have no idea how much EC we should use. I suppose the big thing with EC is that whatever amount we decide on, you would need to have as much storage available, right? I don\u0027t think the DLL doesn\u0027t let you can\u0027t put 500 in now, and then recharge a bit and put in another 500 later. In that case, we have to decide how much EC storage we want to \u0027force\u0027 the player to have on the ground. Unless I\u0027m blind, the only K\u0026amp;K battery is the 3K one? I\u0027m almost thinking 1000 EC. That way, if you have a KPBS container rack with a 3K battery, the cost is trivial. If you\u0027re trying to do it with radial-attached z-100s, it isn\u0027t trivial. I think this rewards being somewhat prepared. You don\u0027t need any crazy resource chain, but you can\u0027t just use a pile of debris to set up your habitat and greenhouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, I always loved the huge batteries that NFE adds, but never liked the rest of NFE. I actually made a folder called NFEBatteries in my GameData folder and just put the batteries in there so I can add them to my stations. My habit of doing things like that makes me wish that there was a huge KPBS battery, but I also don\u0027t think there\u0027s actually any need for one, I just have a problem. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, several of the parts themselves have EC storage as well.\u00A0 You can get a couple of hundred just by putting in a science lab and a couple of probe cores.\u00A0 (And I\u0027m not sure I want to *force* people to have a rack-mounted battery.\u00A0 I like the idea of the racks, but I find them very limiting in terms of base design.)\u00A0 But yeah, the only dedicated battery is the container rack one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m for something reachable with normal storage and a few z-100s in general - but 1000 might be that.\u00A0 How much EC is 1 EC anyway?\u00A0 Is there any good baseline for realism here?\u00A0 I mean, it probably shouldn\u0027t take more power than a couple of removable batteries for your drill, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222993670\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490194274\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165068\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merkov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, Merkov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I just noticed that you renamed my silly refresher to scrubber.
