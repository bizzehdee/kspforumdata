I have yet to find a BDAC implementation guides, but I\u0027ve seen it done more than once, tho I am aware of MAS/RPM guide for moders and reading it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously im not going for 100% recreation , I\u0027d like to make a rather, simplistic, version of the cockpit but with enough detail to make it feel full and functional at the same time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S. If there are free to use texture/model resources for KSP mods (non commerical obviously) where could I find them?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you very much for your assistance!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
