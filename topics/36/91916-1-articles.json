I\u0027m simply not artistically talented, so in the time it takes me to produce a naff looking texture, I can probably write a little plugin for some odd job, create three new types of wheel and a set of tracks - which is why I\u0027m reaching out to see if anyone with a bit of texturing talent would like to joint the project? I know most people are busy with their own projects, but I figure there\u0027s no harm in asking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to do most of the unwrapping work during the modelling stage, so all that\u0027s left to do is arrange the components in the texture space and actually create the texture (the hard bit, I know). I\u0027ve got everything neatly organised in a GitHub repo, along with logs for all the parts in their various stages, and all the parts retain prefabs in Unity so updating is a doddle if UV placement is changed - it\u0027s quite a slick workflow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe good to hear from you if you\u0027re interested \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-05T18:34:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2014 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by lo-fi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T17:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might get more interest if you showed the models you want textured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it\u0027s a bit of a bother having to hunt down your threads.
