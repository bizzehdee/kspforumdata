I\u0027ve found that tinkering with the Scattering Exposure can help.

I dialed down the opacity at 250,000, but when I was flying at 80,000, it was still all white \u0026 pearly because I hadn\u0027t edited the 1000 config point.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I hope that helps. I also increased the Extinction tint a bit to breath a bit more colour back into the world. My next task is to figure out how to save the settings! The buttons don\u0027t seem to be doing the trick, so it might be a matter of editing the config files once one works out what looks nice.\n\u003E \n\nThank you.  Your advice help a lot.  Once I started at these levels it was a matter of tinkering with the numbers to get what I wanted.\n\nAll looks nice now."},{"CreatedByName":"SheldonTime","CreatedById":205300,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T17:19:48Z","Content":"I have scatterer version v0.0331b (KSP 1.4.2), and the oceans aren\u0027t appearing, and so does the sky!  \n\nIs it because of other mods or is it a problem with KSP?
