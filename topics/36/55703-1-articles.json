It was gobbled up in the great forum wipe of April.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, I\u0027ve been searching for something of value to contribute. I think I\u0027ve found something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Manifest is a blatant rip off of Crew Manifest. Given that vXSovereignXv has been too busy, and is looking for someone to support Crew Manifest, I started looking at the code. Just as I had updated it for .22, Sarbian released an updated version!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I thought oh well. I can use it to learn. Well I did. One of the biggest \u0022holes\u0022 in my flight experience was an easy way to manage resources within a given vessel. Oh there are tools out there to do it, as part of a larger toolset, or you can use Hyper edit and others to simply fill your tanks, so to speak. I didn\u0027t want to do that. I wanted to have a bit more realism and control over where resources are stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Ship Manifest was born. Ship Manifest takes Crew manifest to it\u0027s logical extention. If we can move kerbals around our ship, why not resources?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I\u0027ve incorporated Crew manifest into this Plugin. More correctly, I\u0027ve used Crew Manifest as a basis for this work. I would be happy to take over support for Crew Manifest as part of this plug in going forward. Ive been around for a couple of years and plan on being around for awhile longer. Sarbian indicated that while he brought it up to date, he was not going to entertain feature enhancements. (correct me if I\u0027m wrong). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve then added a Resource Manifest, a tool for moving resources between parts in your ship, using the same easy to navigate system that vXSovereignXv used for Crew Manifest. It is a second button, using Toolbar as Sarbian has incorporated. Toolbar will be included with the distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, I will plan on releasing Ship manifest when it is ready, (week or so...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screen shots.

If you add in power needed to move resources around have multiple speeds. A really slow speed would cost no power (or negligeable) but higher throughput would cost exponentially more. That way you get the best of both worlds. In an absolute emergency you can transfer fuel etc around without power, but normally you would use power just to get it done in a reasonable time. As a note, if this used power to transfer at the same rates as alt right click functionality in stock for transfer, it\u0027d be a bit silly.
