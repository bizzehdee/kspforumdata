However i did make him a slightly unstable (only breaks the Time/Space Continuum if you smash it into anything) Land Battleship platform somewhat inspired by the ratte. i will look around for alternatives. but for now he wont be doing any naval guns for a while. hes mostly working on Flans mod stuff, and his own custom part pack."},{"CreatedByName":"AwesomeCup","CreatedById":131709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T06:13:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E M113 chassis and M163 turret would be nice as well.\n\u003E Not intended to be a gimme pig.
