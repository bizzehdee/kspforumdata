Open Kopernicus.log (/KerbalSpaceProgram/logs/kopernicus.log) and scroll toward the end. Note the original planets, each of them having a new number (i\u0027ll call it Y)\n5. Using something like Notepad\u002B\u002B, open persistent.sfs.\n6. Find a craft at each planet (i.e. a Duna Probe, which may no longer be at Duna), and find its planet reference number at VESSEL { ORB { REF = X\n7.

Note that when traveling to a star, minimum delta V will simply take too long , instead you want to speed as much as possible so that the trip will not require ages. Try to speed up at least at 100 times the minimum DeltaV, then the trip should only take 3 years.

In carrer, you also have to collect enough Helium3 for the trip (as helium3 is simply too expansive to buy), which you fortunatly can do now as well from either from surface of the Mun / Moho or from the atmospheres of the Gas Giants. Just setting up the infrastructure should be quite a chalange. I wonder who will be the first one who can succesfully reach a neighbouring star in a carrer game"},{"CreatedByName":"JsJa","CreatedById":165136,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T16:59:01Z","Content":"Planets can be added to these systems , and travel to, enter into orbit and land on them.
