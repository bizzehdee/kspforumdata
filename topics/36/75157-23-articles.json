I\u0027m already a bit short on memory, and while I can (barely) run RVE, it\u0027s way too close to the limit for comfort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, just realised that texture alone is 50mb lol, the problem is, what looks great are large outstanding features (like the cyclone) but these are difficult to tile without obvious repetition. I guess I\u0027ll have to go back to a \u0027flatter\u0027 less varying and smaller texture again :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027ve tried all of them and saving as DDS looses all the transparency information, I\u0027ll try saving with transparency selected as alpha, as DXT5 ARGB, with generate mip maps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T14:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cyclone sure looks nice, but since the map is static, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s such a good idea at all.
