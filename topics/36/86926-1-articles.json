I know it compresses most textures to DXT on load anyway, but this takes a lot of time. A lot of games prefer DDS textures because they can go all the way from disk into VRAM without ever being decompressed. I haven\u0027t seen any references to KSP supporting them, but I just thought I\u0027d ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T15:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know the packaged assets are all in that format, or at least the asset browsers extract to that format by default. I\u0027m a little weirded out about the fact that all those textures seem to come out vertically flipped from what the normal texture orientation is. Still, I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be supported. Might be worth an investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
