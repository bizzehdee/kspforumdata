I am decided to join the modding community and have since produced two parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one I have finished and am not going to release, due to it being my first part. (Bad texturing and non-complex mesh)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second part I also do not plan on releasing, but I have not quite finished it. One of the main reasons for not\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehaving finished it yet being that I want to make the flame match up to the actual size of the exhaust valve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny clue on how to actually do this? I have posted this question in another part of the forums, but I received no answers as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures of my rocket are in the other forum post as well if you want to see the problem I have encountered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T03:37:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr.Desmond Tiny\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
