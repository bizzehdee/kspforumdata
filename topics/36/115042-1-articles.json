I would like to present you my idea for a new mod, which would fill in the gabs I am missing in both stock game and modding scene. However, I lack experience with coding (only basics like script editing or simple lua coding), and I have very few experience with 3D modeling and texturing. I am willing to learn as much as I can about these, but still I can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t do this by myself, so I am\n\n**looking for a help**\n\n. If someone would be interested in those ideas, please feel free to comment in this thread or PM me.\n\n**If you are already experienced KSP modder interested in those ideas, I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t have a problem to add those into your own mod, as long as you at least notify me.**\n\n**Design Goals:** \n\nThe iLumination mod should provide new ways how to enlighten KSP craft exactly to player\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s liking, with more functionalities to offer than just light. Those would be:\n\n- Self-illumination beacons visible from afar, for easier navigation and docking. Various models, like illuminated docking ports, or extendable omnidirectional beacons.\n- Smart Light sensors, configurable to activate lights under specific circumstances automatically (Landing, Night, In the shadow of celestial body etc.)\n- Real-Time corresponding light meters/gauges, providing visual readouts (Canister fill level, Electric Charge, Part temperature readout...)\n- Other Mods Synergy - TweakScale, RemoteTech2, Antenna Range, Distant Object Enhancement, LightsOut, KIS\u002BKAS...\n- RAM-Friendly. Keep memory requiements as low as possible: shared textures, usage of stock textures, simple models.\n- New types of lights: Headlights (long range, narrow cone), beacons, lightstruts.\n- More realism: lights consuming EC! (even stock, disableable feature)\n- Slider-controlled luminosity, and corresponding EC consmption, both in VAB/SPH and in flight.\n\n![Bez_n_zvu.jpg](http://s27.postimg.org/54mztbktf/Bez_n_zvu.jpg)\n\nI know there are mods that can provide similar functions (Aviation Lights, Surface Light), but those are tightly aimed toward specific light usages, while iLumination should provide wider palette of usability across many areas of KSP gameplay.\n\nMore details and concept art coming soon.\n\nAlso please excuse my bad english, it is not my native language, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m doing my best.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T05:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wolfox**"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T19:02:04Z","Content":"The \u0022Design Goals\u0022 section of the OP (**O**riginal **P**ost) is a little confusing.

Thus the same would apply to LDU. When thinking about it, that would be actually better than otherwise, lights wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t turn on/off spontaneously when your ship turn around and block LDU with, for example, solar panel, but only when ship goes over the horizon into darkness.\n\nActually, maybe (for the sake of functionality), optimal way might be making LDU omnidirectional, making even craft rotation irrelevant (for Persistent Rotation\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s users happiness) and removing the need of placing several LDU\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s to cover different sides of the craft, or bundling them together as a group to react on light conditions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T11:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 11:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wolfox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T15:14:07Z","Content":"Maybe Unity 5 will give us a better implementation.
