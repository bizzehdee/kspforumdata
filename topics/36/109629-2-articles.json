However my complaints about it still stand from that past. They are all nit picky and they are mostly aesthetic complaints. First of all the Orbiter itself is a wonderful model. No complaints there. However my issues are with the external tank and the SRBs. The external tank my only complaint is the red ring at the top. I just don\u0027t like that its a total nit pick! I am not trying to sound like some people on these forums who complain about paint shades and precise measurements of fairings and engine assemblies. Im just saying I don\u0027t really like the redish/pink ring around the top. Second I have never really liked any of the iterations of the SRBs in this pack they just seem wrong. They always separated wrong and they just never quite look right. You have to reach out to this mod maker. He has done some great work and has made the best looking SRBs in my opinion ever. Atleast they are the closest looking. They are very high detail so maybe he could make you new ones or maybe you can just scale down these. Idk but it seriously something to consider. [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112771-Spice-Launch-System-SLS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112771-Spice-Launch-System-SLS) Maybe I am the only one who doesn\u0027t like the current SRBs idk. Finally you have to get the skin switcher back. That was hands down one of the coolest parts of this pack. \n\nAll in all very well done. The ship flys well during takeoff is painful flying brick coming back but that pretty much like the real thing. Docking is tough but I imagine the can be worked out with practice."},{"CreatedByName":"Wuwuk","CreatedById":138928,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:18:28Z","Content":"\u0022CSS full update 4.zip\u0022, the same as \u0022CSS HOTFIX update 4\u0022, just CSS folder, craft file and txt files.\n\nFirespitter, ETC and Gimball folder not include."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:21:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022CSS full update 4.zip\u0022, the same as \u0022CSS HOTFIX update 4\u0022, just CSS folder, craft file and txt files.\n\u003E Firespitter, ETC and Gimball folder not include.\n\nYup those should be included or atleast download links should be on the front page.

Fist and foremost if the SRB sep wasn\u0027t a coin flip my opinion of them would be strictly aesthetic. So lets forgo decoupler issues seperatron issues. I don\u0027t think they are large enough, look at the side by side you posted. You can see how much taller they actually are. The nose coint are pointy but not pencil point. Still they come to a point not rounded as the current ones are. The nozzles are a bit wrong. Also I need to be clear, this doesn\u0027t dimmish my experience to much. I am very happy to have a STS in game and it is also pretty close to the real thing. However these are tweaks that I personally would like to see, and I think it would be good for everyone. Seriously look at the link that I posted for the Spice Launch System. Thats what the SRBs are supposed to look like. Warning once you see them you cant unsee and no other SRB will look right."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T20:28:17Z","Content":"Thank you all for your input.
