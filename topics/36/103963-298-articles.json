ALSO! The flooded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E bug still haunts so many people and constantly fills up the KSP sub-reddit.**\n\u003E \n\nThe main things I\u0027d like to see potentially resolved are:\n\n- Editing the Alpha values of the Scatterer atmo effects seems to not actually make the effect more transparent but actually just makes the body fade to a dark grey sphere. Is this intended? I\u0027ve always thought that this behaviour is super weird as it is hard to implement Scatterer on a body that has a very thin atmosphere as you lower the Alpha setting a lot to reduce the Scatterer effect but then have to massively over-expose the effect to stop the body from become a dark-grey/black sphere.\n\n- Occluding the Scatterer horizon effect that appears behind terrain. When there are hills and mountains in the foreground, the Scatterer effect is rendered in front of them on the horizon which has always been an immersion breaker.\n\n- The dreaded refactoring. Scatterer does have a fairly beefy impact of frame rate but I have no idea how performance could be improved. This is an ever-ongoing chase I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-08T23:18:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 minutes ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I checked it and it seemed to be mostly code readability improvements with no major features or major visual changes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What would you guys like to see from this version exactly?
