I\u0027d like to get back to what I posted a few pages back, just before the \u0022release\u0022 discussion started. We were discussing the problem of scaling things so they\u0027re both realistic and playing nice with KSP and PhysX. I think that\u0027s something we need to figure out, especially since I\u0027d like to run BobCat\u0027s Sovet pack with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a difficult problem. There\u0027s an obvious solution of scaling everything 1:1. That would require a bigger VAB, but it\u0027s been done. On the other hand, without some sort of \u0022batch rescale\u0022 plugin, it\u0027d be a pain to support.\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach would be to use 64% scale for planets, then re-scale the \u003Cem\u003Edisplays \u003C/em\u003Eto make it seem like it\u0027s bigger. Of course, that\u0027d take a lot of rescaling a lot of hardcoded things (including default timewarp scale), not to mention changes to plugins.

Pretty much the only \u0022unrealistic\u0022 things would be material density and surface area, and even then, it\u0027s just be a visual thing, with everything using RL values. Now, this would work fine as long as we could tell KSP what something\u0027s surface area is (or at least what to multiply the value by), as opposed to it being calculated directly from the model. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to reliably compare a rocket to a planet, so as long as models are completely separate from in-game calculations, it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum: PhysX might not like the largest superboosters.
