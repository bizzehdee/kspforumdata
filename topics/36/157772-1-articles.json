The issue I\u0027m running into is that it seems that the animation in question is forever locked within the parts .mu file, and importing it into Blender hasn\u0027t let me extract it. Is there any way for me to access\u00A0this animation in \u0022in post\u0022 so to speak, or am I going to need to essentially model/animate/texture my own engine from scratch in order to get the kinda thrust patterns I\u0027d like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-16T18:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight want to check out SmokeScreen, it will definitely allow you to do what you are trying to do, and for a bunch of pre-made engine effects pick up RealPlume Stock. Take some time studying the configs included in RealPlume and the documentation available in the SmokeScreen thread, it\u0027s a lot of stuff to figure out but once you get the hang of it you can do some pretty cool stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/64987-122-smokescreen-273-extended-fx-plugin-mar-11th/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130576-122-realplume-stock-configs-continued-v0114-1222017/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tompete Kerman","CreatedById":157671,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T07:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you. To let you in on what I\u0027m doing a bit, I\u0027m trying to make a semi-realistic recreation of the engine that Spike Spiegel\u0027s personal fighter craft, the Swordfish 2, uses. It\u0027s described as a \u0022Rolls-Royce Axial Fusion Aerospike Turbine\u0022 engine, so what I\u0027m basically designing it to be is a dual-mode engine with an air-breathing mode that functions similarly to an Indirect Air Cycle Thermonuclear Jet Engine (which will consume no fuel ala the Mk2 Rontgen), and a \u0022closed cycle\u0022 mode that engages a hypothetical Solid Core Nuclear Aerospike\u00A0Rocket that will only need to consume LiquidFuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warezcrawler","CreatedById":145377,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-18T20:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI order to get the animation right, you need to look into how it works through the effects nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while on the subject of multi mode engines, you could check out the GTIndustries mod....
