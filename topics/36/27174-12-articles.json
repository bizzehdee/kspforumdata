I\u0027m going to test it and I will edit this post as a feedback of how it was doing. The staging problem occurred both in 0.20 and in 0.21 as well. I haven\u0027t seen any references for this problem here but I\u0027ll try to sort it out. Also sometimes a white texture around the modules during flight can be seen. It\u0027s like a part of the ship but floating next to the modules. I\u0027ll take a screenshot of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So the implanted SAS works amazingly well with the CM/LM. The two together keeps the rocket more stable than the old one used to and of course with the new one I can turn the rocket with SAS on. As for the staging problem it seems that if my ascent trajectory is more shallow than steep the \u0027bug\u0027 I said appears. I tried gravity turns from 5km up to normal 10 km and 10km soft gravity turn was ok. Maybe it was my lateral speed that caused this at lower altitude grav. turn start but it was just some raw experiment to find the logic in this separation break. First I thought maybe too much Gs on the upper stages is the problem so I tried instead of instant sep. waiting 2-3 secs before decoupling as it recovers from wobbling after main engines stop but it didn\u0027t solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-25T21:44:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2013 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Reddragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T04:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to be doing a revamp of all the parts, now that I\u0027m satisfied with the filler parts that I\u0027ve given to aphazael.

Hey BobCat, if you read this, the actual LRV is 210kg. So Reddragon, if you want, you can edit the weight in the config. It should work a lot better at 210kg.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I rescaled the LRV to 0.1 which the LM SAS could handle quite well. Real life LM\u0027s mass was 14,700kg LRV\u0027s 210kg, so the rate is 1/70. AMP\u0027s LM is somewhat 5000kg so it\u0027s 1/3 of real life LM\u0027s mass if KSP\u0027s mass measurement unit is metric tonnes. In this case the Bobcat LRV needs to be 70kg (0.07. One Bobcat LRV wheel is 0.05) in game. I have to test how LRV will work if I rescale the mass due to real life rate but I guess Bobcat made it this heavy for a reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well, with this little mass it floats around just for simple WASD commands like a feather because of pod torque (I guess) so I\u0027ll stick to the 0.1 mass or 0.2 as Razorcane suggested for now.
