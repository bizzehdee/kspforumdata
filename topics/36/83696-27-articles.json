Actually, I noticed an issue with another part. Let me see if I can find it.\u003Cp\u003EHere, I found it. Look at the RCS build aid window. I am thrusting DOWN. Look at the Command Pod, only the RCS thrusters on the right side are firing, and two are firing totally horizontal (they shouldn\u0027t be firing at all) , the two that are firing are an angle would be fine and balanced IF the other two thrusters on the opposite side of the Command Pod were also thrusting down. But they don\u0027t, so they just end up imparting rotational torque to the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1nKkTj2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/1nKkTj2.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, Ven, did you see this photo I posted about the weird RCS thruster directions on the command pod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T00:55:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ziff\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ziff\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, Ven, did you see this photo I posted about the weird RCS thruster directions on the command pod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but I\u0027m not quite sure that RCS build aid is right, because when I was testing them they worked just fine.
