In fact, if you look in the comments section on the spaceport page for it, you can see my interaction with him, and see how much of a dick he was to me. Basically, he lifted the Saturn parts directly from a pack that I had released that was just an update of the original Saturn parts to work with 0.18. That was subsequently removed, and then he republished it using the original .dae models, but still trying to use the cfgs that I had written, which is why the textures didn\u0027t work and the engines didnt generate lift. The kid clearly doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but seems to have someone working with him now to convert stuff in Unity. Since all the parts in his pack are lifted from other mods, I\u0027m not too concerned about it.
