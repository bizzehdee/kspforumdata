This was ma possible because both the long saddle truss and the drop tank itself contain docking ports. They will only dock with each other, nothing else. It was fairly difficult because the tank itself is unpowered, uncontrolled and will spin if you smack it. The docking was performed by MechJeb2. So, Copernicus has gained some re-use capability now.
