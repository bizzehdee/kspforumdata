I think that may mean that the RCS features might not work if you don\u0027t install ModuleRCSFX (I gather there are slight differences in the naming), and other things might have problems if you do install it. Looks like this mod may therefore need an update to work properly with 1.0.5.\n\nEDIT: Looks like the K-21-RCS Jet Thruster (rcsJet) part is the only one affected by this, but I think the ModuleRCSFX reference is actually completely commented out, so maybe ModuleRCSFX should not be a dependency at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T03:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by politas**"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T01:37:56Z","Content":"Hey everyone!\n\nFinals will be over for me soon and that means development time...

Is there a way to do this without modelling an entire new part?\n\u003E \n\nYou can do this by setting the part scale in the Y-direction multiplied by 2 (or whatever you want really). If you want a separate part you can copy the part file, rename the file and the part in the cfg (making sure to set the correct file path in the MODEL{} node), and then set the scale. You will also have to multiply the node positions to the scale you want as well.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of a x2 scaled cfg change that I got to work:\n\n    node_stack_top2 = 0.0, 0.9374, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0\n    node_stack_bottom2 = 0.0, -0.9374, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0\t\n    node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.9374, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\n    node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.9374, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1\n    \n    MODEL\n    {\n      model = QuizTechAero/Parts/Utility/Mk2_Half_ServiceBay/Mk2_Half_ServiceBay\n      position = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n      scale = 1,2,1\n      rotation = 0, 0, 0\n      texture = blank, Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CargoBay/mk2CargoBay\n    }\n\nJust replace the corresponding lines and you should be good to go. \n\nNote that the texture may look funny with more than a x2 scale lol."},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T15:02:46Z","Content":"YAY ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\nyou are still alive xD"},{"CreatedByName":"dark jam","CreatedById":157907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T19:51:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On November 21, 2015 at 2:16 PM, DiamondBack973 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I get this glitch where the \u0022Phoenix\u0022 lifter wings don\u0027t register as parts, and fall off (with the rest of the wing) when I try to launch a craft that has them.
