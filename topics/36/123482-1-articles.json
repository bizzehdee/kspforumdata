Well fear no more, as I am starting an extremely ambitious first project to make a mod which will download the files needed for mods automatically before you enter the save so you can have modded saves and have the stock community use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning on having the mod check all save files upon hitting the load game option, while the list loads, this mod will also download all needed files. Note, this does NOT install entire mods, but rather single parts. So if someone uses a B9 wing, it will only download that single part file and any required plugins rather than the entire beefy mod. Now if the modded save is removed, or whatever mods required by that save is removed, so will the mod in the cashe. So it won\u0027t bulk down your computer with extra files you no longer use. Now I\u0027d like to see in the future per save options, such as only downloading mods for crafts in saves, or download only mods for planetary or structure (Such as OPM or KerbalKonstructs/KerbinSide). Maybe add a list of mods to allow automatic DLs, and what ones you do not want it to download. There will be a mod cashe made, like CKAN, Ofc I\u0027ll need mod permissions, but I\u0027ll get to that when the mod is working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent State:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just an idea right now, and I have a lot of learning to do to make it work but any help with this would be awesome since I am an ambitious mod making newb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-N/A-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast Updated 10/21/15 (BTTF Day)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T13:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nhawks17","CreatedById":32999,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T13:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be incredible if you can get it to work.
