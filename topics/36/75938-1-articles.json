Everything has changed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve completely ditched the stock wheel module in favour of my own home-grown alternative. Some might say this is a bold move, and rightly so. There will be bugs, there will be certain situations where the wheels behave a little differently to stock. If you don\u0027t want to deal with that and file sensible bug reports should you run into something strange, please don\u0027t update for the moment. The new plugin is mostly helpful because it greatly simplifies creating new parts, as the stock modules are rather fussy. However, subtle differences do exist and you should find that the dynamics are much better now. Parts have all received a CoG tweak which has also helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies for breaking saves, I found that the old and new versions are simply not compatible and weird, weird bugs occurred. Forcing fresh craft files is about the only way to deal with this, so that\u0027s what I\u0027ve done. If you want to re-use existing craft files, just remove KF parts and re-save \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebefore updating\u003C/span\u003E the mod, then add the new versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGroups:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice a UI slider called Group Number, along with an Apply Settings button. This does several things. For repulsors, it changes the hover height of all other repulsors on the vessel in the same group number as the selected part. For wheels, steering ration and direction calculation will happen for parts in the same group. Useful for multi vehicle vessels and those with docked rovers. Group 0 is special! A part set to group zero will only update its own setting, and will not receive settings from other parts (even in group 0). Sounds complicated, but it\u0027s easily udnerstood when you\u0027re in-game. Parts default to group 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERepulsor notes:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) They do levitation. Nothing more!!

Get inventive!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The height adjustment and retract/deploy function has now been rolling into one. Setting to 0 height turns the repulsors off. There are two action groups to change the height, as well as the UI slider to change individual units. The action groups change the height .5 for each activation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Surface mount repulsors are now smaller and uni-directional. The have no stability of their own, so you\u0027ll want to use at least three if you want a self stable craft. I\u0027ve added TweakScale support to facilitate easy placement. It makes them a little trickier to use, but much more flexible when using lots of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Effects are on the way.

This means the editor icon is _tiny_.

Pressing D, for example, tells the vehicle to rotate clockwise (looking down), rather than steer right. This might sound like the same thing, but you\u0027ll find the controls are reversed compared to driving with wheels. This is by design. Otherwise there is a nasty crossover region between forward and backward motion when rotating on the spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3)There is a UI slider and action groups to change the torque, along with an action group and button to disable steering.
