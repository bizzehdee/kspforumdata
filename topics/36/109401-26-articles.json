to which .cfg file do I add it and in place of what?~~\n\n~~Also. I have noticed that the Seivert Nuclear jet engine has the same problem with the NFE control panel and in addition, it doesn\u0027t appear to produce any actual thrust. When you turn it on it sounds like it\u0027s running hard. If you cut off the IntakeAtm from the intake it flames out, but it produces 0 thrust at all times and any emissives that show up due to heating also don\u0027t take place.~~\n\nEdit: I figured it out. You just have to replace the contents of the M3X\\_NFE\\_Functionality.cfg file in GAMEDATA/MK3Expansion/Patches (remember to keep a backup copy of the old file just in case).\n\nI did notice that the reactors don\u0027t warm up evenly. They seem to sit and do nothing for what seems like a long time and then shoot up to operating temperature in a second or two. Also I finally realized that the Sievert won\u0027t produce thrust until the reactor reaches operating temperature. Since before your patch it never did, it never produced thrust.\n\nExcellent work so far on the mod.
