Only limitation I can imagine is that it might be tricky to make them visible from the inside, like is currently the case with terrain godrays. I was watching this [https://youtu.be/mXTxQko-JH0?t=1496](https://youtu.be/mXTxQko-JH0?t=1496) and it seems the method they\u0027re using is a lot more complicated with a fur-like shader. They also tried a godrays method but they don\u0027t get in detail on why they dropped it, they only mention it drawing on top of the UI but they probably ran into the same limitation or something else."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T10:19:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, V8jester said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E also [@daniel l.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57763-daniel-l/) the lens flare is fairly easy to modify.

Also whatever was blue would change color as I zoomed in / out from it. And lastly planets would be covered by huge square Shadows that would render like something more inline with Minecraft. (Squares would move based on where you where looking. Really strange stuff, It honestly seems to have cropped up out of no where.\n\nAnd before you waste too much time. DX11 wont corrupt anything if you are trying DX9, DX11 OpenGL right? I recall seeing someone mention that the -nosinglethread command would corrupt saves. But I have never seen anyone have issues switching between DX11 or DX9. This was also something I was playing with the last couple of days.

I had been aware of this issue in EVE for a while, I guess if there\u0027s no fix, then covering it up with beautiful atmo shading works just as well X) Are the cloud shadows being made non-visble however? The issue I found with eve is that it simulated the darkening cloud terminator effect too soon on the terminator. Ideally we could get some way to manually position the terminator on the planet (EVE). Also does your atmo shader still work on a multiply effect?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-08T10:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2016 10:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pingopete**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T10:44:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, pingopete said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Very nice!
