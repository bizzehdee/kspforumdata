Will require some adjustments to the textures, and there is simply no way for me to get the exact same visuals as the legacy shaders (black panels w/ colored reflections), but the new setup should likely be even more authentic looking.\n\nOther plans for this week are to finish up the new stand-alone ModularHeatShield geometry (and textures), and finish up the implementation of the reworked model-switch (for LC-POD optional fuel tanks, upcoming docking-port backplates).  Eventually this stand-alone heat shield model will be used in place of the meshes on the SC pods -- recolorable and/or high-res heat shields all around (eventually).  If I run into extra time this week I\u0027m going to start laying out the geometry for the static-modeled decouplers and probe cores (non-procedural models, but with model/texture switching, and basic scaling support). \n\nIn the slightly more long-term plans, [@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) posted up some documents on an aero-shell-based Mars descent vehicle that I think would be quite adaptable to being turned into a part-series (the Horizontal Lander series).  Solves the \u0027aeroshell problem\u0027 because the parts -are- the aeroshell (rather it is not discarded).  This means that I can make an engine section with proper openings for the nozzles, and not have to worry about procedural meshes or stock aero weirdness.  (this might be one of two horizontal lander part series designs; the other would be more intended for vacuum use).  From my \u0027official\u0027 plans, the Horizontal Landers are up next, so probably about time to start laying out the concept work on them.  Alternatively, depending on feedback/desires, I might be willing to place the LC-POD and LC-LEG reworks ahead of the horizontal lander parts -- as these are already (mostly) planned out stuff, it would be far less concept work, and more just modeling/texturing work (and depending on how they are done, might tie in very well with the horizontal landers).\n\nOver the last few days I learned some tricks in Substance Painter that let me use it to author the recoloring masks and noise textures.  Good stuff, as it means an even more unified workflow, and faster texture creation (put together the recoloring textures for the MFT-LV tanks in mere minutes; as opposed to an hour or two when using GIMP and manually making the masks from the UV maps).  Less time spent on the basic recoloring versions, and more time to spend on making better models and on the high-res PBR textures.\n\nThe upcoming ModularHeatShield part will be my first attempt at using the SP workflow from start to finish, including lots of use of baking from a high-poly model.  So far it has all gone fairly well; some oddities with NRM baking, but I understand the technical \u0027why\u0027 of it, and height-map/displacement baking still works well.  Between the two, I\u0027m sure I can find a working setup to bake out the details form a high-poly model.  Even just being able to bake positional data for detailing work can make the job so much easier (e.g. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports on the SC-B-CM were baked from proxy meshes placed over the existing model; gave very precise results).\n\nWhat this all means is that the modeling and texturing process has become quite a bit easier and smoother (and continuing to become moreso as I learn and adapt).  Which means more models, more detailed models, and certainly more detailed textures (esp. the high-res PBR ones).\n\nI\u0027ve also pretty much settled on a \u0027low-res recolorable \u002B high-res PBR\u0027 setup for future parts.  What will likely happen is the parts are modeled and given the low-res recolorable setup initially, with the high-res PBR textures coming a few days/weeks later (good textures still take a lot of time).  This should likely result in a decrease in the base distribution size (as most of the recoloring diff/spec textures can be reduced in resolution; 1/2 the size = 1/4 the memory) with minimal loss in visual quality (the recoloring textures only add the noise/gradients that can be seen, and most would not notice being reduced to half resolution).  NRM maps might be the exception, and some of those might actually see an increase in resolution, even for the base recoloring texture sets.\n\nMany parts will -only- have the recoloring textures.  Compare, for example, on the new MFT-LV tanks -- the PBR-recoloring \u0027gold\u0027 foil texture is for most purposes, just as good looking as the high-res PBR gold foil texture (the notable differences are on the painted areas where there is edge wear on the high-res version).  So for most basic parts they will have re-colorable texture sets only.  The regular-res (and high-res-PBR) textures will be saved for more detailed parts -- crewed parts, engines mostly."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T20:57:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Should I also convert the DOS panels to have a back-lit function on them as well?\n\u003E \n\nDo you even need to ask? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T21:00:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Conclusion: What looks awesome in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E will look bad in space as there is nothing to reflect like in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, plus the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E has omni directional lighting while space has a point source.

While this can give quite stunning visuals under certain uses (e.g. the Apollo CM in orbit of the Moon), they will be far less stunning in other situations (the same CM will appear very dark/black when on the dark-side of an orbit).\n\nPlanet-shine -- not sure how it would be able to improve things -- the parts are already picking up colored lighting/reflections from the environment (even light-sources).  Does it increase the light from the sun and/or add light-emitters to the actual planets?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Chrome airplanes are pretty viable now\n\u003E \n\nHmm... with my new SP workflow... I wonder how long it would take to rip all of the stock spaceplane related models and create recolorable texture sets for them?  (probably longer than I want to spend given the plain-ness of most of the stock models)  The stock spaceplane parts might actually be good candidates for the \u0027stock-conversion\u0027 shader given their better-than-normal-stock texturing.  Add in a proper MET / GLOSS map, and they could probably look very nice.\n\nBut recolorable Mk2 fuselages?  Could be yummy...

Could represent that some parts of the HS get hotter (edges in paneling, some \u0027cells\u0027 get hotter, etc).  Could possibly even tie this in with some sort of orientation/geometry inputs so that the more forward facing side appears to heat up more than the leeward side.\n- Secondary material / wear effect as ablator is depleted (or heat-absorbed for heat-soak thermal tiles, e.g. shuttle).  A HS that has gone through the entry will look vastly different than a brand-new one.  This could be done by texture blending and/or material layering.\n\nNone of this needs to be done immediately as it wouldn\u0027t really influence how the base textures or model are setup, but is certainly something that I\u0027m going to consider for long-term heat-shield related plans.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe the PBR version will offer improvements when recoloring becomes available?\n\u003E \n\nYou **are** using the PBR recoloring setup already.  That is what makes the metallic stuff available and allows for the reflections to work at all.  It is not really going to improve beyond what is already there.\n\nMostly I think its just going to take some adjustment for our eyes (and brains) to get used to the more realistic lighting, and the fact that not everything is fully lit when in the blackness of space.

What is not present in the reflections is the sun-flare / corona.
