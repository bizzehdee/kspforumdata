The flatbed part carries the rover batteries and solar array and a little crane arm. It was towing a smaller six-wheeled trailer, which has much smaller wheels with a different suspension system. You are still right though - the main rover flatbed is cut in half and on a hinge, so the cabin and batteries are on the part with four of the wheels and the smaller section in the back with the two wheels is what carries the crane arm. I don\u0027t think they separate though, I think it\u0027s just a hinged body - which is a design they used IRL for the proposed robotic Moon rover and at first for brainstorming for Sojourner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T01:42:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 01:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T01:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwww yis please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sgt.Shutesie","CreatedById":141397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T02:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought that the rovers looked similar to that of the LEV/SEV rovers that NASA has but was longer and had more wheels.
