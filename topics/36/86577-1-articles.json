Strategies aren\u0027t really needed on those levels (unless you\u0027re really bad). The game (and thus this mod) is geared more towards Moderate and above. The ideas of Reliable Technology and Cutting-Edge Research (and to an extent neither is stock Aggressive Negotiations ) are simply not compatible with finishing the tech tree.
