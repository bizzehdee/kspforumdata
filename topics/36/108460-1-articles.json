A small quantity is used to lubricate and control the gimballing pistons and dumped as needed\n\nTalking about pistons, the gimballing is animated correctly with flexible inlets as well:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hHcBt.png](http://puu.sh/hHcBt.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hHczL.png](http://puu.sh/hHczL.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThe emissives are modelled somewhat accurately, by superimposing a map of the internal heat to a map of the cooling of a determinate part:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hHcCZ.png](http://puu.sh/hHcCZ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E eyecandy render in blender\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hHcwz.png](http://puu.sh/hHcwz.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E in game. the emissive are on the gas generator as well ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nLicense since I need one is CC-BY 4.0 International"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:34:14Z","Content":"Man that looks pretty sharp ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T22:00:53Z","Content":"Wow I love it!

Anyway the next one should be an expander cycle engine for vacuum use with extensible shroud.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No sound but look great.\n\nStrange, it should be referencing stock sounds, and it works on my machine.
