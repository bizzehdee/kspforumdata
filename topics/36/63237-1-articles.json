Right now it only works on ground vehicles but it demonstrates that terrain avoidance for craft landing on the Mun or other body can exercise a level of ground avoidance reasonably reliably. This script demonstrates that a ground vehicle can be automatically controlled, without any intervention, to seek flat terrain and to stay on and within the vicinity of flat terrain - a crucial ability for any landing vessel that does not want to tip over!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1210-The-Fox-Terrain-Avoidance-System-%28FTAS%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is where I talk about the theory of the FTAS system.\u003C/a\u003E In brief, the game engine does not allow any craft to evaluate the terrain in front of it, but the script constantly monitors the height of the terrain directly below it and the height of the terrain a few meters behind it. By doing this, the vessel constantly evaluates the changing nature of the terrain. If the terrain immediately below it is the same height as the terrain a few metres behind it, then there is a good chance the vessel is over flat terrain and a landing is acceptable. If the terrain varies by a large degree, the vessel is probably positioned over a steep slope and a change direction is required. If the vessel continues changing direction and continues scanning for flat terrain, it will eventually find an acceptably flat plateau to land on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this demonstration, I have a rover running the FTAS on board with mechjeb keeping the rover at a constant 9 m/s. The rover has found a flat depression and no matter how many times it approaches the lip of the depression, it decides it should not leave the grasslands it is on, turns around, and returns to the centre of the depression. Youtube of my development version with random debug information on the screen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3qiBv-KxsM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe green line shows the path the rover has taken. I had the screen capture running for a long time and there are a lot of green lines and the rover stays contained within the depression. If this were a lander looking for a landing spot, I\u0027m very confident it would have stayed within the boundary of the depression during the descent and would have landed safely on the grasslands and not on the hills beside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe algorithm is not perfect and not 100% efficient. Because it can\u0027t see in front or to the sides, it only knows the level of the terrain behind it. There is an assumption that the terrain in front of the craft is more or less the same as the terrain behind the craft. In most cases, this is true, but very irregular and sharp slope changes can confuse the script. Also, when a terrain change is needed, it doesn\u0027t know if it should turn left or right. It needs to guess and then take another terrain \u0022probe\u0022. If the terrain is going up and not down, then its guessed wrong and turns around 180 degrees. For this reason, the script will always seek the lowest possible flat terrain. If there is a flat ledge halfway up a slope, the script will likely skip over that and continue to seek flat terrain at the foot of the mountain, sometimes right next to the mountain. The \u0027probe\u0027 only works in 2 dimensions - that is, one axis of travel. The craft can travel perfectly parallel along a very steep slope and it will think its on flat land. The reason why this doesn\u0027t matter much is for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) it is very difficult and very unlikely for a craft to travel perfectly parallel for any amount of time. Thrust variance and natural ship wobble, drift means the direction of travel is constantly changing - even if by a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E in most cases, a change in gradient in one direction also means a change in gradient in all other directions, meaning, a lot can be concluded by measuring terrain in only one axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI invite ideas, discussion, proposals and test scripts that can help address some of these deficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some (dark) screenshots showing the path the rover has taken:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80858415/hosted2/screenshot31.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScreenshot #1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80858415/hosted2/screenshot26.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot #2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the scripts you can try out.

It can only measure one axis at a time. A craft travelling left to right may detect no slope, or a zero gradient and land, not knowing that it\u0027s on the side of an enormous mountain but because it was travelling perpendicular to the direction of the side slope the gradient appeared to be minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the answer is in a more sophisticated database where multiple points form a network of gradiants and the whole network together provides a clearer picture of the terrain around it. For example, measuring the altitude at point A and then point B gives the slope between A and B (obviously). Another measure at Point C can not only be compared with the previous point B, but alos the first point A. Greater degrees of movement across the z and x axis (left/right, forward/back) between measurements will provide a view of a wider space, but with less granularity. For this reason, a craft on descent should maximise movement across the z and x whilst at a high altitude to assist with pinpointing the general location of a suitable plateau. As the craft decends towards a general flat, movements should be smaller and more refined. Movements should be smaller and deliberate and closer together as the craft approaches a radar altitude of 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how sophisticated kOS can be with storing a lot of data points.
