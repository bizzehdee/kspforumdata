The code is in place to detect wheel pairs, that pretty solid. The catch is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnti-roll bars on vehicles connect the hubs each side via a sprung rod, suitably set up so it lets the wheels move up and down collectively but resists differential movement. Effectively it transfers some of the load from the loaded spring to the unloaded spring, so they behave as though the are weaker and stronger respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can be modeled by calculating differential movement of the suspension either side and scaling the .spring parameter of the wheelcollider accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat! However... Updating an enabled collider does not result in the spring parameter being modified - it tends to sit there and ignore it, then it may or may not update 30 seconds later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen it modeled (incorrectly) by simply adding forces to either side of the vehicle, but this gives some seriously weird dynamics because it unloads the wheel that should be doing the most work. Needless to say, I was not happy with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can hack a way to update the spring by disabling and enabling the collider, but this cannot be run in the update routine as it wrecks the rest of the simulation.
