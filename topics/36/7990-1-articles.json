In real life, you cannot do that. Sure, the sky is a little darker, but for the most part, it\\\u0027s still light blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyway that you guys could make it so that the atmosphere is a little more realistic to what we see here on Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-11T20:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind Kerbin is smaller than Earth, so the atmosphere is in turn smaller as well. Also, how is this blackness?
