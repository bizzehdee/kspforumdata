Pluron-Khato are intended as an alternative to the current Plock which is just a resized version of Vall.\n\nIf you install Pluron-Khato you will notice that Plock is no longer there.\n\nThis is just a temporary feature, when OPM will release an upgraded version of plock I will move Pluron-Khato into a different orbit in order to make it an addition to OPM rather than an alternative to Plock.\n\nAlso, from the next release it will support my new mod ([**SigmaBinary**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127820)) allowing users to choose between **barycenter** and **no-barycenter** for Pluron-Khato."},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T17:59:09Z","Content":"OK, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T07:28:12Z","Content":"Another question, why are some biomes of Urlum\u0027s moons in the Tilt pack deleted?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T07:54:31Z","Content":"There\u0027s a limitation in how ksp handles axial tilt (it doesn\u0027t) and orbital inclination (poorly)\n\nUrlum moons rotate around the planet in an orbit inclined 90 degrees compared to the ecliptic\n\nBut the moons\u0027 equators are sill aligned with the ecliptic. This is why I had to make a new version of wal with the ridge in another position and why I had to rename priax\u0027s biomes.\n\nAll the biomes are there, just the names are changed to make them more consistent with priax\u0027s orientation.\n\nUnless there\u0027s some kind of bug in my cfgs and the biomes are actually messed up, in that case let me know so I can fix them! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T08:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T13:30:14Z","Content":"how do you tilt urlum?
