In the personnel file we can manage:\n\n o Salaries - Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work for free, so some cost for each kerbal should exist. We will pay a salary to each kerbal on the roster, on a Biweekly/ Monthly/ yearly basis, (configurable). Salaries can be adjusted for realism and playablility.\n\n o Stats Editing - Editing stats. You can change the Primary profession, name, and other properties of your kerbal. \n\n o Notes - A simple editor that allows you to add notes to your kerbal\n\n o Training - Training is a means to increase your kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s experience through training. Training can consist of time spent away from flight learning specific tasks, or via Simulations such as in HoloDeck mod.\n\n - *Cross Training* (multi Profession) It will be possible to maintain multiple professions. Through training and flights, you can increase a specific profession by selecting that profession for a given flight.\n\n o Experience - Experience is gained thru flights. With RM, experience can also be gained thru training on specific tasks and thru Simulator training using HoloDeck. Training will increase the experience level of your Kerbals in the profession for which the training occurs.\n\n o Flight / Simulation Log - Flight history and Simulation history will be stored in your Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s personnel file\n\n -Vessel flown\n\n -Dates of filght\n\n -Results\n\n -Accomplishments\n\n o Crew Performance - Crews that stay together fly better together. It will be possible to improve the performance of a given crew through training and Simulations performed together. Kerbals with more time together will perform better on a given flight.\n\n o Accomplishments/Achievements - using Other addons, accomplishments can be gathered and added to your Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s personnel file.\n\n o Medals - Medals for significant achievements can be earned.\n\n o Medical / Psych - Your Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s abilities can be impacted by their medical condition and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csanity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.

Not everyone will want all features, and some features may well be better served thru another mod. I\u0027ve no wish to replace other mods, rather I wish to be compatible with and leverage them.\n\nThere is a ways to go, as I\u0027m just getting the idea fleshed out now.

That way reverting flights, recovering from backups, and interaction with other mods is guaranteed.\n\u003E Other than that, sounds really ambitious - and not in a bad way.\n\nOne of the issues with altering the game save involves name changes, and profession management. Since the name is hard-coded to the profession, I have to manage this separately of the game save. Additionally, what if someone wishes to remove my mod from their game. If they do that, it effectively \u0022breaks\u0022 their game save and they must start over.\n\nNow, it may be that I can \u0022add\u0022 to the game save (like MM configs do). I\u0027m going to be exploring that as well, but my main thought with all this is choice. I do not want a player \u0022locked\u0022 into my mod.\n\nFor some, that may not be an issue, for others it may be a \u0022deal breaker\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T14:49:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:38:07Z","Content":"As a fan of Kerbal Construction Time, I\u0027d love it if your simulation experience could tie in with KCT\u0027s built-in simulations in some way.
