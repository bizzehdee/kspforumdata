In the late 60s early 70s it has been launched several times by rocket SOUYZ for orbital tests. He also participated as payload in 2 of 4 emergency launches of N-1 heavy booster, but never left Earth orbit and flew to the Moon. Has been designed just for one person, and have an independent resource only for 12 hours of which 4 on the moon, and was not equipped with a gateway. At overall it was a very odd looking device. But I want to try it in game with the highest possible realism. Therefore, the model seems to be not very light, but in terms of the development of modern computers - playable.
