The ocean should also no longer disappear in supersampled screenshots and the issue with the ocean kind of flickering/bobbing when you move the camera appears to be gone or lessened, though I\u0027m not sure so i\u0027ll wait for your feedback. \n\nThe sky reflections might look a bit grainy, as if they had a noise effect overlayed on, this isn\u0027t an intentional effect and appears to be some kind of sampling artifact.\n\nThe lights compatibility has a big performance hit when you turn the lights on, even when they\u0027re not directly lighting the ocean but in proximity to it, this performance hit might be fixed in the future, in the meantime if you can\u0027t stand it you can disable it from the main menu.\n\nI\u0027ve also moved the fourierGridSize option to the main menu as lots of people don\u0027t realize turning it down can improve the ocean performance a lot on low-end machines.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Gaiiden said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E anyways, just to be clear I don\u0027t consider my idea a critical feature but if it\u0027s possible to do and something that could be added to the \u0022cool features\u0022 list to be implemented at some point down the road, awesome.
