My few short tests have shown that orbital mechanics works just fine with whatever parameters we set in CelestialBody. It\u0027s graphics which could prove to be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we\u0027ll succeed in rescaling terrain (and something tells me that we will \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ), it will look rather blurry and coarse as textures are covering specific spherical patches which are defined using lat/lng angular coordinates, and so their physical size is defined by the radius of the body. Theoretically quadtree could be extended beyond current max subdivision level of 10 (BTW Orbiter uses the same approach, and it uses levels up to 14, while my D3D11Client engine for Orbiter allowed for up to lvl 18, which gives \u0026lt;10meters precision for the bodies of Earth-like size - although there were FP precision issues to be solved to achieve that), but that would possibly require generating additional higher-res textures if we want it to look nice, AND implementing rather aggressive paging mechanism for textures as they simply would not fit within the confines of 32bit process address space. Well - I\u0027ve solved this problem once already (for D3D11Client graphics engine for Orbiter), so I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll find a way to solve it within Unity \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s not get ahead of ourselves.
