Depending on how I define things, an B pad might have a turn-over time of a week and a half (10 days). Uoruok could therefore launch a 775 ton rocket every ten days. During the turn-over time I might have to use a lesser launch site at a totally different latitude. Planning thus hinges not only on time but also on the launch delta-V budget and proper launch technique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this campaign system will be included with RSS because all the code I wrote for the KSC Switcher feature is required for the system, it will also be disabled by default in an RSS install because it might not be for everyone.

For instance, KSC might start out with a small class C pad capable of 125,000kg launches, but after a year that pad would shut down for a few months and be upgraded to a class B pad with a 750,000 kg maximum launch weight. Then, a few more years down the road, it could upgrade again to a class A with an unlimited launch weight. During that time an additional, smaller class B pad could be built with a 500,000kg max weight limit. And so on. The neat thing about using the \u0022pads\u0022 paradigm is that we can have a site show up on the map but not be operational for some time (while it\u0027s being constructed) or only be used as an airfield or small pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think it would be better to have the site itself handle the quality or the pads? Obviously the pads would define the maximum weight allowed. Maybe it would be better for the pads to have quality rather than the facility and just have an unspoken rule that qualities amongst the site never really stray beyond one step from the others. Or maybe give the facility an overall quality that no pad can exceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo airfields have maximum take-off weights?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also given thought to pad turn-over being influenced by launched weight. I think this might end up being something like using the maximum launch weight ?tripling? the turn-over, with anything under being a percentage. Not entirely accurate, I\u0027m sure, but it\u0027s easy to code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6.4:1 Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be adding several launch sites to the config file along with descriptions and \u0022upgrade paths\u0022, multiple pads and fields, etc... This entails writing some background fluff. Following the current \u0022Kerbaleze\u0022 all of the launch sites will probably just be reversed names of real world sites but that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027ll show up in the same sorts of places. For instance, Uoruok (Kourou), isn\u0027t on a coast, it\u0027s smack-dab inland, while Runokiab (Baikonur) is on a northern-eastern coast. Anyway, this brings me to the subject of Kerbal politics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals seem to be excitable, naive, a bit rough with each other, resourceful, mostly intelligent, and not at all safety-concious. Interestingly, despite some of their characteristics (and perhaps because of some), Kerbals don\u0027t strike me as particularly violent towards each other, aside from the ocassional rough-housing, which greatly simplifies the world. I imagine they probably settle disputes through simple contests of whatever type, not necessarily physical. Looking at a map of Kerbin, I figure there are maybe seven different \u0022countries\u0022 or \u0022counties\u0022, or whatever, that Kerbals could organize under. I don\u0027t, however, think they have a central world government because they seem quite competitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, I envision the \u0022campaign\u0022 to be a space race of sorts. After the first launch of a Kerbal into space, Kerbalkind gets quite excited and competitive, and we see spaceports popping up all over the place. Some countries will probably focus more on advanced airfields that will show up later in time while others will focus primarily on launching rockets. Of course, we\u0027ll always have the \u0022balanced\u0022 original country that hosts Kerbal Space Center itself, which will host the first year of actual spaceflight. All countries will have the capacity to launch sounding rockets and basic aircraft from early on, so you can pick a \u0022side\u0022 and have fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to stress, this will only really be \u0022fluff\u0022 text, I won\u0027t be having the game launch phantom ships and stuff. Maybe once an economy is implemented we can have different sites have different launch costs, maybe based on what \u0022country\u0022 your program is based in, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T23:06:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T23:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the Real Kerbin/KSCswitcher mod could you use this map for the planning of launch sites?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MjWmrtN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MjWmrtN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, can some launch sites not be available unless they are in similar countries\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T23:53:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T23:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the Real Kerbin/KSCswitcher mod could you use this map for the planning of launch sites?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MjWmrtN.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/MjWmrtN.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere\u0027s that from, the KSP roleplaying forum or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. It\u0027s \u0022too much\u0022, quite literally.
