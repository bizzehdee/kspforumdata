You\u0027ll have a way to opt into Dangit support- or not as you see fit. \n\nColor coding is definitely doable, and lit color coded panels in the dark would be even more helpful. Definitely will add that to the list. \n\nAs for labeling, the Ponderosa name is part of the branding, but the model has decal panels already built in. Templates change the panel decals in flight/VAB/SPH as well as add/remove functionality. By creating custom templates you could easily change those decals to your liking. To give you an idea of how this works, download the latest DSEV and play with the FLM series of tanks. the only difference between the tanks and the Ponderosa is that the Ponderosa decals must be square, but they can glow in the dark. Sadly I cannot make non-square decals that also glow in the dark due to a KSP limitation. At least as far as I know...\n\nThank you for your suggestions. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can\u0027t wait to test this out. Would any of these structures have mining capabilities for Ore/Karbonite and such?\n\nThe Chuckwagon and Conestoga can be configured to hold a variety of different resources including Ore, and a skilled Engineer will be able to reconfigure the Gold Digger to drill for any resource in the biome/asteroid. I might retrofit the Drill-O-Matic with the same ability. In Career mode you will need to unlock the proper tech node first to use the Gold Digger for resource extraction. Please keep in mind that the portable drill pales in comparison to the much larger Drill-O-Matic. Similarly I could see a mini ISRU that you could use. I could also see them turning themselves off at high timewarps to help play balance them. Conceptually they\u0027d be used in a pinch to slowly refuel your craft before moving on...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T23:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T15:38:33Z","Content":"*chiming in to keep track o\u0027 this*"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhedd","CreatedById":112088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T09:17:57Z","Content":"I sincerely wish this were MUCH higher on your list of priorities. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\ni already have the best Gemini MOL lab I could wish for, but this...
