For occlusion essentially the 1st part in a stack takes full drag, the middle pats take occluded drag (its actually near 0 if you arent flying at an angle), and the rear part has like 50% drag or something like that. This means occlusion doesnt do much if anything when you have just 2 parts, it lowers drag on the rear part by some, but not by much. Occlusion ONLY kicks in when you have 3 or more items stacked. One way to exploit this is to make a stack of stuff, and place a cubic strut on the front and back. this gives the entire middle FULL occlusion, AND cubic struts have basically 0 drag anyways, so im pretty sure you can guess what that means when it comes to drag for the whole stack. \n\nBtw, if you havent already figured it out, occlusion DOES NOT CARE about relative size of parts that are behind/in front. This means that a cubic strut will occlude anything including a 3.5m tank FULLY!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

One tip that i have though (if u want to cut down drag) is to place a cubic strut behind a rapier, itll take the rear drag and rapier gets full occlusion from it."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:24:24Z","Content":"Nope, it\u0027s by entirely by mesh, does nothing with bounding box or colliders.

Like, um, wow. Four years of development on an aerospace-related game and that\u0027s the best they could come up with? Checking for disparities in size between stacked parts and then adjusting a drag variable accordingly is not a major coding issue.\n\n[![SXmsXEpl.png](http://i.imgur.com/SXmsXEpl.png)](http://imgur.com/SXmsXEp)\n\nAnd people were worried that the days of aero exploits were over!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm**"}]}
