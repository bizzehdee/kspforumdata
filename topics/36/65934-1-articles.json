I recently started out pretty much from scratch with the intention of actually learning how to model and i chose blender as my platform. I currently use blender for all my noob modelling needs. Ill say that blender was a bit tricky to start with. But as im finding out it is a really powerful modelling and especcially animation tool(hint, some tools are hard to find. I usually never need to read tutorials on how to find features and use the gui for applications but with blender there is no way around it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolidworks is excellent and probably much more well suited for what its intended use is (industrial models for real use, 3d prints etc.) But for games and general renderings i must say blender is very good. Iwe used 3dsmax too and it is perhaps a bit easier to learn and do the actual modelling in but afaiks not as powerful for rigging and animations. Just my thoughts.

It tries to not even bother with vertices, normals and all that jazz, as the intention is to work with volumes (solids, hence the name). You can sketch freely, but it is just as easy to add dimensions and, more importantly, relations to everything. It is a bit too much to explain here in detail, but the program makes it really easy to work with mathmatical precision if you feel the need. When I compare that with the freeform modelling tools I know (some propietary programs and a little bit of Blender) which are designed for freeforming shapes, those feel relatively sloppy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is not relevant when working on game assets as dimensions are less critical, but I can imagine the feeling something is missing when coming from a CAD-oriented program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Skull","CreatedById":103510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T02:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAutocad is made by the same people who make 3ds Max.

I see a severe over use of subsurface in most of these tutorial videos. Subsurface is great for full render CG work. You never actually have to apply the modifier when your project never leaves Blender. There are tons of these videos out there. They are likely to not contain subject matter that is of much use to you as a game asset maker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I would ever use Subsurface in a game asset would be when I am setting up Objects that will be used for a texture normal. They will not be in the final model. So again, it doesn\u0027t matter. I also see people in these tutorials use 4k\u002B textures and generally fail at Correct UV mapping and get away with it because of that 4k texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the fact that the needs of the two mediums are different. If I am making a CG movie, I need enormous UV maps and all unique texture coordinates. A video game asset is pretty much just the opposite. Your islands needs to be large and efficient. So lots of UV mirroring tends to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to focus on the videos that are about making video game assets in Blender. You might also want to try searching several different strings like \u003Cem\u003EUV mapping in Blender\u003C/em\u003E or even \u003Cem\u003EKSP and Blender\u003C/em\u003E. Eventually you will hit upon the videos that drop nuggets of info that pertain to your application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be afraid to use several root primitives as entirely separate pieces. Your model isn\u0027t required to be seamless or to be all one part. Use that to your advantage to keep poly count low. Every single face and vertex needs to be doing something useful for your models visual appeal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a cabin that I am working on for a new SSTO shuttle craft. You can see that I have used a baked Ambient Occlusion map to judge which parts of the mesh need to have unique texture coordinates. All of those things you see are actually modeled, yet the poly count is low. That small bit of space left on the texture card in the top right is perfect to add plenty of small details in actual polygons. There is even room to stuff more in the cracks. That is where using geometry efficiently can help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yW8z3tF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yW8z3tF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still plenty of small detail that will be added to that. Such as grab rails and hand holds. I could safely model in panel lines and believable six sided bolt heads if I wanted to take it that far. Though I find that normal mapping handles those sorts of details convincingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
