Basically, those faces are not PERFECTLY aligned with the rest of the face they neighbor. Luckily, Unity likes to solve this problem by smoothing the normals out during the import process.

I would love to see a Gemini style capsule like this but for it to have meaning in the game I think you should do a mod that gives it a greater purpose. Part of that might mean giving it capabilities that other pods lack and perhaps even taking away some of the capabilities that they have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples. What if the single Kerbal Mercury pod could not do EVA? It couldn\u0027t. Gemini was the first with a door you could reclose and you really needed a second man to help get the EVA out and back into the capsule. What if Mercury did not have access to the docking mode of control? What if Mercury would not accept a docking port on the nose. How about if Gemini would only accept the small docking port. No Crew transfer unless you want to do EVA. The Three man Apollo could be the first that would accept the large docking port for crew transfers to other craft like landers. I think you should need at least a Gemini to set a target and do intercept projections. I think the Apollo should be the first craft with the onboard computer to do patched conic course computation. The others should not show the encounter or the part of the hyperbolic path within the sphere of influence or the elliptical once it leaves. So it just shows the elliptical path that you are on right now. No crystal ball for what will happen once you sling shot around the Mun. I\u0027d like to see a new control mode for the lander cans Where you can control the throttle of the main engine and use the RCS in liner mode to control drift just like Apollo 11. Fly the ball to kill most of your trajectory and arc. Then turn straight up right switch modes and have fine control of the throttle to control decent and RCS to control drift. It would be nice if you could upgrade to a view that would give you a topo map to show slope, a radar altimeter and even drift vectors and a targeted landing point. All things you could earn. And I think there should be ground hazards and less tolerance for slope, drift, and decent speed that require this level of control. I think the lander should require a two man crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now you can do every thing with just the little one man pod. I\u0027d like to see a real purpose for the larger crafts and a push to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough ranting. But it all starts with your two Kerbal Gemini pod.
