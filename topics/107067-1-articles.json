May I present the Nova T1 testbed:\n\n![r0ova0.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/r0ova0.jpg)\n\nI have to admit, I was a bit surprised (and more than a bit alarmed) by the fuel consumption, though I was just winging the speed (rather than looking up the values for an efficient ascent). I also accidently turned the engines off for several seconds, performed cartwheels while attempting to gravity turn, and neglected to connect the booster fuel tanks to the center stack, and she still made it into a 90/110 orbit with 45% fuel remaining in the half tank on the second stage (not enough to go anywhere, but more than enough to land). A trio of winglets on the main stack would also not be unwelcome, for after the boosters are dropped.\n\nShe landed just fine, though there was a little bit of panic when I couldn\u0027t remember if the altitude setting on the parachute was sea level or radar (it\u0027s radar). 90/50 descent setup, could have been a lot more aggressive which such a light return assembly. Didn\u0027t even lose the battery.\n\nSo basically, I screwed up the launch at every opportunity in a rocket I threw together in 5 minutes, and the mission was still a resounding success. That is truly the Kerbal way (and of course Jebediah was the pilot).\n\nI very much look forward to trying to recreate my Kethane fleet under the new inbuilt system. The only hitch is that my mining fleet is truly going to be incapable of atmospheric landings now, so I\u0027ll have to work out a shuttle instead. No matter, I just need to decide how to name them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T04:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox**"},{"CreatedByName":"zerotwo","CreatedById":60799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T05:01:48Z","Content":"My suggestion is this:\n\nUntil 3km, reach and maintain 100 m/s\n\nAt 3 km, depending on TWR of engines (under 1.5 twr, max it out, over 1.5 twr go until you start seeing air friction) increase to maximum speed.\n\nAt 7.5 km turn to 90 degrees and proceed until the apoapsis hits 60~\n\nTurn to 5 degrees above the horizon line and accelerate as much as you can, most of this takes part (for me anyway) from about 22km to 35km~\n\n--\n\n![PGfB3wX.png](http://i.imgur.com/PGfB3wX.png)\n\nThis is a very early orbiter.\n\n![hJNvWx5.png](http://i.imgur.com/hJNvWx5.png)\n\nThis is a basic flyby vehicle for passing by Minmus and the Mun.\n\n![RTZoago.png](http://i.imgur.com/RTZoago.png)\n\nAs soon as I hit miniaturization this was the first thing I built.

It can be built with early tech tree parts but VAB and launch pad must be upgraded. It lands and returns with remaining fuel. Capable for Mun surface rescue mission with okto and solar added.\n\nThe tricks:\n\n - no protection shield. Return using multiple aerobraking on high-enough orbit. Only the pod lands.\n\n - launch stability achieved through the LV-T45 gimbal. It is run on the least possible thrust that keeps the rocket stable and controllable until the boosters go off. The LV-T45 is turned off while the boosters are jettisoned to avoid crashing.\n\n - the BACC boosters are run in two stages with the thrust set to optimal values (50% and 80%). The optimal values were found using trial and error.\n\n - the radial engines work in parallel with the bottom LV-T45 after the boosters. Gravity turn is done as soon as the turning effect of the athmosphere allows it\n\n - stabilizer is turned off when possible. This way the electricity in the pod is enough.\n\n - the lander is also the return vehicle driven by an LV-909. Its center of mass is too high so it is hard to land without flipping. But possible :-).\n\n - the to orbit, transfer and landing phase is an LV-909 to spare weight. When reaching orbit the TWR it provides is just enough. When landing on the Mun the fuel is used just before landing. So it is jettisoned just before touching the ground of the Mun.\n\n - there is no ladder. Kerbals use JETPACK to enter the vehicle on the surface of the Mun.\n\n - it has 4 legs. 3 may also be enough :-)\n\n![w2lz7q.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/w2lz7q.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"PerfectDeath","CreatedById":75792,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:28:26Z","Content":"Well, she certainly is not low tech or anything; however, she landed and returned to kerbin with lots of science.
