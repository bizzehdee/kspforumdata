Would it have enough fuel to return to orbit and dock with Laythe Space Station (where the propellant for refueling it is located)? Emilynn Kerman would be the main pilot, and Aldner would ride in the lander pod as he copilot and flight engineer. Just in case, Nuclear Tug L5 was docked to Laythe Station (last time) to pick up a full load of fuel so that it could be used to rescue the Ladyhawk if it was only able to barely limp into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Thompbles had an extra mission for our intrepid test pilots: After the radiation storm hit, GasStation 5 (being held as a reserve in orbit) never came back online...probably due to the failure of its computer or communications systems. So Aldner would bring replacement circuit modules scavenged from the now-empty GasStation 1 to install on GasStation 5. Luckily, the Tug attached to GasStation 5 was still responding (once Thompbles woke its computer back up from safe mode), so it could bring GasStation 5 down to low Laythe orbit to meet the Ladyhawk. Below, Aldner and Kurt drove up to GasStation 1 to scavenge parts (it\u0027s a good thing they decided NOT to crash it off into Fido Bay after all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BkTDEaZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BkTDEaZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing legs of the GasStation were folded up to put it within easier reach. Of course, I\u0027m sure the kerbals could use the amazing long-each powers they use for repacking parachutes to reach the parts of interest, but I wanted it to look reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dP8uflJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dP8uflJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AIXLIUW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AIXLIUW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was worried about what would happen if the Ladyhawk couldn\u0027t reach orbit. Many of my early attempts to fly an SSTO spaceplane into Kerbin orbit had failed, and the spaceplane had invariably been forced to ditch in the ocean. And no matter how slowly and carefully I had tried to land it in the water, it always broke up (although the cockpit with Corfrey Kerman aboard always survived for naval pickup). But if Emilynn and Aldner were dropped into the drink on Latyhe, there was no navy to rescue them. I was originally going to build a VTOL plane to handle ocean rescues on Laythe, but my lack of skill with either building or piloting VTOL planes meant that I was never able to get a VTOL plane to land on and take off from water with anything near 100% reliability. So as an alternative I sent the NAMOR-20 (New Automated Marine Operations Rescue) vehicle to Laythe, where it is currently parked in orbit. The \u0027Automated\u0027 in NAMOR\u0027s name refers to the experimental Artificial Intelligence that controls the ship, and Nelemy was assigned the task of checking out the NAMOR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Nelemy taps his headset mike a couple times*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Ah, Nelemy Kerman calling NAMOR-20.

Meanwhile, Emilynn and Aldner were finishing up pre-flight checks on the Ladyhawk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Say, Buzz... There\u0027s only 24.5 units of RCS fuel in the tank instead of 40.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022What? Let me check. ...Damn, I verify that. Sorry Hawk...looks like I missed a step in the checklist before separating the spaceplane for landing. On the trip out, the Tug must have been drawing monopropellant from all of the onboard tanks, and I didn\u0027t top up the spaceplane\u0027s RCS tank. Sorry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Ah, it\u0027s OK, Buzz. It\u0027ll just make this a bit more challenging. We always have Tug 5 to come get us if I use up all the RCS fuel. Everything else checks out. Let\u0027s see whether or not we can get this bird to space!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore takeoff, the rear Mk1 Fuselage tank of the Ladyhawk held 79.15 unit of liquid fuel, and the FL-T400 tank ahead of it contained 178 units of liquid fuel and 133 units of oxidizer (the missing fuel and oxidizer had been used during the retro burn that brought the Ladyhawk down to Laythe, and for running the jet engine while circling around for a landing. The two FL-T200 tanks behind the ram air intakes were both full. Below, the Ladyhawk lifts off toward the east on its single turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NHZjy7R.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NHZjy7R.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, Emilynn headed the Ladyhawk toward the southeast. The Laythe Base area at Fido Bay is located a little north of the equator, and rather than try to make orbit by heading straight east (which would result in a slightly inclined orbit, requiring a costly plane-correction maneuver later in orbit), the spaceplane was flown down to the equator before starting its run to orbit, because that is more fuel efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SAbpxe3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SAbpxe3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the plane lined up with Joysina Lake (which sits astride the equator), Emilynn banked the Ladyhawk and headed east. Their ground track would carry them a little north of Mariliza Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eHoDiIN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eHoDiIN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yo, Cap\u0027n Thompbles! We are staring to level off for our cruise. Altitude eighteen six. Speed: 13888. Fuel: 375. Oxidizer: 353. I\u0027d appreciate it if you could write these down...just in case we don\u0027t make it back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I copy, Aldner.

But if we have lots of delta-V left over, maybe we\u0027ll just head out to explore Bop or something!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Ah. Well, don\u0027t do that. I\u0027m counting on you to fix my GasStation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022We are picking up some ionization effects...these might interfere with communications. No problems with exterior temperatures.\u0022 *static*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tgQd4w2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tgQd4w2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn was able to get the Ladyhawk cruising along at over 20,000 meters, and speeds over 1,480 m/s, at about two-thirds throttle. If the turbojet flamed out, she backed off on the throttle a couple notches to restart the engine, and tried getting a little higher and faster before the next flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J2O47cC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022J2O47cC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Looking good, Hawk.

Hold on to your hat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Emilynn kicks in the four Rockomax 48-7S engines, goes full throttle, cuts off the turbojet, closes the air intakes to reduce drag, and pulls the nose up to about 30 degrees.

Because the Ladyhawk was ahead of the Station (with was in an 80 km orbit), Emilynn boosted the Ladyhawk into a higher (90 km) orbit, then waited for a few orbits as the now-faster-moving Station caught up to them. Then she dropped the Ladyhawk (the 10.5 m/s maneuver shown ready below) down to meet the station, and then matched velocities. This resulted in the Ladyhawk sitting about 120 meters from the station (with no RCS fuel yet used during the flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GoLiL0Y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GoLiL0Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7cezaL2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227cezaL2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Ladyhawk approaches for docking (using the wonderful Lazer docking cam).

ALSO NOTE that it was a bug regarding the deployment of repacked chutes (using action group keys) that gave me lots of problems when developing and testing the NAMOR back on Kerbin: The chutes were coming out instantly fully deployed and ripping the ship apart. To prevent this, it was necessary to do a quicksave of the ship after repacking the chutes, then reopening that quicksave. (Or apparently you can also switch to the KSC, then switch back.) This also allows the repacked chutes to appear in the staging sequence again (which does not happen after you\u0027ve just repacked them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Bml4F8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220Bml4F8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in THIS case, there was only ONE set of chutes to work with, and the NAMOR was going to land too fast for safety... and that\u0027s why a tiny amount of fuel was held in reserve. This fuel was in the two small FL-T100 tanks, and it was used to fire the Rockomax 24-77 engines just before landing (the rocket engines were used instead of the jet engines because they have no spool-up lag). NAMOR ran out of fuel before touchdown, but it had slowed just enough that the explosion cloud you see below was due to a couple of the cubic octagonal struts that serve as \u0027landing legs\u0027 exploding... the rest of the ship was intact. Any kerbals in it would have been safe on Dansen Island where a Fido rover could come get them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jQ7QO13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jQ7QO13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... despite having been burdened with all that extra oxidizer (which should have been tweaked out of the tanks), the NAMOR managed to land at the rescue target spot and then fly one-third of the way around Laythe to land safely on Dansen Island.
