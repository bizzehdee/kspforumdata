I have found this to be the best way to create fully recoverable rocket lifters: you could leave out the wings and land with parachutes and/or retro rockets instead, but that\u0027s harder to do precisely enough for a 100% recovery. These are also easier to design than HTOL spaceplanes, because the payload goes on the nose like on a rocket and it\u0027s perfectly fine -- desirable even -- to have the centre of mass far forward on the way up. And /very/ early in your career, you can get to near 100% recoverability even without landing gear, because you can ditch them in the sea in front of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in your career, you can use them to explore Laythe and Duna.
