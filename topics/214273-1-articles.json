I can move the camera around just fine in both the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and tracking station.\u00A0\u003Cu\u003EI\u0027ve heard of some people having issues in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I want to reiterate that this DOES NOT apply to that issue.\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcruciating detail for the devs (if they see this) since this one seems rather uncommon but can be reliably and repeatedly induced if affected by it\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore or less, the camera appears locked in position once you\u0027re on the launch pad, in space, or at the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view/selection menu. (Whatever you want to call it when you click return to space center.) After holding down RMB and applying constant movement to the mouse, maybe once every 5 seconds or so you\u0027ll notice the camera move, like, maybe 3mm. That\u0027s not an exaggeration. This also holds true when hitting tab and trying to see is mouse-look works. Nada. It\u0027s worth mentioning that snap still works just fine. \u0022v\u0022 will still snap to the different view angles just fine, but you still won\u0027t be able to move the camera. When flying though, if I go into the map view, I can still move the camera around there. Transition back to vessel view, nada.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter some fiddling, I figured out what was causing the problem. It\u0027s probably worth mentioning that I play A LOT of light sims like DCS and MSFS, and normally would have somewhere in the range of about 9 or more separate devices plugged into my desktop at any given time. I only mention that because the only other people I\u0027ve found who also experienced this exact issue also have a fairly notable amount of flight sim hardware that isn\u0027t of the Thrustmaster or Logitech variety or just a joystick and base. Thus far, I have yet to run into any deviation from that factor.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESource of the issue and quick/temp fix:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor whatever reason, KSP2 wasn\u0027t playing nice with one specific panel. If it matters, it\u0027s the Winwing Super Taurus F-18 dual throttle and startup panel. They\u0027re attached to each other, but the panel and throttle have their own respective USB ports independent of one another. My issue was specific to the startup panel only. The second I unplugged the startup panel, the camera suddenly snapped into position and I was able to move it freely around the launch pad/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view/vessel again. I tried plugging it back in to see if the problem would occur again, aaaand it did. I have absolutely nothing bound to any of my peripherals in the game. I only play it with mouse and keyboard. (First started playing in 2012. Old habits die hard.) Windows reads all of the different devices I have as game controllers and I can say with certainty they\u0027re not something that\u0027s just emulating keyboard keys/presses. Most other games will read them as a standard\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ejoy0_0\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003Ejoy2_[\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ewhatever button/switch input pressed\u003C/span\u003E]\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0, so nothing surprising there. It also didn\u0027t matter if the software for calibrating/adjusting the controls was running or not.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat panel has over something like over 20 separate switches and most of those are 3-position, so maybe there was hard ceiling for inputs per device. However, one of the other people I came across said that it was only occurring with his Virpil throttle, which is well under that amount. I have a couple of other peripherals that are comparable to the problem one as well (though mostly multi-pos rotary switches rather than just switches), yet there\u0027s zero issue with them still being plugged in. Maybe just to spitball a couple possibilities:\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EA)\u003C/strong\u003E There\u0027s some threshold with either a max total number of inputs across all devices cumulatively, or total # of USB devices that once you go over it, the camera is the thing that bugs out for some reason. Might be something stuck in a loop trying to check some input that it couldn\u0027t assign but reads as pressed.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EB)\u003C/strong\u003E I didn\u0027t see any option for it in the settings menu, but if the game isn\u0027t blanking\u00A0 out or freezing panel/control states once you\u0027re loaded in and in control of the vessel (i.e. - ignoring whatever position they\u0027re in until they register a change), there\u0027s possibly some combo or specific problem child that the game can\u0027t make heads or tails of. Regardless of whether or not any controls have been assigned to that device. In either case, why only the camera is affected when viewing outside in general is its own mystery. Though it\u0027s probably safe to say that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view is using the same block of code that the vessel view is using.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"delenda","CreatedById":227499,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T10:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same issue although it only manifests for me once I alt-tab out of the game.
