If I hadn\u0027t had the entire KSOS package running fun with dozens of other parts heavy mods in .25, I\u0027d jump on the memory issue bandwagon...but it doesn\u0027t make sense that after an update now I can\u0027t even get KSOS to work by itself. Nothing has changed in KSOS, and Squad hasn\u0027t added so many parts to push my memory limit. As stated, this only happens when I try to install the parts for the shuttles, I can add 30 unrelated mods (MKS and everything else put out by roverdude included, which adds an extreme amount of parts), along with the two packs from KSOS, vehicles and stations, and it doesn\u0027t even hiccup. Heck, with the new ATG it loads much quicker than in .25. If I try to run the KSOS shuttle packs it CTDs about 10 seconds in.

Previous versions of KSP I was able to figure out what part was causing the issue (it would hang while trying to load something), or figure out what was conflicting with what. To be honest, I can\u0027t say I can recall actually running into the out of memory issue in the past...all my crashes were related to conflicts (which is pretty rare) and outdated or broken mods. I did prioritize the mods the first time around, that\u0027s how I came to the conclusion it was KSOS causing the trouble, and even down to the fact that it was the shuttle bundles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently only using mods stated to be updated to .90, not trying to use anything that\u0027s outdated...and I\u0027m only trying to use KSOS because others say it should be working fine.
