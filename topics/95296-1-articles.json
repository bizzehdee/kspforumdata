You can design your ship and launch it in minutes, I don\u0027t think, that Kerbal workers are fast enought to build a 50m high rocket in matter of minutes, here\u0027s the list of new features, that could be added (some have been suggested before):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - construction time, what would depend on how many parts are there in your rocket/plane and how heavy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - in case of emergency, when you need to launch your craft right away, like a kerbal crashed somewhere in the desert, without food and water (assuming, that life support will be added someday. You could pre-build few vehicles and store them in hangars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - There could be some kind of construction queue for both VAB and SPH, that would show remaining time fro each craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - There could also be an option, when you finally design you craft and want to construct, there would be an option \u0022Do you want to skip construction process and launch you vessel right away?\u0022 it would calculate all orbits of crafts, that were launched before, just like time warp, but with an instant effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You could always edit pre build aircrafts without building new units, time would depend, on how many parts were moved and by how far. It would allow you to repair damaged aircaft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - In space center view you can buy and place new hangars\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T21:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much everything you listed is already on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44952-Already-Suggested-List\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Do not suggest\u0022 list\u003C/a\u003E.
