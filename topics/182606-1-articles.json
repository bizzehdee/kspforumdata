been playing the game for years, but I\u0027ve never been very good at manually downloading mods.\u00A0 But since Sigma has stopped updating on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027m forced to download manually.\u00A0 All I want for now is to get the stock solar system to become twice as big as normal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve done all of the parts, and that I have the latest versions.\u00A0 I got Kopernicus from the Github (where it says it\u0027s good up to version 1.6.1) and the same for Sigma Dimensions (it doesn\u0027t clearly specify what version it\u0027s good up to, but it is the latest version of the mod at least).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI put the Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator, and Sigma folders into the GameData folder.\u00A0 ModuleManager v4.0.1 is present.\u00A0 I then went into the sigma folder, navigated to the Settings.CFG opened and edited a few things.\u00A0 For started I just did Resize = 2 and Rescale = 2, which should make the orbits twice as large, and the planet radii twice as large.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut... when I save, close, and boot up the game.\u00A0 None of the orbits have changed.\u00A0 Am I missing a step to get Sigma to
