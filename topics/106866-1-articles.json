You can \u0022pull\u0022 more TAS, but you can\u0027t raise your Airspeed beyond the drag limit. That\u0027s why craft go faster higher up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Surface\u0022 speed is TAS, since no matter how high you go, the respective Orbital Speed in level flight (same heading) is always the same. You can check it: fly 100 m/s at sea level. ~275 m/s Orbital speed when heading east from KSC. And it\u0027s the same at 5000 metres or at 10.000. However, you won\u0027t be able to maintain 100m/s in most craft at 20.000 because the Airspeed is WAAAY lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s the real issue in KSP: With a standard jet engine, you get nearly exactly the same TAS at sea level as you are getting at 5000 metres. But that\u0027s not real. Blimey, it\u0027s not even real for propeller driven airplanes of WWII. Even with a propeller airplane you will reach higher TAS than at sea level. With any commercial jet aircraft in the world, you will easily reach higher TAS up to 10.000 metres. While this is earth atmosphere, Kerbin resembles it at a certain scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are different limits to a flight profile of speed / altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. On the low end, it\u0027s the lift of the wings. Go too slow, and you are out of the game. This low end curve will start at stall speed at sea level and increase in TAS (not IAS!) the higher you go. You IAS stall speed stays the same, but the higher you go, the higher the TAS gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The second limit is the airframe integrity limit. If you pass beyond a certain dynamic pressure, it\u0027s game over. KSP models this in a neglectable way. The only thing you have to care about are high G-forces or heating. However, it\u0027s a major factor in aviation. Go beyond the red line, and you won\u0027t walk away from this landing. Now dynamic pressure is nothing other than an IAS issue. The higher you go the less dynamic pressure you will get at a given TAS, which means you can speed like a bullet and pull high AOA at high altitudes without breaking your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. So what is the limiting factor then? It\u0027s the third limit, which is the thrust vs. drag ratio. To go fast, you want to go up high. But somewhere there\u0027s the equilibrium between your engine\u0027s thrust and the remaining drag. That\u0027s your service ceiling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in KSP, the jet engine\u0027s thrust/drag ratio seems to have the same value at all altitudes from sea level almost to it\u0027s ceiling. While it is perfectly clear you can\u0027t break the sound barrier at sea level because IAS = TAS at sea level, the IAS at 10.000 metres is way lower, and the drag is not much of a deal. But the jet engine in KSP loses his power too quickly. It behaves more like a prop engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion to make it feel more like a real jet would be to reduce it\u0027s overall power, but to make the power loss up to 10.000 less dramatic, so you could slowly accelerate to a maximum of 300 at sea level, and fly about 400-450 at 10.000 (TAS). Maybe you would even be able to make parabolic flights then up to those \u0022report above xxxxx m at yyyyy\u0022 contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotally support this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the jet engine in KSP loses his power too quickly.

IAS is the indicated airspeed, as \u0022seen\u0022 by the pivot tube. Though there are many factors that influence IAS which cannot be taken into account in a game like KSP, IAS would be directly related to the dynamic pressure. So, using Mechjeb or something like that, you can see how this pressure differs dramatically with altitude while flying the same speed above ground (=\u0022surface\u0022 speed). It\u0027s as great as 2% per 1000ft, so at 33000 ft (10.000 m equivalent), you\u0027ll get 66% difference in speed readouts (oooops!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor flying, it\u0027s very important to have an IAS (or CAS) airspeed readout, so you know if you are near stall speed or near a critical speed limit.

Nothing i couldn\u0027t see with Mechjeb, too. I would love to have it as another reference in the Navball (Orbit/Surface/Target/IAS). TAS would be nice, but it matches Surface, since there\u0027s no wind. Groundspeed would be great, too, but that\u0027s nothing you need very often, and you get it with Surface speed if you fly level, which is mostly the case when you need it to navigate around, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are into creating mods, i\u0027d LOVE to see one mod i didn\u0027t discover yet: A graphical display of the flight envelope, like that: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newbyte.co.il/products.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.newbyte.co.il/products.html\u003C/a\u003E or like that: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.christiancurry.com/primary-flight-display/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.christiancurry.com/primary-flight-display/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://niquette.com/books/chapsky/glossfly.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://niquette.com/books/chapsky/glossfly.htm\u003C/a\u003E (look for \u0022envelope, flight\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith such a display one could easily figure the correct speed/altitude to keep any craft in it\u0027s optimum performance window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet the difficulty would be to create a pop up window that shows the correct information for each craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
