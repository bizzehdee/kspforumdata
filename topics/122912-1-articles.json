Yes, I could probably just blow the fairings and the base off all at the same time and freefall the rest of the way. Probably the option I would use if going to Laythe or Eve. And I want it to emulate a system that NASA was eyeing for real flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get some screenshots right away, though.
