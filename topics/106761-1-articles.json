THIS IS THE GAME I WANTED!! that sick feeling that my first 1.0 re-entry gave me is gone with my first 1.02 re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPop the chute going 2kms? instantly destroyed. Wait another minute and watch the speed fall to 300ms? pop the chute and enjoy an new slow opening with no insane G forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys, you listened and you fixed it, and you did it in just a few days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all the people who where asking why people where so critical of 1.0 this is the answer, because it wasn\u0027t right. 1.02 however is what I was expecting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that chutes can burn off or get ripped off, one had better use a probe core for parachute testing contracts. And, reentry heating is back to a more normal time period, so the atmosphere density at different altitudes seems more balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn and agree \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E burning chute are lovely ; )\u002B etc. nice work squad ; )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
