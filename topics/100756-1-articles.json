If not, either wait until you do, or build a two-podded ship. This will be your \u0027rescue pod\u0027. Don\u0027t forget the parachutes, and if you\u0027re using a probe, don\u0027t forget solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if you use the Stayputnik, you won\u0027t have access to SAS, so flying it can get a bit hairy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rescue pod will need about 500 m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for orbital maneuvering (75 km circular parking orbit to 200 km circular orbit for rendezvous, to 40 km Kerbin-return). It\u0027s actually a bit less than this, so this includes some safety margin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you\u0027ll need to launch the rescue pod into a 75 km (this doesn\u0027t have to be exact) orbit. Since you can get to the Mun, I\u0027m going to assume this isn\u0027t a big deal for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet Jeb as your target by clicking him in the map view, and select \u0027Set as Target\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ll want to create a maneuver node and pull on the prograde handle until your projected apoapsis matches Jeb\u0027s 200 km orbit. Don\u0027t perform the maneuver yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, take that maneuver node and play with the timing (slide it around your orbit and use the \u002B/- orbit buttons) until you get \u0027closest approach\u0027 markers (little red or orange arrows) close together in the same spot your projected orbit meets Jeb\u0027s. This step can take a bit of time, and can be a little frustrating, especially if you\u0027re not used to it. The PreciseNode mod (if you\u0027re not averse to mods) can make it quite a bit easier, as it gives you a finer control, and avoids the niggly mouse-movement-related issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you see the closest approach markers, mouse over them and you will see how close you will pass to Jeb, and where your relative positions will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, you would want to have the closest approach within about 5 km, and you would want Jeb to be behind you in the orbit. Don\u0027t worry too much about this, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re happy with the projected approach, warp to the maneuver and perform the burn. Then coast up to 200 km and your rendezvous point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get close to Jeb, your navball will switch into \u0027Target\u0027 mode. In this mode, the speed reading shows your speed relative to the target. The pro- and retro-grade markers on the navball also switch to showing the vectors relative to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get to the point of closest approach, burn retrograde (relative to the target) until your relative velocity as displayed on the navball goes to 0. At this point you\u0027re basically flying in formation with Jeb. If you\u0027re close enough (within about 1 km) you should be able to switch control to Jeb, EVA him over to the rescue pod, and jump in. If you\u0027re not familiar with EVA control, you might want to practice first (I think there\u0027s a training scenario that will allow you to do exactly this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still too far away, then burn directly towards the target (the pink circle on the navball) until you get a closing speed of a few m/s. After closing with the target, once again burn retrograde to zero out the relative velocity. You can repeat this process until you\u0027re as close as you want to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get Jeb on board, burn retrograde to deorbit and return to Kerbin. (You did remember the parachutes, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be surprised if this doesn\u0027t go smoothly the first time; orbital rendezvous is one of the more difficult skills in the game. Be prepared to use F5/F9 (or, better, Alt-F5/Alt-F9) to practise until you get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T05:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try getting out and pushing. Dump any remaining stages, so that you only have the capsule left, point the capsule toward the retrograde marker on the Navball, EVA Jeb, position him at the bottom of the capsule in the centre, and push with the W key. Do this for a while (don\u0027t run out of fuel), get back in and check the situation (and refill the EVA fuel tank). If necessary get out and repeat. Get the periapsis below 30km and you should be able to renter and land.

Set your Munar escape burn to put you at a 40-45km periapsis and the atmosphere will aerobrake you down to a much tighter AP. If you have spare fuel you can then choose to lift the PE to ~75km and wait for a good time to drop onto KSC. If not, just loop round again and the atmosphere will capture you and you\u0027ll land \u0027somewhere\u0027 - but you\u0027re guaranteed to land \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember that kerbals in stock can photosynthesise; Jeb won\u0027t starve or suffocate, ever.
