All Kerbin lifter stages end up on Kerbin and the transfer stage along with all Eve lifter stages end up on Eve. Some things to be wary of with this craft are: one a true sea level launch will be very difficult, and two you need to take off at a time of day when the sun is mid morning or so that way when you hit apoapsis and are using your Ions to finish the orbit you will have maximum solar power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/3eg2avubitle1r2/Eve_4_Man_Lander_IV.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s it!

I spent a lot more time optimizing the lander than the launch vehicle, so it didn\u0027t fly overly well and could probably be made smaller. However, it got the job done. If you look closely at the lander on the launch pad, it has a ring of nuclear engines around it. These are used to get the lander from LKO to LEO, where it rendevous with the tanker. It takes about half of the large fuel tanks to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker is nothing special. It\u0027s just a large fuel can with a bunch of nuclear engines. It also carries an extra nuclear engine and fuel tank at the top, which is how the Kerbal gets home. Once in LKO, it travels to LEO under its own power, rendevous and then docks with the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking, the lander can be refueled before final descent. When undocked, the nuclear engines provide the necessary deorbiting burn without depleting the main fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, the lander has a number of parachutes which slow descent to about 13 m/s. I went through the numbers, and figured out that landing by parachute alone simply isn\u0027t practical. At 40m or so I flared the main engine for a soft landing. The lander is touchy due to it\u0027s mass, but it does work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy landing site was random. In fact, I landed it a couple of times hoping to hit something close to sea level. No such luck. My calculations show that it should be able to achieve orbit from sea level, but my landing sites were both in the 1000m - 2000 m range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce landed, it\u0027s a fairly straightforward hop back into orbit. From sea level, it should have just enough fuel to make a 107km orbit. From where I landed, I had between 400m/s and 500m/s of deltaV left over, and neither of my landing flares were very efficient. Final docking was done from the tanker, as the lander can doesn\u0027t have an RCS system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the second docking with the tanker, the lander is refueled and the nuclear engine extracted for the trip home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest mistake in this mission was forgetting to put parachutes on the lander can. In an effort to save mass, I didn\u0027t put a decoupling ring between the lander can and the last fuel tank. This saved the mission. Fortunately, the two small engines had enough TWR that if I undocked from the nuclear engine and fuel tank, I could actively land the can on Kerbin. It ended up being a splash down, but the lander and Kerbal survived without difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had three mods installed. The first was MecJeb, the second was KerbalEngineer, and the third was HyperEdit. I never used KE, but I was too lazy to uninstall it. HyperEdit was used in the design phase, but the actual mission was flown from start to finish. I figure HyperEdit isn\u0027t much different than a NASA computer simulation prior to an actual launch. I did use MechJeb for a number of operations, notably for calculating the Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin transfers. All parts were stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m happy to provide craft files if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoger\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T17:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.

When I got on the forums and saw this challenge, I figured I was just about ready for it. Sometimes it is good that you don\u0027t know what you don\u0027t know.

I used a tiny program called SymLink Creator to make a \u0022hard link\u0022 of the save folder to a dropbox folder. I did the same on my computer at work. The game sees a hard link as tho it is seeing the save folder in its actual location.

I tried and tried, but in the end the vehicle I had created could only work with three Mk1 Lander Cans, and, in desperation, I added another ring of huge rockets to my lifter assembly which made it much too big for the circle rule. Then I landed at 602m rather than below 500. So I started over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was originally going to do this in career mode, but it would have bankrupted my program, so I used sanbox. I am still of the mind that my creation is a bastardization of engineering. On the other hand, I just looked at the preceding couple of pages in this thread, and maybe I should feel right at home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander alone is 727.8 tonnes and 385 parts. Oh yeah, and we actually tested the ladder on this one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire single launch is 9033.7 tonnes and 1171 parts, and the cost is 4205541 kurrency. I built the lifter/IP stage with extra docking ports in case I needed to refuel in LKO. My margins were razor thin, but I got away with a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to LKO was painful only because of the lag. Time was running at about 6 or 7 to 1. Waited a long time for a transfer window because I thought the second one looked a little better than the first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause my margins were so thin, the aerocapture was followed by separation and circularization for the IP stage, and right back around to aerobrake and land for the lander. Thus, the night landing. At least you can see at night on Eve. It took several tries to get a good landing site with minimal fuel use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo surprises on the ascent, since I had tested the crap out of the lander. The joy of shedding parts and lag was glorious. Almost as glorious as the joy of successful reorbiting, rendezvous, and docking. The IP stage had only wisps of fuel left after adjusting it\u0027s initial Eve orbit, but plenty to get the tiny return stage home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally thought that I could make it much smaller and more efficient than this, but I\u0027m still climbing that learning wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realized that I had missed taking screenshots at a couple of points, so I had to go back to my named quicksaves and run a couple of sections of the mission over to get the pics.
