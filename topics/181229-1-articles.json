You must be on site as early as possible. In the case of Es\u0027Hail-2/Falcon 9 in November, I arrived around 10 in the morning, even if the launch actually happened at 15:46 local time. Many\u00A0people are coming to attend every launch, even more when it\u0027s a recoverable Falcon. Also pretty good, four restrooms are available at each parking, but you must carry your own water as there are no selling points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe location is costing 1 USD to enter if you are walking in (these guys are smart, the closest houses are in Titusville, almost two hours of walking from the park) or if you are coming on a bicycle. With a car, it will cost you 10. What I\u0027m recommending to everyone who don\u0027t want to take any risk is to buy the annual pass for 40 dollars. In case of multiple scrubs it can be interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Same story for the FL-401 in Port Canaveral. If you are standing at the westerly spot, you just have to park on the side of the road, and everything is done. However, no restrooms are available there. If you decided to stay\u00A0close to the entrance of the base, you will have to stop at a simple checkpoint, and a MP will ask you what you are doing here (only to check if you are working on the base or not). Just say that you are coming to attend the launch and he/she will tell you to park (rear first, mandatory) at a special location. The good point about here is that two large grandstands are available, as well as 6 chemical restrooms, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBUT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, don\u0027\u0027t forget to bring your own toilet paper with you (it\u0027s not a joke, almost every time I\u0027m leaving one in for others).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything there is free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you\u0027re going at the LC-39 Observation Gantry, you need to pay for an entry at the Visitor Center, and $50 more for the gantry. If the launch is scrubbed \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore \u003C/strong\u003Eyou are giving your\u00A0bus boarding card, then everything is \u0022fine\u0022, and you will be able to use your ticket for the next launch\u00A0attempt. However, you must pay for a new daily entrance (this is where it\u0027s way better to buy an annual pass instead of a daily admission, just in case). Now the worst, if it has been\u00A0cancelled \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter \u003C/strong\u003Eyou have seated in,\u00A0the game is\u00A0over. You will not be refunded your tickets, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E V.C. will only give you two solutions: or you can buy something awfully expensive in one of the stores with\u00A015% off, OR it can give you a free access to visitor complex for the next attempt, BUT you will still have to buy a new 50 USD place for the O.G.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s costing a lot, but it\u0027s always giving you the closest spot locations when it\u0027s open. Water and food are free to everyone, and a \u0022mission\u0022 t-shirt will be given to you (officially, it\u0027s supposed to be a mission t-shirt, every single time I went there it was not but some of their\u00A0standard shirts they are selling at the Visitor Complex... anyway)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Every launch is exceptional and particular and another point I really enjoy is that you are always meeting with people coming from all over the globe. However, the rate of right-on-time lift-off is still average.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- For DM-1, it will depend of what you want to see the most, the lift-off or the abort. For the first case, the best would be Playalinda as the pad is supposed to be the 39A, but if you want a better side perspective of the whole scene, I would go for Port Canaveral instead. The trajectory of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDragon\u003C/em\u003E flights is really particular when compared to the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo give you some example, here is what you will see from Playalinda:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/2bxnjeD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image30\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4892/44987230295_487162dd5d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere from the FL-401:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/RCHjBN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002230\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4807/32576937708_69bd127b2e_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, as it\u0027s a Dragon flight, you can see the difference of trajectory on these two shots, both were taken at Max-q from the same location in Port Canaveral;\u00A0both were launched from the SLC-40:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/2dG787q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002235\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4804/46398828192_e819a0acc9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPS 3-I \u0022Vespucci\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/2dofJNr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vlcsnap-2018-12-05-19h26m56s908\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4867/46196812221_76641a2578_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDragon CRS-16\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, the Dragon trajectory is more \u0022straight\u0022 from our perspective.
