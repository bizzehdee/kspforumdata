I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to bring it ouf of the orbit back down to Kerbin, but I was able to get the periapsis to be inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (around 48,000m right now). My question is will the atmosphere take energy out of the orbit and eventually bring the rocket back down to the planet, Or is my tiny rocket doomed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T07:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, atmospheric drag will indeed bleed off velocity (and thus, energy) from your orbiting craft as it passes through the atmosphere. At 48 km it might take a few passes for it to be effective, depending on the general size of the orbit, but it\u0027ll eventually come back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T07:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it will.
