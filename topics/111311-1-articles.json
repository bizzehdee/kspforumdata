So, in your moduledecoupler, add the line \u0027staged=false\u0027 to omit the decoupler from staging action. I have not yet tried this to see how well it works (looking at the source, it -should- work) or if it removes the decoupler staging icon (probably does not). I\u0027m still looking for similar flags with engines and parachutes, but not finding much yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
