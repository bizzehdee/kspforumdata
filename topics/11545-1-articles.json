And Unity is very useful. If you want your engines to glow or your textures to look more high detailed without complex modeling (normal maps). Unity also supports animations. Unity isn\\\u0027t a modeling engine. It\\\u0027s for exporting to kerbal and for advanced parts like animated lander legs. I really hope you give it another try."}]}
