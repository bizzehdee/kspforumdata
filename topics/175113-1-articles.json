Double points if one player does it first. If you can get back to Kerbin, double all points earned by the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll players start with basic tech (MK1 Pod, KV1 Re-entry Module, Flea, Basic fin) with 2HOT Thermometers replacing Mystery Goo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayers also start with one Orange Suit Kerbal which has special abilities (Jeb and Val have abilities that reduce risk, Bill makes crafts have higher Pseudo Delta-V, Bob gives out higher science). All other crew spaces are automatically manned by lame whitesuits. The Orange suits can never die; they only return back to the space center. If whitesuits die, however, you lose Rep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll science\u00A0parts have a base science reward multiplied by the situation and the planetary body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew parts available via using science to buy a random part from a certain category (Command, Fuel, Engines, Control, Coupling, Thermal, Electricity, Science, Utility) with some categories and parts unused. (Possible issue with getting late game parts early)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta-V System Simplified: (Fuel Points (From Fuel Tanks) -\u00A0Mass) * Multiplier from Engine (Emulating Isp).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransport map based on the Delta-V Subway Map with the Pseudo Delta-V Values. Traversing a route takes one turn, except from aerobraking. You can do several aerobrakes in one turn, as long as they connect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRisk Factor (This is a doozy): During Take-Off, Landing, Aerobraking, Refining and Mining (Landing on a body using aerobraking counts as aerobraking).\u00A0A risk number\u00A0is\u00A0based on the Pseudo Delta-V required for Take-Off/Landing/Aerobraking (ordered in least risk to most risk)\u00A0and the type of Drill/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E for their respective roles (Numbers are WIP currently).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way to prevent an accident due to risk is by rolling a number of dice equal to\u00A0the number of kerbals on the craft plus any extra bonus die (Orange Suit Kerbal ability may add extra die, parachutes add extra die)(Probe Cores only have a flat bonus, replicating their calculated behavior). The number on the dice have\u00A0bonuses and penalties added to them\u00A0(Uneven Cross-section makes risks harder, fins make it easier).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the final number is higher or equal than the risk number, you\u0027re safe! If it\u0027s lower, you lose parts equal to how much you under the risk amount (you can choose which parts).(Note: Any\u00A0part with the safety\u00A0can be used for any situation, so you can use a heatshield to make take-off risk free)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding Rockets: Currently WIP, so suggest ideas for rocket construction!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach engine has a thrust value. If the weight of the rocket is higher than the thrust, you will not go into orbit today (Or be landing on an atmosphereless body). In orbit it doesn\u0027t matter of course. The weight of a rocket is dependent on the body the craft is orbiting and the mass of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease share your ideas on this below!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-26T11:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a few cards and there are smaller cards with all the spacecraft parts. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176562-firekerb/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022176562\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176562-firekerb/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@FireKerb\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
