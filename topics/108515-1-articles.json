However KSP only cares about the name before the file extension, not what the extension is or anything like that. So even if the model says \u0022myTexture.png is its texture file, KSP will load myTexture.dds if its in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also override textures via the MODEL {} node in the config of course if you need to reuse a texture from another folder or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you can export it as TGA, PNG, MBM or whatever and then convert it to DDS. There\u0027s a KSP-specific tool to do this automatically: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a very slick program.
