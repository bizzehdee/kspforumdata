It can also make organics straight from water\u002Bsubstrate (farming!). there is no need to create mulch other than that created by kerbals. The kerbitat is what transforms organics to supplies (again, the pioneer module has both of these bits built into a single converter)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:00:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Posted this earlier in the thread, but here it is again. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E As of right now (18:20 EST May 3) I see it on CKAN, listed as \u0022USI Life Support\u0022.

The problem is that when Rover named his DLL he used the same name as ECLSS so there is no way currently for anyone to differentiate the two with MM patches. Rover already mentioned he is going to update the DLL name next release, Universal Storage is more or less waiting for that ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI jury rigged my own if you want to use it. No guarantees on actual balance though since i just divided the 1.25 NOMS container value by 4 to determine how much supplies to put in the wedge.

Mostly for two reasons:\n\n1) You would need to backtrack the assets to remove with the part cfgs (All the assets share a folder instead of being in the folder with the part cfg)\n\n2) The reason for above is that Rover uses alot of shared assets. In a way the mod has already been cut down to the bare minimum when it comes to system resource usage. Delete the wrong asset and you may break multiple parts.\n\nIf your specifically after removing parts so they don\u0027t show up ingame as options, well thats more a case of trial and error really. With the exception of the 2 \u0022MKS\\_EL\\_\u0022 modules everything else (including the module that actually makes the EL Rocketparts) has a specific MKS functionality. Deleting any of them will cause a gap in your supply chain overall. Rover has put alot of work in condensing this mode down from the previous versions. I still remember my 0.25 version where a base needed something like 12 core modules just to have all the basic supply chain... Its currently down to what 4? (Hub, Kerbitat, Aeroponics, Fabricator). Thats of course just the converters not the rest of the base building tools \u0026 fuel refineries.\n\nEDIT: You might be able to drop the drills as I have noticed (at least with Karbonite \u0026 Karb\u002B) that the new stock drill seems to collect anything using the stock resource system. But i haven\u0027t had a chance to see if its also affecting MKS resources.
