You know, maybe a plague hit Kerbin, or there was a massive war, or something else entirely. Probably the massive war because there isn\u0027t a single building or artificial structure on Kerbin (except for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings) The entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is, I think, ran by some sort of either superintelligent non-Kerbolar species, or some sort of AI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why/how you can instantly get new Kerbals as astronauts. They\u0027re mere clones, created by either the aliens or AI. And that\u0027s why they\u0027re always available, don\u0027t care how cramped they are and for how long, don\u0027t need food, air, or any life supply. They are built so they don\u0027t require them. That\u0027s also how you can specify each characteristic when you spawn a kerbal via console menu. It\u0027s just the cloner UI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
