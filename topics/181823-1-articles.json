It\u0027s a simple rocket, similar to the Falcon heavy or Delta IV heavy. It has alot of DeltaV so I like to use it. What will happen is I will check my aerodynamic forces and it is below the ground, and not on the centre of the rocket. The other overlays are normal but it\u0027s always the aerodynamics. I use MechJeb and Kerbal engineer. I wasn\u0027t using the MechJeb case on this rocket. I doubt it is those mods, but if you suspect it is please tell me. Just a quick edit, unless I get out of KSP and get back in the bug will stay with any rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-30T11:37:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2019 11:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbka47A\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot to add a note\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T08:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried adding fins to the rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
