I\u0027m running AVP with all the dependencies and with all the planets I get 15-20 fps which is good. With Duna, I get approximately 1-2 fps. It\u0027s not my craft that\u0027s the issue as when I was doing a Duna mission, I hacked it to laythe. There I got good FPS. If anyone knows a way to resolve this that would be great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-26T11:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReducing quality or resolution?
