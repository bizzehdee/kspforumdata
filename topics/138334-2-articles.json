For me, they are acceptable if the majority of them gets fixed within the next month. Nothing gamebreaking. Nothing that is stopping me to enjoy ksp. Then, software is never free of bugs.

Additionally, the very nature of KSP lends itself to situations most games do not ever find themselves in, such as a ball of landing gear. Shooters usually are designed not to allow you to do anything outside a very narrow set of actions. That makes the actual coding somewhat simple. Building games are inherently difficult to create a rock solid platform that people because you are challenging the player that you\u0027ve thought of all the situations and things that can be done.
