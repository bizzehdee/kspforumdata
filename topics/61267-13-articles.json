This is because being off even by 3-10 m/s can alter your final encounter significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution, rather than trying small prograde/retrogade burns to fine tune, is to simply use RCS to fine-tune after your initial burn from Kerbin. Keep pointing prograde and fire RCS either prograde (H) or retrograde (N). You\u0027ll find that your plotted orbit changes slowly but surely and you can then fine-tune it exactly (although you may have to turn cap-locks on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I was leaving Kerbin to rendevous with my Munar space station, using RCS I was able to fine-tune my burn to get an exact perapsis at the Mun of 40K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also adjust the other parameters. It\u0027s really nice that you don\u0027t have to rotate all around, just use RCS up/down for normal/antinormal, left/right for radial in/out. Using this technique you can convert your trajectory to a polar orbit or whatever. Since you\u0027re still far even relatively small RCS firings can completely change your eventual orbit. This is a lot better and more efficient than trying to burn your main engine once you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s even better during rendevous. I had a hard time with my final tuning of encounter until I learned that the main engine, even at low thrust, is still too coarse an adjustment. It\u0027s awesome to burn RCS pro or retro and watch the encounter markers slowly move together. I can easily get my markers to 1-2 kilometers using RCS for final adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly this technique is used in RL. In Apollo the majority of mid-course corrections were made using RCS. They only used the main engine (SPS) once just so they could get data on its performance. They burned it for like 2 seconds (they called it a burp.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing RCS a lot more has really helped me in this game.

Through that though I built upon my pre-existing \u0022knowledge\u0022 of space flight and I now understand exactly what Mechjeb is doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, last month, I downloaded Mechjeb (and several other mods like KAS, the graphics mod and others). It has made my life so much easier! But I don\u0027t use it to work out the manoeuvres, I do that myself, I just get Mechjeb to do the actual burn as I find it hard (especially on that first burn to orbit) to get it done in time, to hold my heading and control the burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is certainly a useful tool, but not one that should be relied upon as it can make a mess of things - surely, one of the best moments of my gaming on KSP came from a manual landing on the Mun, even if it did topple over and trap Jeb there - a rescue mission is planned, but it may be pushed back owing to a budget crisis.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI justify using it myself as this - it\u0027s not me in the spaceship and any modern spacecraft will use computers anyway to do the actual flying, even if the manoeuvre was planned by a crew member, so I don\u0027t feel like it is \u0022cheating\u0022 in any way, in fact, it is more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stumason","CreatedById":129897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T17:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAye, it does \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E - I got by for well over a year without it and once I used it, it has made the game much less frustrating and I would recommend any new player to spend some time crashing their ships manually, then once they have got to grips with how they fly, get a hold of Mechjeb and give it a whir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also may have double-posted - I didn\u0027t realise that forum posts were pended for Mod review...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T17:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only time that two objects in space are stationary with respect to each other is when they\u0027re attached to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want absolutely zero difference between those objects, then the word rigid also enters the discussion - i.e. struts. docks offer non-rigid connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is to say, you can try to park two independent objects into orbit next to each other, but it will inevitably fail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"laythelover17","CreatedById":130302,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T22:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I learned, I it isn\u0027t broken don\u0027t fix it.
