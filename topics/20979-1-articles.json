I build myself an awesome rig some months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just that KSP doesn\u0027t feel right. space ships are too wobbly. You can feel that every part has physics. If you have a small stack of 3 fuel containers, you literary SEE the stack bend when in atmosphere, costing framerates for every pc, and especially with huge rockets with \u002B30 parts. even my pc can\u0027t handle that. And i\u0027m even forgetting about the drag of every physics object, and other stuff like thrust. Everything (Drag, physics, thrust (what is actually physics)) has to be calculated by your pc EVERY framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is that the ship becomes 1 big physics object, and every time stages split, it splits the 1 big physics object in 2 physics objects. 1 big object means that your pc has to calculate extremely less ****, so there will be much more frame rate. Everything would be the same, expect the bending. There wouldn\u0027t be any bending anymore. So that means that it becomes unrealistic? NO! in real life welded metal things don\u0027t bend too! they break, in pieces. And that is the exact thing what should happen when you don\u0027t use enough truts to secure everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo bending, extremely less physics/drag objects = Much, Much more framerate for EVERY pc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the thing what i\u0027m telling inpossible? in my mind it isn\u0027t.
