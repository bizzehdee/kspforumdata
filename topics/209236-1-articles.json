My question is, if I dock that Digger, does that violate the terms of \u0027fully assembled\u0027, since it\u0027ll be coming from a docked craft? For that matter, if I get one load with 5000 units, does it cancel the contract when it docks, before I can transfer anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caerfinon","CreatedById":207619,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-06T03:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a old reddit post that says:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I believe it just means you can\u0027t use an engineer to assemble part of it in orbit. Like putting the solar panels on after launching a module into orbit. You can still build it with multiple launches, just dont use the EVA assembly feature to put parts on like the antenna or solar panels the contract requires, launch it with them already on.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwith a reply\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is correct; I just verified myself.
