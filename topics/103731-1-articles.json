It is nice for the sort of casual observation you seem to be going for. I have done a little photography with it, and it is not that great of course, without tracking et cetera, but it works. I have visually resolved some things of interest, easily all four large Jovian moons, as well as some bands, the Red Spot, crescent of Venus, Saturn (initially found by pointing at a bright but unidentified star. That was fun), lots of craters on the Moon (who would have guessed?) and the Orion Nebula, among other targets. I have not really looked at Mars, however, which strikes me as strange.

It is now mine, and I have not used it much in the last 10 years. When building your own, learn a lesson from the Hubble; the specifications for the primary mirror are of critical importance. Be sure your intended focal length and concavity are compatible with an existing line of eyepieces, or you may need those to be custom-made as well. The primary mirror should either be special-ordered or fabricated professionally, just like a major observatory; glass grinding, polishing, and coating is by no means a DIY project anymore.
