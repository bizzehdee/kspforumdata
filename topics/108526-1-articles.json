There are other threads, but they are outdated both in version and in date.\n\nI\u0027ll start us off with the \u0022Stayputnik\u0022 probe core. \n\n***Easter Eggs for Parts***\n\n- \n\n\u003E The United States\u0027 *Vanguard* spacecraft, launched after the Soviet Union\u0027s *Sputnik*, lifted no more than a few feet before exploding. As such, many reporters nicknamed it the ***Stayputnik***. Apparently this made it into KSP.\n\n\u003E Its description reads: *The Z-200 is a stackable variant of the Z-100 battery pack, with increased capacity. In emergency situations, please refrain from* ***\u0022reversing the polarity\u0022****.*  \n\u003E This is a reference to the phrase, \u0022reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\u0022 from the popular science fiction television show *Doctor Who*.\n\n\u003E This part has a cost of **42**. Could this part be the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, as popularized by the novel *The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy*?\n\n\u003E This part\u0027s name alone seems to be a reference to the novel *The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy.*\n\n\u003E With the description: \u0022Despite the big scary trefoil painted onto the side of this engine, its radioactive exhaust, and tendency to overheat, the LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor is **harmless. Mostly.** Note that the LV-N is the only LV series engine to run solely on Liquid Fuel - the future is glowing bright!\u0022   \n\u003E This is a reference to HHGttG\u0027s Encyclopedia Galactica\u0027s entry on Earth. For centuries, the E.G.\u0027s only entry on Earth was one word long: \u0022Harmless.\u0022 That is, untill Ford Prefect visited Earth and spent years researching our planet (and drinking a lot of beer). After that, his research for the encyclopedia was accepted and the entry finally updated to the much more thorough \u0022Mostly Harmless.\u0022\n\n\u003E On this part, you can see it says \u0022Kurvy!\u0022 written on the part. Probably related to the fact it\u0027s very curvy.\n\n\u003E Its description reads: \u0022The HECS core capabilities go far beyond its sleek, 6-sided futuristic casing. This probe core provides advanced guidance assistance technology, and comes fitted with internal reaction wheels and decently-sized batteries. Despite concerns that one day, autonomous spacecraft cores could become self-aware and turn against their creators, or even become very stubborn against opening pod bay doors, Probodobodyne insists that these unmanned AI-driven devices are the way of the future.\u0022  \n\u003E In \u00222001: A Space Odyssey\u0022 HAL 9000 was an autonomous self-aware spacecraft core that turned against his creators and refused to open the pod bay doors.  \n\u003E This part\u0027s name might also be a reference to the magical computer named [Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28Discworld%29) in Terry Pratchett\u0027s Discworld.\n\n\u003E   \n\u003E The image file for the launch clamps has a picture of Clamps from Futurama hidden in it. You\u0027ll find him if you open the image in a editor (like Paint).  \n\u003E ![WfWf9uV.png](http://i.imgur.com/WfWf9uV.png)\n\n\u003E The Oscar-B Fuel Tank says \u0022Do not wash in cold water, or feed after midnight.\u0022 This is a reference to the movie, Gremlins, where getting them wet or feeding them after midnight turns the cute cuddlers into demons from hell.\n\n***Easter Eggs for Mechanics***\n\nWARNING: This section contains game mechanic spoilers, such as science collection. Do be careful. If you want to discover these on your own, please, skip this section.\n\n- \n\n\u003E Obviously a reference to 2001, A Space Odyssey, when HAL-9000 refuses to open the pod bay doors for Dave: **\u0022The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... \u0022I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t let you do that\u0022 was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.\u0022**\n\n***Loading Hints***\n\n- \n\n\u003E Another Adams egg is found when the game is loading. One of the phrases the pops up is: \u0022Finding answer to Ultimate Question\u0022 as the green loading bar progresses, and only then \u0022Finding Ultimate Question.\u0022 This is basically the plot of HHGttG. Long ago, a race of super-smart beings built the ultimate computer of all time, \u0022Deep Thought\u0022 and asked it the Ultimate Question of \u0022life, the universe and everything.\u0022 After a few millennia contemplating this question, Deep Thought revealed that the answer is 42. It further elucidated that while this is truly the correct answer, the problem was that the question was imperfectly asked. And so began the saga (trilogy of books) of the search for The Ultimate Question. The pursuit of TUQ is what caused the construction of Earth (and ultimately you and me) in the first place.\n\n\u003E A reference to this xkcd comic.
