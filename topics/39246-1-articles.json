Ladies and Kermen, I present to you Delta Aerospace! My mission: Explore the Kerbol system, establish extraterrestrial outposts, Do Science and most importantly - leave no Kerbal behind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo time was wasted in \u0027designing\u0027 a rocket, and finding a crew to man took no time at all - Jeb threatened to flush the keys to the rocket down the toilet if he, Bill and Bob didn\u0027t get to go first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight recorder went down during takeoff, however it did reestablish connection in time to catch the splendor of the new M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface from orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bbBQQBC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bbBQQBC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding was broadly textbook - the new SAS really makes gently touchdowns with zero surface velocity a breeze.

Fate was against them though, as a miscalculation left the triumphant trio stranded in an elliptic orbit around Kerbin, With electrical systems running low on charge and oxygen dwindling, it was up to Team 2 to rescue the veterans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the view up here was fantastic, the standby team were keen to rendezvous with the Mun lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YJLKMZI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YJLKMZI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing to within visual distance, the rescue team radioed the Mun team \u0022Hows the air up there?
