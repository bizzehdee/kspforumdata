It\u0027s a bad deal to keep a small pool of [plasmatic] liquid fuel superheated, and you don\u0027t want that heat to build up in the reactor mechanism itself, so when the engine burns are complete, the reactors are indeed shut down in a hurry. Thus SCRAMmed would be appropriate, regardless of the true etymology of\u00A0the term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScrubbing, the term I used, could of course be used for\u00A0canceling a reaction, or for canceling anything [quickly]. Though I can\u0027t guarantee it\u0027s in use in the nuclear community at all, in my mind a reaction that has been deliberately and intentionally stopped/reduced has been \u0022scrubbed,\u0022 regardless of how fast it was done. (Don\u0027t know where I picked it up, I blame college.)\u00A0Also, I used it as a deliberate synonym as SCRAM has become more associated with emergency actions. (We\u0027d be having this same conversation both ways, I suppose.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it\u0027s my reactor design itself that might be a bit on the odd or dangerous side..... It\u0027s the fission you want to stop, and quickly, so I see a design with\u00A0a moveable control mass\u00A0(as normal, to absorb the neutrons and various\u00A0other bits they need to absorb to maintain criticality), and\u00A0a radioactive\u00A0core that can be split\u00A0to bring the\u00A0mass back below critical. (The core would then be a \u0022ring\u0022\u00A0into which a\u00A0\u0022rod\u0022 is inserted to achieve or balance\u00A0criticality along with the control mass.... Whether the ring or the rod is the moveable element is up for debate.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechanically this is probably a bad thing, as 1) more moving parts in an already complex thing, and 2) the fuel in a solid-core NTR will be eroded by its very use (well, any radioactive\u00A0core will be), as will everything in the reactor, so having 1/2 to\u00A02/3 of the radioactive\u00A0mass attached to a moveable piece means that moveable piece may break free at some point. NTRs\u00A0place nuclear reactors into their worst possible environment and then proceed to abuse them some more, so my extra complexities are idealistic at best and malpractice or kerbslaughter\u00A0at worst.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-11T22:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2016 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdit: Cleaned up overloaded nomenclature....\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviosAdku","CreatedById":165040,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T22:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnderstood, thanks for the explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Railgunner2160","CreatedById":67181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T01:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269224\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cydonian Monk\u003C/a\u003E I don\u0027t think your ideas are too far fetched, current reactors use movable control rods made of Neutron Poisoning Materials. One possible solution for your concepts is instead of movable control rods you use movable fuel rods instead. When you wish to make the reactor \u0022safe\u0022 between burns such as the period of travel between planets you retract the fuel rods into a mass of Neutron Poisoning Materials. Thus the fuel rods that make up the reactor are the only major moving parts aside from the fuel pumps needed to circulate the hydrogen fuel. Such a design has the benefit of the rods being protected during a impact event by the very material the regulates the rate of fission in the nuclear material, the risk of the fuel rods being damaged when retracted could conceivably make such a design safer during journeys between planets since most of the risk occurs during burns when the rods are extended during a active burn relying on the NTR\u0027s casing as shielding from any impacts....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T10:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last posts have more level than lots of the threads of the science subforum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviosAdku","CreatedById":165040,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T12:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should have seen the reaction to Kerbfleet: a Jool Odyssey\u0027s interlude (the part over Eve\u00A0just after the crossover).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T04:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour Robots Are \u003Cs\u003EWatching\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Ignoring You\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160703-ksp0223-k2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160703-ksp0223-k2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs predicted, the Potassium 2 reestablished ship-to-ship communications with the Jumble of Parts shortly after passing Bop\u0027s orbit. One last check of the ship\u0027s systems showed the originally intended capture burn was still programmed in and ready to go.

There are (at least) two control points in this universe - Kerbin/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and Kelgee Station, as Kelgee has more than 6 kerbals aboard and the required electronics.

Neither did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA positive link was present using three different paths: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-NeonHeavy-Argon-Potassium1, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-NeonHeavy-Argon-Potassium2-Scandium1, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-NeonHeavy-Argon-Potassium2-Scandium2. (Both Sc-1 and Sc-2 are still moored to the K-2, but the links were active and working.) All nodes in this control link were listed as active, the K-2 had a green \u0022RemoteTech\u0022 time delay box with a signal delay of 276 seconds, and I was able to send instructions to the K-2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the Ca-6? Not so much. Red text all the way. No matter what I tried, even linking the Ca-6\u0027s ship-to-ship 50Mm dish to the K-1 or the K-2 (using the \u0022Force Antennas\u0022 cheat in RemoteTech), nothing would let it show as connected. Nothing. The network pathfinding simply refused to work. So I disabled RemoteTech and pressed on with the initial deployments and reenabled it once everything was in its intended transfer orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat crisis averted, next the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and other core action groups stopped responding.

Time until burn: 30 minutes. (Which would take place while theJumble of Parts and its crew were in the dark on the far side of Laythe.) Macfred next deployed the first of the Scandium communications satellites and the remaining probes for the outer moons, as the sooner that was done the better. Again, all four were kicked away from the K-2 by a bit of rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160705-ksp0247-ca-swarm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160705-ksp0247-ca-swarm.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll six of the Calcium probes would enter into polar orbits over their chosen moons, and would do nothing but map the surface until the team was content with the data they had retrieved. Once the mapping and other science tasks are complete, their science instruments will be shut down and\u00A0all six will turn into communications relays\u00A0(assuming their RTGs still have enough energy to power said comms relays). At least that\u0027s the plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Scandium 1, the first of their three main trunk commsats, was scheduled to boost out to a very high Jool orbit (reaching its apoapsis around the start of the new year), where it would perform a plane-change burn to enter into a 25 degree orbit. (As inclined against Laythe.)\u00A0Afterwards it would drop down in between Tylo and Vall\u0027s orbits and complete its capture burn there. As it was somewhat close to Tylo there was (and still is) some concern that the Scandium 1\u00A0might be perturbed by the giant moon, but near-term projections show its desired orbit\u00A0to be stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe subsequent capture burns also had to be dialed into the four science probes, as most of them would be well out of range until the K-3 arrived with the last of their communications satellites. In some cases it would be more than two munths before the crew was even aware of the success or failure of the eight robots. Very much autonomous exploration. A bit nerve-wracking, to be honest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe initial deployment and transfer burns all took place on day 403 of year 99.

Three things would happen here: The K-2 would burn to bring its periapsis down to Laythe\u0027s orbit and a Laythe intercept, the Scandium 2 communications satellite would be released into its high-orbit transfer, and the two science satellite for Laythe would be deployed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe K-2 went first, on day 407 of year 99:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160707-ksp0285-k2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160707-ksp0285-k2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResulting in a close-approach to Laythe with a periapsis of some 82km.

A considerable burn boosted it upwards into a 250Mm transfer orbit, at the top of which it would circularize and (hopefully) provide (spotty) coverage to the two outer moons. [This was a late change on my part, as I had originally intended to use Laythe to boost the satellite\u0027s orbit, but decided there would already be too much going on at the same time with K-2 and the two science probes capturing.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this discharging and tumbling about produced ever more lines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160707-ksp0296_lines.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160707-ksp0296_lines.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMIRV, baby.

Had I\u00A0sent all of the probes alone, none of them would have had radio contact at Jool unless the commsat was sent first... a logistics issue that has a solution, yes, but is also solved by the tug/carrier approach.

Individual probes would need transfer drives of their own, etc., and the extra drives may or may not be reuseable or cheaper. Or lower mass. I\u0027m not sure, as I designed the mission around interchangeable reusable tugs for shoving payloads out to Jool with a minimal cost for return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a mass/cost analyisis in this somewhere I could perform to see if the tug/carrier approach really was cheaper. Kind of like the moon lander math for direct ascent vs LOR. If the mass of the direct ascent\u00A0is more than the mass of the lunar lander \u002B orbiter for the same mission profile, then you don\u0027t choose direct ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably a better way to do this is to use some sort of weird cycler orbit where the tug doesn\u0027t capture at Jool;\u00A0or even a post-transfer\u00A0swingback, like such: Stage 1 tug burns to place payload into Jool intercept orbit; Payload is jettisoned and stage 1 tug uses M\u00FCn flyby and a \u0022detransfer\u0022 burn to return to Kerbin/M\u00FCn\u00A0orbit; Payload has a disposable stage 2 for capture at Jool (most likely with a giant heat shield so craft can both aerocapture and maneuver).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027d rather\u00A0have the three sets of transfer/capture burns for the tugs vs fifteen or sixteen such burns had I sent all of these pieces individually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wildcat111","CreatedById":165926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-15T15:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw Kerbin and Duna in the second last update!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-15T15:33:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2016 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wildcat111\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-15T16:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269224\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@Cydonian Monk\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I had the same problem with Remote Tech on a Mun probe.
