Once your circumnavigation begins... which begins with the launch pad in many cases... you cannot use it.\n\nAlso, I was just made aware of another mod coming out that will supposedly move boats across water at their maximum speed while you\u0027re off doing other things. You set the destination and it goes. It too will be disallowed. Mods like Mechjeb or, my solution, Autohotkey, which hold down the \u0027W\u0027 key for you are fine. Leaving the keyboard for brief periods while the \u0027cruise control\u0027 is active is fine as long as your ability to wreck/crash isn\u0027t thwarted. I haven\u0027t played with the scripting mod but I\u0027m assuming it just navigates and doesn\u0027t make you invulnerable while doing so. \n\nI say again, it\u0027s about the journey, not the destination. Anything that eliminates portions of or makes the journey less dangerous, should not be considered. No risk, no reward. And to be honest, Kerbal join reinforcement makes my skin itch but for now... I\u0027m turning a blind eye.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t seem to be in the Mun list yet, I\u0027m afraid.\n\nYou are now! And I thought the rover I made for Eve was big. I stand humbled. Welcome to the exclusive list of true circumnavigators. My apologies for the delay in this recognition.\n\n* * *\n\nOk, a brief explanation. As I mentioned previously, modding is absorbing a lot of my free time these days. I do check most of my subscribed links every day or two and this thread is definitely one of them. But, when I pop into this thread, it\u0027s usually a quick scan. Periodically, unique solutions will grab my attention for a brief time and when I do come to actually update, I take the time to read the progress being made a bit more in-depth. So, with that explanation offered, if you complete a circumnavigation and I miss it. **BIG BOLD LETTERS**, will usually grab my attention when I come to scan. Otherwise, you may be waiting for my \u0027update\u0027 visit.\n\nTrust me, I just sent a huge WOT message to someone describing exactly why this challenge exists: Because in KSP, once you reach your final destination you suddenly realize, there\u0027s nothing left to do. It\u0027s all about the journey getting there.\n\nWhile I may not get around to it as quickly as I should, I will maintain this challenge for as long as you guys wish to keep driving in circles.\n\nThat, and one of the reasons I really started modding, I had a dream of sailing around Kerbin... yes, sails. And one day, I just might do that and I\u0027d like to have a place to put it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is anyone else having problems with their craft slowly becoming laggier and laggier?\n\u003E I\u0027m at about 40 degrees north right now, the craft has about two days on the mission timer.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s infuriating, I can hardly progress, because the lowered framerate is eating into my reaction time to correct for terrain deviations and other mishaps.\n\nalt-f12.\n\nAnything in the debug log?\n\n* * *\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve gone back pages to see if there\u0027s anyone I\u0027ve missed. I also corrected some goofs on the completion list but not sure if I chopped someone out.\n\nIf you should be on the list, please check. If you are not, please say so and I\u0027ll get you added.

This way, you can define any starting point you wish, plant a flag there if you like, then all you have to do is flag the antipode and come back the other way around. Another simple way would be start point - pole - other pole - start point (or any two antipodes for that matter).\n\nDoing this method ensures that no matter what route you take between your target points, you will by definition have travelled at least the full circumference of the body you\u0027re on, so you\u0027re free to drive around obstacles, or drive right up to obstacles if you want to take them on, as you choose.\n\nOf course there are other methods to prove circumnavigation but taking this method should make the distance travelled indisputable."},{"CreatedByName":"KN_Namida","CreatedById":90069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T13:48:06Z","Content":"Any penalties for driving more than needed?\n\nThe rules state that you should follow an equatorial or pole-to-pole route, without diverging too much.
