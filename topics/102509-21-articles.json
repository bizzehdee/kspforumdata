You set the destination and it goes. It too will be disallowed. Mods like Mechjeb or, my solution, Autohotkey, which hold down the \u0027W\u0027 key for you are fine. Leaving the keyboard for brief periods while the \u0027cruise control\u0027 is active is fine as long as your ability to wreck/crash isn\u0027t thwarted. I haven\u0027t played with the scripting mod but I\u0027m assuming it just navigates and doesn\u0027t make you invulnerable while doing so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say again, it\u0027s about the journey, not the destination. Anything that eliminates portions of or makes the journey less dangerous, should not be considered. No risk, no reward. And to be honest, Kerbal join reinforcement makes my skin itch but for now...

As I mentioned previously, modding is absorbing a lot of my free time these days. I do check most of my subscribed links every day or two and this thread is definitely one of them. But, when I pop into this thread, it\u0027s usually a quick scan. Periodically, unique solutions will grab my attention for a brief time and when I do come to actually update, I take the time to read the progress being made a bit more in-depth.

This way, you can define any starting point you wish, plant a flag there if you like, then all you have to do is flag the antipode and come back the other way around.
