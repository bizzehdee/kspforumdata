It depends on circumstances and if somebody use them they obey very strict safety regulation. The most hazardous chemical I have used is hydrofluoric acid. It is nothing compared to extremities mentioned in this discussion but it is easy to achieve very painful death if you make stupid things with it. Other nasty things are organometallic compounds but I have just controlled their flows with computer controlled valves in secured pipelines. If there had been a leak, gas detectors would have alarmed and ventilation would have suck gases. I and everybody else would have left the building and properly equipped service team would have solved the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
