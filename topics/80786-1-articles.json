An easy way to do this would be to transfer to Jool, go in (low) Jool orbit and then make a transfer to Pol. This is rather fuel-expensive, and I have read somewhere that you could go to Pol without a (low) Jool orbit. Unfortunately, it didn\u0027t mention a link to a tutorial. I couldn\u0027t really find one myself either, even not a more abstract interplanetary moon mission tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody of you know how to do a more fuel-effecient mission to Pol?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll help is highly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-05T16:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2014 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ianr15\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T09:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t go \u0022low\u0022 and that is all the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst fuel economy comes from the point that you have to stop your ship from escaping Jool orbit. There are few ways to do this and you can think of your own too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. We can call it straight. Lower Jool Pe up to some 200km and at the Pe point burn till you have the orbit. Lower Pe as early as you can so it will require just a few dV. You can have elliptical orbit and catch-up with Pol at some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Silliest thing Kerbals ever invented - Aerobraking. Similar to 1st. Except that you lower your Pe to ~100km and do not require to retro-burn at Pe. Then just sit and pray. You get fun and fuel savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Super hard but even more fuel saving - ahead body meeting. I think this is what NASA does. Idea is to meet a heavy Mun (Laythe, Vall, Tylo) heading at you. This maneuver will put you in any orbit you want with minimum fuel use and in safe way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommon principles are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The earlier you burn the less fuel is required;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burn to raise your orbit at Pe, burn to lower your orbit at Ap;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ianr15","CreatedById":104140,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T09:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much DrMonte for your reply.

It\u0027s big and far from Jool). Do this after you\u0027ve done the Normal burn. You can do it right after you complete that and it\u0027ll probably only cost a few m/s of dV. Just keep playing with the PreciseNode \u002B/- buttons while focused on Jool, and watch how they affect your ship\u0027s trajectory. Keep it near Tylo\u0027s orbit and as you change the time of arrival eventually you\u0027ll get a Tylo intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen thrust limit your engine down and make that maneuver burn as precisely as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ianr15","CreatedById":104140,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T09:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for your reply 5thHorseMan.

Just set up your trajectory so it misses Jool with periapsis at approximately Pol\u0027s orbital altitude. If you\u0027re lucky (or smart) you can even set up direct encounter with Pol as you can change the time of arrival to the system by weeks using radial burns. If you\u0027re not coming in Jool\u0027s equatorial plane, though, you may want to use Tylo gravity slingshot to align your inclination with Pol\u0027s first. Or you can just align the plane during your braking maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T11:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ianr15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ianr15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anybody of you know how to do a more fuel-effecient mission to Pol?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that a direct entry into Pol orbit is the most fuel efficient, because you have to do always do your entry burn, otherwise you\u0027ll just fly right out of Pol orbit and then Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, it\u0027s super hard to hit Pol because of the inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient is probably a Tylo slingshot with or without a Jool aerobraking maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T12:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kobymaru\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kobymaru\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to know more about that.

Kasuha and 5th Horseman have basically already ansered how to do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Set up \u0026amp; execute Jool encounter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 leave Kerbin SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 twiddle and tweak with manouvers until you get an encounter with your destination moon. Delta-V changes are probably miniscule; consider using RCS instead of your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically the same as setting up an encounter with a planet, but requires much higher precision -- even with tools like precise node, you may be twddling and fiddling for a long time until you get the encounter you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike 5th Horseman, I suggest you don\u0027t even try to hit Pol. Pol is a tiny target. Go for the much bigger Tylo instead. Transferring from Tylo to Pol is comparatively cheap. Also, once in orbit around any Joolian moon, you have the others to give you gravity assists. The Joolian system is like a pinball machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd keep in mind Variant 2: goo to Jool, aerobrake, and do not enter into a low circular orbit. Remain in an highly eccentric orbit. That costs you less than 100m/s so far. Then wait for an opportunity to present itself... it won\u0027t be long. You should be able to get to Pol with less than 1000m/s, probably much less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ianr15","CreatedById":104140,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T16:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for all your answers. I used a combination of your answers, but the general method was Laie\u0027s variant number 2 (or the equivalent suggestions from other people.) I got to Pol without having to spend ridiculous amounts of delta v. I had a special reason to go to Pol, so I didn\u0027t go to Tylo, which would indeed have been a lot easier. 100 percent mission succes, so I will mark this thread as answered.
