A connector for the two parts on their bottom together will come with the Heatshields ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf I could make a suggestion, I\u0027d also love to see a *perpendicular* adapter to 2.5m parts. This could lead in awesome tower-style drilling, fuel, or C\u0026C style rigs with base stations beneath. I\u0027m using 2x2 Structural Panels in the middle of my current base, and it works, I guess, but it\u0027s just not the same, you know? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I\u0027m thinking something like your container bay, just without the middle ridgeline, and the nodes on the floor of the structure. Possibly some bracing in the corners for landing gear around what\u0027s likely to be a heavy item? Of course, you might just strap rockets to it instead...\n\nSince you\u0027ve been pretty agressive with providing attachment nodes (which is brilliant!), if you rigged it to have 4x 1m nodes as well, you could end up with all kinds of crazy kerbal industrial assemblies for stuff that thus doesn\u0027t so desperately need a million individual attachment nodes.\n\nOther thoughts - the previously mentioned cargo bay (With sides that unfold to ramps, maybe?) and heat shield 2.5m double-adapter for space shuttling will be highly anticipated, too. You\u0027ve done an incredible job, though, and I must thank you for finally nailing a space hab I want to send places."},{"CreatedByName":"edy31415","CreatedById":147592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:22:32Z","Content":"I know it was made for Land.
