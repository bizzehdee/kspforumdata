Go google that.\n\nEdit: Just searched it and couldn\u0027t find anything but dV and engines comparing charts.

You can only have so many three-star contracts open at the same time, depending on rep. No guarantees that an exploration contract appears as soon as possible... but without a free slot in the highest tier, it won\u0027t show up at all.\n\nThe easiest way to bolster reputation are the VIPs to Kerbin orbit.
