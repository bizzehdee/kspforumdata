It doesn\u0027t seem to me this is WAD, and I need to know what\u0027s happening here if I\u0027m going to feature this mod in videos.\u003Cp\u003EMy stack designs typically put the next engine in the stack to ignite before the stage below is separated, so that we have a situation where the next engine in the stack is firing before and during the actual separation of the stage which approaches fuel out. With this design paradigm, for some reason the next engine in the stack is igniting and firing, but the moment decouple happens the engine which has ignited and should be now the main engine immediately shuts off and goes into an unstable fuel state. I\u0027ve tried different combinations - a traditional separation and fire in the same stage activation, firing the engine simultaneously with separation; adding a standard decoupler, etc. Result is always the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : It may be that the 2nd Stage engine is shutting down because of a large difference in TWR between the booster stage and the second stage, with the second stage having a much lower one. This would induce instability in a low or no pressure tank - and stock fuels do not simulate pressurization. Still waiting for comment from the dev.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : attaching radial monoprops to the 2nd stage, and firing them before attempting to ignite the 2nd stage seems to work reliably. Possibly the issue here is WAD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s strange, I\u0027ve designed many rockets that ignite the next stage before decoupling (e.g. a rocket that imitates Proton-M which ignites the 2nd stage before 1/2 sep) with EI and have no such problem. Anyway I will do a test to check this again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I cannot reproduce on my side... perhaps because the 1st stage\u0027s final TWR is not extremely high...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T15:53:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
