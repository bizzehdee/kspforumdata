More drills do produce more but it is more efficient to add an engineer. Running out of power is definitely a problem, 2000\u002B electric per drill probably. Heating I never encounter but it is also a concern. I made one that had a rover for the mining part but misaligned the docking port so I lost mobility. Location make a difference to use the scanning parts to pick a good spot and a rover to find the best spot for ore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get a better boost from experienced engineers. You can always change the out if you land a ship near by or even dock with it with you refueling lander ( if it had a crew capsule on it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your playing career, do a lot of rescue missions and you will have many engineers to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you give me more info on how you play and what your objectives are I can offer more suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped some.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brettuzzi","CreatedById":144709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T23:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s likely that your limiting factor will be electricity, not drills -- at least, if you want to mine through the night.

Adding power to last through the night doubles your output again. Adding a total noob engineer gives you 7x the output and adding a three-star one - 17x. So for a typical setup of two drills, that sits idle through the night and runs at full power on two gigantors through the day, you\u0027d need 17 drills and either 340 RTGs or at least some 25 gigantors and 1337 largest batteries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr 34 drills and some 50 gigantors to get the same output without mining at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, you won\u0027t ever break even with fuel cell arrays without the engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers are paid for this, they are there to oversee the machinery and make sure it works best.
