If i put say 6 drills in the same vessel, will i get more ore? provided i keep them all powered, obviously.

More drills do produce more but it is more efficient to add an engineer. Running out of power is definitely a problem, 2000\u002B electric per drill probably. Heating I never encounter but it is also a concern. I made one that had a rover for the mining part but misaligned the docking port so I lost mobility. Location make a difference to use the scanning parts to pick a good spot and a rover to find the best spot for ore.\n\nYou get a better boost from experienced engineers. You can always change the out if you land a ship near by or even dock with it with you refueling lander ( if it had a crew capsule on it). \n\nIf your playing career, do a lot of rescue missions and you will have many engineers to use.\n\nIf you give me more info on how you play and what your objectives are I can offer more suggestion.\n\nHope this helped some."},{"CreatedByName":"brettuzzi","CreatedById":144709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T23:31:21Z","Content":"It\u0027s likely that your limiting factor will be electricity, not drills -- at least, if you want to mine through the night. The drills use 15 electricity per second and a Minmus night lasts 6 hours."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T00:20:18Z","Content":"Indeed.\n\nYou need a touch over 4 fuel cell arrays to power 3 drills and an ISRU at full bore. The number of drills needed to supply a ISRU fully will vary with with ore percent, but the mass does not scale well."},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T02:04:21Z","Content":"Thanks guys! i have no problem warping through the night so i just add plenty of gigantors. I play Career, currently i have 16 kerbals but only 4 engineers, and had to buy the 4th. Got unlucky with the rescues! but i maxed out science already so maybe i\u0027ll buy another engineer and be done."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T05:27:47Z","Content":"Note doubling your drills doubles your output. Adding power to last through the night doubles your output again. Adding a total noob engineer gives you 7x the output and adding a three-star one - 17x. So for a typical setup of two drills, that sits idle through the night and runs at full power on two gigantors through the day, you\u0027d need 17 drills and either 340 RTGs or at least some 25 gigantors and 1337 largest batteries. \n\nOr 34 drills and some 50 gigantors to get the same output without mining at night.\n\nAnd no, you won\u0027t ever break even with fuel cell arrays without the engineer.\n\nThe engineers are paid for this, they are there to oversee the machinery and make sure it works best. It\u0027s their job.\n\nOh, and at 3 stars you\u0027re above the break-even point for running off fuel cells.\n\nOf course you can always take the idle approach and just accept your operation is going to be *sloooow* or take to mining asteroids. Considering top ore concentrations on Minmus don\u0027t exceed 10% and a very poor asteroid has maybe 80% ore, doing it without an engineer will still yield 8x the ore."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T09:58:46Z","Content":"If you don\u0027t want to leave a kerbal there, use a probe core instead."},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T17:48:44Z","Content":"Does the engineer have to be in the ship doing the mining, would a near by EVA work?

Doesn\u0027t need to be a command pod - the ship may run off a probe core, just the engineer must be in the crew rooster.\n\nOf course the engineer can go on EVA to fix nearby wheels/landing legs, or pick a surface sample or do some sightseeing... the drills will just run at reduced efficiency for the duration.\n\nConsidering that with an experienced engineer you\u0027re likely to outpace your ISRUs with mining speed by a considerable margin, there will be no loss to fuel production as it will run off the ore tanks."}]}
