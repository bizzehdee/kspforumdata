Moons other than the Mun or Minmus can have their parent planet\u0027s song playing upon landing. Thoughts on this? Should I approach this in a different way?

I\u0027m a bit wary of songs being played as soon as a ship touches down, because I frequently bugger my landings and hop into the air a little bit. This would cause the music to start, play for a fraction of a second, stop as the vehicle left the ground, and start again, which would be a little strange. Maybe the plugin would wait for a second or two to be sure that the craft was fully landed, or only play music when the ship had landed and the engine was off.

That being said, I wouldn\u0027t mind making a song for being out past the orbit of Eeloo, though it probably won\u0027t happen until I\u0027ve made songs for the planets and moons.

I did get a chance to take a look at these songs, and while I feel that they\u0027re a little too \u0027harsh\u0027 for the gameplay atmosphere I\u0027m going for, they\u0027re still really great. I think that the second one is actually eerily similar to what I wanted to do with JOOL, though with fewer \u0022pneumatic\u0022 noises towards the beginning \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. JOOL is going to feature pretty much every single instrument that I can find, and if I do it right (there\u0027s a chance of that happening, right?) it\u0027ll be \u003Cem\u003Eepic\u003C/em\u003E. I\u0027ll keep these songs in mind when composing, and I\u0027m going to be sure to give you some quality percussion. (DRES, however, would likely be better plain.)\u003Cp\u003EI would give you the unfinished version of Dres, but unfortunately, copying files from my Mac to my PC is always such a pain, I only want to do it once. Sorry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly (see the above post), I\u0027ll start the final push for getting DRES done first thing tomorrow. Thanks for the kind wishes.

Yeah those songs are a bit shall I say, \u0027more serious\u0027 than KSP music probably should be. Blizzy is the plugin going to have an easy way to add your own music if wanted? It would be cool to be able to set your own \u0027theme\u0027 that plays when you safely land. DRES should definitely be plain. To eerie for anything rigid. I\u0027ll be listening from the gloom... *creepily fades into a dark corner*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T08:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBlizzy is the plugin going to have an easy way to add your own music if wanted?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, that should be possible through a configuration file or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
