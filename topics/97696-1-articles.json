It was my favorite thing I had ever built, and I would often fly it around Kerbin just for funsies. The thing is, it did none of the above things very well. The cargo bay was small, it fell short of making it half way around the planet without Kethane refueling, it was pretty hard to get into orbit although it was also my first attempt at an SSTO so looking back now it was more my piloting that made it difficult than the craft itself but it only barely had enough oxidizer to JUST make it to orbit anyway. The extensive Kethane capabilities were for if I needed to refuel a stranded vessel but with such a poor range itself and I think only like 2000 units of Kethane storage, it wasn\u0027t very good at that either.

I started building them shortly after Scott Manley\u0027s Reusable Space Program revealed to me just how incredibly good the LV-N was as a landing engine, and once I switched over to reusing landers instead of doing one-time landings, it became my go-to lander for Munlike worlds and lighter. The lander has about 2.5 km/s of delta-v, which gives a lot of freedom for landing on Minmus-like worlds, and reasonable freedom for Mun-class worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Cheddar-Class.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cheddar-Class.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The class is named because using Radial attachment points to clip the red-hot bells of the LV-Ns into the cryogenic fuel tanks is a bit cheesy, and as a result, every Cheddar-class lander has been named after a cheese. The one on the left is probably the prototype STV Cheddar. Others have included the STVs Caravane, Bergkase, Herve, Limburger, Passendale, Brie, Gruyere, Muenster, Neufchatel, Roquefort, Port Salut, Tilsit, Feta, Casu Marzu, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, Ricotta, Jarlsberg, Velveeta, Fileta, Emmental...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary difference between the 0.19 version and the 0.90 version is the use of the Clamp-o-Tron Sr Docking port on the top instead of a Clamp-o-Tron. This allows the lander to automatically draw fuel from a Rockomax-Jumbo based Cantanker, which I typically launch with the lander. As a result, I\u0027ve sent Cheddar-class landers to Gilly, The Mun, Minmus, Ike, Dres, Pol, Bop, and Eeloo. The 0.90 verions also has an RC-001S 1m probe brain instead of the Probodobodyne OKTO-2, and has modulemanaged 20 units of KAS Storage into the Landercan and 40 in the Hitchhiker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T16:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Standard Interplanetary Modular Ship System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uc1J8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
