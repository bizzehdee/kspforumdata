I got pretty bored in these days, so I tried making some pixelarts. Here are two examples.\n\nThis is an Airbus A330-200 (RR Trent 700 engines) made from scratch. I used blueprints, and some of my photos as reference. 1 meter is roughly 3 pixels.\n\n![4wzXFfb.png](http://i.imgur.com/4wzXFfb.png)\n\nAnd this is a Nikon camera (it started out as a D7100), and a flash (an SB-600, maybe?).\n\n![k0hhQf8.png](http://i.imgur.com/k0hhQf8.png)![be8fbcC.png](http://i.imgur.com/be8fbcC.png)\n\nI find creating pixelart a fun way to \u0022waste\u0022 time.
