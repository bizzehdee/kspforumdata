I\u0027m fooling around with SCANsat for the first time - could anyone please tell me what the icon with \u0022LA\u0022 in it, to the very right of the screen, does? I notice it orients my craft when I press it and occasionally a window pops up with biome data, but can\u0027t quite figure it out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLink to example:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MtcN7zz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/MtcN7zz\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weebastardman","CreatedById":135164,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T15:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo-one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T17:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using scansat for a long time and I\u0027ve never noticed an associated LA icon in the toolbar.
