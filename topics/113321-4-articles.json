After a few \u0027simulations\u0027 it became clear there wasn\u0027t going to be any sane way of getting all that payload up there without the mainsail engine. My intent was to take several crew (and one tourist who wanted to orbit Minmus to finish the contract) to boost their XP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to use my unmanned Mun lander rocket to get some science, and stick a Kerbal in it. I knew if it could land on the Mun, it should be able to reach, land and leave Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making a few minor adjustments, adding Val, I set off for Minmus.

Like I said, this was originally an unmanned design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn unmanned design that was never meant to return from the Mun. I\u0027d set it up to be able to take and send back science, so if I ever got \u0022transmit science from the surface of the Mun\u0022 contracts, I still had a capable vessel there to do it immediately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now you\u0027re probably ahead of me, we\u0027ve all done it at some point I\u0027m sure. What do you not need on a vessel that is not intended to return? Parachutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I had left and reloaded the game before landing on Minmus, so the \u0022revert flight\u0022 option was not available to me, but that\u0027s okay, reverting is not the Kerbal way not with all this science. Fortunately, with the rocket being designed for Mun landing, there was quite a lot of fuel in the lander part left. So using it sparingly at first to help slow me down, then going all out to land I did manage to make a safe, if violent landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis only issue I had is that the landing was at 10m/s - which to me seems way too fast. In previous versions I\u0027m sure most if not all would have been lost. It could be a mod that affected this, I\u0027m not sure.
