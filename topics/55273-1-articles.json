First off, I want to clarify that I do indeed think that KSP is an awesome game (my favorite ever) and I believe that the devs have done an AMAZING job at making it. (I am getting in to game design myself and I have really developed a respect for these guys considering how hard it is)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that Minimus is the only body in the Kerbal system that lacks an atmosphere while at the same time, has no craters. This makes no sense because in real life, there are meteors floating about everywhere in the solar system, whacking things at random, and making a crater there if there is no atmosphere to stop it. I thing re-modeling Minimus to include some craters would be nice, but I still quite like the unique terrain it has, and a better option would probably be to come up with some excuse as to why that moon is so smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I would like to recommend is ice caps on Laythe, temperature readings on the surface of Laythe currently don\u0027t depend on your latitude, but they are almost always a few degrees above freezing, this would make sense on the equator, but logically, the poles would be below freezing and the water would freeze, forming ice caps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see anything I just mentioned in KSP, then comment and say so, if you like the game as is and think my ideas suck, say that too, I want this to be a 2 sided discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T07:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice that Minmus is apparently mostly ice or snow.

The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is a larger target by just a little more than an order of magnitude, by chance alone, we would expect Minmus to be struck about 1/10 as frequently as the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT! The story doesn\u0027t end there, now does it? Minmus also has extremely low gravity, even in its immediate vicinity. Due to it\u0027s low gravity, it\u0027s not able to alter the course of rogue asteroids enough to cause collisions, where as the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s gravitation (and probably Kerbin\u0027s gravitation, as well) is more able to alter the course of asteroids and pull them into collisions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat probably happens is that any asteroids that enter the Kerbin system and spend enough time there to make them likely to hit \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E are usually sucked up by and collide with either Kerbin or the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, letting Minmus tootle along is nice little elliptical orbit, doing it\u0027s tasty, tasty thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to recap: Tiny target \u002B low gravity \u002B big brothers = Safety from asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T09:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, almost anything that might hit Minmus is much more likely to hit the Mun or Kerbin instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd any icecap on Laythe would because of the tidal forces exerted on it by Jool (and the other moons of Jool, especially Tylo) be ripped to small bits rather quickly, floating on the oceans of Laythe until they melt (seeing Laythe\u0027s average surface temperature being slightly above freezing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe in time KSP can have icebergs and ocean currents, but there\u0027s a lot more important things to do than develop those just on the off chance that someone might be able to land something on an iceberg and have it float around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T10:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are already polar ice-caps on laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T10:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikeman7918\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mikeman7918\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI noticed that Minimus is the only body in the Kerbal system that lacks an atmosphere while at the same time, has no craters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo, Vall, Bop, Pol, and Gilly don\u0027t have discernible craters either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you that ice caps on Laythe are way too small for its distance from Sun.
