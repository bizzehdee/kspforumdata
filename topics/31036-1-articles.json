But I\u0027m fairly certain my rocket is too good for just getting to Mun. Contains parts from the KW Rocketry pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/knMd36T.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022knMd36T.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing is a monster and I didn\u0027t even know. It wiggles on the launch pad, it shudders violently in flight. I\u0027m too scared to execute a gravity turn with it, not even sure if it\u0027s capable of one and once it\u0027s in space it has all the manueverability of boulder in mollasses. But it has such huge fuel reserves that I can get the main tank over to Mun with 1K fuel left, despite the huge hits to fuel efficiency this thing experiences from flying through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere like a drunken rocket ship. I can\u0027t even use all the fuel in the nuclear engine so I just toss it aside as I close in for a landing. It\u0027s brute force with no regards for efficiency but it gets the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to properly use this rocket for something bigger than a measly 1 kerbal lander, what could I do with it? How much more mileage could I get from this if I actually use gravity turns and pay attention to how fast I\u0027m going as to not hit terminal velocity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T04:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell first off, are you turning off the gimbal on the outer engines before launching? This might be what causes it to be so wobbly and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, if that was the case, there\u0027s really no reason to use the heavy KW Rocketry struts, normal ones will do just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the wing parts you added don\u0027T have any control surface. Your best bet for large rockets are the R8 winglets (I think its their name).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for how far you could go, depends on your payload really.
