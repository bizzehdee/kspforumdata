I used this \u0027gravity braking\u0027 technique once when returning a spacecraft from Sun orbit back to Kerbin. I slung around both Minmus and the Mun (many trajectory corrections (and some \u0022extra fuel\u0022) required) from the leading side, to slow myself into a parking orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the jettisoned radials, they should change SOIs just the same as your own vessel. I\u0027m guessing you jettisoned them early on, which meant they drifted away from you for a long time before you did the unplanned slingshot. Even though their initial relative velocity to you was low, over a full orbit, that can mean many kms of separation, and that can be just enough to miss an encounter.... It\u0027s hard to tell what happened to them, but if you have debris enabled, they should still be there, on an eccentric Kerbin orbit somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olsson","CreatedById":20218,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T14:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this means if I escape the Mun\u0027s SOI from the side it is moving I while have gained speed?
