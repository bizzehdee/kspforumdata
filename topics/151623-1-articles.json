Now, even sitting on the launch pad, if I switch map views, several symptoms appear. None of my other projects have this problem. The project contains 76 parts in 6 stages. It\u0027s smaller than most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The graphics get very weird, e.g. the screen is mostly black and the sun is only an outline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Switching back does nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.
