I am almost 19, and currently going through the local Fire Program at my college. I hope one day to be a Fire Fighter. I am currently an E.M.T. I love to talk about history, read, learn about machines, technology, and the such. I have thought about designing a few mods, but with no experience, besides minimal C\u002B\u002B knowledge, that probably won\u0027t happen (unless there is a Modding KSP for Dummies guide out there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if it is at all possible to change my forum name; I apparently was confused when i signed up and put my shorthand E-mail account name \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played the beta awhile ago, and I sucked.

If they fly OK but can\u0027t get to orbit the big thing to remember is that it\u0027s easy to get to space, harder to stay there.
