Several feats of espionage later, all the Arks have Alcubierre drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drives, however, can\u0027t move enough mass to either move an Ark or evacuate it faster than just having the Ark arrive as planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Alcubierre ships can do, however, is set up seed colonies and mining outposts around neighboring stars, or carry freight and mail. Or, in the case of the show itself, checking out and salvaging/culturally integrating/rescuing slowships-there\u0027s a lot of them, they tend to be somewhat shoddy, and not all of them weathered the slower than light exodus very well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould like more ideas for worldbuilding.
