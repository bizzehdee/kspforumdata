Any suggestions on what to pull that would have the most effect? I am already running ATM Basic and have no desire to bump it up to Aggressive. There were a slew of recent updates for many of my mods; prior to the updates, I could go an hour or more without crashing. Now, I am lucky to get through 6-7 scene changes. \n\nLogs posted here: [http://1drv.ms/1Chz7fo](http://1drv.ms/1Chz7fo)\n\nSuggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cetera","CreatedById":109237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T02:25:59Z","Content":"Lots of mods eat lots of memory.

That only gives you an idea of the size of the code complexity, NOT the size of the memory it uses once loaded.\n\nTake for example the following pseudocode program:\n\n    L = some sort of list.for x goes from 1 to 1024   L.Add( allocate an array of 10485676 byes padded with zeros )\n\nThat\u0027s a PUNY tiny program... that eats 1 gig of memory."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T05:37:56Z","Content":"Also, size on disk does not relate that closely to size in memory: a 100kb PNG might take up 2MB of ram (2048x2048 texture) whereas a 768kb MBM will take up only 128kb of RAM."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T05:53:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, actually, it wouldn\u0027t.

You can parse his log and pick out every dll \u0026 texture if you like, but that would take longer than just posting a one level directory list by some distance.\n\nHe explicitly mentions scene changes which seems to cause leaks even in stock games, but if he\u0027s got a huge pile of mods with huge piles of textures he\u0027s not going to have the buffer a stock player has - and if his mods have added more textures his buffer has just shrunk even more, and hey presto less time between crashes. Could be a leaky plugin too, hey, but any usual suspects have to be picked out of the log, once again. Some people are pretty intimately familiar with mods which can cause problems or mods which have updated recently - maybe from personal experience with the same thing after an update, even - no need to disassemble each \u0026 every one yet when you can just scan a list \u0026 point out some things to try messing with."},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T07:22:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, actually it would.

Often you can reduce memory footprint \\*by\\* using a more complex algorithm. That results in a bigger DLL but a smaller memory footprint. Just listing the GameData contents only shows the disk footprint, which can be quite misleading and trick a person into blaming the wrong mod for the memory usage.\n\nYes, just giving the titles of the mods for other people familiar with those mods to look at is useful, the the implication was that this wasn\u0027t the reason you asked to list the GameData folder, but rather it was because of those disk usage sizes you posted in your example.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T07:25:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading**"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:23:13Z","Content":"Courtesy of CKAN, my currently installed mods:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - ActiveTextureManagement-x86-Basic 4-3\n\u003E \n\u003E - AlternateResourcePanel 2.6.3.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - BetterBuoyancy v1.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - Chatterer 0.8.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - CommunityResourcePack 0.3.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - ConnectedLivingSpace 1.1.1.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - DeadlyReentry v6.4.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - DistantObject v1.5.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - DistantObject-default v1.5.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - DockingPortAlignmentIndicator 6.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - FinalFrontier 0.6.5-697\n\u003E \n\u003E - FirespitterCore 7.0.5463.30802\n\u003E \n\u003E - Fusebox 1.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - GCMonitor 1.2.1.0-20\n\u003E \n\u003E - InFlightWaypoints Deprecated\n\u003E \n\u003E - KAS 0.4.10\n\u003E \n\u003E - KerbalAlarmClock v3.2.3.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - KerbalConstructionTime 1.1.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - KerbalEngineerRedux 1.0.15.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - KronalVesselViewer 0.0.4\\_0.90.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - KSP-AVC 1.1.5.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - KSPTips 4.0.0.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - ModuleManager 2.5.10\n\u003E \n\u003E - NEAR v1.3.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - NebulaEVAHandrails 1.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - NoMoreGrind 1.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - NRAP autodetected dll\n\u003E \n\u003E - PlanetShine 0.2.2.1\n\u003E \n\u003E - PreciseNode 1.1.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - ProceduralFairings v3.11\n\u003E \n\u003E - RasterPropMonitor-Core v0.19\n\u003E \n\u003E - RealChute 1.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - Regolith 0.1.7\n\u003E \n\u003E - RemoteTech v1.6.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - SAVE 0.9.17-387\n\u003E \n\u003E - SCANsat v10.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - ScienceAlert 1.8.4\n\u003E \n\u003E - Service-Compartments-6S 1.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - StageRecovery 1.5.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - StationScience 1.4\n\u003E \n\u003E - TACLS v0.10.2b\n\u003E \n\u003E - TACLS-Config-Stock v0.10.2b\n\u003E \n\u003E - Toolbar 1.7.8\n\u003E \n\u003E - Trajectories 1.1.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - TransferWindowPlanner v1.2.3.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - TriggerAu-Flags 2.6.3.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - UniversalStorage 1.0.90.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - USI-SRV 0.2.2\n\u003E \n\u003E - USITools 0.3.2"}]}
