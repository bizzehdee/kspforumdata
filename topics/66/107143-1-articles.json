According to it, KSP isn\u0027t a 97 because it doesn\u0027t boost the immune system of children and small mammals near it.\n\nWith any vague point system, actual quality has to be inferred from what they gave other games one has played, which doesn\u0027t really work for PC Gamer because for several games their review has been bought."},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:25:35Z","Content":"It\u0027s just 96/100, I don\u0027t get why people are saying percentage, it\u0027s like saying I rate that game 4/5."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:30:24Z","Content":"Influenced by Minecraft?
