When I started playing at version 0.15 I felt like they had read my mind. At the time I was finishing my degree in astrophysics and really wanted a game that would let me see and apply some of the basics principles, in a fun and enjoyable way, that I had spent the previous four years learning. There were a few games that promised this but all were too basic, or too myopic or overly complicated and unfinished. This game fit the bill perfectly and I have been playing nearly non stop ever since. The best part is by 0.16 this game had already replaced my long running #1 game Starcraft I which I had been playing since it came out in 1998. I was beginning to wonder if I would ever find something better. Congratulations KSP on being my #1 Game even if PC gamers only thinks your #90.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T15:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;More importantly, we hope that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in your top 100, too.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop 100?
