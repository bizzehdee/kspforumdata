There is NOTHING more annoying than designing a lander, only to find out it doesn\u0027t have quite enough fuel to get back into orbit! Sure it can be unexpected and challenging, but it shouldn\u0027t be an issue we run into because THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY to accurately know our craft\u0027s Delta-V without digging into parts configs to precisely figure out how much of our vessel is dry mass vs. fuel and performing some rather complex mathematics to figure out our vessel\u0027s Delta-V for each stage. It\u0027s really not a very difficult feature to implement, and should do a LOT to help new players learn how to design usable craft with enough Delta-V to carry out their missions... Look at how Kerbal Engineer Redux (or MechJeb2- which just steals the code from KER) calculates Delta-V to figure out how to implement this is stock...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, a Thrust-Weight Ratio readout in the VAB/SPH! It would be nice to know BEFORE trying to launch a craft that it doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to even make it off the pad! This is *ESPECIALLY* important if we are playing without Reverts of Quicksaves, as otherwise we could bankrupt our entire space program simply because we don\u0027t have access to a number that only requires a quick calculation to determine. Sure, we COULD go and look at the Thrust of each engine and then compare that to the vessel mass, but having to close the game and perform a bunch of math to design our rockets really takes a lot of fun out the of game! TWR is a simple number that even a 1960\u0027s computer could have calculated in a few milliseconds given the right information on thrust and vessel mass...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also recommend that the coding for the Engineer\u0027s Readout be made accessible to modders (who might want to expand it or reference it), and that it be set up to eventually account for changes in TWR (and sea-level TWR on different planets/moons) with a stock engine Thrust/ISP fix (so engine THRUST *increases* with decreasing atmospheric density, rather than fuel consumption decreasing... The atmospheric compression curve should also expand to allow performance to decline even further at pressures greater than 1 atmosphere- like on the surface of Eve, which otherwise would become substantially easier to get off of with the revised drag model...) which is probably one of the most-requested features here on the forums, and a HUGE pet-peave of mine that such a simple aspect of rocketry isn\u0027t simulated realistically in KSP... (especially when it would actually *IMPROVE* the performance of stock rockets by allowing them to dump mass more quickly at high altitudes, resulting in reduced total gravity-losses to orbit...)
