Some minor changes to how the back end deals with screens associated with categories makes for cleaner code and easier maintenance.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Meanwhile, Felipe (HarvesteR) has been making a ton of progress, finishing up work on the orbit lines, map icons and orbital context menus, and the KSC panels and vessel markers, which are now all implemented and working. With those out of the way he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moved his attention to the vessel recovery dialog.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Work on the staging user interface has also continued, with Jim (Romfarer) tackling more background focused tasks. The backend of the staging interface is now sending distinct calls to the user interface, whereas in the old where everything went into the same place. This has made the staging interface more stable and most of the odd visual staging bugs should be gone. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The amazing Dan (Danrosas) finished the designs for the prints that will be made for the office. Once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ready he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll share some pictures on Twitter. All in all, three posters will decorate the wall of our remodeled office, but first they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll to be printed and framed. Aside from the posters there will also be a giant Kerbal vinyl decorative piece. These will pretty much signify the end of the office remodeling (finally!).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We want to zoom in on the user interface update in general for a while too: when we started the overhaul we knew that it would be a tremendous amount of work: we tend to overlook a lot of the user interface when we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just playing through the game, but once you start really taking stock of every single interface component in the project, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s simply everywhere. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The new native Unity UI is really shining through all this. If we were porting to some other UI system, we would be having a very, very hard time. The fact that this overhaul is doable at all is very much a comment on how easy to use, flexible and powerful the native Unity UI system is. Felipe commented that he can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait to start creating new UI controls with it, and that what used to be the most dreaded part of the job is now looking like a fun, creative process.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Be that as it may, we are still looking at quite a mountain to climb with the overhaul. Progress is happening much more steadily now, but the amount of work still left to be done is enormous.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;All that work that gets done is prepared and organized by the producers, and Max (Maxmaps) and Ted have been busy discussing features, handling dev kits, and setting up schedules that might drive some people insane, but will ultimately speed up the process of translating code and user interface discussions in the devnotes into an actual new update. As time progresses and Ted settles into his new role as Technical Producer, the teamwork between him and Max is improving exponentially. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At the moment Ted is mostly busy rearranging QA schedules to fit the updated plans we have for 1.1. Those are currently being finalized and we hope to be able to share more about it on Squadcast, or in next week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s devnotes, time permitting. Outside of that, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve frequently found him performing the usual producer-type tasks of e-mailing intently, looking thoughtfully out of windows and having meetings.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Joining the frantic pace are Andrea (Badie) and Kasper (KasperVld), who are currently reviewing the dozens of applications to join the Media Group. Watching YouTube videos may sound like an easy job, but giving a well-founded opinion on over 30 channels with different styles, and comparing them based on those descriptions can get very complicated very fast, not to mention time consuming! There are literally hundreds of videos to look at, and thousands of metrics to compare. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been following KSPTV last week you may have caught the streams that Scott Manley, DasValdez, Jimorian, EJ_SA and Shimmy did from the B612 Foundation in San Fransisco and Twitchcon. The universe seems to have survived this enormous concentration of cool at the same time in the same place, but it must\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been close to collapsing. We understand they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve all had a great time there, and we hope that everyone else who was there has too.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re visiting OpenESTEC this Sunday, you might unknowingly run into Kasper, who will be there to attend a few symposia and meet a few ESA staff. If you live in the Netherlands (or close by) and if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re interested in spaceflight then this might just be something you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re interested in: lectures by astronauts, actual spacecraft and the research \u0026amp; technology centre of ESA will be open to the public.

The reason is mainly because we had 3 GUI systems running on top of each other (we talked about this in one of the previous devnotes). In addition, everything that involves cursor movement and hit detection outside GUI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s is handled with its own controller, actually a quite big number of controllers, all of them have to communicate with the user interface system and lock itself down whenever the mouse is over an element. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Now that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve consolidated everything into the new Unity 5 GUI system we can accumulate all these checks into one line of code courtesy, which means that (by default) clicks don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bleed through these elements into itself anymore.\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Felipe on save and craft compatibility\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Craft files from earlier versions do still work in 1.1. So far none of what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done has caused them to break. Some redesigns might be needed to account for subtle differences in flight handling and such, caused by the move to the Unity5 physics, but there shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be any changes that would outright break backward compatibility.\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;The same goes for game saves. So far, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been testing here with my old saves from 1.0 and before, and they keep on loading fine, so as far as we can tell, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nothing that would break those either. Of course, modded saves are quite another story.
