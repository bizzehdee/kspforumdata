The test itself works already, and the output does match the expectations for the flight handling of known craft. The big challenge now is finding a way to display this data, which is quite dense, in a way that is as intuitive as can be, but without oversimplifying. The original idea was to draw stable and unstable ranges, based on the assumption that instability would have a more or less clear boundary. Testing shows that this isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t the case, and there are small variations which need to be visible for the tests to make sense. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Based on the dev output alone however, following its guidance I was able to construct a nice, stable craft which flew just as the overlay estimated it would, so that was good. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re past the technical part of this feature, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s now largely a design problem\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Which isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t saying it became any easier however. Be that as it may, the overlay is coming along nicely, and I can already say I wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like to have to build spaceplanes without it anymore.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; Well, the drag system is all but finished. The change in flight dynamics is fun but we will require a rebalancing of a number of parts. We will be merging in the updated lift dynamics and then hoping to push it to the QA team later this week so they can have a play. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been also looking at implementing a new re-entry heat system to run alongside.

Now that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s public knowledge, I can talk about them! It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a while since we started doing concepts, playing with the shapes, the texture ideas, how it would affect the current rig for the Kerbals, silhouettes, and all those processes involving character design. Right now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m moving the default kerbal joints and adjusting them to the female version, also painting weights to try and do afterwards some retargeting inside Unity. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one issue though, since we did the Kerbal EVA system before Unity 4, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re only using Mecanim on the facial animations. Everything else is running under the Legacy system. Right now we need to figure out how hard it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be to implement the default EVA animations into the adjusted rig for the female model. If it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a couple of paths we can take. One of them involves doing the retargeting inside Maya (and since we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re talking of more or less 100 animation loops, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably the last option). My main concern right now are the facial animations, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m afraid they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to break once we add the rotations and translations of the default Kerbal face. Fortunately we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re talking here about single states that are blended into Mecanim (happy, sad, excited and scared plus variations), so creating new ones should take one day or two tops. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; First of all, I just want to thank everyone who commented on the Engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Report features last week. The part where you listed up the things you were \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Calways\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 forgetting when building rockets and planes. This week I\u2019ve been going over the comments and turned it into actual features for the app. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not too late to come with more suggestions though as most of the tests still have to be written. But i just want to stress that the point of the app is not to hold your hand while you build, it is more a tool to alarm you of possible issues which may be hard to spot during construction but would lead to major grief later on. Such as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chatch obstructed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 this was a really good suggestion. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .Finalizing the plan for the update. Reentry heat is in, as you have probably already read. Also coordinating with collaborators to make sure they know what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to see from them. As usual, they are all fantastic to work with. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been assigned to take on the task of delivering the best tutorial experience possible, thus my digging into Reddit and just about every community resource I can (often being sneaky about it) to find out where new players need a hand, and where they just need us to get out of the way.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Ted (Ted):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; It\u2019s been a nice and busy week here. I\u2019ve spent today coming up with nicknames for all of the engines we have in-game so that it\u2019s a tad easier for people to refer to each engine - no more \u201Cthe big bell-shaped one from the ARM update\u201D.

It\u2019s the sort of thing that doesn\u2019t have to be done, but really does make everything a lot more efficient when QA begins. Everyone knows what the feature is, we\u2019ve already had the feedback about understanding the feature and that has been implemented so it\u2019s mainly QA bugtesting that remains.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Finally, I\u2019ve been working with the Experimental and QA Teams to ensure that the prioritised list of bugs to be fixed for 1.0 is accurate and reliable.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Anthony (Rowsdower):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.
