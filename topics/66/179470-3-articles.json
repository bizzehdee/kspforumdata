There are a few points or \u0027things\u0027 I think that are important to raise or muse over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The \u0027Preview Channel\u0027 team that consists of QA testers, Media testers etc. (that we have learnt in the past get shown previews of art to comment on prior to public showing) are not giving enough feedback or enough high quality feedback with respect to the new parts\u0027 design from a structural design standpoint, from a technical art standpoint and from an aesthetical style standpoint. This is having a detrimental effect as the artists are not getting feedback on their art to then rectify prominent design issues before showing it to the public or before release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The \u0027Preview Channel\u0027 team are giving feedback and critique on the parts but the artist(s) creating this/these parts may be too stubborn or may have a too large of an ego to acknowledge that there are design issues with said parts and does not intend to consider making any further changes to the part design... nullifying the point of feedback and critique. I have no idea who did the art for this part specifically and please not that this is not an accusation of character, merely conjecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The \u0027Preview Channel\u0027 are all signing the praises of the designs of the previewed parts before public showing and therefore the part is shown to the public as is but there is a large disconnect between the \u0027Preview Channel\u0027s\u0027 feedback compared to a large portion of the general public consumer comments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... none of these may have any weight or substance and at this point all that it serves for me to conject about this above is to stir the rumour mill which doesn\u0027t serve anyone any good, however, if there is truth in any of the above then it is concerning due to the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT #1. If the feedback the artists are receiving is consistently poor, low in quality and/or quantity and does not contain the background knowledge with respect to the design from a modelling/texturing/coding standpoint then maybe it seems like it is the time for new \u0027Feedback Givers\u0027 to be taken on that can assist the art team in creating parts that fulfill their function and also appease the vast majority of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT #2. If this is the case, it is a very sad situation. As a designer, the only way to improve your skillset from an overall design standpoint is to broaden your views with regards to your own designs and acknowledge that other people\u0027s opinions on your work usually hold great weight as you become blind to the innadequacies in your own design work... all designers and artists suffer from this. If an artist is unwilling to take on feedback and critique in their work, I guess that is then the responsibility of the Lead Art Director to ensure that this mentality does not remain as it becomes quite poisonous within a team (this is from personal experience).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT #3. If this is true then it is concerning as there is a strong disconnect between the \u0027Yes Men\u0027 of the \u0027Preview Channel\u0027 and the common opinion and thoughts of the community at large. Again, this may be resolved by allowing more people to give feedback or take on further feedback from public preview releases and then rework the art.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, none of this resolves the specific issue that has been brought up by a lot of people in this thread with regards to the windows but there are a couple of ways that I see this progressing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. Nothing with regards to the part design changes. If the windows are modified it would require the artist to change the geometry on the model mesh, redo the UV-Maps and also ammend the texture to suit. Depending on the level of ability of the artist this could take anywhere between an hour or a day judging from various other artists I have witnessed doing similar work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. The windows are modifed reflecting the critique and feedback given in this thread and most of the community is appeased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC. The windows are modified but don\u0027t get much positive feedback with regards to the new changes... then go back Point A. or B. above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I feel that there is enough of the proportion of discussion in this topic with regards to the windows to clearly identify that there is an issue here. Whether changes get made going forward is neither here nor there when it comes to public discussion on this forum but it would be nice to think that discussion is CERTAINLY being had behind closed doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-02T20:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna rovers incoming!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-02T21:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have mostly liked the new updated artwork and really appreciate the work you guys have been putting into it.

Straight up corners in the windows are a weakness that will often lead to catastrophic faults (look at airliner windows ,and how they\u0027re always rounded).

While it\u0027s not solid, it certainly looks like the cabin took inspiration from the SEV, which had beefy window frames. With that in mind, I sorta tried to mock this up earlier today, really only meant to put it in a few\u00A0discord servers for a lark, but I might as well share it here.
