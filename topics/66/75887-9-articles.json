This concept was discussed on the forums, attached to surveys and quickly stood out as a great way to highlight the big-time nature of this exciting update. The Kerbin Cup video by Nassault went over really well and we saw some gaming media cover it, including GameSpot and Shacknews. Now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting ready for the next update to get out Experimentals and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve already seen one of the videos on the Experimental side. Personally, I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait to dig in and play it once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETed (Ted): This past week has been a very busy one. In Experimentals we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve tracked down some dastardly issues that plagued the builds and the Devs have fixed them up nicely, as well as noting down feedback about the finer points of contracts. Now that the major issues are seemingly gone, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve moved on to prioritizing balancing out the rewards the player will receive for completing or failing contracts, taking into account the feedback from the past week. This is quite the mammoth task for us to do, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re approaching with as clear a field as possible in terms of remaining bugs and thankfully, the critical bugs don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look to be coming back *knock on wood*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn QA we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been testing out the features that Marco and Hugo have been working on respectively. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re both going through QA pretty well, with bugs here and there but nothing either of them can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t patch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after a week in Experimentals, the feedback for the improvements that were made from putting 0.24 through some further development and QA is fantastic. It seems to be positive feedback all around when it comes to the changes, which leaves us all very pleased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnthony (Rowsdower): I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t quite compete with what Ted had to say, lol. The Kerbin Cup is going well on all fronts. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been debuting a few KSP company LOGOS each day. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been trying to figure out some meetup ideas in hopes that I can make something come to fruition. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also got a question for you Twitch viewers out there. Are there other streamers not currently on the channel that you think would be a good fit for KSP-TV?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEduardo (Lalo): Following up the Experimentals and the tasks of each one in order to have the release ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERogelio (Roger): Very sad because Mexico\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s elimination from the World Cup, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also happy because we almost finish our first video as a team and my first video as a KSP team.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on fixing the bugs of my features with some help from Jim.
