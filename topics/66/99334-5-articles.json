Last week I said I was concerned about performance on some of the tests. The design concern feature is not a list of parts a vessel has and has not. It is a set of tests which analyze your vessel for possible issues you may run into. For example a big part of these tests are dealing with resource flow and will prompt when you have resource containers which are not being drained, consumers (such as engines) not getting the fuel they need, etc. And for every of these tests the parts in question are highlighted. This means the tests have to run every time you attach and detach a part and in the case of stack resource flow the system has to check for every resource container, and then trace back from the consumers which of these containers are not being drained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just implement an \u0022Engineer\u0027s Report\u0022/\u0022Engineer\u0027s Inspection\u0022 button so that the tests are only performed when the user wants them performed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way it\u0027s currently described to work seems a lot like validating a textfield as the user presses each key.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T09:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe docking UI is really useless.

It is a set of tests which analyze your vessel for possible issues you may run into.
