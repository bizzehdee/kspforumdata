I think \u0022balance\u0022 can not be attained in a bubble and that it often requires additional systems in order to attain. Only balancing at the end results in basically having to make do with what you have and precludes the possibility that what you planned ahead of time might not be any fun. IMO, until something *is* fun you\u0027re just operating on a theoretical level that may or may not pan out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to me, incrementally balancing things as you go is generally a better approach as it allows you to raise the alarm when systems just aren\u0027t working right, when you may need new ones, when the ones that are there should be scrapped in favor of something else, or when you realize that plans that you had really aren\u0027t necessary or serve any real purpose (which is what I tend to suspect about the conversion system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the worst case you may even realize that something new you just added in actually makes the game less fun, but without any form of existing balance, there won\u0027t be any real way to tell if that\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve put a lot of work into trying to balance career mode since science was first introduced and certainly don\u0027t feel any of my previous work was wasted with the introduction of these new systems. Additional variables have been introduced into the equation for sure, but that just means I can focus on tweaking them in isolation around the base that I\u0027ve already established instead of being overwhelmed by the overall complexity of the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T01:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T07:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere isn\u0027t even a basic UI tutorial that points out what the buildings are, or tells the player to visit the smallest, furthest away building before launching something and essentially wasting cash.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA very short and quick overview of the game would be sufficient really to point new players where to go and look for things, I agree here.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECare to expand on that?This is, of course, something aside from the tutorials, yeah?
