Yes they are not directly porting the game but there is no way in hell a mobile developer will be able to manage this on their own. Squad will be helping them every step of the way. The game is very complex now and making it work on the PS4 architecture will be tough.

You are right that it may take a while to do the port. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E During its PlayStation Latin America event tonight at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony revealed that Kerbal Space Program will come to the PlayStation 4 in **2016**.\n\nKSP has been in development for 3-4 years, the developers understand their code. I imagine many collaboration questions can be answered via email. Squad has already complimented them for their help with U5 thus far. The benefit of additional income from this port could, if wisely reinvested in development, help KSP on PC see new and interesting features sooner, rather than later."},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T14:49:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The thing is, most people play KSP because they like space (and Jeb).
