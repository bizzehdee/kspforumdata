The thing about Kerbal Space Program is that it\u0027s a single player game, and as such you have NO right whatsoever to tell people whether they cheat or not. I use a ton of mods, not because it\u0027s easier than stock, but because it gives me a lot more variety to play around with. You might consider a mod like Kerbal Joint Reinforcement a cheat, while I consider it a necessity if you want to design rockets that look and act like real life rockets. You might consider NovaPunch a cheat, but when you have made an asparaguss-less stock lifter that can get more than a hundred tons into orbit like me, you\u0027ll get pretty damn pissed off by hearing someone say that you\u0027re cheating by using parts that are 5 meters in diameter. Trust me, \u0022skills\u0022 in this game is much more than a question of whether one uses mods or not. Even if you used B9, it would still take as much skill to make something like cupcakes landers, or even to fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t tell me what to do in a single player game without objectives, thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-17T14:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2014 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by wasmic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T15:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReally!, Really!, ;;; Mods, mods, mods.

Also, how is FAR, DRE, and KER cheating? In some aspects, they create more of a challenge as well as eliminate others. I play with mods that allow me to build things that are nigh impossible with stock. ex: with B9, Pwing, and Klockheed Martian Space shuttle engines, I can create an accurate copy of the shuttle, or make something completely original. Just because you play with mods doesn\u0027t mean you have no skill or that you\u0027re a cheater (Look at Scott Manely: he is the most praised KSP player ever, and yet uses plenty of mods).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T18:30:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI saw someone do an Ablate landing a long time ago, it was a series of pictures.
