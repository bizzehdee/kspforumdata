Basic probe cores might only be capable of a single planned maneuver node, and you might have to pre-orient the probe for the burn. Higher tier probe cores might support two or more maneuver nodes, and have the ability to self orient to the next node using reaction wheels. Early intermediate probes might only be capable of orienting to the attitudes they naturally support (prograde / retrograde only for an early probe, for example). A later probe might add support for radial or normal vectors. High end probes would have unlimited pre-planned maneuver nodes, and would be capable of orienting to a node. All probes would support a blind initial burn, based on pre-orienting the probe before coms loss.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll maneuvers would have to be set up in coms range.
