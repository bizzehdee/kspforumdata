Apparently, SQUAD prefers showing off popular YouTubers\u0027 videos that would already get tens of thousands of views, and are relatively poor-quality. \n\nIt does send the message, \u0022Hey, [*insert popular YouTuber here*]! We appreciate the fact that you\u0027re showing off the game, and can you please continue doing so in the future?\u0022 But it also denies up-and-coming YouTubers from the chance of having their videos viewed by thousands of people. I think that the latter is far more important than the former.\n\n...and don\u0027t get me started on the fact that this video is long, rambling, and vulgar. It\u0027s not very good, to be honest.\n\nAgain, just my $0.02... and I\u0027m crabby this morning, so I might feel better about all of this tomorrow.\n\n-Upsilon\n\n900th post!"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T20:40:39Z","Content":"Instructions :\n\n1. Know nothing about rovers\n\n2. Start recording\n\n3. Replicate rover design you saw in another video\n\n4. Forget (If you ever knew it) the difference between Kerbin, Kerbal and \u0022Kerbans\u0022\n\n5. Show how unstable the rover is\n\n6. Get over 18.000 views on Youtube\n\n7. Get featured in Video Wednesday\n\nI kinda feel like you guys should promote good videos from unknown youtubers instead of meh videos from \u0022famous\u0022 youtubers..."},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T23:12:46Z","Content":"R.U.B.B.I.S.H.. hope the 1.0 is better then this...
