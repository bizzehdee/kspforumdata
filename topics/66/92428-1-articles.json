Experimentals is going at full steam, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re pushing fix after fix here, and trying to make sense of the simply enormous amount of feedback we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting from the test team. Again, not only are we faced with technical issues that need solving, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also working on balance and gameplay issues, which are in a way much harder to deal with, as any change at that level is not likely to be a small one. The main issue of course, is time. The release deadline is making a most unsettling whooshing sound as it rushes towards us, so the main goal for this last stage is to try to resolve as many issues as we can in however much time is still available. The good news of that is that the release (and well-deserved rest) is really not too far off. The not so good news for us is that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all uphill from here, against a headwind, wading through molasses, and any other metaphorical difficulties you want to add to that.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;On more specific news, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gone through the new Crew Pilot system yesterday, and set it up so that, as explained already, Kerbal Pilots are needed to provide SAS and Autopilot assistance, but also so Probe Cores are also able to do the same. That was done by a rewrite of the old ModuleSAS part module, which before was pretty much just empty. Now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s used in probes, to specify the level of SAS service provided. .Higher-level probe cores provide more AP features, and are of course, much more expensive. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also spent a good deal of time revising the R\u0026amp;D placement for probes, so that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find a nice gradual progression from the simplest model (the Stayputnik) to the top-of-the-line ones all along the control/unmanned branches of the tech tree. This means the so-far very similar probe cores now finally have actual differences between one another.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been solving some hosting issues with our Squad website and checking that it was working as it should be. Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m now doing some changes to the KerbalEdu license validation UI because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to update it too.

It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a busy week, but not a particularly interesting one to talk about. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re playing the experimentals game now. It consists of checking the tracker constantly, hunting for bugs to fix, locating one that seems a suitable one for oneself, investigating it, trying a fix and waiting for feedback about it. If the fix was acceptable, all that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s left is to pray that the fix didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break something else. If it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t acceptable in the first place, well it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s back to square one. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been last week for me in a nutshell.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; This year, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve learned to measure our lives in Dev Notes. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no week that I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t turn around, poke the guys and tell them about it, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re almost at the end of another good year. On my side, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve learned a lot from this last few months, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still a little over the edge thanks to the extreme crunch time we went through, but will make it up on the holidays. This week we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been wrapping up the upgradeable buildings feature, tweaking small details, positioning of the assets, fake occlusion, materials, and so forth. Also managed the change the loading screen with the help of Mike. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s looking sharp and new now. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been some good experimental season. Almost no big bugs to squash on our side, since the implementation was handled by the rest of the team. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Another week of trying to keep up with fixing the bugs coming into the bugtracker. As much as this is interesting and useful in itself, I have another bit of news which should be more interesting. Today the Propulsion category for parts is officially being deprecated and all parts contained within are split into \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEngine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFuel Tank\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. If your modded parts still use the Propulsion category, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry, the change is backwards compatible in the sense that all parts tagged with Propulsion will be split into the new category based on whether they have the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEngine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 partmodule attached.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Recording the video for the update has been a little challenging this time around. Content is\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 vast. I had three different scripts I canned, recorded three different videos all clocking at around 15 minutes, then realized it was best to be concise. My weekend did involve trying to complete a contract that required me to hit a 17k altitude survey spot (which I decided to do on a spaceplane because\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 reasons) but I managed it in the end. The update nears, experimentals are progressing and some pretty cool negotiations regarding KSP merch have gone down. Speaking of them, thanks to everyone who participated in our survey, the data collected was incredibly helpful. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Ted (Ted):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; It\u2019s been another incredibly busy week. Unfortunately this week doesn\u2019t have much in the way of interesting events to talk about, it\u2019s been mostly full of the more routine, but very necessary, tasks involved with this stage of testing. There\u2019s been a lot of collating of feedback, running builds, answering tester inquires in IRC, checking up on resolved issues, the list goes on! I guess this dev note is more to let you know that I\u2019m still working away here and have most of my marbles!

How about the proposals I\u2019ve been making? No? Oh, well, I guess you\u2019re right. They\u2019re a bit boring right now, but it\u2019s the end result you\u2019re going to want to know about and will definitely be hearing more on - *knock on wood* - in the near future. Call this the groundwork stage for a few things *I hope* are on the horizon.
