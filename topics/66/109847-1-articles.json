Right now base building, vehicles, heck even capital ships are bloody hard to make with the lack of larger parts. Also, i think we have enough rocket parts, what more could we use anyways aside from 5m parts or the like? There is enough engines, fuel tanks, and other assorted parts catering to rocket builders? Well maybee some think we need more, but i feel the airplane specific and rocket specific categories are already pretty filled. More parts are always welcome (provided some optimization is done to cut down ram hogginess of KSP), but i think that those 2 categories are plenty filled, all we need is more structural parts to let us make bigger bases, warships, ect."}]}
