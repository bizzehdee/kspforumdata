As a former airline pilot he usually focuses his videos around building and flying aircraft of various descriptions, but his latest project is both something completely different and very much worth watching.

I need to make one correction: I was never an airline pilot, and do not have anywhere close to that much flight experience. I hold a Commercial Pilot certificate and thus could in theory be paid to fly airplanes, however that has never been my job. I spent a whole lot more time turning wrenches, inspecting and repairing airplanes, than I did piloting them.\n\nAnd a suggestion, if I may. This video is probably a better introduction to the current series: \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/00Sa4VB4bWY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThanks for the notice.
