The tourney was scheduled for 3 hours, but we only had 2.5 or a little less to allow for judging. During that time there was a brief setup period, in which you could configure KSP\u0027s settings, and re-familiarize yourself with the game. Once that was over, everyone started a fresh sandbox save and went at it. You could build and launch as many things to as many places until time was called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods were allowed, and all craft had to be built fresh in that save file (no stock ships allowed). Apart from that, you could use any internet reference you needed, form the wiki to phase angle calculators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksaving and reloading was permissible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals had to be EVA\u0027d on the surface, I believe because the scoring was done via a save file parser. \u0027Splashed-down\u0027 kerbals did not count, so your landings had to be on dry land (this made Laythe somewhat more difficult).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe winner had about 600\u002B points, achieved by landing 300\u002B kerbals on Eve. In retrospect, Eve was probably the way to go, since it\u0027s low dv, and easy to aerobreak at. I personally was only able to clock in 55 points, landing an 11 kerbal colony on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe organizers encouraged all the players to take as many screenshots as we could, that they might accompany the after action posts. I personally really want to see 300 kerbals standing (or perhaps just piled up) under a purple sky \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T22:50:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by gulegule\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T02:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks gulegule.
