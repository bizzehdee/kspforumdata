If I didnt care I even dont write here uninstall game and play\u00A0dunno more battlefield but I care. \u003Cem\u003EIf they care they really do something.\u003C/em\u003E We cant even talk about multiplayer and they promise with v.0.24 (2 years ago). They patching game atleast this is good but tooooo slow.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I was trying to tell you before, is that they have added new parts. They added in the radiators, the goliath and Juno jet engines, and they have made improvements with heating and other things as well. Some of the things you suggest are massively ambitious things. Squad has made their game incredibly open to modding, and there are a great number of very cool planet pack mods, part mods, etc, if you wish to go beyond stock, but you have to also understand that the game was severely limited by it\u0027s 32 bit engine. That means it can only access about 4 GB of memory... Adding more parts, more planets, etc... It would fill that memory up even faster. Many of the crashes people see in KSP are actually related to the memory limit being hit. Modders hit that limit more easily than stock players, cause they have added parts and add ons that fill up even more of the limited available memory. If Squad added all those extra things into the game, without first upgrading the engine to Unity 5 (which has 64 bit support), then the stock game would crash as much as heavily modded games. Looking at something like multiplayer... With KSP 32 bit already at it\u0027s limit, Squad had no choice but shift priority to updating the engine \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E. Without first upgrading the engine,\u00A0stock could not grow.\u00A0Maybe, after the Unity 5 update, they can come back to looking at multiplayer and other popular, but long awaited\u00A0features, as a possibility.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe 64 bit Unity 5 engine gives us better performance, so the game runs smoother, can handle ships with more part counts, more ships at once, and provides extended memory access... There is not a desktop or laptop computer you can \u003Cem\u003Eeven buy\u003C/em\u003E that reaches the max usable memory of Unity 5 in 64 bit mode. That means, if you have 8 GB, 16 GB, or even 32 GB (like me \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), KSP will be able to use any amount of that memory! Whatever you got, KSP 64 bit will be able to use it!\u00A0That means no more limits to the memory the game uses, and it means we can support more simultaneous mods, as well as more stock parts! I personally want more planets myself, but I am also totally fine installing Kopernicus and adding planet packs. I think I want to add Outer Planets Mod and maybe one more...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, Squad has to balance what they add, vs what the game can handle... 32 bit KSP was already so packed, that it was near bursting at the seams... It crashed a lot, because of memory problems. With 64 bit KSP, those memory problems are gone, and stock can once again\u00A0grow, if they like. And trust me... Squad like!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding other planets and such... I don\u0027t know if Squad will ever flesh out the far reaches of the Kerbal solar system. I would like Squad to add planets to represent Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (Pluto forever! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E), but Squad is also VERY well aware of the modding community\u0027s contributions... I strongly suspect that they don\u0027t want to step on anyone\u0027s toes. Sure, Squad could make their own Kerbin system analogs of the last 4 plants (Eeyup, I said there are FOUR \u003Cs\u003E\u00A0 lights \u00A0\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0planets \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E), but at what cost? They could certainly make their own, but then what happens to the hard work of the modders who creates mods like OPM? What if Squad integrates OPM into stock. I\u0027d LOVE that! I really would love that... but then what does that say for all the people who have created alternate planet packs? Do they get left out? Do their mods now conflict with the orbits of \u003Cs\u003E\u00A0\u00A0OPM \u00A0\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0stock?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s why we have a modding community. Squad lets us choose how much extra we want to add to KSP, and sometimes they incorporate the best of the best\u00A0extras by hiring mod makers. Just off the top of my head, I recognize the names of\u00A0Porkjet and Arsonide, people who created excellent mods for space plane parts and extended contracts. Their mods were so good, Squad basically hired them\u00A0and incorporated their mods into stock.\u00A0Sometimes they add their own cool stuff. Sometimes they leave it purely to modders. I would not be concerned about it at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad is still a very small team, and you can\u0027t expect them to be able to do things with\u00A0the same capacity\u00A0as a big company like Rockstar,\u00A0EA, or Ubisoft... It takes time and effort to add features, parts and fix bugs, and they have to spread\u00A0these things out over time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I guess, in the end, what I\u0027m saying, is try to see the bigger picture before letting impatience or anger guide your words. You can write and say what you want, but consider first if it\u0027s actually warranted. Consider whether what you are saying is cause you have a real observation, or because you are are mad that a particular feature you wanted hasn\u0027t been implemented yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I explained, KSP 32 bit (Unity 4) was at it\u0027s breaking point. Getting mad that something like multiplayer, or more planets, or more\u00A0parts that you wanted has been ignored isn\u0027t a good argument to say that you\u00A0cant see any of that being added by Squad. They did add a lot of stuff, but were focused on adding necessary parts (like the radiators, and the largest and smallest jet engines, since there was a big gap in jet technology). Even more so, Squad is focused primarily on\u00A0improving and fixing the underlying game engine so it \u003Cem\u003Ecan handle\u003C/em\u003E the addition of such larger scale improvements, without crashing the game all the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne more thing... \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0expect new things!\u003C/em\u003E That\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Squad has worked for a whole year at making Unity 5 a reality!

More stock parts, and I mean more KINDS of parts that allow me to build\u00A0MORE than just a big round\u00A0rocket stack with a kerbbed capsule at the very tippy top, or an airplane or spaceplane that looks like the Space Shuttle (R.I.P.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, these things are what I look for every time I read a \u0027Tuesday Dev Notes\u0027 post, and obviously I\u0027m disappointed every time.\u00A0 In conclusion, and specifically for the reasons listed above, I really don\u0027t think that you should be calling the game \u0027Released\u0027, or \u0027Done\u0027, as in \u0027Version 1.anything\u0027.\u00A0 To me, the game is more in a state that\u00A0 I would call about \u0027Version 0.93\u0027.\u00A0 At BEST.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy opinions, worth what you paid for them.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T19:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458846805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002272520\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neutrinovore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Neutrinovore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy opinions, worth what you paid for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI presume that \u0022My opinions are worth nothing\u0022 isn\u0027t actually what you were trying to say, otherwise there was no point in posting them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T19:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471853\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458846805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002272520\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neutrinovore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, Neutrinovore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt boggles my mind that the ONLY \u0027Kerbal-made\u0027 structures on the ENTIRE PLANET are still just the KSC and the Island Runway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re forgetting KSC 2 and the pyramids on the other side of the planet.
