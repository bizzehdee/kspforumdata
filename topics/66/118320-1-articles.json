Jatwaa\u0027s channel is great!\n\nThere are three things you can do here, Badie. If I were you, I\u0027d do a combination of all of them!\n\n**Thing #1: Individual Videos.** SQUAD\u0027s traditionally done a lot of this. It\u0027s just posting a link to a single video for KSP players\u0027 enjoyment.\n\n**Thing #2: Video Series-es.** I\u0027ve only seen this done a few times ([here\u0027s one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90551-Video-Wednesdays-Rover-Adventures-Around-Kerbin-24), for example), but I always like when it happens. This is showcasing a particular Kerbal Space Program series that\u0027s really cool.\n\n**Thing #3: YouTube Channels.** That\u0027s what you did for Jatwaa and, as you may well know, it hasn\u0027t been done too often either. I really like the idea, though! And yes, it would be nice to see more of this in the future.\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\n-Upsilon"}]}
