All we can do is make baseless assumptions based on the lack of information we\u0027ve got. When people don\u0027t get information, they tend to assume, and when people assume, then tend to assume the worst. And when consumers assume the worst about a product, its reputation will be harmed. They say all PR is good PR, but it works the other way too: No PR is bad PR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad hasn\u0027t really said anything that should give players cause for concern. Devs leaving, Porkjet parts, console versions... they haven\u0027t said anything alarming about either issue. What makes us concerned is the lack of information. Or, let me try again: Because players miss information about certain issues, they have become vocal about these issues, and the \u0022worst assumptions\u0022 mentioned above have become central to the discussion, because those, call them rants, are the only statements with concrete points we can discuss. The lack of official information creates a void it\u0027s up to the fans to fill, and we fill it with negativity because this is the Internet. As stated by Raptor9 above, people generally only become vocal about a software product if they have issues with it, so those with issues are the ones to start discussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the discussions filled with negativity are allowed to fester, and devnote after devnote comes out, where Squad seems to refuse to address the issues. Their statements weigh heavy in the discussions, and would probably add balance to them (see: Roverdude\u0027s excellent work of bringing facts into the Great Developer Exodus debate), but when Squad stays silent, the premises for discussion stay in the hands of the vocal and dissatisfied fans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here we are, and the prevailing views seem to be that console players are screwed over, that Porkjet\u0027s work was for nought, and that Squad\u0027s plans for the future focus on expanded marketing of the product they have right now, rather than improving the product. Squad themselves haven\u0027t planted these ideas, but they sure haven\u0027t done much to refute them either. And since those ideas are, again, prevailing, they will become the basis of every discussion on either issue. Until further news is given from official sources, this is the situation Squad has to live with. And it does deteriorate the community, that can\u0027t be helped - unless, of course, the issues are addressed in a concrete, detailed and factual manner from official sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-14T10:25:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2016 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Codraroll\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T13:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222848797\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479020146\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150430\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galileo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/13/2016 at 0:55 AM, Galileo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill this issue, that destroys rovers, be fixed in the future?

Now, we all know that most companies (and that includes Squad) aren\u0027t very open about internal matters, so that we don\u0027t hear all that much about that isn\u0027t strange either. What Squad needs to do is bring the KSP team up to strength again (which at the moment itobviously isn\u0027t) and then start to work on what they think is best for the game, mixed with what the community is best. As of now, this probably isn\u0027t possible due to internal problems so give Squad some time, let them do the small bugfixes and other problems first, let them work themselves back to full strength and as a community, let\u0027s not moan too much about it. Squad themselves aren\u0027t probably reading this, but the dev\u0027s (what\u0027s left of them) probably are, and they are most like as unhappy (or even unhappier) with the whole thing as we are.

After a few hours of the new release, the forum was full of the most obvious complaints - the wheels were borked beyond what anyone expected. Wheels had not been a problem in .90 but were essentially useless in 1.1.3 It was not until the eruption of complaints that Squad came forward and admitted the wheels were an issue, but rather than to explain their plans to handle it, we got the \u0022it\u0027s a Unity 5 issue\u0022 speech. There were a few modders and Squad staff members (independently of Squad)\u00A0 that immediately began to fill in the gap left by Squad\u0027s seemingly lack of interest in becoming proactive to address the issue.

The wrath of the forum even continued onto Facebook... But by the time Squad came out with the complete explanation and the plan to address the wheel issues, it was too late to quell the hostility of many. It was why the demand for 1.2 to be released, even prematurely, was made by the forum to Squad. This set in motion a few other issues that Squad is now having to address...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other examples of this too... the souposphere that existed since 0.18 (and led to the development of some pretty awesome mods such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and NEAR) that compensated nicely for the atmospheric conditions on Kerbin. I remember the forum (pre-2012 purge) where this issue was beaten to death on about four threads and the response was always \u0022It\u0027s a Unity issue...\u0022 without any further explanation. But to even get that explanation took nearly eight weeks of forum blasts to admit it wasn\u0027t quite right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad has always been great at promoting the new and upcoming features in each update they\u0027ve released.

Even if it is nothing more than \u0022we\u0027ve recently have become aware of a new bug. Nearly a hundred have reported X.
