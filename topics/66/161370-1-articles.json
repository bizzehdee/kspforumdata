The important thing to know is that this big news doesn\u2019t change much for the KSP community. Squad and the current development team is still here and we\u2019re hard at work on KSP and its future updates, but now we are fortunate enough to do so with the help of an experienced publisher like Take-Two, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited and happy to see where our conjoint collaboration will take KSP forward. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, we\u2019re still focused on the Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion and we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on our progress. And yes, we\u2019re keeping our promise of free DLC for everyone who purchased KSP through April 2013! We\u2019re continuing to work closely with Blitworks on the updated version of KSP for consoles, which will be available on the Xbox and PSN digital stores when it is complete. This will be a free update for anyone who already owns KSP on Xbox or PS4. We can\u2019t wait for you to play what we\u2019ve been working on in the coming months! \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very exciting time for KSP and the Community, and we hope you\u2019re as thrilled as we are.
