The Content Team has been hard at work for months already producing assets for all the facilities in their various levels. My part in this is to make sure the assets are set up properly to spawn at KSC, and to write the code that will make it all work in game. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve written a set of new controllers which work very similarly to the code that runs and keeps track of the Destructible Facilities. On scene start, KSC spawns at its place on Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface, which brings in Upgradeable Facility objects. These look for data from the save file to spawn the correct model for each facility. These models then have yet another set of controllers which load either the intact or destroyed version of destructible objects in each facility. It took some brainbashing, but I managed to put together a system which works well with all these daisy-chained spawning objects, allowing us to have persistent, upgradeable, destructible Facilities at the space center.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;One interesting thing we had to find a way to work through here, were the bits of the space center which aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t part of any facility. These are the filler ground sections between buildings, and the crawlerway leading to the launchpad. These objects aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t upgradeable by themselves, but they too have to change as KSC evolves around them. For that, we have a second type of upgradeable object which instead of being upgradeable manually or from saved data, they update their state based on the state of one or more neighboring upgradeables. That means the ground sections between facilities can automatically upgrade themselves to better match the level of the areas they connect. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Up next for this week (and the weekend, and likely the week after that too) is to continue setting up each level of each facility here, plus its wrecked version, plus its demolition FX and sounds. Needless to say, this is a gigantic amount of work, but here is where our decision to do destructible buildings on the last update is really paying off. We already have the workflow, the infrastructure and the tools to take on this much larger job without getting tangled in a mess of unorganized assets and incomplete code.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;The facility assets are still being developed though, so while those are still being built, my focus is going to be on setting up the gameplay systems which will interact with upgradeable facilities. First up are the UIs to actually perform the upgrades, then hooking the system up to require Currencies to afford upgrading, and finally the code to allow other components to query the upgrade level of facilities and change behavior based on those levels.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;All in all, a proper mountain of work lies ahead, so I better stop writing now and get back to it.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;As every week, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m doing database backups and server monitoring.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also developed a new tooltip controller system for use in all the areas which currently use their own tooltip system.

After working three months modeling and texturing in Maya, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to move to Unity and start tweaking the assets. I have been talking with Felipe all week on the proper way of handling the prefabs inside the system he built for the buildings. I can, for certain, say that we are on 80% development of the assets, and 50% of the feature. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be an interesting development week, since there are things that need to be optimized, like modular parts and props and shaders. On the other hand, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m writing that dev blog post I promised two dev notes ago. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m on page two and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nearly the introduction, so expect lots of information, visual aids and a description for each building when it is time for you to roam into our asset creation pipeline for the last three months! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; This week i have been working on the main controller for the new partlist toolbar which is part of the editor overhauls for 0.26. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s basically hundreds of code lines flipping buttons on and off. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;As you recall, the editor part list previously had 7 tabs.

And we are also planning on splitting the propulsion tab into fuel and engines. So if you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t select another filter, the editor will work just like it did before.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;In addition to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFunction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 we are planning to add more ways to list parts up, all with their own subcategories. For example. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cby module\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cby manufacturer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cby resource contained\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 etc. And the funky thing is you can select both filter by \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFunction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and any of the other filters.
