I\u0027ve always loved crew manifest, but this looks interesting as well. I can think of some areas where I may still prefer to use crew manifest though. Namely creating new custom kerbals as well as needing to transfer crew at launch, when trying to get the camera to cooperate in order to select ships may be difficult (Yeah, I could just go back to the VAB and set them there, but...). But the idea of being able to transfer crew using the alt-click menus is a nice one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, this is the first time I saw anything about the Connected Living Spaces mod, which looks interesting and might be one I check out as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
