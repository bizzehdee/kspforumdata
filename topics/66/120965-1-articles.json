Most of that work was invested in improving the build times of the code. Most of you will be familiar with basic code that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s often in an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153if (condition) then action\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 format. While this code can be read perfectly by humans, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not very efficient for a computer, and so to turn this code into a program it is compiled into an executable file that consists of a lot of ones and zeros. The game is compiled a few dozens of times every day amongst the developers, which takes a little more than a minute every time. You can imagine that although this is a short wait, it quickly adds up. If we can reduce the compile time then the developers can work a lot more efficiently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe (Harvester) has been working on this, but the tool he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s writing to save him time is taking a lot of time to be completed, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an investment in the future. For now, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found that overclocking the CPU also has a significant impact on the compile times, because the compiling process is single-threaded. Felipe even bought a new processor to help things along: an i7 4790K, clocked at 4GHz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowing development down even further was the sudden release of Unity 5.2 last week, which holds some interesting upgrades to the user interface system: the rendering of the user interface is now done in parallel with scene geometry on a separate thread, which should mean yet more increases in performance for KSP. Of course, no update will happen without a few small issues, and sure enough the update to Unity 5.2 broke some user interface elements, so we had to adjust some code on various levels to fix them again. It took some time, but now everything is working again, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re continuing development of 1.1 on Unity 5.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere in a dark and no doubt rainy corner of the United Kingdom Mike (Mu) has been working on improving the game experience for beginners and more advanced players alike. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been developing a framework system codenamed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153KSPedia\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE2015, Mike\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s friend Josh) which will be able to developer a much improved and extended help system in Kerbal Space Program. The framework will also be open to modders so that mods can take full advantage of it. Modders will be able to add pages consisting of any native Unity user interface system via AssetBundles. This all means that the system is versatile enough to include a wide range of content such as animations and movies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne area the KSPedia will focus on is the non-obvious keybindings in the game. Many people discover them quite late or not at all. Think of things such as Alt\u002BRight Click to transfer fuel, or pressing F while using the offset tool to toggle absolute and relative position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJim (Romfarer) has been getting stuck in the staging interface even more this week, spending a lot of time making sure the code that splits and merges staging symmetry groups is working perfectly. Splitting and merging staging symmetry happens when you change the default staging list, for example by decoupling two radial decouplers in a symmetry group of six. This often happens when people set up asparagus staging. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also fixed a few visual bugs in the staging interface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast month we asked the community to apply for positions on the experimental team, and we got more than we bargained for! In total Ted had to sift through over 380 applications. Unfortunately we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough positions even to accept all the excellent applications that remained after a first selection, and only 9% of the applicants were accepted. Everyone who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been accepted will have received an email by now. If you weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accepted into the experimental test team we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d still like to thank you for applying, and know that it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t necessarily due to your application being sub-par, if only we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d had more positions open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcitement around the office last week when we were contacted by the CutOut Fest, most likely the largest animation event in Mexico this year, that they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to showcase the 1.0 launch trailer. Animators from all around the world will be present and Dan (DanRosas) was rightfully extremely proud that his animations were selected to be shown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the production side of development Max (Maxmaps) was mostly stuck in meetings regarding the design of 1.1 and coordinating the Unity 5.2 update. In the little time that remained he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been mostly busy taking care of streamlining the accounting and invoicing process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the community end Kasper (KasperVld) and Andrea (Badie) have been busy preparing the media group applications that will launch later this week, probably tomorrow. The applications will target YouTubers with between 500 to 10,000 subscribers with at least 250 views of their latest Kerbal Space Program videos, and Twitch streamers with between 500 and 2500 followers who have a concurrent viewership of at least 50 viewers. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be looking for content of exceptional quality for this category of channels. Channels with more than 10,000 subscribers (YouTube) or 2500 followers (Twitch) can contact KasperVld directly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also launched a new community art contest last week, in which we ask you to design a fantasy box-art for KSP. This can take the form of any physical medium on which KSP could be distributed, such as DVD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s USB drives or even floppy disks. Definitely check out the contest on our forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also seen the arrival of a new streamer on KSPTV: Oaktree42 will be streaming weekly on Thursdays at 11AM ET, or 15:00 UTC. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very likely that another streamer will be joining the channel, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep his name under wraps until everything is final. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to point your attention to the ESA moon challenge. There is a famous xkcd comic titled \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csix words [you never say at NASA]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, which are \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cit works in Kerbal Space Program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Well, as it turns out those words can now be heard in the hallways of ESA! The ESA Moon Challenge asks students to design a mission scenario and operational concept for their HERACLES study. Kerbal Space Program is suggested as a visualization tool for these scenarios, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be supporting the participating teams if required.
