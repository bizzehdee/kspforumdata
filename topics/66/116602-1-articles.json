Isn\u0027t this impossible as you cannot make accurate burns as an EVA Kerbal?\n\nKerbals are automatically oriented in the normal axis while on EVA, so North/South burns are easiest to get right. For radial and prograde burns, I look at map view to find a visible target (usually the body I am orbiting). Early in the mission, I would try to either face the Kerbal toward the body or toward prograde before burning, but reorientation is an expensive waste of propellant so as I got better I would just approximate the burn from whatever direction I was already facing.\n\nRegarding burn magnitude: For big burns, I calculated out how much propellant it\u0027s going to take and/or how long the burn should last. (The full jetpack is 620 m/s and acceleration is about 3 m/s/s.) For small burns, I make very small inputs then switch back and forth to map view to see how I\u0027m doing. Since the jetpack does not have a throttle, burns need to be at least 0.3 m/s or else you will overshoot the burn. For very tiny orbital burns, that means waiting until you are closer to your target in lots of cases. (There were a ton of deep space corrective burns not shown in this video because frankly they are boring.)"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T21:34:16Z","Content":"Amazing.
