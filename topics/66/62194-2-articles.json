I am really happy to see that a new tutorial is being done and that Multiplayer support is being started in the pipeline. I typically only play Multiplayer games because I like to socialize with friends in different areas while playing. I was anxiously awaiting the release of Dayz and Playing World of Tanks when KSP caught my attention from a blog on the intranet at work. The people I play online with are interested in KSP but the problem is we can\u0027t play together in a multiplayer environment. We can\u0027t share designs, progress, or anything else so KSP ended up sidelined by the ones that have bought it. Just the other day I was talking to my buddy about how I have a Space Station orbiting Duna with landers and I wanted to drop its orbit to about 10KM and undock a lander to start it air braking while I thrusted the Space Station back up into orbit and if the game was Multiplayer it would be nice to have him piloting the lander while I controlled the Space Station. We really want to collaborate on missions and designs but are just unable to do so in real time. The Tutorial should help some of my friends that got quickly frustrated with the learning curve and Multiplayer will create a stronger and larger community around the game. I think it was a very wise call to start projects that will expand the customer base and ease the learning curve so people don\u0027t give up on the game before they even figure out that you can\u0027t just shoot a rocket straight up to acheive an orbit.
