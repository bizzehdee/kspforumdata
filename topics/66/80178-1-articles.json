You watch a cinematic once (I didn\u0027t even feel like watching this one), you see an EVA suit multiple times. Advertising is important, but actual game content is even more so. This model would probably work in game, though. KSP isn\u0027t really graphics-intensive, it\u0027s CPU limited most of the time. Large textures might be a concern, but that\u0027s only due to Squad\u0027s bone-headed texture loader.
