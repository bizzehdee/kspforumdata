There is at least one (possibly two?) major memory leaks in KSP 0.90.\n\nWork with any tweakable part for any extended period of time and you can see the game\u0027s memory footprint grow at quite a considerable rate. There is also still a major decoupler bug that at certain speeds decouplers experience phantom forces. Nullref\u0027s also occur in stock.

Or at least I\u0027ve only noticed it when trying to place a node fairly close to my ship on a hyperbolic plot. If that is what causes it to bug out and you don\u0027t ever place nodes under those conditions then you won\u0027t see the bug occur.\n- The third one... maybe he doesn\u0027t use the gizmo that much. If it\u0027s bugged and you don\u0027t use it, how are you to know it\u0027s bugged?\n- The fourth one... That seems to happen primarily when strutting the part that you want decoupled. Which most of us do, I think, but you can get away with not strutting if your design is light and you don\u0027t mind your SRBs flopping a little. I\u0027ve never seen an unstrutted part decouple improperly with the radial decouplers.

When you can and can\u0027t switch from radial to mirrored, and how mirrored chooses to mirror based not on absolute coordinates but includes the rotation of the craft, works esoterically at best and simply doesn\u0027t work at worst. Also, re-placing symmetrical items frequently breaks action groups, so the one you actually placed is still in the action group but the other ones are not.
