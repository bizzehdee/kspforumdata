I\u0027ve always enjoyed the dev notes quite a bit, especially back when they were in the KSP Weekly format, but as of late I\u0027ve noticed that I\u0027ve been checking for them far less frequently, and when I do I\u0027ve been winding up feeling disappointed more and more often by the lack of info about the game. The amount of conversation occurring within the threads also appears to have slacked off with time, so I\u0027ve been getting the impression I may not be alone in that, and that it might be worth pointing out as a potential trend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, thanks for taking the time to discuss it.
