Anyone going into a high Kerbin orbit sees K for kilometres. Everyone who reaches a solar orbit sees M for Megametres. Anyone who sends a ship onto a solar escape trajectory and waits long enough will see G for Gigametres. People abusing physics might well see T for Terametres. What most people don\u0027t know is that KSP also has P for Petametres, E for Exametres, Z for Zettametres, Y for Yottametres and X for eXtreme distances (I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a name for that, and it\u0027s not an SI prefix), but then it loops back round to m again.\n\nThe logical reason is that the letter comes at the end of a line of numbers. Since we use the decimal system, each number has ten possible values (0-9)\n\nLook at the list of prefixes: m, k, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y, X. That\u0027s ten. Having ten values probably made it easier to code, and I doubt the dev who wrote it (presumably Harvester) thought a value of 999999X (~10^33 m) would be too small. The real-life observable universe wouldn\u0027t even need the Y on KSP\u0027s scale. Radius of approx. 440000Z on KSP\u0027s scale."},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T12:42:49Z","Content":"Welcome back Danny!
