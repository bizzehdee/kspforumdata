We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in the final stages of a process that brings us to the first QA tests of update 1.1! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe (HarvesteR) has been working on the user interface for the map view and the orbit rendering in it. The orbit rendering is one of the most complex systems in the game and quite a tangle of code to unravel, but like many of the other parts of the game we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve tackled due to the update to Unity 5 it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been needing a rewrite for a good while now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast week we talked about the toolkit that is used to draw the orbit lines, Vectrosity. We mentioned that it had been updated to accommodate Unity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new user interface system and that we had to rewrite large parts of our code to make everything work again, and it turns out it took even more than we had originally anticipated. Felipe ended up editing of the toolkit source code as well because KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s map view isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153normal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 game setup: there are several cameras at work, rendering from different layers in different coordinate frames, and the splines fall right in that weird in-between zone which isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t easily identifiable as a worldspace object, nor as a screenspace one, because in a way they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese cameras render in screenspace, but they take coordinates from worldspace points, and depending on the map zoom, they shift from rendering in a 2D canvas to a 3D one. Long story short: it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s complicated. Ultimately, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working again and even got a few improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the orbit splines taken care of we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve moved on to the map icons. These are the graphics that are drawn on top of the orbits and show your position, apoapsis, close approaches, intercepts and so on. In the old system we relied on one method called GUI.draw to draw all these icons onto the screen, and while it was a quick way to produce UI controls quickly it also meant that we lost a lot of control over the objects that were being drawn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the new user interface system each icon and other UI control point is its own actual object, which means we can spawn and remove them, (de)attach them or send information to them from the orbit renderer, and on top of that they all handle their control inputs autonomously. Ultimately this is a good thing, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also a major revision of the interface logic for orbits and map objects in general. Implementing this new system in a way that can integrate into the bits we want to keep from the old one is a large and ongoing task, but ultimately it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Felipe has been working on the map view interface Jim (Romfarer) has been working on the staging interface this week. The backend code of this part of the game is yet another part that was in need of a critical look, and he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s now working to make the user interface talk with the underlying systems in a reliable way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from all the ongoing work on the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s interface, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re planning to implement a number of features to improve the accessibility of the game, making the game easier for complete novices through a number of methods. Mike (Mu) has been coming up with some great and interesting ideas in this area and although nothing is definitive yet we should be able to bring you some news on this over the coming weeks. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also heard he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very happy with the new computer he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s built, which has improved his compile times immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of workstations, Ted finished up moving house this week, got his new workplace all set up and is ready to dive back into the swing of things. Most of his time was spent in the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153daily grind\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and updating the internal documentation in preparation for the upcoming QA of update 1.1. As we progress through the development of 1.1, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s becoming more clear where the growing pains and areas of issue are, so modifications to the documentation are made to provide the QA team with a solid foundation to start testing soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFriday was a very interesting day at Squad for many reasons. Firstly, the Squadcast was hosted not by Miguel (Maxmaps), but by Kasper, Ted and Andrea (Badie). In a mission that Ted described as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbrilliant\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and Kasper as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctypical Squadcast\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 a rocket blew up on the first attempt due to lack of struts, then at the second attempt it made a full 360 degree flip on its way to orbit and ultimately landed safely at Duna, only to see the payload explode at the very end of the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere was Miguel then? He had caught a plane to the PAX Prime convention in Seattle for then mysterious purposes. By now everyone probably knows he was there to announce the Wii U port of KSP during Nintendo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Nindies at Night\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 event. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s back with us now and although he had a great time at the event he seems to have contracted the zombie plague, no doubt from the many handshakes, high-fives and hugs he received from fans and developers at the convention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis week both Kasper and Marco (MarcoSS) have started their university curricula again, and both in the Netherlands! Marco is there to obtain his master\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s degree in Game and Media Technology, while Kasper is shooting for his master\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s degree in Criminology.
