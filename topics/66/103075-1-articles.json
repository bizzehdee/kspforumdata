The build system had to be reconfigured, which took quite a good deal of time and during which we were unable to run builds as often as we would\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve liked\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 While the QA process was slowed down by these server issues, I took the opportunity to do things that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had in my wish list for a very long time:\n\n- Added TrackIR support to all game views, plus independent toggles for each of those in game settings\n- Added Field of View control to the main flight camera. (Hold modKey and zoom)\n- Added confirmation dialogs .prompting you to save the current craft on leaving, loading or creating a new craft to the editors.\n- Added a confirmation dialog before overwriting a previously saved craft file.\n- Part test contracts now round their altitude and speed envelopes to much more sane values.\n\nAlso, Kerbonauts now cost Funds to hire. The cost of hiring more crews increases for each additional crew member in your active roster, that is, hiring your 30th Kerbal is much more expensive than hiring your 5th one. This cost increases based on your current active crew count. That means, for instance, that going through 100 Kerbals would be far less expensive than having a roster with a hundred active ones. \n\nAnd lastly, this is something that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still working on today, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m adding a **togglable** camera wobble system, to allow cameras to shake and vibrate in response to external forces. Currently I already have implemented effects when pulling high Gs, when rolling over the ground, and when intense aerodynamic effects are acting on the vessel. there are still a few other causes which I hope to implement, but even now this system already promises to be a significant enhancement to how flying feels.\n\n**Mike (Mu):** Another fun week of bugs and balancing. Have put a lot more work into the aero/thermal side of things plus fixed a load more issues besides. \n\n**Marco (Samssonart):** Last week was all about the demo, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fun having to work on something that involves everything, every area of the game. This week I worked on some general restrictions the demo has with respect to the game, this is a previous necessary step before I dig in and start butchering sandbox and career mode. Other than that I got my Tutorials Git branch as tidy as possible because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about to enter QA, so that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another thing that will be keeping me busy this week.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas):** This week I took some time out of rendering and animating to improve Valentina\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cinematic model. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right, she\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be having an appearance in the new animated adventure. The face rig that the Kerbals are currently using is a bit old (that means I did some amateurish mistakes) and has some performance issues, while being referenced inside the Maya scene. Hopefully Valentina\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s will prove that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s better to change all the mouths for the sake of easier animation. \n\n**Jim (Romfarer):** This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve focused on bug fixing, the sort of bugs that have come from merging all the branches together. Between that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve worked on getting the resource panel in the Knowledge Base up to standards. \n\n**Max (Maxmaps):** Tuesday already? Crud. Been way too busy with the business side of Squad HQ to plan the April 1st thing tomorrow. There might not even be one and that makes me sad in the heart. Besides that, helping out Dan with the 1.0 animation stuff, and making sure all the content from our awesome collaborators gets in the game in an orderly fashion. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s kinda amazing seeing the devs working in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153beta\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 mode, where they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just adding small things and doing polish instead of crafting behemoth systems. Kinda like modding their own game, really. Mind you, you have to look past the actual behemoth systems that still had to be made for 1.0, aero is big. Really, really big. You think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a long way down the road to the chemist\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just peanuts to the aero overhaul.\n\n**Ted (Ted):** Over the past week we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on QAing the develop branch, with pretty much everything merged in that needs to be. Now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a matter of clearing up the issues remaining on the develop branch and adding polish touches that have been pending a while. \n\nThankfully the build server issues have resolved themselves for now as well.\n\n**Rogelio (Roger):** I fixed some shots of the smoke simulation, when I started to do some render tests I realized it looked weird on some frames but I fixed that and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on the scene lights, I think that should be done by the end of this week, and then the compositing and FX part will consume the art department resources. .\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld):** It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a relatively quiet week which was rudely interrupted by a spam bot on the forums that posted more than a thousand blog entries with links to several shady websites. Because the blog system is a bit \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153tacked on\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to vBulletin, some of the normal moderation tools aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t available for them and so I spent a few hours .manually deleting every single blog entry. Looking forward to the IPS4 update if and when that comes around. Facebook seems to be messing with its metrics a bit lately, which results in some confusing numbers but I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bore you with the details on that one. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T17:30:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T22:06:45Z","Content":"Quite a lot of progress, guys.

First, the modder code might simply be a hack around the main code, that would not be needed if the devs made the feature themselves. Second, unlike other devs in another companies, AFAIK SQUAD does not force you to waive your IP when modding KSP automatically, so technically the modders code is not open for their use automatically ( leading to negotiations about it\u0027s usage that can be simply avoided if you just redo from scratch ). Third, the devs might believe that adapting the current mod code to the main code will be a bigger workload then doing it from scratch.
