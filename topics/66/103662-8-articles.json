Those values are now defined separately for each possible situation, so we now keep vessels in the atmosphere (or in sub-orbital trajectories) loaded up to 22.5km away. That means falling debris can now easily hit the ground (or KSC facilities) during launch, other vessels can reenter with you and actually hit the surface, quite a few interesting things.\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nSpecifically: orbiting craft are not in atmosphere. Bases are not on suborbital trajectories.\n\n The only two times I can think of that this might cause problems is during launch or if you have multiple craft flying in formation in atmosphere (or suborbitally). The first is by design; yes, you will see more lag if your rocket shreds itself, but that\u0027s the tradeoff SQUAD chose to make for the increased relevance of the actions of the debris (to wit, possibly damaging your space center or other craft in the area). The second seems like increased load distance is what you would want anyway, since flying in formation is impossible if your wingmen disappear."},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T13:13:17Z","Content":"From the East end of KSC runway to East end of the island runway is approx. 31.4km.
