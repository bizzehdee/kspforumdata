(This was also kind of my point, let\u0027s say only 5% of players visit this forum; those are the\u00A05% of the players who\u00A0actually care about development news, the other 95% are casual players\u00A0who likely don\u0027t read patch notes or have any desire to be involved in the progress of the game.

I follow the development of a few other indie games and frankly I\u0027ve always preferred Squad\u0027s weekly, reliable updates over the sporadic, scattered \u0022mini-blogs\u0022\u00A0the other devs seem to prefer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeking new customers/players is important, certainly.

Not exactly looking forward to the umpteen scattered, duplicate threads we\u0027ll have whenever a single rogue news item pops up on reddit or twitter, made by posters trying to bring it back here either.

Excluding the super complex mods that deeply mess with physics, the vast majority of mods made in 2014-2015 for the 1.0 version can be recompiled on 1.4.5 with only a few trivial changes. The reason why a lot of mods from this era has been abandoned is most likely because a lot of modders, including me, don\u0027t have much time or interest to work on them. Since KSP is very mod-friendly, you can create mods quickly and easily. That mean that a lot of mods get created by a lot of people, then gets abandoned because they move on to other games or activities. To a certain extent, I think this is also happening with the \u0022major\u0022 mods that have been supported for 4-5\u002B years by the same authors. They lost interest.

A game that is \u0022finished\u0022 is a dying game. There is and will forever be bugs to be fixed, performance to be improved, physics to be made more accurate, graphics to be made nicer, features to be reworked or added. We should be grateful that Squad is still adding content and refining the game for free so many years after release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-06T16:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223462860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178756\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221538776196\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022128643\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Poodmund\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Poodmund said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, with specific regard to your post, I appreciate that a great number of mods only required recompiles to get functioning in 1.4.* but the prior\u00A0patch release scheme and large changes to the code base since 1.0 causing mods to be rewritten, refactored etc. has driven a lot of developers away from maintaining their mods, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and Sigma: Dimensions\u00A0being prime examples where authors have lost interest in publicly releasing their mods\u00A0and its a testament to how many mods LinuxGuruGamer now maintains.

I see alot of talk in this thread about squad updating to frequently and changing the API thus breaking the mods. But at same time we ALL want squad to make the game better with more features and whatnot with meaningful updates. So i got a question: How do the players expect squad to accomplish all that if people are going to be poodleing about it when they do? It is like dammed if they do and dammed if they dont. You guys are putting squad in a very awkward position it seems to me. Update the game and make it ever cooler and funner then it is now\u00A0or dont update so mods can catch up (when they get around to it in their free time or maybe never) Personally me, I am on squads side this time. I want the game to move forward in development thats why i bought the game in 2011. Mod makers well, as always, maintain your mods and play catch up even if they change the API on occasion. Mod making is strictly voluntary no mod maker is obligated to update or continue a mod its totally at their discretion and at their convenience. I do have one request though to the mod makers. If ,for whatever reason, you decide to no longer continue to update your mods consider passing the torch to another modder or if that is not a option communicate with people your intentions of no longer updating the mod. To just abandon a mod and leaving people hanging with no\u00A0communication (even PM\u0027s you do know we know if you have read them right?)is just uncool\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-06T17:20:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2018 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Redneck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThirdOfSeven","CreatedById":135015,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-06T17:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically update every 3 months makes any serious project in this game nearly impossible without freezing it on your PC and not getting updates anyway (cause anything like career or crafts may break).
