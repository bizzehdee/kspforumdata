I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve implemented a cool system for showing the upgrade effects on the KSC facility UI and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been previewing the effects for the next level, which uses text replacement tags. I borrowed them from the random backstory generator we created for Contracts. It replaces specific tags with the value of the given upgradeable rule based on the given facility level. This means we can quickly and easily show what each facility does, and will do at the next update level, in full rich text format.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Next up, it was time to actually start implementing these rules. This may seem like a backwards way to work, but really, the subjective difference between a game rule and a bug is 90% .in how it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s presented to the player. I could, for instance, restrict vessels above a certain total mass from launching with 2 lines of code, and that would be immediately reported as a bug; and rightly so. If the game doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t explain why you aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t allowed to do something, you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if it was intentional or not, and generally in those cases, we all assume it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not. .\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So as you can imagine, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing a lot of UI work this week, to make sure players are always aware of the restrictions that come with the lower levels of each facility at KSC. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve even added a new app to the toolbar that appears in the VAB/SPH, that keeps track of your craft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stats like size, part count and total mass. It also changes color to let you know if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re exceeding some limit (the limit is also always shown). It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a huge amount of work, but I feel it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be completely worth it in the end.\u0026lt;strong id=\u0022docs-internal-guid-5b47822d-e8d2-c8d7-5262-800b8ba823e7\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;About the gameplay restrictions themselves, this is something we gave a lot of thought, and it was the one place where I really didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to just do the simplest solution and call it a day. Upgradeable facilities has been one of the longest-pending planned features, and we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be doing it justice if all you got from it were some small perks here and there. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going through all levels of game code here to implement rules that will have a properly significant impact on how the game plays out.

Models are nearing completion for this release, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting into that extra detail phase for all the assets. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;One interesting thing that we were thinking of implementing was a baked occlusion on the vertices of the models, for all the assets that are on the space center. With the aid of Marco, we did a surface shader that could multiply the occlusion to the diffuse color, and in some parts it added a neat touch. Unfortunately, most of the models are made taking into consideration the amount of resources they consume in the game, and most walls, or columns, are planes with tileable textures, so that makes it extremely hard to bake an occlusion in vertex level without adding more tris or doing some retopology. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong id=\u0022docs-internal-guid-5b47822d-e8e0-4806-8359-82b7376cf630\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;For the first time ever (i think), my GUIs were the first to go into testing.
