This is caused by both absence and a large chunk of work on the community side of things: Kasper (KasperVld) is on \u2018vacation\u2019 for two weeks, studying for two large exams and rushing to meet a thesis deadline at university, while Andrea (Badie) and Joe (Dr Turkey) have spent a lot of time to make sure our attendance at the Playstation Experience last weekend went off smoothly. Those of you who attended the event will have had the chance to experience the first playable console build of Kerbal Space Program (on PS4 of course) and to meet our very own Dan (DanRosas)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn to the development of KSP 1.1 then. Felipe (HarvesteR) put in some overtime to fix several critical issues with the port that were holding back the rest of the development team. It\u2019s crunch time in that department as well then, as we\u2019re gearing up for a winter-stretch to make sure 1.1 is released as soon as possible. We\u2019ve postponed our traditional two week end-of-year vacation time to make this happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that a lot of progress can be seen from last week: several fairly significant bugs in the construction, staging, flight and map view areas of the game were fixed, and going through the list it seems that we\u2019re very near to complete the user interface overhaul now, aside from the long list of small details that we wish to address. Felipe especially was very excited to see the game go from a \u201Cbroken mess\u201D to \u201Csomething playable\u201D this week, because months of work on something that just didn\u2019t work was starting to get disheartening. We\u2019re now at the point where it\u2019s quicker to list the outstanding tasks than to list the completed tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe indicated that this would be a good time to highlight the overhaul on the orbit splines rendering: the orbit lines you see in the map view. This is one area that has been improved upon greatly in the update. We\u2019ll let the pictures speak for themselves, but the new version of Vectrosity we discussed many moons back is really paying off now as we can do \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/fvspp\u0022\u003Ethings like this\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe was not the only one to take advantage of these new features: Brian (Arsonide) has also jumped on the opportunity to fix one particular issue that was often encountered when dealing with contracts: the direction of the orbit of objects was often quite hard to discern, but the new orbital lines that scale up once they get closer to the object now clarifies the situation\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sT3jJxd.gif\u0022\u003E as you can see here\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile looking at these pictures you might have noticed that the Tracking Station has received a bit of a user interface update as well: the top bar layout is much cleaner and is now consistent with the top bars on the other KSC facilities (editors excluded) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMike (Mu) has been working on the settings screen, which with the console ports in mind did not just require a rewrite of existing functionality, but also needed to be made configurable and needed to include support for different controllers and platforms. The result speaks for itself, and Mike even managed to make it a little bit prettier and a lot more moddable in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe editor parts lists haven\u2019t escaped our attention either, and work on them has been continuing. Jim (Romfarer) has implemented a system where the scrollbar returns to the position it was at before you left the tab, it\u2019s one of those seemingly smaller changes that will improve workflow in the editor quite a bit. For KSP however, the moddability and customizability of the menus means that you can literally have millions of ways in which the parts can be listed with even just the stock parts and menu layout. Fortunately Jim caught this possibility early and fixed the underlying systems or else you would be able to crash the game by simply selecting many, many different category combinations iteratively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob (Roverdude) has been implementing his probe and telemetry system into the Unity 5 branch. The new user interface was \u2018lit up\u2019 for the first time and overall we\u2019re very happy with the result. The interface shows your current control level \u2013being either a Kerbal or a probe core), the signal strength and the method of connectivity which can be either directly to Kerbin, using a relay network or remote control from a piloted vessel. It sounds complicated but works quite well,\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KybLBT2.png\u0022\u003E as demonstrated by this picture\u003C/a\u003E of a probe connecting to Kerbin via an orbital relay network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreparations to put the Unity 5 / KSP 1.1 update through QA testing have also begun: Ted has brought several temporary QA testers on board so that the QA team can work more closely and cohesively to put the upgrade through its paces. Not only the QA team received some attention, Jenkins (the build server that compiles KSP into the different distributions) has had its version of Unity updated to Unity 5.2.3 and few test versions were run on them. As expected, it required a few initial failures to get the process working properly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we move on to the QA process we need to fix all the bugs, and that\u2019s Nathanael\u2019s (NathanKell) area of expertise. Most developers have focused on the user interface lately, but the upgrae to Unity 5 also caused different issues, such as with the game\u2019s audio: engines which used the old ModuleEngines still, instead of the newer ModuleEnginesFX, had an issue where the visual effects worked fine, but the sound effects wouldn\u2019t play on ignition. If you then zeroed the throttle and throttled up again the system worked as expected. A few tweaks in the code later and the engines are now roaring as they should again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you\u2019re in the market for KSP themed Christmas gifts you should take a look at our\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.shapeways.com/shops/kerbalspaceprogram\u0022\u003E Shapeways store\u003C/a\u003E, and the\u003Ca href=\u0022http://shop.maker.tv/collections/kerbal-space-program/\u0022\u003E Maker page\u003C/a\u003E where we are offering new merchandise.
