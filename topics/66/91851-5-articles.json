One thing I\u0027d like to see though which I don\u0027t think is currently in the game is that when the navball switches from orbit mode to target mode, we lose the radial/perpendicular markers - obviously the radial one isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E useful, but the perpendicular marker would be a massive help, in the sense that it was perpendicular relative to the target. Is this something that could be looked at?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T22:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on getting married tomorrow HarvesteR! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
