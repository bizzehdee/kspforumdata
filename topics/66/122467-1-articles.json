As we continued with the work it became clear that some things would be done on schedule while the engine update seemed to be in an eternal state of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cjust one or two more weeks\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. This past week then, our production team - Ted and Max (Maxmaps) - sat down with everyone involved: developers, executive producers, artists, community people, and discussed the possibility of releasing the complete features sooner, in a separate update. That update, is Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What then will be included in update 1.0.5?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Contextual Contracts by Brian (Arsonide)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Contextual contracts aims to turn contracts into a more cohesive experience. To accomplish this a new system was created that detects and creates contracts for existing vessels. The more spacecraft are in orbit, the higher the chances are you will run into one of these new contracts.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thermal Improvements by Bob (Roverdude)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Radiators, the ISRU and RTGs are all getting a bit of attention from Bob! Notably, the radiators can now be hotter than the parts they\u2019re cooling, allowing for active refrigeration, the ISRU\u2019s core now heats separately from its skin, and the RTGs now generate appropriate amounts of heat (though we cannot recommend using them as heaters).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;New, and Overhauled Parts by Chris (Porkjet)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We already showcased a few of the parts that Chris has been working on lately, namely a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) analogue, an overhauled Mk1 Cockpit, overhauled versions of the Basic Jet Engine, Turbo Jet Engine, Mk1 Fuselage, Mk1 Structural Fuselage and Mk1 Intake. These will be included in 1.0.5.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many bugfixes by Nathan (NathanKell) and the other developers\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;NathanKell and the other developers have fixed dozens of bugs that we can include in this update, with the ever invaluable help of the QA Team in triaging, reproducing and fix-testing bugs. The main focus of these fixes are the thermal systems. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve included a full list \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/356-Announcing-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/356-Announcing-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;on the forums\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This week we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve started QA testing different parts of the update already, and we hope to give you a better estimate of a release relatively soon based on how smoothly this process goes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Of course, work on the 1.1 update also continues: Felipe (HarvesteR) has focused on the flight interface, and also changed the workflow a little bit: instead of trying to get through all of the UI, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going through all of the overhauled bits which have been started, but were still pending revisions. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s grown into quite a large list, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s become critical that any interface work that has been started gets finished, rather than keep on going and starting new things while leaving a trail of loose ends.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That means that currently Felipe is going over everything that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s already been moved over to the new user interface, and making sure it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ready to go. That is taking quite a good deal of time and effort, not only because of the amount of work that needs doing, but also because the bar is set very high: this isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a new piece of content we are adding, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a revision of a very large, very established part of the game that has had years of polishing and bug fixing done to it. The minimum acceptable standard of quality is the same level it was at before.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Felipe also mentioned that this week has been a good opportunity to go over areas of the game that haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been visited in a while. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s added a few new things here and there, whenever the opportunity arose. For instance, since the addition crew roles and levels, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve wanted to add a way to display the role and experience level of a crewmember on the main interface. The role and level of crewmembers is now displayed when hovering over their faces, provided it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a career game (where roles are relevant).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;More good news is that with the focus changing from completing the whole user interface overhaul to just completing the already-overhauled segments, the amount of work needed for the user interface work to be ready to integrate with the main development branch is greatly reduced, and we can then add in all the other parallel features that are being developed such as the KSPedia which Mike (Mu) has completed this week. The only thing left at the moment is compiling the help screens which will make use of this new system.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With the work on KSPedia done, Mike has updated the PartTools in preparation for 1.0.5. This is a relatively minor update, but a more interesting one is planned for 1.1 For update 1.0.5 the new PartTools will give modders the ability to use any shader built into the game, and also allows them to create an asset bundle containing shaders (with an extension of .shaders), which the game will load as a normal asset and can then be used in mods! Unfortunately, until the Unity 5 patch hits, these asset bundles will have to be built in Unity 4 which itself requires a Pro license to do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Creating a new tweening controller to handle movable user interface elements was on this week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s task list for Jim (Romfarer). Initially the controller will be used by staging to move the list elements into place. In the new Unity interface the size and position of list elements are handled by their own internal controllers so once an item is in such a list, it can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be moved. As a result a lot of smoke and mirrors are involved in making it look like those elements are moving.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For example, in the simplest case, you pick up a stage group. In order to make the list move fluidly in to close the gap of the element you just removed, a special invisible list element is placed where the element you removed was. Immediately it starts resizing until the height becomes zero and it destroys itself. While the resizing element is in there, the indexes of the stage groups does not match the indexes in the list. And this is what the tweening controller does best, figuring out what is where and where it ought to be as well.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas) made some changes to the Kerbal rig for the animations. A small revision of the mouth made it easier to move the mouth around. The mouth is now a joint based rig, whereas before the revision it was blendshape/curves oriented, which prevented the animations from being imported into Unity. The joint based system will allow these Kerbal characters to work inside the Unity engine.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After his fixes for the 1.0.5 update were complete Nathan (NathanKell) has focused on the bug fixes that will come in the Unity 5 update. Some of these are very infamous, such as launch clamps following the rocket, airbrakes that can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have their action group changed, and various bugs related to the claw. Last week, a technical question related to the RequestResource system was asked, and it so happens that Nathan has also been looking into this for a while now:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow, as is fairly well-known (and was mentioned in the question I want to respond to), that system trawls the entire vessel (if ALL_VESSEL or STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW) or crossfeed-connected parts (if STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH) each time a request is made of a part. Now obviously that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s less than optimal. However, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done for a reason: we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just naively cache all available resources, because at any moment you might decouple, or dock (or go KABOOM) or even you might just toggle the flow state on a resource tank. That could add a resource to the list of resources available, or it could remove it. Further, there can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just be one cache in the case of STACK because that is request-location-dependent. There are ways to do this based on listening for events, and multiple caches\u2013and the new VesselModule system introduced in 1.0 will help immeasurably\u2013but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not an easy thing we can just slap in. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep looking into it, however.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the non-development side of things we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve learned that Kasper (KasperVld) had a great time at ESA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s OpenESTEC event, meeting industry people and representatives from organizations we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve worked with over the past few years. Best of all, he came home with three posters signed by ESA astronauts that we have yet to figure out what to do with. Rest assured that we will make you work for them. He also asked us to remind the university students reading this that the ESA Moon Challenge is still open to interested students, but that the application period will end later this week.
