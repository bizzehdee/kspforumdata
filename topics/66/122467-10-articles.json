Actually (can I go on a tangent for a second?), there\u0027s talk of a police group on Steam for devs, and there is more talk that trolls will flag a dev if he/she\u0027s one day off with the release of an update because of a funeral or something. So actually, maybe it\u0027s a good thing release dates aren\u0027t announced. \u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it\u0027s safe to speak for Squad on this one.

Start about when you reach 100m/s. Pitch about 5-10 degrees, let the prograde marker line up with your new heading and then follow the prograde marker. Stop your turn at about end of atmosphere or even slightly lower. (I like to stop somewhere between 60-70 unless it\u0027s RSS then I stop turning at 100km)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
