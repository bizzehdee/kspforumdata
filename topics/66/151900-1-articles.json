The US election day hangover is still around, but here at the KSP HQ we continue to work hard to build upon this game that has brought so many people together, regardless of race, nationality, gender, religion and political orientation. Without further ado, let\u2019s dive into this week\u2019s news about all things Kerbal!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the QA front, the past week has been taken up with writing more test cases for various aspects of gameplay. This has involved reviewing past reports to gauge where oversights can be avoided. Part performance testing has also been reviewed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, there was also some Test Team management tasks, reviewing Test processes and looking for ways to improve things. Preparing Test Case summary reports and reviewing the QA volunteer team members. Other activities by the QA team have included helping the devs with the part collider review, and other reported public bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, on the bugs front we seem to have finally found the root cause and a solution for the OS-X Sierra permissions issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u2019s not all, we ran into a rather annoying issue, where we would keep seeing graphical corruption while playing KSP and we could not track it down, until one of the glitches stayed visible long enough to see what it was and it was the Steam notifications of friends coming online or playing a game that they were trying to draw on top of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of us also had a blast with KSP and a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, which we got to test a bug but found it\u2019s working perfectly for many airplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the development trenches we have been prioritising some bugs to fix next on the list, getting involved with the new team members and helping out in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, some of the bugs we fixed include that Kerbals can no longer get duplicated names when hired (or generated in contracts) and some other around the resource system that slipped through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, we fixed a bug where fairings kept disappearing when applying settings in-game, as well as one where the terrain textures on the R\u0026amp;D Building looked weird and another where the part action PopUps got stuck on screen when selecting the Astronaut Complex at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also worked on a new feature to get the default keyboard bindings based on the keyboard layout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, we\u2019re keeping up the hard work on the localization process this week; this included adding display names for the resources (bonus side effect: LiquidFuel is now Liquid Fuel in all the UIs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to the art side, we\u2019ve been working on the workflow and various art assets, including some work for our future projects and finishing up the biome maps - specifically, saving Dres for last. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise, the work on the colliders continues. Developers and Artist are working hand in hand on how to optimize the colliders for some stock parts in the game, and fixing small details about them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe art department is also working on some designs for merchandise, including T-shirts and Patches, which we will be able to show you very soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike most of you have noticed, our team has been continuously growing and this week we would like to introduce you to our new Game Designer, Rob Shaer (Robbonaut).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRob lives in the UK with his wife, 2 boys, and a dog (Stan-Lee). Robbonaut has been in the Games Industry 14 years primarily as a Designer but he has dabbled in many aspects of game development over the years. Rob recently worked on Carmageddon: Reincarnation and the digital versions of Magic the Gathering. Going back a few years, some of his other titles include Burnout 3, Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates!, Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice, Motorstorm: Arctic Edge, and Little Deviants. We are really excited to have him in the team and we are sure that his expertise will enrich KSP in many ways. Here are some words Rob wanted to share with us:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Ci\u003EI\u2019m looking forward to getting stuck in with the team, meeting you all and I\u2019m extremely honored and excited to be working on such a great game.\u003C/i\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also wanted to share this awesome picture that @anth12, the Ultimate Bug Hunter, sent us with his reward.

Now, we all know that most companies (and that includes Squad) aren\u0027t very open about internal matters, so that we don\u0027t hear all that much about that isn\u0027t strange either. What Squad needs to do is bring the KSP team up to strength again (which at the moment itobviously isn\u0027t) and then start to work on what they think is best for the game, mixed with what the community is best. As of now, this probably isn\u0027t possible due to internal problems so give Squad some time, let them do the small bugfixes and other problems first, let them work themselves back to full strength and as a community, let\u0027s not moan too much about it. Squad themselves aren\u0027t probably reading this, but the dev\u0027s (what\u0027s left of them) probably are, and they are most like as unhappy (or even unhappier) with the whole thing as we are. So, give them a break, let them recover and when the development ball starts rolling again, let the community requests flood in. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, it\u0027s always good to be critical, and to suggest what you feel is essential, but to bash into Squad\u0027s non-communicative nature time and time again is probably not helping. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
