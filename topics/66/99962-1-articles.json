This includes features like the timewarp-to system and Kerbals being able to clamber onto objects. Those are now integrated and seem to be working fine as far as we can tell. There are several other smaller features that also made it in, which should be at the very least good quality-of-life improvements.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The lift model for wings and control surfaces is pretty much done now, pending only some tuning based on what the QA team has to say about it. The new lift model includes proper lift-induced drag simulation, as well as many other improvements which make flying much more intuitive. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been having a lot of fun with it, and flying does feel a lot more natural.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now this week, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on something which has been widely requested and we reckon it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s due time to address that: fairings. Along with cargo bays, fairings will also let you shield other parts from the air stream, protecting them from drag forces and reentry heat. Fairings are going to be procedurally generated, so you should have a great deal of freedom to build them in any way necessary to fit your payload inside it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a lot more to tell about that, as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve just started doing this yesterday so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very much bare-bones at the moment. But as always: more news on that as it develops.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; I have been spending my time refining and tweaking the aero model with the invaluable help and feedback from the QA team. Adding new features and implementing their ideas to make it a more interesting and stable flight model. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Remember that secret project I mentioned a few weeks ago? Well, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still ongoing and has had very good results, so it will definitely be a thing for 1.0, we are just about ready to reveal the details about it, expect them soon.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In other news I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been taking a look at a few long overdue issues with the launcher and patcher on Mac, the launcher is fixed and the fixed version will be uploaded once we confirm it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s quality stuff and all that jazz Ted takes care of, the patcher\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.is a whole other story, it was originally developed by Rob (N3X15) the code is not easy to look at, I seem to have traced the error and narrowed it down to a few scripts, but even compiling the patcher is hard at this point, I really don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how that will turn out in the end, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep on digging. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the female Kerbals: I had to do a quick retarget inside Maya of all the animations that are being used in Unity. We couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do the retarget with Mechanim inside Unity because we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the legacy animation system, which is extremely technical and not animator-friendly. It will need some further tweaking once some other dev has a look at the code and the way the animations are being called. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In the meantime there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another part of the Kerbal assets that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s being run with Mechanim: facial expressions. IVA Kerbals look good, although there are some troubles with the position of the arms and feet, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m already targeting how to solve those problems in two different ways: I could save a pose inside Maya and apply it to the beginning of each animation, or I could override the bones in Unity. Since the connection inside Maya overrides some other rig properties, reworking the animations there could be a little problematic. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m learning to stop using the Expression Editor as there\u2019s plenty of freedom with the utility nodes to start messing around with always-running calculations. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;I\u2019ve got a little announcement this week concerning the Application Launcher and mods. First of all it will now launch into whatever scene you choose to launch the game in and it will stay alive for as long as the game is running. Second, as a side effect of this, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also added mechanics so you can add apps that show in the main menu. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; I\u2019ve been in meetings: business meetings, travel planning, travel unplanning, and setting up timelines to make sure that all the parts of 1.0 are set in place. I\u2019ve also had a blast testing the new aero system in QA, even if it meant horrific failures because my overly simple ways of doing things clash with a more realistic system. I\u2019ve also been organizing negotiations to have the game show up in more storefronts, and I\u2019m considering cutting Squadcast down to half an hour and maybe prerecording the footage to make sure the gameplay doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get in the way of the news sharing. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Ted (Ted): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;This past week has been a continued whirlwind of outstanding testing and feedback on the aerodynamics overhaul by the QA Team. They\u2019re really getting down the very low level tunings of it and providing fantastic suggestions to the developers on changes that could be made. Additionally, we\u2019ve begun initial balancing of the engines in the context of the aerodynamics changes that have occurred. It\u2019s going very well thanks to the expertise of the QA team members and should continue excellently.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Finally, I\u2019ve been assisting Roger and Dan with some vessels for their animations as well as providing assistance to Marco on his secret project and on the Launcher/Patcher front.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Rogelio (Roger):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time for the art team to begin the new animation for the upcoming release so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been setting up the props we need for dressing the scene up. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a time consuming task because back then when I became part of the KSP team, the assets where named differently as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m used to name them so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been searching in many assets folders. On the other hand some props aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t modeled yet, but as soon as I finish setting up the ones I have for now, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll model them. Also I did some UI images for the female Kerbals-\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Kasper (KasperVld):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Well, where do I start?
