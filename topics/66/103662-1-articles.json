The camera wobble system is set up and operational (and scalable for internal and external views, separately). In preparation for the impending experimentals phase, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been going over several items here which I had on my list, which I felt had to either get added now or get pushed aside:\n\n- The main menu \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153load game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 dialog now shows Funds, Science and Reputation (as applicable depending on game type) for each game, as well as the number of active flights and contracts.\n- The Physics Bubble for vessels is no longer always set to 2.5km. Those values are now defined separately for each possible situation, so we now keep vessels in the atmosphere (or in sub-orbital trajectories) loaded up to 22.5km away. That means falling debris can now easily hit the ground (or KSC facilities) during launch, other vessels can reenter with you and actually hit the surface, quite a few interesting things.\n- I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve added a basic set of custom cursors as well. OS default cursors in a game just scream \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153unfinished\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Although it was a minor addition, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t help but notice how everyone noticed it.\n\nAnd last but most definitely not least (actually, quite the opposite), I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been thinking long and hard about the tech tree here, and a few important thoughts came up. Most importantly, I realized that no matter what tree layout we end up going with, there was one problem with the current implementation which would make any layout frustrating to go through: Until now, only nodes which were researchable were visible. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d only get to see a greyed out node in the few cases where you unlocked one of the required parents for a node (in the very few cases where more than one parent is required to unlock). Now, all unavailable nodes will be visible in this greyed out state from the start, allowing you to see all the way ahead to the very ends of the tree,\n\nThis simple change alone already makes a dramatic difference in how going through the tech tree plays out. Being able to tell what comes next means you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to take Tech nodes at face value anymore. You can now invest in long-term strategies, as you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to see where each branch ultimately leads. You also won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find yourself blindly guessing anymore at the potential future options of a tech node, and getting frustrated when a choice turns out to be a dead end. In addition, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll also be able to select those Techs, view the parts they contain, view their dependencies and costs, all of which greatly enhance your ability to plan ahead and strategize, as you now have much more information available to make informed decisions.\n\nDespite that, though (or perhaps as a consequence of it), I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also gone over the tree itself, and with the help of the debug utilities I wrote the other week, done a *major* revision to the tech tree layout. Being rid of the constraint of having to assume players can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see the entire tree was immensely freeing. I was able to move nodes and parts about and create interesting branch paths with far more freedom and ease. (being able to launch cfg files in N\u002B\u002B straight from the game, and save and reload the tree on the fly were definitely a major help also). IMO, parts are much better organized. Aircraft parts are available earlier, a few redundant parts were repurposed/rebalanced, several new nodes have been added, including a few tier 8 ones, costing 1000 science. It should hopefully be quite a bit more interesting now.\n\nOh, and I also fixed the build server (again)\u2026 Although that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hardly a lot of fun to talk about. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hope it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break again immediately after writing this.\n\n**Mike (Mu):** I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been implementing some new parts from Porkjet and fixing a few bugs. The aero and thermal stuff is now feeling solid and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Thoroughly enjoyed a long weekend thanks to some religious thing too.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart):** This time there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s less to report since we had a short week in the Mexico front due to some mandatory Easter days off. Work on the demo is moving on nicely, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m about halfway there I think, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m starting to get into the career stuff.\n\nQA for the tutorials has started too, there are not a lot of nasty bugs, but there is a fair bit of valuable feedback, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going back and forth between the demo and the tutorials. Oh, and the usual \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbuild-server-is-on-fire\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 situation now and then.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer):** This week i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing more bugfixing. I also had a lovely easter holiday. In more exciting news we did have a discussion about the tech tree and decided to make every node visible so you can see and select everything and better plan ahead. So i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve implemented this functionality into the gui and it should work with all modded tech trees of course.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps):** Deals, meetings and more. Really exciting partnerships in the horizon that we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t quite talk about yet without our surgically implanted NDA devices separating our heads from our necks. Other than that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on our prerelease plans for 1.0, contentwise to be precise. Should end up really cool!\n\n**Ted (Ted):** The QA Team and I have been continuing work on scraping together the last bits of QA and getting them done and dusted. Additional to this work, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been writing and sorting the documentation for the Experimentals Team and testing are up to scratch. With, of course, a few build server issues to contend with in the meantime.\n\nLastly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve managed to get in some good ol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 playtesting and getting as far in Career mode as quickly as possible. So far, the changes that have been made are fantastic.\n\n**Rogelio (Roger):** Finally Im done with the smoke simulation for the video, it was hard to really achieve the desired results, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m glad I did it. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m adding some other effects to the shots where the smoke appears, the smoke is just another character in our new animation, it has its own role (I feel it like my little baby) lol. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been doing some lightning tests and it start to look very cool.\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld):** On sick leave.
