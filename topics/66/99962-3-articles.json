I could be missing something here, but it seems logical to me that at least two more beta updates are needed, one to test the major new systems, and one to verify that any issues found from the previous beta have been fixed without introducing any new issues. I\u0027m sure the QA team is very capable and talented, but it still isn\u0027t a match for the bug finding prowess of a large community with a wide variety of hardware, skill levels, and game breaking talents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen far too many games leave early access too early and get completely destroyed in the reviews (which will highlight everything that is broken, you won\u0027t have the luxury of people overlooking major issues anymore because of early access) which leaves a bad mark on the game that is nearly impossible to remove even if the game is fixed with a later update. A lot of reviewers will only review the game once (when it hits 1.0) and many more people will base their buying decisions on these reviews and not take the time to see if the game has been fixed since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t want to see this happen with this game, I guess I\u0027ll have to wait and see and hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Still looking forward to new features after 1.0, I just hope that the 1.0 release is rock solid and can stand on its own so if I dig out a boxed copy in 20 years I can still run it (maybe with the help of a vm/emulator if needed) and enjoy it for what it is without having to deal with issues that should have been fixed before release, even if they were addressed in a later update that I might not have access to at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T18:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
