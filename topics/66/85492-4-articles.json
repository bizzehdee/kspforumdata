So you need to use funds to build the tracking station so you can do more than one flight at once, you need to pay to open the astronaut complex once you need more astronauts than Bill/Bob/Jeb. You want spaceplanes? You have to build both the SPH and the runway. Maybe the buildings themselves would need to be upgraded: want you use the SLS parts? You need to upgrade the VAB to something bigger. Want to track spacecraft beyond Kerbin\u0027s orbit? Upgrade the tracking center.

I personally find it helpful to keep in my mind that KSP is Kerbal space \u0022Program\u0022 and that a space program includes a wide array of elements to manage. ILR Having to repair and prep launching facilities is a substantial element requiring planning and resources. Having the underlying architecture in the game code to support this is frankly essential. Whether a player chooses to use it or not is a decision based solely on their individual play style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, kindly consider my past and future play possibilities: When the 23.5 ARM release appeared, I like most others dove in and danced with a few asteroids. However, I now primarily ignore them. Not because I dislike asteroids in the game, but that I have other interests and have decided to not leverage asteroids in my mission designs. NOW... IF it is the case that an asteroid might hit KSC and wipe out parts of my facility, then I would probably (and very quickly) warm up a \u0022claw\u0022 or two and have then parked nearby Kerbin just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tend to think that Squad has an evolving vision of the game (as with nearly all complex undertakings) and having the new DA functionality available to devs and modders opens up a wider set of options for future expansion. Every small step (if taken carefully) will support a more complete game environment in the end at the 1.0 reveal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways... that\u0027s my two pence, YMMV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-28T08:33:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2014 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESchpelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
