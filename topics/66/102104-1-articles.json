The pack includes new docking ports, fairings, a heat shield, a service module and much more to make the pod look the part.   \n\nThere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an impressive list of supported mods which includes Ferram Aerospace Research, Deadly Reentry, TAC Life Support and Connected Living Spaces, and you will need the AnimtedDecouplers, Realchute and ModuleManager mods installed for it to function fully. All in all, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a function-packed and very neat mod.\n\nMore information \u0026 downloads in the [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**Forum Thread**!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T22:09:09Z","Content":"Interesting...."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T22:37:17Z","Content":"One of my favorite mods.
