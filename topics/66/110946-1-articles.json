Keep enjoying KSP!\n\n* * *\n\n**Felipe (HarvesteR)** \n\nWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re chugging away at the Unity 5 upgrade here, and as I probably already said last week, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s by no means a small task. Read on for more about that. On my end, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been revising shaders and tweaking basic physics.\n\nThe shaders so far have been thankfully quite compliant; the terrain shaders required a bit of shuffling around, as they are right up at the limits of SM3 constraints, and U5 adds a couple of new things that effectively give us fewer texture interpolators to play with. We were only one interpolator above the limit though, so some tighter packing of input data and a few lines moved from the vertex program to the frag program solved the problem.\n\nAs for physics, U5 and the new PhysX 3.3 (last week I wrote 3.5, that was a mental typo) have changed the internal limits of springs in joints, which as a result, meant some vessels were looking a bit like\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 overcooked spaghetti. This was fortunately easy enough to tweak, just upping the global tuning factor for joint rigidity until joints felt normal again.\n\nThe one thing that is giving me a run for it are the wheels. The new wheels in Unity5 apparently still have a few issues of their own, which makes them very much unsuitable for their job of being wheels\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 They become unstable if other rigidbodies are attached to the wheeled body, which in our case means the other 100\u002B parts that make up the ship. Needless to say, that was a problem.\n\nThere is a solution, however, and this is why I love Unity (I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even get paid to say this). If something doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fit your needs, there is in 99% of cases something you can get that will do the job as you need it done, and once more we turned to the Asset Store and found a very cool package that handles vehicle/wheel physics in not only a very realistic way, but that is also module-based and fits right in with our own part modules scheme. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very much looking forward to starting work on it.\n\nNow, one big question from last week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s feedback was about the state of a 1.0.3 revision patch. This is being developed in parallel. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting together the most important fixes and QA testing is already in progress. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re targeting primarily a memory leak with the temperature overlays, and also the most important balance issues both around part stats and physics constants.\n\nDo keep in mind though, that balancing is very much a subjective thing, and what feels right for one may not feel right for others, so the bottomline is that there is no exact solution to it. We aim to hit a happy middle ground, but we can only act on feedback accumulated over a reasonable period of time (at least several weeks), and from which we can identify a general trend towards a specific direction. My point with this is that 1.0.3 is firstly focused on fixing technical issues, then glaring balance problems and potential exploits, and lastly, subjective balancing, when applicable.\n\nAnyhow, we expect the patch should be getting ready to go soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 In terms of days, not weeks. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about as accurate as I can be without making stuff up.\n\nLastly, a preemptive answer: No, 1.0.3 won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be built in Unity 5. That upgrade will still take a while. The patch will be using the same Unity version we built the 1.0 release on (4.6.4).\n\n**Alex (aLeXmOrA)**\n\nWorking to have the accurate and final servers for our websites. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re deciding which one is the best option according to our needs. Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m helping with the KerbalEDU final builds, so TeacherGaming can release them soon.\n\n**Mike (Mu)**\n\nWhat a fun week it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been. We embarked on the Unity 5 upgrade last week and decided that we would consolidate all of our UI systems on to the Unity native UI system. So thus i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been going through the entire game and replicating, rewriting and reworking every piece of UI. This is a bit of a chore but the rewards for it will be great. The game will run faster, be slightly smaller, be more easily moddable and, just as important, be faster to work on. It also paves the way for future enhancements and allows for much better scaling with odd aspect ratios, screen resolutions. There will also going to be a UI scale slider for those amongst you with really good/bad eyesight.\n\nAside from the mountainous UI upgrade i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been putting a few hours into the 1.0.3 patch. It features more aero/thermal balancing and fixes a memory leak in the thermal display.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\nFound out a couple of issues concerning the Kerbals that will need to be taken care of once the Unity 5 upgrade of the game is ready to move forward. I started to see what would be the best approach for those matters. I did a couple of graphics for Kasper and Miguel, the plush announcement and the Sally Kerman gif. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also the\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/340-Designing-Valentina-Kerman-a-perfect-badass-Kerbonaut\n[Dev Blog](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/340-Designing-Valentina-Kerman-a-perfect-badass-Kerbonaut)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/340-Designing-Valentina-Kerman-a-perfect-badass-Kerbonaut\nI released last week, in case you haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t read it, about the iteration process of the female Kerbal.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\n*Jim is out with the flu, get well soon!*\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**\n\nWe finally launched our plushies! They are looking incredible and I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t personally wait to get my own. On the general side of stuff, overseeing the U5 upgrade and making sure everyone in our team has what they need, while at the same time we work on 1.0.3. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been organizing travel and the like for the upcoming events this year. Can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait til we are done with Unity 5, as the stuff coming in 1.1 is quite cool and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m eager to share it with you guys.\n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\nQA is focusing on the 1.0.3 patch, mainly addressing the memory leaks, rebalancing a few engine Isp values and some aero tweaks. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been evaluating and developing our internal design and development documentation here though, getting things up to scratch for the long road ahead!\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been an interesting week, mostly in the merchandising department.

Aside from that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve spent some time watching a lot of YouTube videos, not only from some big-name streamers who put out new KSP episodes (Nerd3, JackSepticEye, Quill18 and many others), but I also looked at quite a few channels that were entered in the\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987\n[**Oscar-B Awards**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987\ncontest, and cast my votes as a judge there.

Good to hear ur progressing!\n\nOne question though (about the wheel problem and potential solution). I am not that experienced in coding so i have no idea how easy or good this could be for KSP. So here is the question. Did u try to do something like Robocraft did about the number of parts and stuff connected to part interaction? If i understood their method well this is how they did it (sort of): When you craft your robot using cubes (that would be parts in ksp), the game makes your contraption a single mesh that saves a lot of resources. Now when a part of your bot is destroyed you get a new mesh (i am not sure how they did this). So basically you would always have one rigid body the entire time. Again this is just how i understood it. Maybe im totally wrong here and i hope im at least somewhat close.\n\nIf this is possible it would allow 32bit version to support really huge ships (considering part count) with low resource impact.\n\nKeep up the good work!"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T21:45:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you guys know how much Unity5 will break models?

Ultimately they will need to trust their own instincts and vision."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T00:41:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Felipe (HarvesteR)** \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E .....\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There is a solution, however, and this is why I love Unity (I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even get paid to say this). If something doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fit your needs, there is in 99% of cases something you can get that will do the job as you need it done, and once more we turned to the Asset Store and found a very cool package that handles vehicle/wheel physics in not only a very realistic way, but that is also module-based and fits right in with our own part modules scheme. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very much looking forward to starting work on it.\n\nSounds like this would open up some wheelie good features in the future.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
