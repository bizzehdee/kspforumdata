Opinions obviously vary.\n\nPerhaps because I am not so benighted as to think that farmers=morons, I never saw the problem with it. \n\nLook, as noted, modern rocketry got its start on a farm. If you want to launch rockets, you need a lot of open space, and farms generally have that, plus they generally have several outbuildings that make good workshops, especially since most farms have at least one building dedicated to storing and repairing machinery. I suppose if you want to imagine that they have the weight of the Kerbal nation(s?)/race/whatever behind them from the start it seems a little absurd, but then so would be the idea that they start with a very limited budget. \n\nA farm is simply a good setting if you want to depict the agency starting out on a shoestring budget."},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T07:02:15Z","Content":"\u003E I do hope unmanned vehicles will come first in this new tech tree.\n\nFingers crossed."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T07:31:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps because I am not so benighted as to think that farmers=morons, I never saw the problem with it.\n\nVery nice work with the insinuated insult, \u002B1 internets to you, sir.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Look, as noted, modern rocketry got its start on a farm.\n\nYeah, I don\u0027t care, we\u0027re not launching the initial liquid fueled rockets of the twentieth century, we\u0027re launching Kerbals into space from the beginning.
