I\u0027m not sure this is the right place for suggestions, but the main thing I butt up against in the VAB is trying to make complex craft that have sections joined at odd angles. Like, if I want to join two mk1 fuselage sections together at 30 degrees, to make a curved connector between different sections of a vessel, it gets messy. If certain pieces would snap together neatly at odd angles, it would allow a lot more options for creating complex vessels. Also, I would really enjoy some more complicated missions, e.g. salvage this disabled/damaged craft and bring it back to Kerbin, or land this super awkward object on the surface of whatever moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
