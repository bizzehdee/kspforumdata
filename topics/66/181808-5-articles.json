I think the concerns about the asthetics are a bit out of proportion considering the old version of it, while somewhat more fitting with other parts, looked just plain bad; seems like it might be nostalgia more than objective reasoning to me. Regardless of the whys of disliking the new asthetics, I must say that stats matter more here because the current state of the engine makes it a complete dud worse than the Thud, being an engine clearly (and moreso with the revamp) designed for vacuum use, yet having stats that make it bad in atmosphere and \u003Cem\u003Eutterly terrible\u003C/em\u003E in vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"airtrafficcontroller","CreatedById":174649,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T20:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I like it,\u00A0the textures seem to be in a higher resolution than the old engine and that gimbal mechanism surpassed my expectations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grey version will look good with the Oscar tank and that silver reflective line could be used in more parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the constructive feedback,\u00A0just paint that orange line in grey version with black or white, we already have the orange variant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats it, many thanks to squad and to the artist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nebbie","CreatedById":169696,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T20:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223533115\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181808\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549052726\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174649\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022airtrafficcontroller\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, airtrafficcontroller said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I like it,\u00A0the textures seem to be in a higher resolution than the old engine and that gimbal mechanism surpassed my expectations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grey version will look good with the Oscar tank and that silver reflective line could be used in more parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the constructive feedback,\u00A0just paint that orange line in grey version with black or white, we already have the orange variant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats it, many thanks to squad and to the artist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually like gray with orange stripe...but again, I think the proper thing for Squad to do is have a base texture variant and then separately switchable primary and secondary colors, so that we could just choose which colors it is outright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T23:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks so nice!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T02:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the new version because it got rid of the 2 nasty \u0022attachment blocks\u0022 cube thingies and replaced it with a saner-looking swivel system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a simple bloke.
