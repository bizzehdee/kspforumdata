KSP is literally the last game I would see working on a console; its too technical, its too complex. I fly with a Xbox controller, but I would never ever ever want to do the rest of the game with it.\n\nKSP isn\u0027t done yet, there\u0027s plenty left to do. We all know your team is very small, and frankly any time spent on a PS4 port feels like its being taken from your actual fanbase, your actual customers; to what? Join the multitudes chasing the console gamers?\n\nIt\u0027s sort of ironic that you announced this during the PC E3 showcase tonight. You guys should have been there announcing something new and awesome for your fanbase, to let us know you have plans going froward... not that you\u0027re looking elsewhere.\n\nDon\u0027t know what else to say."},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:37:28Z","Content":"And there we have it ladies and gentlemen. Squad has officially reached the fanbase dissonance event horizon, where no hope for a proper handling of the post-release strategy for this game can ever possibly escape. Here we have a once promising game bursting with potential now hobbling along as a disparate hodge-podge of incomplete features, imbalanced gameplay, and inconsistent styling that is (mercifully) completely fixable by third party modification, and yet due to the limited vision of what can only reasonably be described as an exhausted and impatient corporate structure none of these highly sought after improvements and rebalances have or will ever likely be remarked upon with any commitment or ambition. I am now fully convinced that the future of KSP lays solely in your hands, modding community. As somebody who does not nor plans to ever own a Playstation 4, X-Bone, WiiWiggle or whatever they\u0027re calling it now, I honestly (and forgive me for my bluntness) could not give two flying \\*\\*\\*\\*s about KSP being on PS4. Why anybody thought this would be a good idea is likely to elude me for many months, before I inevitably give up the good crusade of hoping Squad will ever again release a bit of news that is even remotely in line with the general concensus of the community it was made for and just download 42 gigabytes of realism mods.\n\nI give up, guys. I\u0027m so tired, and broken... Goodnight.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T03:46:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:37:30Z","Content":"Plus, more money for SQUAD could equal more dev team, more dev work, and more content."},{"CreatedByName":"Anubis","CreatedById":22917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:37:48Z","Content":".....wow...I LOVE THE NEW DEVNOTE ON 1.0.3, UNITY PORT, and X64 SUPPORT.....congrats on your new cash cow..too.."},{"CreatedByName":"IvanTehFennec","CreatedById":26927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:38:04Z","Content":"This is just plain idiotic.
