Not many more news than that though, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re really just getting back online again\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 For me, quite literally in fact. From the last 2 weeks before the 0.90 release to just a few minutes ago, all my internets were coming through a 3G tether\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Just now the ISP techs finished up and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m properly hooked up with a fiber link.

It was a really good quality time. Now that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re back, I had to do a clean installation of OS to my computer here at the office. I think that after 3 years that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with it, it had never been formatted\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 so, it was already necessary. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m glad I did it, tho! It is running smoother than before and I can work even better. Now, I have to help with support and some little tasks in accounting to keep everything on track for the start of the year. Also, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still deciding what activities each dev will be doing for next releases. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; The, long overdue, holiday season over and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s back to work.

I did my best to provide at least a bit of support during our vacation time, but I fell short, very short, so these first few days I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been answering the mountain of support email from the last few weeks.
