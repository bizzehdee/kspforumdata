It\u0027s annoying but without clean up and now the reduction in scene changes - what does that do to overall memory use and release? Has any efficiency been sought to improve the release of memory? People seem to not want GC, but it\u0027s actually important to long term stability and the game\u0027s memory footprint.\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to learn some basic C# stuff for beginners. I\u0027m slow, but interested and motivated. What Mu is talking about, I think, is a good thing. It will allow for more efficient use of memory by \u0022grabbing the code by the \\*\\*\\*\\*\u0022, so to speak. In other words, instead of relying on Unity garbage collection to release previously used memory that is no longer needed, he is instead trying to close those \u0022memory calls\u0022 himself by optimizing the code. Now that KSP is getting close to 1.0 and feature complete, he is taking the opportunity to condense and streamline. Just my guess. I think it\u0027s gonna make things way-better."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T05:56:17Z","Content":"Any chance water lag will be fixed for 1.0?"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T06:02:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to disable that \u0022feature\u0022?

Has this been partly fixed for 1.0 so it is not SO much of an issue?*\n\n- Degrading FPS on increased memory footprint\n\n*Has this been looked into?*\n\n- Orbital lag in regards to sea render\n\n*Has this been fixed in any way?

If anything the fix to SOI transitions should be a great reason to re-examine the time warp limits and why they exist since SOI transitions will now be handled properly.
