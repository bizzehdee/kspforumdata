Tea and bikkies all round!\n\nTo SQUAD\u0027s critics, I can only say that there was a certain well-known company whose products I boycotted many years ago simply because one outstanding feature of their games proved to be that they were clearly never game-tested adequately, with the \u0027final product\u0027 released with game-breaking bugs that were never fixed despite which numerous expansions were sold, and customer complaints were solidly ignored.\n\nSQUAD, however, gives every impression of being a company that really cares about their product and the player experience. As others have pointed out, it\u0027s highly improbabl that any software of the complexity of a modern game will have no bugs whatsoever on release; we don\u0027t know what bugfixes SQUAD have in store for 1.0, and we do know that they\u0027ve committed to further updates beyond 1.0. Critics, please do continue with your valuable input of keeping an eye on what\u0027s not yet right with the game and letting SQUAD know about it, but please try not to be too negative about the fact that the 1.0 release is likely to be with us sooner rather than later. \n\nI\u0027d also add that personally I haven\u0027t seen Mr Kraken at all in v0.90, which is a vast improvement on 0.23. I\u0027m running 32-bit KSP on a second hand machine with 4GB RAM total, a creaky old graphics card, and Linux Mint. Sure I\u0027ve got the graphics quality turned down, but the game still looks great, and yes, I use mods, between 3-12 of them. depending on what I\u0027m trying out at the time in prepapration for my forthcoming attempt to colonise the Kerbol system.\n\nAnyway - \u0027Yaaaay, v1.0!\u0027 I\u0027m very much looking forward to it!"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T08:22:56Z","Content":"ok..... gregrox, start up the hype thread."},{"CreatedByName":"jedensuscg","CreatedById":76475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T09:05:48Z","Content":"So I understand it\u0027s 100 testers pulled from the most familiar players that know the games in and outs but this is where things go wrong, and where you always end up with bugs in the release phases of each build.\n\nJust using a dedicated team of people that know the game like the back of their hand, and know how you \u0022should play\u0022 the game, means they don\u0027t do all the silly stuff less experienced players do on a regular bases.\n\nJust food for thought. There are a lot of dedicated but far less familiar players that could break the game in ways you never even dreamed up, because they DON\u0027T know everything and do a lot of wacky stuff that veterans know you just don\u0027t do,and won\u0027t even think to try. This is especially important since this will be actual release you are going to get a flood of new players. Previously this was all the early access players. A new build would come out of experimental\u0027s, and get punished by us regular folk...and lots of new bugs would be uncovered. This time around the game won\u0027t have that benefit. It will be getting punished by a lot of new players who are gauging the game as a fully release, bought off the shelf game.\n\nNow I am not saying go picking people all willy nilly. But it would have been nice to see some sort of process where players could apply for a shot to test it, and if you have access to the hours played on steam use that to get a good range of players. Me? No i would not be interested, but I feel that more time and a larger test pool needs to be used for that big 1.0 release. Or as someone said before, a few weeks where early access players abuse it. Since this is FULL ON RELEASE, you NEEEEEEEEED to have all your ducks in a row. This is prime time, going gold, all the marbles. No longer will review sites have to add that caveat \u0022the game is still in development so its OK to expect a few bugs\u0022.\n\nOne could say that we are all testers, but that is no longer true, Next time the rest of use see the new patch, that\u0027s it, release. You don\u0027t want to be like those large publishers, like that one that starts with an E and ends with a A, that uses actual release as a mass beta test (like that one battlefield game, or that city building one...). \n\nSo all I am saying, and it might be that way in this particular test, but don\u0027t have 100 of the top, brightest and most knowledgeable being the sole testers. It\u0027s a lot harder to patch in good will after actual release then it was in early access.\n\nWhat would I do if I was in the position? I would stop sale of the game in early access on steam and the website. Have a two week period where only those who own the game can download the 1.0 update, and let them beat it into the ground, while also giving all the mod authors that are not special enough for the elite club to optimize and bug fix their own mods. This will give the best first impression when the flood gates open. IMHO.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T09:26:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jedensuscg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T10:33:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What would I do if I was in the position?

I mean, you\u0027re right, you\u0027d probably get 20 people doing something dumb like that to troll Squad but, for the most part, I think the bug reporting from users would be much more useful, especially if the game is released as a 0.99 beta or something and they do a quick turn-around into 1.0. A quick version turn-around for bug fixing would add some urgency to bug reporting, plus you could always obfuscate the bug reporting link in a way that only highly interested parties would find it. There are ways to make this useful for the devs. Hell, take advantage of the top QA people to screen the public bug list.

But Squad has answered; they like the two-level setup they have, with an internal test team checking over the reports of the volunteer \u0022Experimentals\u0022 group, who each applied for the job. The bottleneck on release quality is probably not in the testing and numbers of bugs found, but in developer time digging down to root causes of bugs and solving them. They\u0027ve allowed a longer period of time for this feature-locked \u0022Experimentals\u0022 testing cycle, not just for testing, but for fixing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E During the Experimental phase we do large amounts of minor bug fixes, some severe bug fixes and a lot of tweaking. These are cycles that require very specific, dedicated and precise feedback from the Testers and that\u0027s something that is best done with small Teams.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Prior to version 0.15, the Experimental Team didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exist. However, with the increasing size of the KSP player base and the game itself, open testing was no longer a viable option for efficient and spot-on bug reporting and issue tracking. Thus the Experimental Team was created.

Sorting through reports becomes a mammoth task when the overwhelming majority of them are of extremely low quality. The amount of extra overhead this causes ends up having a worse effect that just staying with our core group of really experienced, super efficient QA Crew. Branch testing for QA started as soon as it was possible, and has gone on since. Add to that the fact that we\u0027re effectively scheduling the longest experimentals period in the history of our game, and we can be reasonably certain that most major things will be caught by then."},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:16:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you want the QA team to screen the good reports from the bad, you\u0027ll have a QA team that doesn\u0027t do testing.
