For example, if there is a contract to land on the Mun, which will reward you $10,000, is it a contract you can only do once? Can you only do it X number of times? Can you do it any number of times always for $10,000, or can you do it any number of times, but the reward you get back for each repetition of the contract gives you a lower profit as the previous completion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are 2 great questions I\u0022d like answered myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) My biggest concern is just that, if something is recovered its refunded. If you notice when you \u0022delete\u0022 or \u0022Recover\u0022 something, the button is different. If its not broken up, and is on Kerbal you can \u0022Recover\u0022 it, instead of just removing or deleting it. I\u0027m assuming if you press the \u0022Recover\u0022 button It\u0027ll refund the cost of that part to you if at least partially (I\u0027d be ok if the fuel wasn\u0027t refunded since it was used up and all). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027m worried about this \u0022Grinding\u0022 feature as well. I don\u0027t see why a contract should allow you to do it infinite times for the same payout, unless it was to put an RP element into it. For instance. \u0022Put a probe orbiting the Mun at 20km for an independent business.\u0022 or \u0022Independent Business X wishes for you to collect Mun rocks, bring some back from the Mun Highlands.\u0022 If I had several missions like that which makes it understandable then I\u0027d be ok with constant/same or slightly fluctuating payouts, since you can mark it off as different companies or businesses making the contract, and not just all from the same source.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T21:21:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBob (Calisker):\u003C/strong\u003E Getting ready for First Contract to go live soon but in the meantime, was really stoked to see this Le Monde feature on Kerbal Space Program go live: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/KF4FNb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/KF4FNb\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.
