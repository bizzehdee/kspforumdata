It uses LED\u0027s to track rather than facial recognition. Sometimes the filter is just unscrewing the lens and can be remove/replaced easily. Other times you have to remove it forcibly and permanently, it depends on the camera. FacetracknoIR does not need this, you are correct, however it\u0027s not as accurate in tracking as Freetrack. Though to be honest, I\u0027m not sure for THIS game accuracy matters. I have not tried it in KSP since I do have a TrackIR now I probably won\u0027t bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposedly FacetracknoIR uses a lot of CPU also, I have no idea on that really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you plan to use Freetrack (again, accuracy) you need to know some electroics. How to solder, how to measure resistance for LED\u0027s, that sort of thing. Either that or buy your assembly from someone that does.
