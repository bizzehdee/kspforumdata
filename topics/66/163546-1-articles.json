It was the early 1970s and the US and the USSR were in the midst of the Cold War. Tensions were high between the two superpowers at the time: the United States was engaged in the Vietnam War and the memory of the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh. The real threat of a full-scale nuclear war was however deeply feared by both sides and after what seemed to be a perpetual struggle there was a change in the approach both sides had in the conflict as the two nations started to pursue a d\u00E9tente policy. With the close of the Vietnam War in 1975, relations between the United States and the USSR began to improve, as did the prognosis for a potential cooperative space mission. This is how the \u003Ci\u003EApollo-Soyuz Test Project\u003C/i\u003E came into existence. The \u003Ci\u003EASTP\u003C/i\u003E was made possible by the thaw in these relations, and the project itself endeavored to amplify and solidify the improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It involved the docking of an Apollo Command/Service Module with the Soviet Soyuz 19. This mission ceremoniously marked the end of the Space Race, paved the way to the end of the conflict between the two nations, and the beginning of an age of international cooperation between NASA, the Soviet Space Program - its successor, Roscosmos - and other space agencies. We like to believe that all conflicts can be solved when there\u2019s the will to do so, and usually all parties want peace. What is certain is that there\u2019s always much more to be gained when nations cooperate than when they compete against each other. Luckily the Kerbalkind does not have to deal with such human problems. But you want to hear about KSP development , so without further ado, let\u2019s begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EThe 1.3.1 update is coming along nicely with more work on various bugs for the release\u003C/b\u003E. For instance, we \u003Cb\u003Etweaked the Sun shadows in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E scene that were still flickering\u003C/b\u003E at certain angles for certain graphics cards. We also worked on a fix to vessel ground collision detection when they come off rails that also included recovery parts (for recovery contracts) and when the player changes their terrain detail levels in game which could cause vessels on the ground to explode, or appear underground or appear above the ground. Additionally we fixed other bugs from QA for Localization and while the devs have been working on those fixes, the QA team have been\u003Cb\u003E looking deeper into the tutorials and scenarios\u003C/b\u003E to make sure that all portions are correctly translated. We feel it is imperative that new, non English speakers experience the game without obstacles. We\u2019ve also been making sure that they function correctly for everyone. The testers have been using any time left to go through the bugtracker and check old ready-to-test issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EConsole work is also continuing\u003C/b\u003E. The external QA team has finished the first of several testing rounds and were able to identify a few issues that are being confirmed by our team and later will be fixed by our friends at \u003Ci\u003EBlitworks\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other news, the \u003Cb\u003Ework on the design for the \u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E continues\u003C/b\u003E. The devs are \u00A0working on features including a graphical display for the creator to select vessel parts in various situations and another to set up the available crew in a mission and assign crew members to their vessels. There\u2019s also been work on \u00A0integrating more of the component pieces in the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E and making improvements in the functionality and design as we do that. One of the components that was integrated this week are the logic nodes, which help the creator define paths for the player through their mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the dev team has been \u003Cb\u003Eworking on Vessel Positioning on a Celestial Body\u003C/b\u003E. This has been tricky with all the different scales of the various celestial bodies and we have to make sure that the feel and precision are just right, since it will be used very often when creating missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn an artistic level, the team finished with the \u003Cem\u003EVostok 1-inspired IVA\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and began modeling a new EVA chute. To give you a glimpse of the new IVAs the team is making,\u00A0check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/YUXaO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAmerican-inspired Lunar Excursion Module\u2019s IVA\u003C/a\u003E . Additionally, the \u003Cb\u003Eartists have been producing some more wireframes for how the mission creator will manage vessels for a mission\u003C/b\u003E; tweaking them in a combined effort between the Design and Development teams. The UI got some attention, too; this time around the team worked on some buttons and icons for the orbital gizmo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs new parts get produced, the QA team gets immediately busy with its \u003Cb\u003Etesting and providing input to the rest\u003C/b\u003E of the team by building full crafts to identify balance issues. They\u2019ve took their first look at the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E to check the initial mission mechanics and while there are still some teething problems, as it is to be expected with these early versions, the package is looking great and they are eager to get stuck into testing it fully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we remind you that you still have another week to participate in our latest \u003Ci\u003E\u003Cb\u003EKSP Challenge\u003C/b\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163157-ksp-challenge-landing-on-duna/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELanding on Duna!\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/i\u003E\u00A0So go check it out and share your creations!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s it for this week.
