Answered my question, might clear up some here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Assuming all available contracts have been those I don\u0026#39;t want to do for a while (can happen with randomness) so I had to do them in order to make money/science. The game will then think those are the contracts I prefer when in fact it\u0026#39;s the opposite. How does the system prevent bad luck turning into continued frustration?\u003Cbr\u003E\n[I]1) It\u0026#39;s a cumulative effect that happens over time, once the contracts you prefer show up and you start doing those, they will overtake the others fairly quickly. It\u0026#39;s a weighted influence, and it never hits 0% or 100%. That means nothing will ever completely disappear or completely fill the mission board, but in general, your preferred missions will be much more common.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/I]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) The one type of contract I really like is the \u0022Explore $planet_or_moon\u0022, but those are quite rare and not repeatable. How is a preference for this type of contracts factored into the new system?\u003Cbr\u003E\n[I]2) Unique contracts always appear with default weighting, so they always have a chance to show up with this system. Explore contracts are also getting a few more tweaks that I will elaborate on in future development logs.[/I]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: aaaaand speak of the devil...
