I love KSP, It is the best game I have played ever ( I thought so when I started playing at update 0.15 and still do) and considering I have been playing video games since 1984 that says a lot (I Hope). I do wish people would try to remember that the game is still in development even if it is nearly finished and I think it has gone far beyond the creators wildest dreams. I am a little bummed that there wont be a stock resource system. But if it can not be integrated effectively it is probably best to leave it as a mod for those of us who are more die hard. I would rather they spent their time optimizing the game to work better faster with less resources. THough my PC was top end 7 years ago it is definitely showing its age now and frankly I can\u0027t afford a new PC right now so the more efficiently KSP runs the more I can do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T03:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Can Do!\u0022 spirit that all Kerbals share inspired me to this title idea for .24: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBudget Projected, Contract Accepted!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s keep the positive energy flowing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NKL","CreatedById":68418,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T08:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E64-bit. 8go of RAM.

Now we should consider ourselves lucky if the servers that we constantly have to be connected to in order to play, quite alone, on our own, are up and running, ready to validate your credit card and facebook account if you want to so much as watch the opening cinematic. Back in the day, if a game had multiplayer, it meant that two people who had the game could play the game together, linking their computers and being in the same game environment.

No constant validation servers, no facebook log-in, no small mountain of DLC\u0027s before the game is in a playable state, no forced MMO modes. It really shines through that it\u0027s a game about sending your toy-soldiers-turned-aliens into the space and not about bleeding a certain gaming demographic dry of their money.

Where are all the good ole\u0027 attitudes towards the player base? The fun and warmth in gaming? When did the only priority become creating a profitable business model, rather than a kick-ass game?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou clearly missed the \u0022insert a quarter to continue\u0022 days. Or the legion of crap games that came out with the Atari 2500. Or the price fixing schemes that Nintendo forced on 3rd party developers for the NES. Or having to pay for 5 1/4\u0022 floppies at your local PC shop that had copies of game demos they\u0027d downloaded for free (at 2400 bps) from a BBS. Or when a game publisher would charge you full price for a replacement set of floppies when one of them stopped working. Or etc etc. Back \u0022in the day\u0022 there were no patches: you got what came in the box. If it was buggy, sometimes the developer would fix it, but you\u0027d have to buy a new box to get the fixes. Back in the day, there were games that required you to e-mail the developer for an activation code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no magical golden age of rainbows and ponies when game devs worked on games as a service to humanity, expecting to eat the goodwill of their fellow citizens and be sheltered by the joy they gave the children. Video games have always, always been plagued by DRM, markets flooded with crap-ware, profiteers looking to monetize everything, pay-for extra content, bad customer service, etc. Video game makers have always needed to eat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027d actually say that now, right now, is the real golden age of video games, particularly as consumers. There are more indie developers than ever, with great ideas exploding all over the place. You can purchase (humble) bundles of many extremely high-quality games (DRM free) for $1. Fan feedback and modding communities have taken gaming places that were unimaginable 20 or even 10 years ago. GOG and similar sites are making older (and newer) games easy-to-buy and easy-to-install. (Have you ever wrestled with autoexec.bat, trying to get your memory settings just right so that $50 game you purchased the night before will load up?) Multiplayer is easier and huger than it\u0027s ever been. (Most consumer games \u0027in the day\u0027 were either 2-player over a modem, used hot-seat play, or were play-by-email.) Steam makes maintaining an absolutely huge library of video games that I\u0027ve bought over a decade (mostly for very cheap prices) completely painless; no bookshelves used up; no compatibility problems with new OS releases; no lost discs. There are multiple huge conventions throughout the year geared specifically to video games and video game culture. Video games are a bigger industry than the movies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no desire to go back to the \u0027good old days\u0027. I like gaming where it is right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokker","CreatedById":15359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T21:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the word pwnage applies to the above reply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokker","CreatedById":15359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T22:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iMAniaC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iMAniaC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, this turned out to be a grandpa rant (although I\u0027m not even 30)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet you felt qualified to make such a comment?

I also think that he address fairly not so much the Game industry as a whole but how many of the very largest and most popular game companies treat their customers.
