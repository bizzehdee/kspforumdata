I\u0027ve now replaced them with piloted fly-back boosters that launch in a vertical stack and are then flown back to the KSC runway after separation.

If solid fuel turns out to be cheaper than liquid fuel (as I suspect it will), and if boosters that are deleted in the atmosphere are not recovered, then the fact that the solid fuel is stored in disposable \u0022trash bins\u0022 could make them very attractive for use in first stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also worth bearing in mind that depending on how much the cost of fuel compares to the recovery value of parts, SSTOs could either be very attractive, or a complete false economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KBMODIGITY","CreatedById":80155,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T09:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMG I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cant wait.

Getting just a command pod back to Kerbin requires a little bit of skill (engines to deorbit, press for parachute), but also wouldn\u0027t get you much money back.
