I\u0027ve stopped playing since the the news about 1.0 and the updates it\u0027d bring, as I did not want to feel burned out by the release of 1.0, and I wanted to play it with fresh eyes.\n\nI\u0027m incredibly eager! All the news I\u0027ve heard so far is excellent, and it feels like it is going to be incredible. The only thing I \\_really\\_ hope for in the future is Multiplayer... but I cannot wait for the neat things that the modding community does with the new stuff in the game.

Every update has seen it move in a direction that makes it even more exciting for me. KSP has inspired me to follow space news, watch rocket launches, and read up on history, dive into other space games, and learn C# and Unity coding to mod the game myself. I can\u0027t think of another game, early access or otherwise, that has inspired so much in me. Thank you, SQUAD, for all the hard work!
