And it did because the game was calculating physics for every single part despite the fact nothing was moving so every frame the physics calculation results were coming to the same results as the previous frames. It would be like Excel checking, and recalculating, every single cell in a spreadsheet even when there is no user input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, I no longer expand bases.
