Airbrakes are NOT designed to affect lift and are usually built on to the body of the aircraft, looking very much like the ones seen in the teaser video. They are used to dump excess speed during flight (often during the approach to a runway) *without* risking the aircraft stalling and falling -- which is what would happen if spoilers were used.\n\nYou are right about airbrakes being mounted that way round for safety reasons, but there is another reason: they are more effective opening that way, because they create more turbulence."},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T02:19:10Z","Content":"So much goodness, but was that a working MFD?
