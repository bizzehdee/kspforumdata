I do agree with you though, this sort of thing would have to be VERY carefully done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m talking about here is how for me to get into orbit, it takes about 4700 dV of fuel. Someone a bit better than me could do it in 4600. Some players take nearly 6000. So the pilot of the ship makes a discernible effect on how well something happens. The problem comes when a really good player plays with really leveled up Kerbals, and therefore breaks the laws of physics that you (and I! I promise) are concerned about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess what I\u0027m saying is that IMO it\u0027s the player\u0027s skill that should matter, not whether the kerbal piloting the vessel has enough skill points. The player is the driver, not the kerbal. This is how it is handled in every simulation game I\u0027ve ever played, whether driving, flying, or other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you, though I\u0027m willing to wait on my judgement and see how they do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
