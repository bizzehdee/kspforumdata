That, and a few balance changes, is all I expect. I\u0027ll give it a try, but no doubt I\u0027ll be installing FAR and some version of RSS as soon as they update.\n\nDo you realize how absurd what you just said is ? Saying that you will install FAR anyway for 1.0 WHATEVER the stock aero upgrades will be is really the same as saying that you don\u0027t trust squad at all and that what they do sucks... Maybe that is what you think, but then why do you even play KSP...?\n\nMaybe you\u0027ll prefer the new stock aero over FAR, who knows ? you have no clue until 1.0 is out, and I think that we shouldn\u0027t depreciate anything that we don\u0027t know about.\n\nHow can you not be excited about stock aero, fairings and everything else ? i really don\u0027t understand that...

I said, taking my assessment of squad\u0027s statements and patterns to this point, that I am in no doubt I will not be happy with what Squad is planning. I do not dismiss everything squad does. That\u0027s insanity. But we are not talking magic fairies here. Squad doesn\u0027t conjure updates out of thin air the night before release. Two months in, the major feature decisions have been made. Statements by Squad at this point are based on those decisions. We can and should understand them to be based on facts about the next release. Perhaps they will better my expectations and I will stick with the stock aero model. Perhaps as soon as I post this they will post something dramatic proving my assessment incorrect. That is a possibility. Imho it is just a very remote possibility.\n\nBut we will all see soon enough. Squad is predictable as the tide when it comes to release dates.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T23:01:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:29:41Z","Content":"How about we wait to see what it is before announcing whether we like it or not? \n\nAnd please don\u0027t make the dicussion personal, guys."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T04:12:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m pretty sure you have no idea what you are talking about.\n\nOr maybe you don\u0027t understand what i\u0027m talking about?\n\nAnyhow, people, this is a conversation, not a single post.

After seeing the new stock fairing system, it is nice that it is now in game, the extra control over size at points along the way and not needed another part to do middle section fairings is nice. But I think I still like the mod version better. Maybe Squad can get together with the moder like they did with Rover Dude on resource and come up with a combination of the two systems?"}]}
