[https://www.facebook.com/ftegames](https://www.facebook.com/ftegames), so it\u0027s confirmed that these purveyors of[questionable mobile games](http://www.ftmobile.com/Products/Hookups-Wallpaper.aspx) will be doing it. [http://www.ftmobile.com/default.aspx](http://www.ftmobile.com/default.aspx)\n\u003E I don\u0027t know what to say. Were they the lowest bidder, or something?\n\nOh yeah. I can\u0027t imagine anything else.\n\nFor those who need a little more direct confirmation of the absurdness of this deal SQUAD is cutting, by the way, here you go. It\u0027s official.\n\n\u003E ![jyQRPUz.png](http://i.imgur.com/jyQRPUz.png)\n\n[*Link to Flying Tiger\u0027s facebook here.*](https://www.facebook.com/ftegames)\n\n***Joy to the world.***\n\n**So,** does anyone want to comment further on this decision, in light of the fact that the scad of \u0022featured products\u0022 created by this shady, unknown studio that SQUAD claims to be partnering up with is made up entirely of software diamonds like **these**?

Thankfully I can say that the dev cycle on 1.0.3 is nearly done now, and you\u0027ll hear more as the week progresses.\n\nDude... I usually don\u0027t like to tell people how to do their job... but as somebody who has been a journalist for a respected newspaper for years and has delved into PR and is currently the main communication interface between our company and a lot of customers, I have to say something.\n\n**Posting the PS4 announcement into Dev Notes is like walking into the labor room during birth and screaming \u0022Look guys, I bought a new house!\u0022**\n\nThis would have been news for the \u0022Announcement\u0022 thread. \n\nJust a slight error, right? I am worried it is not. I am worried you deliberately misused the Dev Notes to get more attention, because you know that people read those the most. You have read some of the comments here. If my speculation is correct you have toyed with your own customers\u0027 expectations and (even more worrying) with their trust.\n\nDev Notes are for Dev Notes. It there are no news on development, then just write another \u0022Slow News Day\u0022 Dev Note. Or say \u0022no dev notes today\u0022. Use the appropriate channels for the appropriate content. Otherwise we could basically abandon the forum structure and moderation, because if you can post anything anywhere you want, why shouldn\u0027t we?\n\nThere is only one remedy:\n\n**@Mods: Please move this thread to \u0022Announcements\u0022 and rename it correctly. Thank you!**\n\nRegarding the announcement:\n\nI personally don\u0027t like Sony or the PS4 (would have preferred you going for ID@Xbox, especially with the ability to use PC Mods on Xbox One, as Bethesda has announced for Fallout 4), but I can understand your wish to expand your awareness and income. So good on you. I am not excited about Flying Tiger, but maybe they just don\u0027t have any good gameplay ideas and are sound code monkeys. Who knows? I am giving them the benefit of the doubt here. \n\nBut being currently employed with a software development company, I am contesting your claim that outsourcing PS4 development will not affect PC development. I am pretty sure the devs will have to coordinate with Flying Tiger and / or show them how certain things are done or supposed to handle. As someone who wrote his thesis on a self developed usability test I am especially worried about that topic, since KSP is laid out for Mouse \u0026 Keyboard, so how could that be translated to a controller without being an abysmal user experience?\n\nThe next dev notes better be real dev notes."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T05:21:31Z","Content":"\u003C blows party horn \u003E\n\n...\n\n\u003C goes back to waiting for patch to fix \u0022released\u0022 game \u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"fchurca","CreatedById":64090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T05:26:38Z","Content":"Breaking news: Flying Tiger has actually made rocket games before.
