Ultimately, we were communicating with the team at NASA almost daily to make sure we were doing their work justice. A lot of credit has to be given to Felipe Falanghe, KSP creator and lead developer, as well as our technical artist and developer, Chad Jenkins, and our QA director Ted Everett. The entire team crushed it but these three worked some seriously brutal hours to make this update the biggest the game has seen.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Ricoxg: \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Can you tell me a little about the development process?

The tracking station is intended to emulate real life, as NASA is working hard to evaluate all of the asteroids out there that pose a threat to Earth. Where the team took some liberty was the Advance Grabbing Unit, otherwise known as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Claw,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that is used to redirect asteroids. It can actually grab other things too so if you want to redirect Kerbals, go for it \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 but please be careful!\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrtwinS","CreatedById":19144,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T20:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo comment on the \u0027does NASA test ideas in KSP?\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.
