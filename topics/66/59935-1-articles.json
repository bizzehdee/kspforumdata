What this means is that after 2 SOI changes (so it\u0027s showing 3 lines), KSP will stop telling you where you ship is going. This is fine in Kerbin, when all you\u0027re doing is going to Mun and back, but if you\u0027re going to another planet (especially Jool) you want more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you\u0027re going to Jool and want to make sure you come in really close so you can aerobrake. Currently (with 3 samples) you would make a maneuver node and it would show you leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI (sample #1), flying around Sun (#2), and then coming in to encounter Jool (#3). However, Jool\u0027s a crowded place and there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027d encounter one of its moons. At that point, your line will STOP DRAWING and there\u0027s nothing you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept now, you can increase the samples. Add 1, and now you have 4. You\u0027ll get an additional line showing your encounter with Tylo. Add another one and you\u0027ll see your line increase back into Jool\u0027s SOI and oops, seems you\u0027ve also got a encounter with Laythe. Add a 6th sample and and 7th and you\u0027ll now see how you pass through Laythe\u0027s SOI and continue on on the other side to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally have my conic samples defaulted to 8.
