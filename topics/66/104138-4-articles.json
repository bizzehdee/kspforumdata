Still, at least it gives me plenty of time to mess with bearings, and ofc make some tanks to place said bearings ontop of so the turrets can turn.\n\nIm happy we are getting a larger xenon fuel tank (ive actually NEVER used the toroidal fuel tanks in any design as it was too large for .63m probes, and was too small for 1.25m ships/probes. It had its uses, but it was generally awkward to use and didnt quite fit my own personal aesthetic tastes, so im actually one that fully supports this. Now id love to see a 1.25m ion engine, as right now, the ion engines are just way too small/unpractical for any real use outside of super tiny pribes where these new fuel tanks would most likely be too large anyways.\n\nIm really REALLY **REALLY** hoping the RT-5 flea booster is .63m in size. For ages we have been using stacks of the separatrons in kinetic missiles, and id absolutely love to replace the whole Ibeam\u002B8Sepatrons with Ibeam\u002B1SRB (saves part count, lets you carry way more ammunition before lag starts to be a problem). That aside, a smaller SRB would make a very nice RATO booster for some heavier aircraft. RT-10s are awkward to use for this, and usually have too much thrust for rocket assisted takeoffs.\n\nAlso, can i get a word on roughly how much the reentry heat is on default settings? Like what can and what cant be done now in terms of aerobraking. Many of my SSTOs/spacecraft rely on aerobraking to slow down and get into orbit, and im hoping that a trajectory thats say going at 20km PE on laythe, when im going at 4km/s velocity isnt going to fry a MK-2 part fuselage and wings spaceplane. This is a normal aerobraking maneuver, and i dont think itd be very good if that fries a plane, especially if its made of MK-2, MK-3, ect parts, given that those should be at least partially shielded. Now if you go straight at a planet, i expect and hope that anything included a heat shielded craft fries, but im hoping that aerobraking isnt broken by the new reentry heat (worst case scenario ill turn it down, but id still like default settings to allow some aerobraking)."},{"CreatedByName":"acrain116","CreatedById":101088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T04:50:54Z","Content":"Please take your time guys.

New features can expose additional bugs, interfere with other systems you thought were solid, etc. Hence why \u0022feature complete\u0022 is a thing. Developers have learned the hard way over time that unless you stop developing at a certain point, you\u0027re either going to wind up in a perpetual testing phase, or you\u0027re going to risk a buggy release.\n\nAnyways, this has all been gone over many times before and my conclusion was that we were talking to a wall and I may as well just sit back with fingers and toes crossed. Will return now to doing so ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T05:18:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What does \u0022leaving early access\u0022 mean if they\u0027re not going to be doing anything differently from what they\u0027re doing now?\n\nThe short and glib answer is that it means they won\u0027t have the \u0022early access\u0022 tag on the game any longer.\n\nThe long answer is that it changes customer expectations, which is really the heart of the issue here. When you buy a game in early access, you\u0027re more forgiving of bugs and glaring omissions (like black-screen IVAs for example). When it\u0027s out of early access, higher expectations and harsher judgments ensue. HOWEVER...\n\nCounterbalancing that is the constant post-release updating that\u0027s trending in this era of gaming. I\u0027d never buy an MMORPG and expect the developer to say, \u0022This is 1.0, the FINAL version, and we\u0027re not releasing any patches, new areas to explore, new abilities, new loot, new mobs, or raising the level cap. Have fun and goodbye forever.\u0022 Some games I own have gotten significant updates for over a decade.\n\nSo you\u0027ve got to ask yourself something: when Squad says \u00221.0! we\u0027re not \u0027early access anymore\u0027\u0022, are you going to spontaneously switch from forgiving bugs and omissions to passing harsh judgment and shelving the game because it hasn\u0027t, in your mind, earned the 1.0 label? Or are you going to enjoy the improvements and look forward to more improvements, seeing as they committed to continuing development? The next patch **is what it is** regardless of whether Squad calls it .27, .95, or 1.0. You decide how you\u0027re going to react to that. To those whose enjoyment will actually be affected because of the label, I think you\u0027re just cutting your nose off to spite your face, as the saying goes.\n\nAnd then there are those who object to Squad calling it 1.0, not because it would suddenly affect their perception and enjoyment of the game, but because they think it\u0027s a bad business decision. And I can spare maybe an ounce of sympathy. It\u0027s totally understandable to want your beloved game developer to be financially successful. We all want them to be around to make more updates, maybe even a sequel. But to be honest, I think it\u0027s a bit presumptuous of us to think we have half an idea of Squad\u0027s financial position, market strategy, future plans for growth, deadlines, business deals, and all the other factors that affect the decision to go gold. Nor do we actually know how good their experimental version is today. Some of us throw around the prediction that Squad is adding too many new things to possibly be able to release a good product without another beta stage. I\u0027m not sure we\u0027re in a position to accurately predict a failure based on that, and dev notes -- a tiny, tiny window into their development cycle. Unless I hear some more convincing evidence that the next patch is going to be a disaster, I just dismiss this as wild speculation.\n\nI mean, who am I going to believe? The developers who actually have the code in hand, and are listening to QA and experimentals test feedback, or forum member X who, to my knowledge, might not have ever developed a video game in his/her life, much less actually have any behind-the-scenes knowledge of the next KSP version."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T05:57:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Felipe (HarvesteR):** So much so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m referring to the git log to see what went in between the last dev blog and now. \n\u003E Here are some highlights:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Fixed a VERY ugly-looking bug concerning scenario modules and persistence, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m amazed it went by as it did.

There has been a lot more work put into balancing and tuning the aero system too. The jet engines have had another pass with respect to their characteristics. For those that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know, the airflow through jet engines (and thus fuel flow, and thus thrust) is now a function of mach and of air density giving them more interesting limitations and effects.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Jim (Romfarer):** Following up on the tech tee changes i was applying last week to make every node visible, this week i started updating the icons for the new and modified nodes.

Imagine that: some people actually build for aesthetics. I have about a dozen designs using the Donut tank.\n\nWould it have hurt you to add just a new Xenon tank? I mean, you have two parts in aero already being functionally redundant, the two intake parts with 40 fuel in them. And yeah, they are distinctly different - in optics.\n\n If functionality alone is your reasoning you would not have added female Kerbals, just saying."},{"CreatedByName":"Pigbear","CreatedById":68791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T07:01:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem becomes that additional features at least partially invalidate previous testing. New features can expose additional bugs, interfere with other systems you thought were solid, etc. Hence why \u0022feature complete\u0022 is a thing. Developers have learned the hard way over time that unless you stop developing at a certain point, you\u0027re either going to wind up in a perpetual testing phase, or you\u0027re going to risk a buggy release.\n\u003E Anyways, this has all been gone over many times before and my conclusion was that we were talking to a wall and I may as well just sit back with fingers and toes crossed.
