This is fortunate I suppose, because we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not done porting from 4.6, but the things we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t touched yet will not be needing double work, we can port them right into 5.1, that is of course assuming there were changes to that particular area from 5.0 to 5.1 . One area that we have already been working on and changed further in 5.1 are physics joints, so those will now require a bit more work, but it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look quite as bad.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E And again I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m in the position where I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really share what I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on businesswise except for the fact that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty cool and it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be too long til you learn some of it. Other than that, the Gamer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Edition came out as well as the GoG summer sale! It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s always fun working with new partners, exposing yourself to their corporate culture and viceversa. 1.0.3 experimentals have been doing well, and there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a big chance we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see an extra bit thrown into it as a way to thank you all for your patience.\n\n**Ted (Ted)**   \n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been another rather slow week with the developers still enjoying some well deserved R\u0026R. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been continuing with my production duties as well as assisting the Experimental Team with 1.0.3, putting in some smaller changes/fixes in the downtime as well as something rather brilliant from RoverDude - a smaller feature but one that should prove very useful for all.
