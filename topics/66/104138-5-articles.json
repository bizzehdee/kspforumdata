There was a huge thread about this when they announced next version was going to be release, and I know a lot of the community, myself included, thought it was a really bad idea.\n\nAt a certain point though, it became obvious to me that they were going to go this route regardless of what anyone said and that there really was no point in going on about it. I don\u0027t like it, I think that as time goes by and feature complete is being pushed aside week after week that\u0027s it\u0027s getting even riskier, and overall I think this whole thing is a mistake, but ultimately I wish them the best of luck with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T07:56:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looking at the ROUND8\u0027s stats, it was redundant with the Oscar-Tank, except in terms of design.

It\u0027s a somewhat visually sub-par part with an awful fuel/mass fraction that nobody ever uses. The Round-8 on the other hand is visually distinctive and very popular among builders, who can make use of the unique shape to do some designs that wouldn\u0027t be possible with any other tank. I\u0027m willing to bet that if you had picked the Oscar-B to convert, you\u0027d have a lot less complaints.\n\nThat said, I think there\u0027s a better solution still... if you want new, larger xenon tanks, [just go talk to Nertea](http://www.areadenialgames.com/ksp/nft10_XeTex.png)! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T08:01:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T08:07:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looking at the ROUND8\u0027s stats, it was redundant with the Oscar-Tank, except in terms of design.

With reasonable builds, acceleration is usually over 1m/s^2, and that means that you can do, for example, Jool ejections, in two ~20min passes pointing prograde, capturing the essence of long, low thrust burns (a pretty cool part of advanced spaceflight) in what amounts to five-ten minutes of gameplay, half an hour if you count the timewarps between apoapsises. Now, you can do the same thing in less than a minute with a high thrust cemical burn at TWR\u003E1... but that also gets old, quick.\n\nRune.
