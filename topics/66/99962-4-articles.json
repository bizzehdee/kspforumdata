But no. Seriously. No. This thing has been hashed and rehashed and re-rehashed and literally every time N-body physics comes up as a suggestion, somebody suggests this, and it would not work because physics does not work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that it\u0027s a big deal or anything. I mean, Legrange points aren\u0027t even that stable (EDIT: Did I say \u0022that stable\u0022? I meant to say not stable at all - at least, L1 through L3), except for the L4 and L5 points which, in this case, would lay *on* the orbit of the second body anyway. So, if you really want to pretend that Legrange points are a thing, you can do what I do and put your satellite up in the second body\u0027s orbit, and use save-file editing to remove any uncertainty in the orbit, then proceed to not touch it ever again. I use this strategy for my comms satellites in RemoteTech, and it\u0027s pretty effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T05:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a reason I said \u0022exception to patched conics\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou in fact CAN use a ghost SOI, it\u0027s an approximation.
