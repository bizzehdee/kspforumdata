I\u0027ve been playing games for 30 years.

There is no such thing as bug free software. Bugs are a fact of life. If you don\u0027t learn to deal with it, you can\u0027t be a gamer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact is, SQUAD has a small team and a complex game. Yes, the wheels are broken right now. Yes, my game sometimes goes an hour where I can\u0027t go into the VAB for more than 2 minutes without crashing, and then mysteriously it just starts working fine. Yes, I have a space station which when I dock the last piece to it, zooms off a million meters in 1 second and then rips apart due to some insane rotational kinetic energy which sends the whole thing flying off into a gajillion pieces at millions of meters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one thing I\u0027ve learned on the internet and gaming all of these years is that constructive criticism is the only thing that works.

But just try to keep perspective. Bugs are inevitable, they take a ton of time to fix, and things get prioritized in a way that us gamers may vehemently disagree with, and the best way for us to have an impact is to do as much work as we can on our end to provide information and feedback in a way that isn\u0027t insulting to all of the time these people pour into something that I\u0027m sure they all care very deeply

I think I have found the solution: No more dev notes. Just stop them. No more soontms, no more hypes, no more what we are doing now, no more what we will do next, no more moars. I guess the dev-notes could have been a good idea when the game was starting and there was a little community, to inform the people about the game\u2019s development, form the community and give a little publicity. Nowadays, in my opinion, they are not only useless but counterproductive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did knowing who\u2019s taking a vacation or how long it would be, help in any way Squad or the community? What benefit brings to know someone is working in this and some other in that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came to this game in 1.0.4, of course not knowing anything about Squad, who works where or whose finger is broken. I just bought a game, played it and loved it. After a while I started reading the forums and found out a new version was coming soon. (I hadn\u2019t learned the special language used in here yet). So I left aside the big campaign I was playing and waited\u2026 (hype, prerelease, patch, patch, patch\u2026..) Was that January, February? Actually I\u2019m still exploring the moons in my new 1.1.2 career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow after a dev-notes release it\u2019s funny to see people just trying to translate and read between lines what they really mean, because experience has taught them that if a na\u00EFve reader only reads the dev-notes and take them literally he will be lead to frustration and disappointment. To me they sound like political / marketing language: correct but empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe use thousand of products every day, each of them have a development team behind working hard to improve their product just like you. I don\u2019t need to know if the fisherman who fished my food has problems with the boat or if the engineer who maintains the bridge went to Acapulco in vacation. I just need my fish to be fresh and the bridge to don\u2019t fall when I pass through it. So my friendly suggestion (which I know not many people will support but, hey, I\u2019m weird) is to stop the communication, keep on working, fix the bugs, keep in mind the suggestions of the community, and just let your work speak for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one plays the game because you are very friendly or communicative, it\u2019s because people likes the game. If it gets better we will play more and recommend it to our friends. If it gets worse we will stop playing and not talk about it. For me, the lessons I\u2019ve learned in this past months are: not to read the dev-notes and wait veeeery long before downloading a new version of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-25T18:39:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2016 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Perringo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T18:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222600593\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140447\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464188169\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146896\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirad\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Sirad said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would you do if you want to sell the Game to more Customers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st: Adding new content\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd:Bugfixing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil its not reputational scorched ground, choose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere it me, I wouldn\u0027t release until I had a finished product. \u00A0Then I wouldn\u0027t have to choose. \u00A0If I did have to choose, I think bugfixing should always come first until your current version if feature complete, and that you shouldn\u0027t even think about new features until the current release is stable for the majority of users on all platforms. \u00A0Critics have been VERY nice to KSP so far, but all it\u0027s going to take is one or two reviewers talking about an amateurish game that crashes frequently and has gameplay issues and your new customer base will drop off sharply. \u00A0Word of mouth on KSP is good... so far, but judging from these threads, patience is starting to wear thin for a lot of people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zoidos","CreatedById":133853,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T18:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222599583\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140447\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464128405\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002240700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, KasperVld said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI scratched my arm trying to replace the headlight bulb on my motorbike \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay this be the worst biking-related accident you ever have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fellow biker\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T19:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222600944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140447\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464201328\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162874\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Perringo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, Perringo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo more dev notes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t sound ridiculous.
