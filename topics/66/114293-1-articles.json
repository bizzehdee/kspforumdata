Bravery is overcoming great fear and doing what is necessary. One only has to observe Chief Kerbalnaut Bob Kerman\u0027s facial expressions and screams during any flight to see he is overcoming great fear. In fact, Bob\u0027s facial expressions have proven a better indicator of less than nominal performance of our launch vehicles and spacecraft than any cockpit instrumentation. (A true cost saving!)\n\nOur only request is that you schedule any necessary filming around Chief Kerbalnaut Bob Kerman\u0027s upcoming planned landing on Eve. Seriously, we feel it is wise to do so as the return vehicle is still under design.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Grand Designer\n\nVoidryder\u0027s Aerospace\n\nP.S. Our Attorneys will be in contact over royalties percentages."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:09:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Some sort of Interstellar parody?
