Early feedback sounds very good so far, and based on my own subjective experience, flying does feel a lot better now. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re far from done though, as with the new changes, new possibilities arise and must be accounted for. Cargo bays haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t had much of a use until now, but with the new aero system, they will shield whatever is inside them from the airstream. This means more than reduced drag and reentry heat though. Wing surfaces placed inside (closed) bays won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t function, neither will parachutes, RCS blocks, solar panels, air intakes or science experiments which must be performed in an atmosphere.
