Honestly, I liked the idea too. I took all the negative reaction on the forums to those levels to just be \u0022more-of-the-same\u0022 complaining that the loudmouths do anytime anything changes that is outside their expectations. I ignored it, just like I ignore most of the complaints people have before they actually have the release in their hands, since, not having it actually in their hands, they by definition don\u0027t really know what they\u0027re talking about. I\u0027m saddened to see that for once Squad took the complaints to heart and nixed some levels that I thought might be interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the lesson is that we shouldn\u0027t ignore all the complainers of each release and voice our positive support to new ideas to balance them out, but boy is that tiring. I\u0027d rather, Squad, that you just trusted your instincts. They\u0027ve made a fantastic game so far. I want you to know that for every vocal person on here complaining about something, there are a thousand of us who are pleased with KSP. It\u0027s just that being pleased doesn\u0027t inspire one to fight vocally on the forums against the anonymous, vocal minority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m glad we\u0027ll see the barns and trailer parks again in some revamped form at a later date. Squad, keep up the good work, please realize that there are 1000\u0027s of me for every one of the complainers and don\u0027t take the negativity to heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fun: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard#mediaviewer/File:Dr._Goddard_Transports_Rocket_-_GPN-2000-001693.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard#mediaviewer/File:Dr._Goddard_Transports_Rocket_-_GPN-2000-001693.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real life history of rockets had a few trailers and barns in it as well, if you need any ammo to shoot back with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--pest\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
