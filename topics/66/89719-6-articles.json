Artistic style tells the audience exactly what to expect from a game.

A more realistic simulation-type game should have graphics based on real-life images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, artistic style defines a game.

For example, the Kerbals in KSP are clearly cartoonish, not based on reality but instead in the game for lovable characters (unless, of course, you are Danny). Meanwhile, the equipment of the Kerbals is state-of-the-art. As Bac9 (the designer of the current iteration of KSC) described the equipment of the Kerbals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bac9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bac9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine.

Kerbals act upon what they have to develop rapidly, whereas risk-adverse humans reflect on what happened each flight very deeply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Kerbals do know how to engineer, their constraint when building a space center would not be lack of knowledge on how to build such a center, but instead lack of funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building something with low funding, often cost-saving measures include reuse of older parts rather than building from scratch. This would not result in the use of old barns. Most likely, it would use repurposed steel plating and other sturdy but cheap materials. The exteriors wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look pretty, but it would still look sturdy and competently built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBac9 explains some general principles used in building the current KSC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENext, you need to create guidelines for yourself to govern the sizes, offsets and types of windows and doors.

There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an excessive number of them, but the idea of using tanks is an excellent idea and should be used in the current 0.25 KSC as well.

Wood is readily available, cheap, and not exactly sturdy. Not to mention the fact that rockets do involve fire.

Wood is just not a good material to build metal components in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one used in practically every large building nowadays. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right, concrete! Concrete is an excellent material in terms of compression (squeezing) strength, though it cracks easily with tensile (streching) strength. Concrete foundations and even concrete buildings are very common. They aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t pretty, but they do work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth steel and metal, unpainted, look fairly awful. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also the cheapest way to go about using it: just give it a corrosion-resistant spray and be done with it. Any materials the Kerbals are using would most likely be unpainted, besides a few parts needed for labeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows look good, and they let natural light in. For such large windows, Kerbals wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use blue glass, but instead a tinted white glass to let natural light in without being blinding at certain angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, and most importantly, prefabricated materials would be important to use. Numerous structures could be reused at low cost. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s look at some of these by going back to the photos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YkTrPBC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YkTrPBC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wood texture could be something like steel plating.

But the execution of the upgradable buildings needs a revamp. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s plenty of artistic ways to make something look low-budget while still maintaining visual appeal. And the experience of building a full complex without Bac9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s assistance means that it will get easier the second time.
