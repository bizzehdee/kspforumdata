I\u0027ve been on a quite the break from KSP lately to focus more on life, but nevertheless hanging on to this magnificent community we have here has been just as fun and rewarding as it was from the very beginning!\n\nWhen I bought Kerbal Space Program on July 4, 2013, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was young and inexperienced in the world of gaming, but being swept into the Kerbal universe I found myself simply craving more of what there was to be offered. I joined the forums, read the dev notes, and became good friends with fellow Kerbal Space Program players. This all has changed my way of life, overall attitude, and ideas in a way nothing else could. This game taught me mistakes aren\u0027t just great teachers, they\u0027re the only teachers that matter! I mess up bad every now and then, but I put on a smile, find out what I did wrong, and grow from those experiences. \n\nReading these developer notes every week for countless months now have made me realize the tremendous efforts that go into games such as these, as well a the people behind the process. I used to see people online as avatars and usernames, and the emotional acknowledgement of there existing a living, breathing, thinking, human being behind those screens had never clicked in my mind. You all changed that!\n\nFinally, Kerbal Space Program has made me a person I couldn\u0027t be any more happy to be. The effects Kerbal Space Program and its community has had on me has sculpted who I am into someone who thinks and cares about others, someone who accepts failure, and someone who pursues their passion. What if I told you that before my time with KSP I was not interested in space? That hobby had died years earlier, and even during then I was not very into the subject. Now its back! Loving space and space travel has had the same life-improving, character-building experience, and it too has its roots in discovering Kerbal Space Program one slow summer afternoon.\n\nYes, this is a very deep post, but only because Kerbal Space Program has been such an emotional experience that stretches far, far beyond just being an ordinary video game. Squad, you are a blessing to me, all throughout the good times and the bad times. Thank you so, so, so much for committing four years of your lives to such a wonderful project! I love you all! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n~Nathan (Thomas988)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chowderpat","CreatedById":140156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T23:45:51Z","Content":"When you know there adding heat shields, this game got a whole lot harder.
