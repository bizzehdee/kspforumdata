It may well be that the response was to a different part of the post, the important part is that it got replied to which is rare anywhere else on the forum...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Regex WAS making a feature request, or at least requesting the code be changed (in a way I support) which is essentially the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave the devs look at the entire Part.RequestResource() chain. It\u0027s pretty hairy and I (and a bunch of other people) are pretty certain optimizing that would help with large craft since crawling over the entire craft part tree several times per Unity update looking for Resources instead of caching those parts containing usable Resources is wasteful. There have been a few mentions of it, not certain if anyone has ever posted it as a bug since it\u0027s pure optimization (not to mention all the other vagaries surrounding the KSP source code and discussing it here).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself, I also feel that this thread gets looked over more by \u0060people who matter\u0060 than the many suggestions in the suggestion forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason I visit is to see the topic of the week as far as development goes and to try to stop Squad in their favourite hobby, which is only implementing half the bits of a great feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the UI for example, for many years now, it has been very difficult to choose between two craft that are very close but over 2.5km. As this happens A LOT especially when wanting two craft to rendezvous it would seem that it would be an essential part of the UI when dealing with more than one craft yet we still have the system of \u0060click and hope\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have suggested this many times in the suggestion forum over the years and supplied a few solutions as the updates fly by with no change and now we are at \u0060the great rewriting\u0060 of the UI and I suspect this will STILL not get looked at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would seem plain that either the system is not working or the system is not being shown to be working due to the lack of feedback. I suspect the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves people in the state where they make suggestions and nothing happens, leading them to understandably think the suggestion has been missed in the huge amount of suggestions and has not been read. Then when they see a reply to any post at all (whether a suggestion or not) they too desire to have their valid suggestion to improve the game for everyone be seen so they post their suggestions in the one place they see as getting read, the devnote thread...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we now have a dedicated devnote writer who is aware of the current state of development and future implementation plans, maybe they (or someone else) could comment in a sticky thread in suggestions to say \u0022This will happen\u0022, \u0022This will not happen\u0022 or \u0022This suggestion has been seen and will be thought about but may well not happen\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the popular \u0060threads of the month\u0060 could we have a monthly \u0060suggestion roundup\u0060 where suggestions are gathered and shown to the forum to gauge opinion and provide even the slightest sign that someone is reading them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like that would seem essential once the community exceeds a certain size to stop reactions like these...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelationships fail when one party just withdraws and stops communicating on a topic.
