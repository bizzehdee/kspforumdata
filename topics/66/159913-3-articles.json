I have played this game since .10 at the very least, and while I have disagreed with some of the things Squad has done w/ development and choices they\u0027ve made, I also know that they do a lot of good, too (one big common bone you and I picked was the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebarn).\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I also know that a lot of other stuff that could have been forced was\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIt would, frankly, be ridiculous to assume that part failures are a forced \u0022feature\u0022 in a standard or sandbox\u00A0game. I wouldn\u0027t disagree with Part Failure being forced *in* a mission, as a mission may very well need a part failure to be interesting at all.
