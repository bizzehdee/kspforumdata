I had to take care of the most obvious issues which I had noted down here. No point in having the QA team spend time and effort in reporting bugs we already know are there, right? So these last few days I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working pretty much around the clock here to get those things set up. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Some of these improvements are very old, very annoying bugs. For instance, symmetry in the SPH had a bad habit of getting the node placement wrong when you tried to chain bi-couplers to get multiple attachment points. This bug took a good deal of hunting down, but I managed to figure out the proper rotation maths to make the nodes stack-attach properly under mirror symmetry. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also added KeyBindings to all the new editor functions, and while at it, several of the old ones too, if for some reason you disagree on X to toggle symmetry, for instance, you can now remap it. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Other tweaks were prompted by the new possibilities the gizmos allow. Have you wondered what would happen if you were to drag or rotate a part which had gizmos attached to or from it? Answer is, they would rigidly move with the parent part, in a most displeasing way. Now, this one took a lot of work, because the Struts and Fuel lines are \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;the\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; most arcane part types in the game. They were the only stock parts still working as an extension of the Part class, instead of using the much more elegant PartModule system. That was because those two parts couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be done simply as modules. The Part class handles parts as attachable objects which you can use to construct a ship. The Fuel Lines and Struts however, being 2-point attachment parts, required a different way of working that essentially modified their way of \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;being a par\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;t. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;We did have a plan for this however, which required a lot of time to implement, so it was never enough of a priority to be worth attempting, especially considering the potential for bugs. This time around though, I decided that we had endured those old wiry messy part classes for too long, and hunkered down to put the new implementation into practice. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I would say that it \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;almost \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worth the effort. So much so that if you had asked me if it was worth doing yesterday at half past midnight, I would have given you a bleary eyed look that would certainly not imply I was happy with the whole idea\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve managed to get the whole thing in order, and cleaning up the bugs now, I have to say, this is a massive improvement.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Struts and Fuel Lines no longer use their own Part extensions. Now, there is a single part extension called CompoundPart, and along with it, a new PartModule extension called CompoundPartModule. As you might imagine, CompoundPartModules require a CompoundPart type part to function. On top of these, we now have three CompoundPartModules: CModuleLinkedMesh, which takes care of keeping the visual model of the strut (or fuel line) connecting both ends of the part; CModuleFuelLine, which creates a fuel re-route when both sides are anchored, and CModuleStrut, which creates a joint between both ends. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;This new approach means there are no longer large amounts of repeated, messy, unmaintainable code when working with those parts, and it means creating new types of parts that use 2-point attachments should be much, much simpler. This is something we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been wanting to do for ages, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very glad I took the time to get it done - even if it meant another working weekend and some late nights. It was well worth doing.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;On other notes, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also fixed the editor Undo/Redo system. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not quite sure when it was broken, but it was hopelessly unserviceable here. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gone through it to get it back in working order, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s now working pretty well again. As a consequence of the fix I implemented to fix the undos, I found we now had a system which allowed us to implement a fix/improvement that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been widely requested. During construction, crew assignment is now completely persistent. Kerbals assigned in the crew tab will stay in their assigned seats as you add and remove parts, and even if you disconnect the part they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in itself. They only return to the available list if you delete the part they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Anyhow, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been my week.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA): \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;As some of you may know, a security vulnerability was announced on the SSL 3.0 Protocol called the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2POODLE\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack and it affects all implementations of SSLv3. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read information encrypted with this version of the protocol in plain text using a man-in-the-middle attack. To mitigate POODLE attack, one approach is to disable SSLv3 support completely from both servers and clients sides. Since encryption is usually negotiated between clients and servers, it is an issue that involves both parties. I had already disabled SSLv3 from the KSP server and all the information send through it is protected, but we recommend you to disable it on your side (browsers), so it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t affect you on servers that had not disabled the protocol yet. \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://disablessl3.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://disablessl3.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;HERE\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is some information and instructions on how to do it.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart): \u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;This week was a busy one, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been helping Chuchito wrap his head around the whole project in order to start implementing his multiplayer client into the game (chill out people, this still doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean multiplayer is coming out soon-ish).

This was a massive task, as it replaces the old part tabs. Instead of the old tabs, you now get filters which will list parts up in ways you never were able to do before. For example, you can now list parts up by which module or resource they contain, or both if you have a lot of parts and want to narrow it down. For every filtering you have chosen, there is now an option to sort parts (and subassemblies) by name, mass and cost in ascending or descending order.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;If this was not enough you can also create your own custom categories and place parts into them just like you did with subassemblies before.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been overseeing the development of this update\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s contributor content.

We picked apart Kerbal Experience (KXP) in QA via some pretty keen-eyed playtesting. As I mentioned last week, it\u2019s such a core component of career gameplay it needs to be as developed, intuitive and balanced as possible. Interestingly enough, the original trait effects were actually still in for QA so that we could compartmentalise the different systems that make up KXP. After providing in-depth feedback on the Roles/Traits system (whether a Kerbal is a Pilot, Engineer, etc.) we moved on to brainstorming what effects the different roles should have on gameplay and the scope these effects should have. This feedback was more comprehensive and is still pending a good ol\u2019 chin wag on the development side.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;For now, we\u2019ve moved on to QAing Marco\u2019s Building Tags branch.
