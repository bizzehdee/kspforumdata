I think the options/resource sliders that you can tweak when starting a game are pretty powerful, and that combined with Contract Configurator makes the game pretty customizable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor fun I\u0027ll throw out another career idea:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech tree is gone, replaced by a system where closed tech branches \u0022get the OK to proceed,\u0022 aka open up, when X amount of science is obtained from Y body. The tech can then be unlocked for use by using funds. The balance will give enough tech to proceed to the next logical planet, yet give skilled players enough to shoot for more advanced ones. Extra science from a body can be traded in for funds at a rate that increases based on where it was obtained from. The main benefit: getting cool new parts is a great motivation to get players to go interplanetary, as opposed to contracts. Currently one can unlock the tech tree without leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, which seems a bit too easy IMO. Also, it makes \u0022realistic\u0022 sense in a way- the space program has to prove it can comfortably achieve certain goals before moving on to harder ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust another career mode idea, nothing to see here \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T13:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222741149\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472938841\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107529\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curveball Anders\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Curveball Anders said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, you want a different game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo an extent, I do, in fact. I love KSP because of the topic it covers more than anything else. It\u0027s a great sandbox\u003Cem\u003E simulation \u003C/em\u003Eof a complex subject. But make no mistake, KSP as it currently stands has little to no gameplay mechanics in relation to what I would define as a \u0022game\u0022. There is no set goal (fine for some, troublesome for others, like myself; I want/need an objective/purpose\u00A0OTHER than anything I can come up with myself); the token gameplay mechanics that are implemented are half-baked, ill-thought out, or just make no sense;\u00A0there\u0027s no end-game content/activities for\u00A0long-term play past meeting any goals. A lot of this can be corrected by mods, but a \u0022game\u0022 that relies on community supplied mods is not a game in itself: it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Eplatform\u003C/em\u003E for a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo top this off, KSP is a cluster of a programming project. Engine refactor post-commercial release that\u0027s advertised as a Patch/Update? I have never seen that done before, not without a full version release. (Or a re-released edition, like Directors cuts, but those also add more content like a mini-expansion... Or as it\u0027s known these days, DLC Add-on.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor gameplay mechanics, Career is a joke. Funds don\u0027t really mean much except in the early game. It (along with a player\u0027s patience and ability to multi-task) is just a limiter on how many craft you can have active at any point. Fine, but that\u0027s about it\u0027s ONLY purpose. Science as a resource that easy but tedious to acquire is just boring. And you can practically ignore Reputation. Strategies make no sense (assuming they even work right...). The research system is fairly limited (this I can forgive a bit due to the sheer number of parts in the game that would have to be tracked for a GOOD research tree...) Pilot stats mean nothing in practice. Pilot levels have little bearing in typical play. (Probe cores can supplement Pilots, not breaking things make Engineers pointless, and Scientists make a tedious mechanic either more or less tedious depending on how much you care about efficiency; the increasing hiring cost makes no bloody sense either. I\u0027d rather pay a daily wage to my kerbonauts.)\u00A0Lastly, the various mechanics barely feedback into one another. You can practically remove any of those mechanics and it wouldn\u0027t affect basic play in career. What kind of game has mechanics that don\u0027t support one another?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I look at KSP as just a game in it stands now, it\u0027s boring as hell. Everything is tedium. (Unless you\u0027re an engineer who spends more time designing than \u0022playing\u0022.) There\u0027s little to no incentive to do anything once you get used to playing. Practically all the real fun and joy of KSP lies in the first-time experience. \u0022Woo! Rocket didn\u0027t blow up on launch!\u0022, \u0022Yay! Space!\u0022, \u0022Heck yeah! Orbit!\u0022 etc. If you get adept at it, everything is a repetitive chore. \u0022Okay, circularizing burn now\u0022, \u0022Apo burn #3\u0022, \u0022Ah, there\u0027s the Mun, time to burn\u0022, etc. If I understand and know how to launch a rocket into orbit routinely, why must I do it for the umpteenth time to do anything that would be new to me? At some point, I should be able to graduate from the micromanagement to macro-management. Do I really need to personally be involved in every action in the game? I say no: by \u0022end-game\u0022 (whatever that is), I should be able to just say, \u0022Okay, at this point, do a 100m/s burn for injection. Then at intercept periapsis, circularize.\u0022 I shouldn\u0027t need to be personally present for a craft to accomplish that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...All right, now I\u0027m really starting to rant. I\u0027m gonna cut myself short now. There\u0027s more I can/want to say to explain my view more/better, but I\u0027ve been at this long enough. I\u0027ll shut up now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T13:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

At least the programming issues are getting hammered out and rectified (though that should\u0027ve been most done before commercial release.) Once they get KSP to not be what sounds like spaghetti code, the next step to tackle would be actual gameplay mechanics and progression. (Any complaints about added content can wait until there\u0027s a game for content to be used in.

At this point, looking back, it feels like they were too shortsighted with getting something to meet the basic ambition of the game (which I think was \u0022fun/amusing entry lego-style rocket simulator\u0022). The long term aims weren\u0027t planned or got short-changed in the process.

(I know it Kerbal SPACE Program, but I\u0027d like more content on Kerbin for just airplanes. Yeah, there are mods, but modders can only do so much if there\u0027s little to no framework in place to support them.) I\u0027d honestly welcome a KSP2 and let KSP1 languish in just bug-maintenance if it meant KSP2 could correct everything wrong with KSP1 while improving what it got right.

Sites of particular value would essentially be highly localized \u0022Easter eggs\u0022 that increased the science data returned, even perhaps allowing full transmission values from the surface. The gravity experiment, seismic detector, thermometer and all would be used to help guide you to these pockets to sample. Examining these sites should generate a contract branch that helps you explore nearby related features and return reputation and funds as you do so. This would make EVA exploration worthwhile and increase the utility of rovers and planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a player chooses a science career then running science experiments should be part of the fun and a gameplay investment.

They usually lock the platform at that point for ease of maintenance. I know of minor point updates (I think Satellite Reign or Wasteland 2 did a release that was a based on a point release update to the platform, like Unity 5.0 to 5.1 as an example), but not wholesale rewrites of the underlying program.

If the reputation meter was more prominent and you could target which contract paths you wanted to explore then I could definitely see a reputation reward for hitting some of these high value sites being translated into recruiting more scientists.

Pressure and gravity scans could reveal information that would tell you when to set your parachutes to auto-deploy. That would also encourage players to send small, light uncrewed probes to sample the atmosphere before designing big manned missions to those worlds, because then you could benefit from having engines tuned to land in their specific environments; to know the elevations within scanned biomes; and understand at what air density mark a parachute is safe to deploy on that world without tearing it apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface samples and seismic scans could increase the thermal efficiency and ore extraction rate of ore drills within only those specific biomes that were tested. Thermometers and Science Jr. labs could test the radiant energy and micrometeorite prevalence in orbit of different worlds to boost the strength and efficiency of solar panels and radiators operating around those worlds. Maybe you have to have a thermometer on a craft for ISRUs, radiators and other heat managements systems to work at peak efficiency. Or even have thermometers work as thermostats to auto-deploy radiators when necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal EVA reports from the surface could expose previously hidden waypoint markers for exploration contracts within specific biomes.

two 60 part ships inside the same physics bubble would have crashed the game.\u00A0 And of course adding things like 20 additional stylized wing parts would also be akin to cheating the system because

Pressure and gravity scans could reveal information that would tell you when to set your parachutes to auto-deploy. That would also encourage players to send small, light uncrewed probes to sample the atmosphere before designing big manned missions to those worlds, because then you could benefit from having engines tuned to land in their specific environments; to know the elevations within scanned biomes; and understand at what air density mark a parachute is safe to deploy on that world without tearing it apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface samples and seismic scans could increase the thermal efficiency and ore extraction rate of ore drills within only those specific biomes that were tested.
