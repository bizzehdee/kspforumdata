modding community is trying to support as a problem, and I think that releases every 3 months will just make it worse, especially if each\u00A0release is\u00A0followed by 2-3 patch versions over the next month, leaving only 2 months to update large mod sets like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-0 before the next KSP

their\u00A0reasons.\u00A0 Perhaps they\u00A0either expect\u00A0breakage with (some) new KSP versions, or want\u00A0to spend time testing with a new KSP version before making an official release

11th\u00A0October, 2016.\u00A0 \u00A01.2.1 Released 1st\u00A0November, 2016.\u00A0 \u00A01.2.2\u00A0\u00A0Released 6th\u00A0December, 2016.\u00A0 So 2 patch releases to stabilize the 1.2.x series over roughly a 2 month period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.3\u00A0\u00A0Released 25th\u00A0May, 2017.\u00A0\u00A01.3.1\u00A0Released 05th\u00A0October, 2017.\u00A0 1.3.1 was more a minor feature\u00A0release than a bug fix release, so arguably 1.3 was stable at release, and new features were added 4 months later.\u00A0 Note this is 5\u00A0releases over almost exactly\u00A012 months, \u00A02 of which\u00A0(1.2.1 and 1.2.2)\u00A0were what I\u0027ll call bug-fix type releases.\u00A0 1.3 followed about 7 months after 1.2,\u00A0 (and 5 months after the 1.2.2 patch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.4\u00A0\u00A0Released 06th\u00A0March, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A01.4.1\u00A0\u00A0Released 13th\u00A0March, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A01.4.2\u00A0\u00A0Released 28th\u00A0March, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A01.4.3\u00A0\u00A0Released 27th\u00A0April, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A01.4.4\u00A0 \u00A0Released 21th\u00A0June, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A01.4.5\u00A0\u00A0Released 26th\u00A0July, 2018.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to argue that 1.4.0 was almost a public beta for the 1.4.1 \u0022Making History\u0022 release that was scheduled for 1 week later.\u00A0 1.4.2\u00A0was a bug fix release\u00A0that was pushed 2 days before Easter.\u00A0 My personal opinion is that it was pushed without enough testing because Squad wanted us to give us an improved version to play with during\u00A0Easter.\u00A0 \u00A0I\u00A0consider 1.4.3 to be a fairly stable release.\u00A0 So 3 or 4 patches (depending on whether you want to count the 1.4 release;\u00A0 personally I consider it a public beta rather than a release)\u00A0to get a stable 1.4.x release over roughly 2 months, then a minor patch with new features \u002B bug fixes for\u00A01.4.4, and then another bug-fix release\u00A0with 1.4.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few\u00A0points I want to make here.\u00A0 Firstly both 1.2.x and 1.3.x were in better shape at release than 1.4.x.\u00A0 If I recall correctly,\u00A0both had an opt-in public beta over a few\u00A0weeks prior to release\u00A0which meant many of the bugs were fixed before the official release.\u00A0 \u00A0This meant that Squad had access to a lot more testers\u00A0than\u00A0it\u0027s internal QA/external testing group could provide, and could push bug-fixes quickly and get confirmation that they had indeed fixed the issues people had reported.\u00A0\u00A0 During that test phase mod authors could easily say \u0022I\u0027m not supporting the beta, I\u0027ll update this\u00A0mod\u00A0after the official release.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly even\u00A0with that testing it took 2 months to stabilise the 1.2.x series.\u00A0 What would have happened if\u00A0there was a policy of a new release\u00A0every 3 months\u00A0in place in 2016?\u00A0 Would it have been possible to get something worthy of a new release out one month after 1.2.2?\u00A0 What about churn for mod authors with 3 releases over 3 months?\u00A0 (Please don\u0027t say that you would have just held most of the fixes for the release 3 months after 1.2.\u00A0 1.4 demonstrated that it can take you several attempts to actually fix the bugs that people have reported).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirdly 1.4.x\u00A0looks like it was rushed out without enough testing.\u00A0 I think it would have benefited from a public beta like the 1.2 and 1.3 series.\u00A0 (I will admit that you probably wouldn\u0027t want\u00A0to do a public beta for Making History, but you should have been able to do a public pre-release beta\u00A0of 1.4.0, which would have let\u00A0you deal with issues like the re-entry effects, jet engine sounds etc before the Making History release).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the community would be better served by going back to public opt-in betas for new releases, and aiming for something like the 1.3 release.\u00A0 ie squash all the bugs you can before the official release, so that hopefully you don\u0027t need to do any patch releases.\u00A0 Then if you do need a patch release aim to get it out within a few\u00A0weeks of\u00A0the official release, then give mod developers and players 5\u002B months before the next release.\u00A0 \u00A0Enough time that mod authors get to relax and play between updating their mods for new patches.\u00A0 Enough time that hopefully large mod packs like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and RP-0 can hopefully get everything updated, tested and released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

advocating for less.\u00A0 Ideally one release every 6-12 months, with that release ideally being bug free enough that you don\u0027t need to do any patch releases.\u00A0 (If the release is buggy, then by all means push a patch release or two if necessary, but hopefully you can get it stable in a few weeks.\u00A0 Mod authors who don\u0027t want to do multiple build-test-release cycles can even wait a few weeks\u00A0before updating especially if you are transparent and say, we plan to ship a\u00A0patch release in the next couple of weeks if a patch is necessary).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion maintainers of large complex\u00A0mods\u00A0need a larger breathing space between patches than 3 months.\u00A0 6-12 months seems more reasonable to me than 3 months.\u00A0 (Consider a mod author who wants to update their large complex mod, then spend roughly 80-100 hours playing a campaign with it as a playtest before deciding\u00A0it is ready to release.\u00A0 \u00A0If they can\u00A0can play an average of 8 hours a week, how many months\u00A0is that playtest going to take)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote
