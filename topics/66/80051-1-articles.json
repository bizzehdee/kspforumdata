We spent the entire day yesterday going through all our old and placeholder assets, code and packages we had in the project files, and managed to get rid of several gigabytes of stuff that we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need. This should make our lives much easier going forward. The asset mess really was reaching alarming proportions.
