For those of you not familiar with HOC, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s made severral notable KSP series such as That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s No Mun Base and his Artificial Gravity exploits, that grew his channel to a follower count of over 100,000 people. He has also hosted two charity events around a KSP mission, raising tens of thousands of dollars for [https://www.charitywater.org/](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**Charity: Water**.  \n\nAll in all one can safely say that Harvey is a true mastodon in the KSP community, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very happy to see him playing the game after a six month break.
