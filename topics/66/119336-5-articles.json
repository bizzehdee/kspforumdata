Now rewrite one knowing that thousands of people are going to read it and cite it in the future as gospel, others are going to actively look for things to criticize in it, still more are going to pound you with questions about the things you didn\u0027t do, etc. Be sure to write it in a language other than your native one, too. Devnotes, for better or worse, are now PR activities, which means that language and content have to be carefully controlled and vetted. It takes a minute or two to come up with what you want to say, but likely an hour or more to phrase it in an acceptable way. \u003Cp\u003EI liked the old format better, but I understand the switch. The devs can give their unpolished 2-minute versions to Badie or Kasper or whoever is writing these and let them do the polishing while they go back to developing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, this. Someone upthread said this must take longer than the old format implying it would negatively affect development but for the people that matter, the ones actually writing code, it takes less of their day and they can get back onto more important tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know myself how just writing an email can take unreasonable amounts of time out of my day. It\u0060s not always easy to switch between having your head deep in something to pull it out to write something then get back into it and it can disrupt your thoughts longer than the time it takes to just write it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also preferred the old format but I\u0060d rather have more dev hours concentrated on pure coding than some pretty words on the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is the trade off then I welcome it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe GPU stuff for Physix is and was always limited to some computation only (mainly particles).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, from what I have seen the real benefit will be on the order of 10-30%.

It takes them NO MORE than 10-15 tops to get them done (I know this because we have to have a weekly class session in a computer lab so I sit and watch them do it before they leave) and it\u0027s the same type of stuff, just parroting back what they did that week. 15minx52wks=13hrs, so assuming it takes them a full 15 mins and they work every week of the year, they lose under 2 work days of productivity.
