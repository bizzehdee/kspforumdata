Despite our best efforts there\u2019s\nno news to share on this front yet: we\u2019re still going through the paperwork. We\u2019ll\nkeep you updated as the situation develops of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe code\ncleanup and optimisation passes continued at the same pace as last week. Mike\n(Mu) and Bob (Roverdude) have again tackled many areas where the game could be made\nto run more efficiently. A more specific update in this area comes from Jim\n(Romfarer) and Nathanael (NathanKell) who have spent this week rewriting the\nresource flow system. Under the hood many systems have changed: Resource\nrequests and GetConnected requested are now cached per set of crossfeeding\nparts, and per resource ID. On top of that the event system created in 1.1 for when\nPartResources change state (flow mode, empty, nonempty, full, etcetera) is used\nso that the caches are updated in place rather than recreated. All in all, this\nmeans there is a small spike on staging but so long as the part count doesn\u2019t\nchange and crossfeed rules don\u2019t change the actual lookups are extremely fast\nand garbage-free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith these changes\nthe flow modes have been simplified and their number reduced to a total of\nthree main types of flow: part-only, crossfeed, and all-vessel. Part-only flow\nremains unchanged. All-vessel flow is the old mode you know well from electric\ncharge and monopropellant, and crossfeed replaces both jet and rocket engine\nflow modes. Jim has dived into graph theory and maintained a graph of the\nvessel mapping out where resources can flow. Since every connection between\nparts has an infinity flow capacity the underlying graph theory becomes relatively\nsimple and the calculations can be run in linear time. Some details are still\nbeing worked out but overall these changes means it is a lot easier to define\nresource flow rules and the whole system runs a lot faster than before. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWheels are\nstill on the development agenda: Brian (Arsonide) polished off the tail end of the wheel\nupgrade. A good part of his time was spent verifying that many of the \u2018kraken\ndrives\u2019 submitted to us by community members using the old wheels no longer\nfunction anymore. We regret to inform you that they are\nindeed\nfixed. With that out of\nthe way Brian moved on to patching a few issues with Vectrosity (a tool used to\nfor example render the orbit lines), and helping Bob (RoverDude) with the\nimplementation of the Antenna network systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently we talked\nabout Bill\u2019s (Taniwha) efforts of getting KSP to more correctly display\nintersections in orbits. He\u2019s been busy prototyping various solutions and this\nweek he got the prototype code to find all possible points of interest (between\ntwo and eight, always in pairs) when the points are not too close to each\nother. A picture says more than a thousand words, and Bill has provided two:\nthe first shows the eight points for orbits resembling hitting Gilly from\nmoderately high above Eve, the second shows the available six points on an\nintercept with a highly elliptical orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://taniwha.org/~bill/intercepts-8points.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://taniwha.org/~bill/intercepts-8points.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://taniwha.org/~bill/intercepts-extreme.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://taniwha.org/~bill/intercepts-extreme.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe QA team (Dave, TriggerAu; Mathew, sal_vager; and Steve, Squelch) have\nhad their hands full with the first test builds of version 1.2 and running the\nbug tracker cleanup we reported on last week. Especially bugs on consoles are\nproviding a challenge, as players can\u2019t provide us with the same level of debug\ninformation as PC players can. Patience and perseverance have yielded good\nresults though and we\u2019re already working on a patch to fix the issues that\nplayers are experiencing there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKasper (KasperVld) is in Mexico this week , and he, Andrea (Badie), Pablo\n(Paul Amsterdam) and Rodrigo (Roy) went to a university on Saturday to represent\nSquad at a presentation for aspiring game developers. Kasper is also preparing\na large forum update, but some potential issues with database backups need to\nbe resolved this week before the update can take place.
