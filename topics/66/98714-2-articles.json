You were great, and I thank you for your patience with the fickleness which is the KSP community.

Your humor, patience, and openness with the community will be greatly missed. When you first came on as CM, my first thought was that you could never be the same as Damion or Cap\u0027n Skunky (who had been CMs since I first started playing KSP), and you weren\u0027t, but everyone is different, and I thank you for everything you have done for the community.
