It may seem a bit too easy when coming back to Kerbin, but have you tried going to Jool? It\u0027s extremely unforgiving. So it\u0027s not actually a low entry heating setting, it\u0027s just that Kerbin has a relatively forgiving atmosphere.\n\u003E let me guess regex, it doesn\u0027t make any sense.\n\nNo, you\u0027re just talking about the wrong things. Typical reentry speeds on Kerbin are sub 3km/s (you can get a bit more when coming back from Minmus, but whatever...) and, with the current drag and heating you\u0027re never going to build up enough speed heat to really damage anything beyond small parts. Jool is entirely different because you\u0027re entering at high speeds (usually much greater that 3km/s) from interplanetary transfer and have to scrub a lot of delta-V to aerocapture, which means your parts are subject to a lot more heating most especially because you\u0027re in a thinner atmosphere for much, much longer than reentry on Kerbin. In fact, it\u0027s pretty safe to say that aerocapture on Jool from an interplanetary transfer would be fairly close to actual reentry here on Earth, at least higher up.\nSo, yeah, it boils down to the fact that Kerbin is stupid tiny, like pretty much everything else in this game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T23:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidBowman","CreatedById":111419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:55:29Z","Content":"I knew we\u0027d have devnotes when Modding Mondays came out!\n\nUnity5!

It keeps all those assets in memory forever.\n\u003E This has nothing to do with Unity, nothing to do with 64-bit, and nothing to do with modders.
