They show exactly what the spirit of collaboration and a love for the game is all about.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The first is the opening of \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1q66GGn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/1q66GGn\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;KERBAL STUFF\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Born from a want of a community-built repository, a number of members from throughout the modding community got together and built one from the ground up within a matter of months. From its inception, it\u2019s grown into an alternative to Curse for users who prefer a different and entirely community-driven experience.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The second story belongs to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;stupid_chris\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, a noted forum moderator and modding community member. He recently underwent some severe computer issues which left it needing a dire fix. Thankfully, the aid of an donor helped bring his plight to a quick end. The donation was made without any prior message or provocation on stupid_chris\u2019 behalf, either. It was yet another case of an unexpected helping hand coming from the modding community.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No matter the situation, we are always proud of how the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;KSP\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; modding community can get together and continually impress us with the ingenuity they showcase, especially when they come together with their eyes on a prize.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Have any warm community stories you\u2019d like to share?
