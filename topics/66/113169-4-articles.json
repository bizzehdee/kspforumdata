You have a platform that allows you to put information in one place, try it out.\n\u003E As Maxmaps said on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3a4ax0/were_broadening_the_ksp_universe_by_bringing_it/cs95m20) they are actually working with some studio called Flying Tiger and they will handle the port. Flying Tiger is best known for terrible Mobile games, so thats fun.\n\u003E \n\u003E I guess that is better than having the KSP team trying to do both. I still think its a terrible idea and it seems to be completely off the rails over there at this point. There\u0027s no direction.\n\nUh, why did they hook up with a company that is known to be bad at making mobile games?\n\nAt least they\u0027ll get the blame if it does down the drain."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T04:01:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Where did he say that?

Also they\u0027ve been great to work with as well, as Unity 5 was something both studios could work on at the same time and it really, really increased the speed at which we progressed through that project.\n\u003E Worry not, 1.0.3 is still being worked on and you shouldn\u0027t have to wait much longer for it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: And you\u0027d be amazed at how well the DS4 works with the game.

Sure, everyone here is a PC-gamer and plays KSP on the PC and doesn\u0027t care about other consoles. But what about the people who can\u0027t afford the time and money to set up a PC, or already have a console, and thought that KSP was a really cool idea that they could not play? They wouldn\u0027t be a part of this forum of course, because they can\u0027t play it. But when they load up their gaming news website and an article mentions that rocket sim they liked the idea of being ported to a PlayStation4, and assuming they have a PlayStation4, their eyes are gonna light up, because they get to play Kerbal Effing Space Program!\n\u003E And of course, as has been stated several times, the console dev team will not take away at all from Squad\u0027s work on the PC core game, and in fact has boosted the development of Unity 5 upgrade.\n\nYeah, this thing."},{"CreatedByName":"ximrm","CreatedById":111063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T04:09:02Z","Content":"Squad...you\u0027ve lost your mind.
