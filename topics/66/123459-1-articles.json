The fact that KSP was recognized at such a high level as being not only a videogame but also a tool to inspire children to pursue scientific careers is especially flattering, and was a real boost to the morale across the team.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Trips have been a large part of Max\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 (Maxmaps) week, coordinating not only the White House visit, but also Dan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trip to IndieCade this weekend, this will be an amazing event and he might bring back an award, as we were nominated for the Indiecade Awards there, too. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Ted is also travelling to make perform some maintenance on our build servers, this is part of the wizardry he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s applying to the build servers, which will allow us to use them a fair bit more reliably. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also looking at our internal practices surrounding their use, which will perhaps allow us to speed up the build times and automate more processes within them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The 1.0.5 patch has been doing well in QA, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all coming together. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re entering the final phase of QA where we merge the feature branches into a main QA branch so that the QA team can test the whole update together. Once that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re happy with the state of the builds we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be moving to experimental testing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the update 1.1 front the interface work continues, meaning Felipe (HarvesteR) has been working on it, very much like the week before this one, and the one before that, and as far back as we can recall. UI panels, widgets and controls are being redone to the new unity UI, and even though it feels like wading through an endless mire of work, there definitely is progress being done. Two weeks ago, the game was completely unplayable. Last week, it was already possible to get through most of the important game transitions, like launching new flights and such. This week, most features are working again, which means there certainly is a lot of progress happening. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This week the staging interface officially was also officially declared feature complete. Great news for Jim (Romfarer), as it has been a hell of a job to get there but finally it is done. Overall staging looks much the same and despite some added animations only the most meticulous players will notice the difference. A few very old visual bugs in the staging interface have been fixed though, related to how symmetry groups are split and merged together when you move staging groups or stage-icons around. In a way the new staging system works like the old one was supposed to work all along. Ultimately - aside from performance upgrades - this is exactly our goal for the user interface overhaul.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Mike (Mu) has been finishing up the currency widgets and missing apps, working on a few UI improvements to assist new and old players around the space center. He has also reworked the part action interface, which just might be getting a usability overhaul before 1.1 is released.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The amazing Dan (Danrosas) is moving ahead with his animation test for the long-term Kerbal update and everything seems to be working perfectly so far. He is looking to add a little extra detail on the mouth and he found an easier way to get an O shape. Polishing is ongoing, and once that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done the plan is to move the model to Unity, to see how it turns out in the engine.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We are starting to use a new team communication tool, which is proving to be immensely useful. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always been primarily connected via Skype chats but have always lacked in integration with the tools we use. We are now starting to use Slack, which has an unbelievable level of connectivity with everything we use, from Github, to build servers, to Twitter feeds and online to-do lists: everything is now connected, which gives us a complete dashboard of notifications for all things Kerbal. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Media group applications will take a little more than expected Andrea (Badie) and Kasper (KasperVld) are working on them. Kasper is away this week because he has an exam to prepare for which we wish him good luck! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T22:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat info.
