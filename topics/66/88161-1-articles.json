To add the new gizmos to the editor, I had to delve into one of the most convoluted areas of KSP code, the editor logic. That part of the code is very sensitive to small changes, so poorly-planned tweaks to it usually end up creating a heap of bugs. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;This time around though, I decided to put an end to it and take on a complete overhaul of the editor logic code. I undid the mess of switch statements and state logic we had, and replaced it completely by a proper finite state machine setup, using the same FSM system I wrote for the Kerbal EVAs for 0.16. The KerbalFSM system is generic and fully expandable, and allows us to have much more control over what is meant to happen and when. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Of course, this meant chucking out a lot of working editor code, but it was for the best. If we had left it as it was, we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to add new features without increasing even more the complexity of that already critically complex blob of code.

Activating root mode will allow you to select another part (from the children of the selected set) to attach by. It will reflow the hierarchy much like docking does, so the selected part becomes the new root of the hierarchy. This one is particularly useful for subassemblies and such.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;The last few days were mostly devoted to ironing out issues with the new implementation, and improving the way the editor handles rotating parts and symmetry. It is now possible to switch between Radial and Mirror symmetry modes using the Y key (a UI button will follow shortly), both in the VAB and SPH.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not yet prepared to dish out all the details as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m in the middle of implementing the logic for it atm. but you might be interested to hear what we want it to do. The plan is to have different ways to sort through parts to make it easier to find exactly what you want while at the same time preserve the old structure of the tabs as the first thing you see when you enter. The old part tabs will therefore be part of the first filtering category you see when entering these tabs are the subcategories of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSort by Function\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 filter. We have a list of other sorting methods which will be there in addition to this and the idea is to be able to select multiple groups of sorting methods to narrow down the part selection further, much in the same way the archives in R\u0026amp;D are organized.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;In addition, the stretch goal of this new GUI is an option to make custom part categories where you can put all your favorite parts. If all goes to plan, you will be able to make as many custom categories and subcategories as you want. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been organizing and looking over our liaisons with modders who are now collaborating with us (Shoutout to Porkjet and Arsonide). Other than that, following up with everyone else on the team regarding the progress of update 0.90, going over the necessary design points of the experience and trait systems, discussing the plethora of new biomes and starting to look into picking a name for the update.

We\u2019ve begun to use the Wiki feature of the redmine tracking system as a more organized and easier to use testing documentation repository. Hopefully it\u2019ll make it easier for the teams involved in testing to communicate and work on KSP. Additionally, I\u2019ve been doing some compatibility testing of the plugins and themes we use on the tracker with Redmine 2.5.2 to ensure that we can update to that version from our current one - without anything going awry. On another note, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been researching Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 4.5.5 update to explore how viable it is to update the project to it and get some early QA in.
