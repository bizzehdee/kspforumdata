If the ship is really rigid, the control point is never moving in relation to the main axis of the ship. When the ship is bendy and the control point is away from the Center of Mass, it starts bouncing around and the\u00A0controller has a problem because it\u0027s getting inaccurate errors. What I mean by that is the angular difference between where the ship is pointing and where the controller\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethinks\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the ship is pointing is not stable, because there is a constantly changing difference between the main axis of the ship and where the probe core is pointing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo imagine it this way. You have a long bendy ship with a probe core at the tip, but the ship is currently just sitting there. This is sort of like a \u0022resting axis\u0022 where everything is all lined up in it\u0027s natural position.\u00A0There\u0027s no difference in relative position from the control point (the probe core) to the Center of Mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E) of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow lets say that the ship is trying to Stability Assist and\u00A0is slightly off it\u0027s target. The controller knows it has to correct a few degrees and gives that input. The reaction wheels or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E react, but the ship bends. The control point overshoots the target orientation, so the controller says \u0022oh, that was too much\u0022 and backs off. The problem is that the \u0022resting axis\u0022\u00A0of the ship hasn\u0027t actually made it to the target yet. So as the ship unbends, it snaps back past the target again and undershoots. So the controller tries again, and the same result occurs. If the ship has just the right amount of bendy, it can become \u0022resonant.\u0022 Which means the bending response 180 degrees out of phase with the controller input. The harder the controller tries, the worse the result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis situation is fixable\u00A0buy toning down the controller a bit. The flip side to that is that the controller would then never take full advantage of a ship that isn\u0027t bendy. Non-bendy ships would then appear under-responsive and sluggish. Airplanes don\u0027t want to keep their nose up. Space ships can wobble around a bit.\u00A0And any ship that\u0027s somewhat marginally stable would become unstable because the controller doesn\u0027t push the ship hard enough to maintain stability. I personally prefer a really tight controller, so that it sort of \u0022sticks\u0022 where ever I put it. But that doesn\u0027t provide the best response for ships that aren\u0027t fairly rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther ways to fix this are by giving any of the torque providers a ramp up function, so they aren\u0027t ON and OFF (here\u0027s all the control I can muster, INSTANTLY!). Flight controls already do this.

If the ship is really rigid, the control point is never moving in relation to the main axis of the ship. When the ship is bendy and the control point is away from the Center of Mass, it starts bouncing around and the\u00A0controller has a problem because it\u0027s getting inaccurate errors. What I mean by that is the angular difference between where the ship is pointing and where the controller\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethinks\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the ship is pointing is not stable, because there is a constantly changing difference between the main axis of the ship and where the probe core is pointing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo imagine it this way. You have a long bendy ship with a probe core at the tip, but the ship is currently just sitting there. This is sort of like a \u0022resting axis\u0022 where everything is all lined up in it\u0027s natural position.\u00A0There\u0027s no difference in relative position from the control point (the probe core) to the Center of Mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow lets say that the ship is trying to Stability Assist and\u00A0is slightly off it\u0027s target. The controller knows it has to correct a few degrees and gives that input. The reaction wheels or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E react, but the ship bends. The control point overshoots the target orientation, so the controller says \u0022oh, that was too much\u0022 and backs off. The problem is that the \u0022resting axis\u0022\u00A0of the ship hasn\u0027t actually made it to the target yet. So as the ship unbends, it snaps back past the target again and undershoots. So the controller tries again, and the same result occurs. If the ship has just the right amount of bendy, it can become \u0022resonant.\u0022 Which means the bending response 180 degrees out of phase with the controller input. The harder the controller tries, the worse the result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis situation is fixable\u00A0buy toning down the controller a bit. The flip side to that is that the controller would then never take full advantage of a ship that isn\u0027t bendy. Non-bendy ships would then appear under-responsive and sluggish. Airplanes don\u0027t want to keep their nose up. Space ships can wobble around a bit.\u00A0And any ship that\u0027s somewhat marginally stable would become unstable because the controller doesn\u0027t push the ship hard enough to maintain stability. I personally prefer a really tight controller, so that it sort of \u0022sticks\u0022 where ever I put it. But that doesn\u0027t provide the best response for ships that aren\u0027t fairly rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther ways to fix this are by giving any of the torque providers a ramp up function, so they aren\u0027t ON and OFF (here\u0027s all the control I can muster, INSTANTLY!).

So if a ship is bendy, the user can manually turn down the controller a bit so that it\u0027s not so over reactive. If they need more authority, they can turn up the controller a bit.
