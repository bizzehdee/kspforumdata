So far, it seems like if you want to recover spent stages without a mod, you have to basically get their periapsis above 22km (which, for on-rails craft, is a stable orbit), take them with you (hence SSTOs having a purpose), or kick your main craft\u0027s apoapsis out far enough that you have time to ride a spent stage to the ground before the main craft needs your attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShifting from what they\u0027ve done to purely my opinion: Recovery *should* be hard; the issue is that stock KSP makes it very, very easy to safely parachute an empty stage to the ground. You can put as many radial parachutes as you want on something, for not much of a mass penalty. If recovery didn\u0027t require taking things into orbit, it would be way too easy to make a craft fully recoverable, removing any benefit to careful mission planning minimizing the amount of stuff you lose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could have done something to change it, but we haven\u0027t heard anything even *suggesting* that recovery of dropped stages would be possible; to the contrary, HarvesteR mentioned (when describing part test contracts) that using experimental SRBs for non-contract missions would require extra planning to make sure they could be recovered; if dropped stages could be recovered, there would be no need for this extra planning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-14T21:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2014 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stoani96","CreatedById":71886,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T21:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick note to that \u0022every thing further than 2.5km away from the focused craft and below 20km in atmosphere(at Kerbin)\u0022-thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad!
