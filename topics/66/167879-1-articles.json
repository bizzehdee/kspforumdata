On Monday we celebrated the 128th anniversary of \u00A0Edwin Powell Hubble\u2019s birth. Regarded as one of the most important astronomers of all time, Hubble played central role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology. Born in Marshfield, Missouri, Edwin was a gifted athlete in his younger days, but it was his intense interest in astronomy that would dictate his fate. However, upon his father\u2019s request he had to study law, though he managed to take a few math and science courses. After his father\u2019s demise in 1913, and as he did not have the motivation to practice law, he proceeded to teach Spanish, physics and mathematics at a high school in Indiana, where he also coached the boys\u2019 basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of a former professor to study astronomy at the \u003Ci\u003EUniversity of Chicago\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s \u003Ci\u003EYerkes Observatory\u003C/i\u003E, where he received his PhD in 1917. Shortly after, he volunteered for the \u003Ci\u003EUnited States Army\u003C/i\u003E and even though his Division was sent overseas to join the Great War, he never saw combat. After the end of the war, Hubble spent a year in Cambridge, where he renewed his studies of Astronomy, and in 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the\u003Ci\u003E Carnegie Institution for Science\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s \u003Ci\u003EMount Wilson Observatory\u003C/i\u003E, near Pasadena, California, by George Ellery Hale, the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant 5.1 m (200-inch) reflector \u003Ci\u003EHale Telescope\u003C/i\u003E at the\u003Ci\u003E Palomar Observatory\u003C/i\u003E near San Diego, California. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHubble discovered that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as \u201Cnebulae\u201D were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong direct relationship between a classical Cepheid variable\u2019s luminosity and pulsation period (discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt - another astronomical legend by herself) for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances. He also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the \u003Ci\u003EHubble Sequence\u003C/i\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1929 Hubble examined the relation between distance and redshift of galaxies. Combining his measurements of galaxy distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by Vesto Slipher, and by his assistant Milton L. Humason, he found a roughly linear relation between the distances of the galaxies and their redshifts, a discovery that later became known as \u003Ci\u003EHubble\u2019s Law\u003C/i\u003E. This meant, the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. This law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHubble did not receive the Nobel Prize, since the Nobel Prize in Physics did not recognize work done in astronomy. Nevertheless, the \u003Ci\u003EHubble Space Telescope\u003C/i\u003E was rightfully named in his honor and, now, his name is most widely recognized for that. What an extraordinary life for an extraordinary scientist, whose findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe. After this small homage, let\u2019s move on and talk about KSP development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[Development news start here]\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis week was not short of progress. The \u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E continues to take shape\u003C/b\u003E as components and features continue to be implemented. For instance, the team recently \u003Cb\u003Efinished implementing Story Messages into playable Missions\u003C/b\u003E. This task involved three elements. The first was the Action Message Dialog, which is a new node that displays a dialog during Mission play similar to the Tutorial dialogs. The Creator will be able to choose a character to present the message and text to display. Secondly, the developers added storage capabilities for the mission messages by having the Screen and Dialog Messages for missions store into the Messages App so they can be reviewed at any time by the Mission Player.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team also worked on \u003Cb\u003Ea small enhancement to the Graphic Action Pane (GAP)\u003C/b\u003E that will minimize it to the bottom of the right panel when there is nothing being displayed in it. It will re-expand automatically when there is a parameter selected that has a GAP display. We are trying to include these sort of quality of life features to make the process of mission creation easier and friendlier for Creators. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are looking to improve the experience for Mission Players as well. One of such improvement that the team worked on this week is a \u003Cb\u003Efeature that will allow players to see mission objectives visualized both on Map and Flight modes\u003C/b\u003E (depending on the objective), not only for Orbits and Celestial Bodies (which are already in place), but also for Ground and Overfly Targets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimultaneously, the team was busy \u003Cb\u003Edesigning the Tracking Station Display of Mission Objectives\u003C/b\u003E. The idea here is to have an overview for the \u00A0Mission Creator by using the Tracking Station with time frozen at the start of the mission. It\u2019s not 100% locked in but we are trying to add node information to the vessel list portion of the UI, while showing vessels, targets, orbits, and so on, instead of just Vessels widgets. We also want players to be able to access relevant parts of this info in the Tracking Station during Mission play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the artistic side of development, the team \u003Cb\u003Eis working on finalizing some of the UI graphics and layouts in the builder scene\u003C/b\u003E, so the expansion is starting to look rather sleek. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cb\u003Edevelopment of Update 1.4 also continues\u003C/b\u003E, which this week involved a lot of work on the Unity Upgrade branch and PartTools updates to support the new version of Unity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other news \u003Cb\u003EKSP on consoles is looking great as we approach the January release\u003C/b\u003E. The last builds are very stable and it\u2019s getting more difficult for testers to find serious issues. The test team however are always up for a challenge, and they have been working hard at finding bugs, albeit minor ones, which have been fixed this week. An example include a minor bug that was triggered when zooming in and out in one specific controller preset with the reticle unlocked and it caused a momentum that kept the camera moving towards or away from the object even after the buttons were released.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s it for this week.

You\u0027re not going to stop kids from swearing if they want to. Over protection is just as harmful as overexposure. Good parenting cannot be replaced by any lame rating and missing ratings are not an excuse for bad parenting. Only idiotic journalists claim that video games make children violent or retarded or smth. I grew up playing GTA and many other games when I was underage. I could tell it is a game and I was taught on what is good and what is bad by my parents. Parents that hope the media (games included) will educate their children for them are dumb. You don\u0027t need media to be a bad person. You can do it without violent games or naughty language. You had bad people before fire was discovered. It\u0027s not an excuse. Stop clogging developers with rules and regulations because they are not substitute for educating people\u0027s children. Only moral puritans trip over naughty words. The rest of people just want to have fun and don\u0027t scream for the world to stop just because someone said a bad word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-27T11:41:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2017 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by mystik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-27T12:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdult content (including profanity) will be treated just the same as any other such content: Not permitted on this forum and not allowed to link to it, either.

So the likelihood of multiplayer in 1.4 is about as close to 0% as it can get without SQUAD flat-out saying No.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-27T21:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223229518\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511817605\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175658\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XLjedi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, XLjedi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still do not get the concept of why anyone would want multiplayer?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...unless it still had a way to use accel time?\u00A0 Which I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve seen implemented in a multi-player game before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127731-adding-multiplayer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere \u003C/a\u003Efor a discussion on that, or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/164832-multiplayer-in-version-14/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere \u003C/a\u003Efor a more recent one.
