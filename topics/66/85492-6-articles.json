In my honest opinion destructible buildings seem like the kind of thing that should satisfy both parties. Its both a new feature and polishes the game. Lets face it buildings that can sustain the damage rockets falling on them (which I have done more than once) aren\u0027t realistic, so this is pollish in that regard, and its a new feature where can \u0022accidentally\u0022 blow up KSC. Yay fun for everyone, now you have a realistic incentive to not drop stages low and the ability to have fun with explosions. Coupled with the fact that Squad explicitly stated that this was going to be a small feature I\u0027m not really sure what everyone is complaining about.

If I want to blow a building up, I\u0027ll launch Battlefield. KSP is a game where you spend most of the time constructing and launching rockets so I personally think physical model, aerodynamics, avionics, life support, interface (separate thrust control for shuttles? Nah, haven\u0027t heard about it) are the components that need to be improved in the first place. But it looks like developers have changed the conception and are now developing FlatOut in Space. Yes, I know that it is just the ground work blah-blah, but the developers still had to create 3D-models for the destroyed buildings! That requires time that could be spent on improving more important components of the game.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve been playing KSP since 0.8.x, .24 was the first update I skipped and it looks like I\u0027ll skip .25 for the same reason - it doesn\u0027t offer anything new in the sandbox mode. I think this is the second mistake made by the developers - not everyone plays career mode, and a lack of new features in sandbox makes people bored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94770-Secret-feature-is-completely-underwhelming?p=1438507\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1438507\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94770-Secret-feature-is-completely-underwhelming?p=1438507\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1438507\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery disappointing. \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Emay\u003C/strong\u003E get another look\u0022?
