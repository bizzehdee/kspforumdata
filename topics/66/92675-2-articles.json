The old nature of contracts had kind of made me find the game more of a chore to play and I wasn\u0027t really enjoying it that much, even with the addition of so many cool new things from the last update. However with kerbal professions (hope I can fix those pesky solar panels), crazy new contracts, shuttle parts, a bunch of new biomes on far away worlds, and a upgradeable space center (Love the style btw, though if you are planning on adding a even lower tier you should totally make the VAB a crane and Jebs junkyard) I think I\u0027m going to be busy for a VERY long time now.
