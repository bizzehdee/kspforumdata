That means, for instance, that going through 100 Kerbals would be far less expensive than having a roster with a hundred active ones.\n\nFrankly, that makes no sense.

Currently I already have implemented effects when pulling high Gs, when rolling over the ground, and when intense aerodynamic effects are acting on the vessel. there are still a few other causes which I hope to implement, but even now this system already promises to be a significant enhancement to how flying feels.\n\nI certainly hope that it would be toggleable.
