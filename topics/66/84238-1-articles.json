A number of features have already been integrated into the main development branch and tested. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also taken some time to upgrade and overhaul our issue tracker, to add an issue voting system and a complete revision of the styling rules to make the more important issues more visible at a glance. This has already proven worthwhile as several issues we would have probably dismissed as being of lesser importance have surfaced with high vote counts, which indicates that even though a bug/feature request/feedback item may be technically of low severity, subjectively, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s seen as very relevant. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;This week, we are setting up the Administration Facility systems to be QA tested, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m having a go here at a little app to help maintain the issue tracker in a serviceable state.

However, since an office remodeling is going on here at Squad HQ, the main routers that provide the office with internet needed to be moved from where they were and that left us without internet access for a day.

According to the position of the building in the Space Center, you should be able to see the VAB and the Astronaut Complex.

In case you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know: an atlas is a texture with many smaller textures baked into it. The main benefit of doing this is to reduce the amount of memory used by the GUI. A prefab is basically a gameobject template used to instantiate multiple gameobjects which share the same behavior. We use those for all EzGUI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in the game because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s easier to manage scenes and atlas updates.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Over time, many of the GUI prefabs have received small updates and as a result the amount of atlases used in many of them have grown. So what I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m doing this week is re-building the atlases in order to reduce the amount of atlases in use per prefab in an effort to have as few atlases as possible in use at any point.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working closely with the art team to get the giant 0.26 project done in time.
