There should be, when you click on the forums button, a twitter feed on the right hand side with Maxmaps\u0027 latest tweets as they happen. Posts on Reddit should be links to full articles/full responses here. Tumblr gets used more often than their own blog feature here. Official Squadcasts should be nested, archived and easily accessible from right here.\n\nThe fact that this is not the case is an example of Squad failing to comprehend how new media works.\n\nNow, this is not the failure of Squad as a whole, but rather a succession of failures by previous community managers (and whoever gave those managers their marching orders) who were great at interaction, but clueless as to what they\u0027re supposed to be doing. Marketing through new media is about creating networks of consumers and guiding them to a single source to *build a community*. Kerbalspaceprogram.com is supposed to be ***the*** place to go for news and discussions about KSP.\n\nYet it isn\u0027t.\n\nIMHO, it is telling that in order to get the full picture of a feature being implemented or interacting with developers that one must scour multiple forums and mediums outside of this site. In fact, it is the second largest single major contributing factor to their continuing PR blunders and ineptitude at managing their community. They\u0027re sitting on a powder keg and don\u0027t even know it. They\u0027re clueless because their primary focus is on everywhere *but* here. It isn\u0027t malicious... Squad simply takes their own forums for granted and relies on their very capable moderators to avert catastrophe while they delude themselves that focusing elsewhere is good for business.\n\nThe ludicrous speculation and mania regarding fairings, or the new aero, or any of the other new features that are *hyped but not expanded upon* - which is ultimately the source of all the rampant speculation, mass hysteria, irrational criticasting and ridiculous conclusions we routinely see on this site - are symptoms of the fact that Squad\u0027s PR and marketing energies and focus is elsewhere. Hell, our own moderators have to hunt down hi rez images and repost them, whereas the low rez should be posted elsewhere with a link to the high rez images originally posted on this site.\n\nDrive the traffic here, not away.\n\nDuh.\n\nAnyways, I think I\u0027ve written everything I\u0027m going to write on the matter, and leave it at that.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T23:42:40Z","Content":"Like 15 pages of people crying that their tank has been re-purposed in a game that challenges you to think up new designs for new challenges.

Like you said we\u0027ll have to wait and see what the new model does.\n\nIm guessing that they arent going to do a 100% dynamic aero model, as it actually takes alot of processing power to pull something like this off. Id guess that there might be so called part occlusion (say you place a fuel tank behind a nose cone, only the nose cone is considered to exert any drag), so id guess clipped pats could act as if they were hidden behind something else. Still, until release, we can only speculate, hopefully wing effects on other wings and parts blocking wings arent modeled, but if they are RIP sci-fi replicas, as most of them NEED wings/surfaces/ect clipped inside to function at all.\n\nThe one surefire way to cancel drag (that im aware of) is clipping stuff into one of those utility or cargo bays, as thatll flag them as shielded and they shouldnt be affected or even checked by the aero model untill you open said bay. Im actually tempted to make a reentry aircraft that has wings inside one of those utility bays, is capable of reentrying on its own,"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:17:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Clipping has always allowed you to bury things but it\u0027s never affected anything, even in FAR.
