Unlike many democratic systems though Squad apparently needs a super-majority in order to get a clue. Nothing happens unless there\u0027s overwhelming opposition.\u0022 - Capt. Kipard\n\nHey Capt. Kipard\n\nI think it\u0027s important to understand what democracy isn\u0027t. Democracy isn\u0027t giving in to the loudest and most outspoken in the room, although, sadly, modern politics is increasingly about just this thing. This is ultimately what forum discussions are, not a reflection of what the majority think, but what the most outspoken think. \n\nI personally, and anecdotally (in other words, the weakest form of evidence ;-) ) don\u0027t think there is evidence a majority of the people commenting on the forums are critical of squad in the main, frankly it seems to me (but I only hang around here, not reddit or anywhere else) there is a group of about four or five of the \u0022usual suspects\u0022 who are constantly criticising (constructively, I\u0027d say most of the time, sometimes not though) squad. A passionate, often thoughtful group, but by no means reflective of a majority.\n\nEven if we take it that a majority of the forum commenting community are critical of squads approach, this is still just a fraction of the total KSP playing community.... I\u0027d argue (but have not figures at hand) most people who play KSP do not engage in the forums.\n\nSo, I\u0027d argue that Squad.... while listening to the community... should not necessarily feel obliged to take its advice in all circumstances. \n\nIndeed.... I\u0027d go further and say that designing a product by committee is rarely a good idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T00:50:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist**\n  \nforgot quote"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T06:06:09Z","Content":"It\u0027s not designing by committee.
