The enclosure is subdivided into panels, which can break off individually or in groups, which means we can have full control over how the fairing will come apart once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jettisoned. During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So we will be able to decide if we want clamshell or confetti or clamfetti.\n\u003E \n\u003E Crisis averted!"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T23:08:11Z","Content":"I dare to say that buying KSP was one of the best ideas of mine so far.
