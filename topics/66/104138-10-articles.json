Im all for the larger xenon tank, but i do have to say its not exactly that difficult to either make fuel tanks modular (total volume, pick and choose whatever you want in them), or worst case just make 2 round-8 fuel tanks, one for xenon, one for LFO. Still, im hoping that EVENTUALLY we will get procedural wings, and procedural fuel tanks that not only allow us to pick a length, but also allow us to choose what fuel we want in it (say pick LFO, LF, XE, Mono, ect). Procedural stuff will kill 2 birds with 1 stone, both cut down part count/lag/loading times, AND give us more customizability in our craft.\n\nIf push comes to shove, you can always edit the .craft files to alter the fuel loadouts to specific tanks anyways. Ive actually done this on a few ion craft as when i decide to spam massless batteries, ill just edit the properties and make higher capacity batteries (its already exploiting when you spam massless batteries, so editing batteries to have more capacity achieves the same exact thing for less part count)."},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T00:40:04Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know- well, mostly know about you guys, but im just going to keep the 0.90 Round 8 in place of the 1.0 Round 8.\n\n**AVATARS AND SIGNATURES ARE NOT ENOUGH, WE... ...I HAVE TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION! ....INCASE THE XENON ROUND 8 WILL BE A THING WITHOUT THE LFO ONE!**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:51:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **AVATARS AND SIGNATURES ARE NOT ENOUGH, WE... ...I HAVE TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION! ....INCASE THE XENON ROUND 8 WILL BE A THING WITHOUT THE LFO ONE!**\n\nDrastic Actions Engaged: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:52:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Drastic Actions Engaged: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29)\n\nYou guys actually have to engage Reddit in this, Squad doesn\u0027t care about the goings-on around here."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:52:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Drastic Actions Engaged: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29)\n\n3 mods now, this is getting really interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:00:15Z","Content":"There are at least 4 threads devoted specifically to the toroidal tank, last time I counted.
