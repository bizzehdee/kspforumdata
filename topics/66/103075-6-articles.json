And how are you going to know what happens to the AC under different conditions?\n\nAnd third, simply because you can do it for a very specific case, does not mean it gives you any sensible information, you forgot that wings can have built-in AoA, your craft is free to have any shape, and that lift and drag are not as much two independent vectors in space without direct correlation as the wording makes it sound:\n\n![airfoil.gif](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/imgflu/airfoil.gif)\n\nAs I mentioned on the previous post, you could consider forces on the Y axis as lift, and on the X axis as drag, but that loses sense on a dynamic environment.\n\nIf you want to calculate lift and drag positions you would have to pick a single frame during your flight and measure it, which wouldn\u0027t be that useful either.\n\nNow to how an actual AC is more important to your concerns than you think:\n\nCOL on the current VAB is not shown because of how the current stock KSP works, drag is inline with COM and lift is only generated by wings.\n\n\u0022Center of drag\u0022 effects only happen if you are using FAR or NEAR, on the case of FAR the stability derivatives will tell you if there is something wrong (and we will get some sort of analysis on 1.0).\n\nWhat causes the craft to flip around is not drag, but the whole aerodynamics effect, you have your AC in front of your COM, not drag.\n\nIf it\u0027s still confusing, on supersonic the drag is mostly on the tip of the airplane, and the lift moves back, so you have your \u0022center of drag\u0022 really in front of your center of mass on most cases but that does not make your craft unstable.\n\nThese scenarios where the craft flips are certainly either related to roll or yaw instability, not pitch, having your AC behind your COM ensures dynamic pitch stability (If you use FAR, check Mw), but if you have some sideslip angle and not enough tail to counter it, or too much dihedral effect, when you pitch these effects can flip your craft sideways or on a corkscrew and then flip you backwards.\n\nStall can also be a cause.\n\nAC is exactly what you want to know what is going to help with your flight characteristics, it makes sense, and it\u0027s how it actually works, I believe that a COD would cause more confusion than solve on any other case.\n\nTake rockets for instance, if you have tail fins on the bottom that does not bring your drag to the bottom, but your lift stabilizes it, you would still see the drag above the COM and that would not make any actual sense.\n\nAlso, there shouldn\u0027t be a COL either, as I mentioned previously, just an AC.\n\nIf you want to understand it a bit better I recommend you to take a look on how FAR does it, take a look at the stability derivatives and at how the COL point is represented (It\u0027s actually an AC).\n\nIf you already use it, what I just said should be a bit easier to understand now (but I believe you don\u0027t since you mentioned the nonexistent COL without wings).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T13:07:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T12:56:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E so when all those people do start playing they will be accustomed to a level of detail and visual fidelity that is not present in the game... cue disappointment.\n\u003E Why not make the video with 90% in-game footage.

I was talking about stock indeed, in FAR I don\u0027t have these problems (though have different designs). I had no idea the current stock aerodynamic model dynamically incorporates changes in CoL and CoD for supersonic speeds. Also, I forgot that CoM = CoD in stock, but as far as I recall, I am indeed getting pitch instability (defo no yaw or roll), so that shouldn\u0027t be possible according to what you said above. It might be an error on my side, let me check if I still have that craft and see if I can find the culprit.
