They\u0027re just not accounted for yet, and we\u0027re probably going to have to do some playtesting to figure out how (and if) the fairings would work in between two chunks of spacecraft.

That mod I linked changes exactly three lines of code to make the instrument work correctly.\n\nSecond, might an airspeed gauge be included for IVA? In addition to surface speed and orbital speed, how about equivalent airspeed? Just as a third option on the default speed gauge? I understand that reading EAS might be confusing for some, and probably shouldn\u0027t be included in the default external views. Players choosing to fly IVA, however, are probably seeking that more immersive experience and have already decided to learn how to interpret the instruments. This update promises better atmospheric flight, better airplanes, better flying... and just about the first thing anybody needs to understand about flying an airplane is airspeed.\n\nActually, thinking about it... you\u0027ve told us mach effects are modeled ingame. So we could probably make great use of a machmeter, otherwise players are going to wonder why their airplanes suddenly start flying completely differently, possibly going uncontrollable, at seemingly arbitrary speeds and altitudes. So I guess that\u0027s three requests. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSquad, I love your game. These are great devnotes, thank you!

The enclosure is subdivided into panels, which can break off individually or in groups, which means we can have full control over how the fairing will come apart once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jettisoned. During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\n\u003E Next up is implementing the actual jettisoning behavior for the panels, and also writing in the enclosure detection, which is already being handled by the cargo bay module. There is quite a bit of work still left to be done, but I dare say what we have is looking pretty good already. .\n\u003E \n\u003E The fairings are very customizable via the part.cfg, so we can determine the number of panels, the amount (if any) of edge smoothing between panels of different angles, as well as a number of other parameters, on a per part basis. And yes, we are planning on a number of different sizes of fairing parts (at least covering 1.25m through 3.5m profiles).\n\nYAYYY!!! STOCK FAIRINGS!!! no need to install mods! nice looking rockets! (better drag model makes it useful btw)"}]}
