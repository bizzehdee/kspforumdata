Have put a lot more work into the aero/thermal side of things plus fixed a load more issues besides.\n\nThis is really the thing I am most interested in. Fixes. Sadly it\u0027s also the *least* discussed part of any update, outside of HarvesteR occasionally expanding on a topic. \n\nYes it might sound dull, in some ways it is dull. It\u0027s also equally exciting, rather critical and is also the single biggest factor (having the most direct impact) on my enjoyment of KSP.\n\nThere is a mod for almost anything. But fixing core issues? There\u0027s only so much that can be done. Aerodynamics and engine changes are great. As are other features. Some quite welcome and arguably well overdue.

Hearing engine sounds in space is already bad enough.\n\u003E Do we really need the game to feel more arcade style?\n\nAnd yet, every astronaut that has ever flown has heard the sound of the engines in his ship and has been shaked by them, sometimes quite vigorously. Curious, huh?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Related to this, it would be a great win for usability if the right-click menus in the flight scene were decoupled from the craft position so that they stayed stable on screen. Currently, menus can be very difficult to click if the craft is spinning (or the screen is shaking). Make the menus draggable and connect them to the part with a line instead.\n\nNot that I would be against a fix such as this, but right now you can make things MUCH easier by going into chase cam. That will lock the cam to the ship, and then the thing that is moving around is the scenery, not the ship\u0027s parts. Helps a lot when you start fiddling with thrust limiters to control a rocket, for example.\n\nRune. I can\u0027t even remember right now... do you hear engines *from other ships* in space?
