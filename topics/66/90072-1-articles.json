Back to Upgradeable Facilities here as of today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recap on last week, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve made several tweaks to improve usability on the editor gizmos. Angle-snapping is improved now: holding LeftShift (remappable) will engage extra precision, reducing the angle snap interval from the default 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. This also works with both gizmos. The offset gizmo snaps to a 0.2 unit sized grid, or 0.1 when holding shift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also added something that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve wanted to add for a while now. Things like this are why I love Unity. I have always felt that the highlighting effect we have on parts was not enough to notice them sometimes, especially when you have tiny parts hidden behind other stuff. To solve that, I added a new edge-highlighting effect. It took literally just a few minutes to set it up. The shader solution was imported from the Asset Store, but this ease of implementation was also in great part due to the very massive code overhaul the editor underwent. Adding it to the old code would have made for even uglier and buggier code. .Anyhow, this new edge-highlighting effect is now used to highlight valid root candidates when using the root tool, to highlight valid destination parts (in flight) when transferring crew members around, and also to highlight parts when you mouse over their staging icons, both in the editor and in flight. This one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a long time coming. I wish everything was this easy to set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn other news, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve taken some time to sit down and actually have a proper play with the new construction tools, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll leave you with a few screenshots of my latest mission to Laythe: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cdNkfMZ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oJEGroR.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MUgYECc.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlex (aLeXmOrA): \u003C/strong\u003ERenewed the SSL Certificate for the KSP website and set the company\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s email address for our newest team member: Kasper. I also helped Ted with some changes to the bugtracker configuration, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s easier for the QA team to follow the issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike (Mu):\u003C/strong\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had my hands full with more UI additions for the XP system as well as cleaning up and clarifying how XP is allocated on the back end. Have also been assisting in implementation of the tooltips, FinePrint and the new Mk3 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarco (Samssonart): \u003C/strong\u003ELast week was QA of the building markers, and I also moved on to another feature. I am implementing Nick, Roger and Daniel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s buildings into the game. What this means is taking the prefabs these guys did and making sure they all are destructible and upgradeable. The part where they have to be destructible is quite a lot of work, because I have to set up a collider array that closely matches the building\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s shape. The easiest thing would be to use the same building\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mesh as a collider, but this is far from optimal. The collision detection using meshes is quite expensive in terms of computing and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s proportional to the mesh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s complexity, number of vertices, triangles and all that mumbo jumbo. So, what has to be done is work with primitives, planes, cubes, spheres, capsules and cylinders as best as I can in order to get a shape that closely matches the building\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and is not as hard on the calculations. There are some cases, however, where a mesh collider cannot be avoided, especially with the wrecked models, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been trying to keep these to a bare minimum. Since Roger, Dan and Nick did the hell of a job optimizing those models a few of these won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t lay as heavy on my conscience, the heaviest of these building models have roughly 6k triangles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am mostly done with the colliders and all the other stuff. Just today, I started with something really fun - exploding stuff. Seriously, every single asset that can be destroyed in the Space Center has to have a unique explosion animation, so this means particle effects. This is what I will be working on for the remainder of the week most likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel (danRosas)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E Got some interesting reviews on the weekend and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re moving forward with the assets and making the proper adjustments to have them be the best way possible. Our game is that particular case where we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re moving back and forth on asset creation, implementation, etc, and we rely on our community to deliver the best result possible. Talked with Miguel and Felipe, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re doing some changes on the approach to the feature. Hopefully you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to see what we come up with during QA. In the meantime, this week we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be modeling, texturing, and moving in and out of Unity, testing out everything that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s being done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJim (Romfarer)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E It has been another week with crazy hours to get this update on track. Up until Thursday, I was working to get the new editor toolbar ready for QA. As it turned out it needed some revisions. Earlier today, I finished those revisions and i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m actually sitting here as i type this discussing it with the QA team. The most important change that came out of this process was the introduction of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csimple\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cadvanced\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 mode for the toolbar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn simple mode you get access to the tabs you had before without subassemblies. The reasoning behind this is that simple mode is intended for new users and i consider subassemblies to be an advanced feature. Enabling advanced mode will open up a second toolbar where you have access to more ways to filter parts with multi select or not, subassemblies and custom categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMax (Maxmaps):\u003C/strong\u003E .Had a veritable mountain of feedback to sort through after the building showcase. Other than that, a ton of good stuff is coming along in QA regarding editors and experience. Our version of Fine Print has been growing into a lovely thing, and Porkjet, is once agian knocking it out of the park with the new MK3 models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the feedback though, there is more to be said. We had communications issues regarding the state of the models that we showed you and ended up picking work that wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really ready to showcase. We have been working hard at Squad to up the graphical standard the KSP community deserves and displaying roughly the earliest 20% of the work that so far had been done as the culmination of it was not the right way to go about it. It actually ended up being a great thing, though, as after several meetings and long talks, all your feedback lead to the reevaluation of a lot of the work currently being done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those buildings are now going through a thorough revision and the ones showcased in all likelihood will therefore not be ready for 0.90. Fear not, as we have a whole second tier of visual buildings (think industrial park turned space center) that need only minor adjustments and will be there to showcase the upgradable buildings as a feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once more, thank you for your feedback, enthusiasm and support. Where other communities would have turned downright toxic you (mostly!) just showered us in constructive criticism and we can never be thankful enough for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETed (Ted):\u003C/strong\u003E Another busy week over here in QA HQ! There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not too many specifics to talk about, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll try make this an engrossing read nevertheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I mentioned last week, this week we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had the Editor Overhaul branch in testing with the QA Team and that was incredibly productive in all manners. There was a lot of usability feedback about the UI/UX and how the part filtering and categorization was displayed to the player. Romfarer/Jim then worked tirelessly with the ever-outstanding QA Team to narrow down the feedback to an ideal user experience that could be implemented via a series of minor changes, resulting in a revision that would be both more intuitive to old players and less overwhelming to a new player. *hands mic to Jim to talk about those changes*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gizmos part of the Editor Overhaul went through QA pretty easily, with only a handful of revisions and bugfixes being required - which were raced through by HarvesteR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been planning out the finer points of this week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s QA to ensure that we get the most out of it and each feature both enters and exits QA seamlessly; ready for integration and - eventually - Experimental testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been testing out Arsonide\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s implementation of Fine Print into stock KSP and I must say that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s looking to be a very, very welcome addition to KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s contract system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnthony (Rowsdower):\u003C/strong\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s funny how things can change from day to day. Not so long ago, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d said on Reddit that the barn was staying and that modeling and textures would be looked into. Today, as you read, it turns out that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be looked into so much that the whole tier one system won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be ready for 0.90, after all. These are the types of changes that can happen - and happen fast - when detailed community feedback and continual internal monologues occur on a constant basis. Just another day in the life\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of changes, my duties have shifted a bit around here. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been put in charge some things that Max and Calisker used to focus on, but for obvious reasons, they either have different priorities going or they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re simply not around to do them anymore. Things like encouraging gamers from channels outside the community to join us here have been entrusted to me. Now what does this mean for you? Not too much, really. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still the CM and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still good for spreading goodwill and crummy jokes throughout the community, however, my focus is now much broader. For instance, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to notice a little less of me around the forum, particularly in a capacity of moderation.
