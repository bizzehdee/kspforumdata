For very good reasons, and with very good results! Why the change now? \n\nYou have years of experience under your belt, telling you not to release a feature before it\u0027s ready, telling you it\u0027s okay to go back to work and release it later. Remember the first version of the contracts? Remember going to experimentals, finding the contracts weren\u0027t ready, and choosing to go back to work on them some more? That was a good idea!\n\nIt\u0027s so mystifying. *Everybody* who cares about KSP and has been paying even slight attention knows that this is not the way to officially release a game. All of Squad\u0027s previous words and actions illustrate that you know this better than anybody. It looks exactly like control of the whole project has fallen into the hands of some new party clueless about game development; somebody who doesn\u0027t care about the game\u0027s commercial success. If that\u0027s not what changed... what did?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:00:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I view career as so much more than \u0022unlocking stuff\u0022. It\u0027s about accomplishing what you can with the tools and funding you have available, then being rewarded for your successes. Once the tech tree is fully researched, the game doesn\u0027t end: you still have your reputation and funds to balance and you still have plenty to do from that point onwards. You can go ahead with contracts to fund your own agenda.\n\nI agree that\u0027s how it should be, (tech tree just the start), but I also agree with tater:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The point of a campaign or career game is to provide some sort of context, and be immersive, IMO. That I have to actively alter the way I view contracts is in fact anti-immersive. I have to assume any pure science contracts are not \u0022contracts,\u0022 but ideas from my own scientists, for example. \n\u003E Like it or not, unlocking tech is the only reward system. We can all play for our own reasons, but there is some psychology at play\n\nThe problem I have with cthe tech tree is it presents a more clear, tangible goal than anything else. That and the way each biome can basically be ticked of makes the game seem less about having your own space program, and more about going planet hoping until everything is ticked off. \n\nThere are contracts, but having them as the main reason to keep going to other planets, and to set up bases and things takes the initiative out of the players hands. It\u0027s like someone else is calling the shots, and the player just executing them."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:24:39Z","Content":"Tw1, what if contracts and what are now the \u0022explore\u0022 contracts were very explicitly different things.

You\u0027d need to survey, or take a ridiculously low alt photo of some part of the Mun, for example, and that would cause a new explore contract to be generated to land---within XXkm of where that last mission was accomplished. Have a pattern of doing science that makes sense. Orbital science (mapping, really), hi-res images of landing sites (visual survey at ridiculous altitudes (so maybe a crasher type probe)). Completion then unlocks the landing missions, but generated procedurally using the coords of the hi-res mission(s). Those contain the EVA, sample collection, and other science, perhaps as they are now, scattered nearby (with that point as the center, and all within some range).\n\nWith scanning in, \u0022biome\u0022 specific science might not be available until you first ID the biome\u0027s existence via mapping, etc. That creates some immersion, IMHO."},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:41:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **The release animations are a waste of time!** please redirect that art and animation talent to producing and refining IN-GAME CONTENT.\n\nThe release animations aren\u0027t made for us, they\u0027re there to showcase the game to those who may be interested in buying it.

This is a good thing.\n\nBleating about fixing in-game asset quality is pointless when there is a maximum ceiling of ~3.5GB of ram before Unity 32bit will crash.

Apart from the engine not coping with the \u0022load everything always\u0022 model of texture management and crapping itself.\n\nAs it is, that ceiling is so close the developer is considering the stock use DDS texture formatting to actually cope with the (increased yet again) ridiculous numbers and amount of in-game of textures. This means 1.0 is likely to have a considerable footprint increase.\n\nYes I\u0027d like to see some better textures. So would most people. However such finesse usually occurs towards the end of the build cycle once the actual mechanics and frameworks are stable; right now core functionality is broken in some not-great ways; and the animation and graphics guys can\u0027t really do much about that, hey.\n\nDan working on in-game assets is happening anyway.

Have a contract to unlock a node you don\u0027t need? Pft, skip it. If anything, I\u0027m not sure the tech tree implements this well enough.

Why should a player\u0027s game experience be the one that is arbitrarily set (either by statistical analysis or a ridiculous need to cling to 80s gameplay) rather than an organic process of exploration *that can change with every new game?*\n\nAnd why does it have to be set exclusively to contracts? Why can\u0027t contracts make it easier to gain access to a node, or reveal a node earlier? Or parts for that matter? In fact, why can\u0027t we have nodes with overlapping/shared parts between them that are accessed at different times or triggered by certain events?

That\u0027s the *hypothesis*.\n\nThe *reality* is that they\u0027re in a mad rush to get something out for 1.0 cutting corners all over the place.\n\nIf you want to see an extreme example of that just look into how much Beats by Dre cost to make, and to advertise. I\u0027m not a sound engineer, but those who are say they are mediocre headphones at best, while well over 2/3ds of his costs goes towards marketing. And then people buy them for $300... ridiculous.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am as excited for an animation as much as the actual game realese. I was crushed when there was no .90 animation.\n\nThey were crushed, CRUSHED I say, disheartened, utterly dismayed, a shell of a person. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For the past 3 1/2 years *at least*, Squad has moved deadlines all over the place! For very good reasons, and with very good results! Why the change now? \n\u003E You have years of experience under your belt, telling you not to release a feature before it\u0027s ready, telling you it\u0027s okay to go back to work and release it later. Remember the first version of the contracts? Remember going to experimentals, finding the contracts weren\u0027t ready, and choosing to go back to work on them some more? That was a good idea!\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s so mystifying. *Everybody* who cares about KSP and has been paying even slight attention knows that this is not the way to officially release a game. All of Squad\u0027s previous words and actions illustrate that you know this better than anybody. It looks exactly like control of the whole project has fallen into the hands of some new party clueless about game development; somebody who doesn\u0027t care about the game\u0027s commercial success. If that\u0027s not what changed... what did?\n\nAsking the real questions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The release animations aren\u0027t made for us, they\u0027re there to showcase the game to those who may be interested in buying it.\n\nI think you\u0027re confused about what showcasing is. I often see gamers complain about pre-rendered not-in-game animations in advertising. Somehow not here though.
