While still in active development for PC, Mac and Linux, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;KSP: Beta Than Ever\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; marks a major milestone, as it is the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first beta release. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the first major step in the process of growing out of early access and into a fully launched game.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Building upon a long term project that was introduced with the last update\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s destructible facilities, players will now have the ability to start from the ground up with a basic space center and turn it into a sprawling compound in the new upgradable facilities feature. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not just buildings, either. Players will unlock new capabilities and bonuses as their career path progresses.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Speaking of progression, the new Kerbal Experience system allows for the Kerbals, themselves, to progress as they never have before. Kerbals have gained specialized skills that players can improve by taking them on missions. Advanced piloting, science gathering and spacecraft repairs are just a few of the things Kerbal crews can do as they gain experience.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; In surprise move, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Squad\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;European Space Agency (ESA)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; have banded together to provide a special treat for players.
