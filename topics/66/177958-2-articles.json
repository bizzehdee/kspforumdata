They ship anyway, then do nothing about fixing it... Until they change the game engine again and introduce different bugs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt happened when KSP was crashing people\u0027s window managers, it happened when the game was constantly crashing to desktop - I take it you recall \u0022double free or corruption\u0022? I sure do. Lately, it\u0027s been\u00A0 happening with regard to wheel physics almost every release.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of GNU/Linux joystick support, the cause was understood nearly a year before 1.4.0 shipped (if the Unity forums are anything to go by), so either Squad failed to test their game on one of the officially supported platforms, or they simply don\u0027t care. They based the release on a known-broken game engine, and they appear completely unwilling to fix it even when a demonstration of how to do so is freely available in the form of a mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI figured out how read events from my joystick with about 20 minutes of SDL tutorials, and that includes finding them. This is not a difficult problem to solve, and there is no reason bar laziness or obstinacy to wait for Unity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad has done nothing at all that I can see, except to subtly blame Unity, SDL and the open-source community at large.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as I am aware, nobody held a gun to the devs heads and forced them to use this particular Unity release, so blaming Unity for the problem is largely irrelevant.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEveryone else is using SDL for input successfully, so I see no problem there either.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the \u0022open source community\u0022 \u0022making some great gains with the database\u0022 (the GameController DB), this is, frankly, kind of insulting. It\u0027s not their job, because that\u0027s not what it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Efor\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe purpose of the GameController API and its associated database is to use the xbox controller as a lingua franca for xbox-controller clones and \u003Cem\u003Egeneric gamepads\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf Unity wants to use GameController and GameController only for input, \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E can populate the database with mappings, and \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E can add the functionality to properly support joysticks and steering wheels.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe same goes for Squad: if they want to use Unity, they get to deal with it\u0027s perversions. A way to do so (using SDL directly) is aptly demonstrated in the AFBW sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-01T14:29:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2018 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-01T15:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223443364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177958\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535808659\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262955\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deddly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Deddly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious as to why you don\u0027t stick with 1.3.x?

take it over the older one, but i have to say that the end cap looks terrible, no normal map to make the bolts stand out, random black circle in the middle which serves no purpose from what i can tell but makes it look bad (old end cap was much better even if that too wasnt really good), and generally too sharp edges with no speculars or good shading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hex-2 is a part that i use so rarely (and i think its only on a single one of my capital ship designs in a spot where you can even see it) that im not gonna have a fit if it looks like crap like it does in the stock game, but i have to say that outside of the foil texture itself, there is not much i like about that part compared to the older one, and i feel that it really didnt even take that much effort to make either unlike most of the porkjet parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the foil texture and reflections i like, but my main complain with it is that the edges seem way out of place, the texture goes from greyish metal/plastic to foil with no defining edge feature (besides the obvious 3d model edge) that would make sense to have on the edge.\u00A0 It would be better if the foil wrapped itself around that edge and then had a distinctive seam where the foil goes underneath the metal or something similar so it doesnt look like the texture just ends on the face instantly (this is also an issue with the new 2.5m tanks, the edges just end too abruptly which looks good when the tanks are covered with something, but badly when the end is exposed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221TZLbVw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/1TZLbVw.png\u0022
