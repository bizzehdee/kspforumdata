This turned out to be one gigantic system, which obviously means it took much longer than expected, but it also means that we have a very powerful, expandable, mod-friendly system that we can use to generate all sorts of interesting contracts. With such a large system, we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t shooting to have it fully completed in this update, but rather to have the underlying framework for it working to its best capability, so we (and the modders) can get creative with it later on and make the most of it. In terms of code complexity, the Contracts Framework is likely the new most complex single feature we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got.

There will always be bugs - you just have to accept that as fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you should apply to being a tester as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T11:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBTW, I think it would be a good idea to make some kind of a poll so that community could express what we would like to see in the next few updates the most. I\u0027m talking about things like more biomes or planets, not something \u0022new\u0022 requiring a lot of work with the code bur rather something filling gaps.

For us veterans small discrepancies and minor bugs might not be as big of a deal, because we understand how most of the stuff works and also know what is not supposed to work or happen. For new players though, small stuff can really make or break those first 30 minutes and therefore might scare them away of this (otherwise) very good game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been holding out on starting a new career since 0.23.5 came out and really looking forward to trying it all out with the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep it up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T12:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoooohoo!
