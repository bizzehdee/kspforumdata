The Kerbal Life Sciences mod changes that now by allowing you to perform real life physical experiments on your Kerbonauts.\n\nThe mod provides two experiments: the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity and the Sonographic Astronaut Vertebral Examination.   \n\nCheck out the video below and the [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112340](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**forum thread** to find out more!  \n\u003Cfigure data-url=\u0022https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4ScPt5UMMQw\u0022 data-orig-height=\u0022304\u0022 data-orig-width=\u0022540\u0022 data-provider=\u0022youtube\u0022 class=\u0022tmblr-embed tmblr-full\u0022\u003E\u003Ciframe id=\u0022youtube_iframe\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ScPt5UMMQw?feature=oembed\u0026enablejsapi=1\u0026origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026wmode=opaque\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022304\u0022 width=\u0022540\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T22:10:14Z","Content":"Glad to see this mod featured, it integrates nicely into what I am pleased to call \u0022stock\\*\u0022.\n\n\\*may contain MechJeb, TAC-LS, USI, and/or other mods."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T22:45:36Z","Content":"Lol, does it eat up the Kerbal?"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T00:38:29Z","Content":"It would be nice to see different kinds of science integrated into the stock experience."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T02:43:02Z","Content":"Jeb, Bob, Bill!? ,,, You\u0027ve just been promoted ,,, to lab rats."},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:00:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sonographic Astronaut Vertebral Examination\n\nThis always makes me think about Dala softly oOOoOOOoooohing at me in the think tank.\n\nThis, along with all Nehemiah\u0027s science mods, really add to the science bits of the game."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T06:09:17Z","Content":"Well deserved recognition, Nehemia\u0027s set of science mods are great and really add to the stock game."},{"CreatedByName":"AlfredTus","CreatedById":139567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T22:53:29Z","Content":"ggcarmelo do you think you could put up a link to your csv rosters file with MJ and Kareem and Real Madrid?
