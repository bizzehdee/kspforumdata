I have a gut feeling that the game can, as it stands right now, only recognise a \u0027new\u0027 vessel and charge you as needed. Like I said, make it remember what parts were already bought and only charge me for new parts. That way, I\u0027m still paying for the fuel and payload but the plane that I\u0027ve already paid for is still mine and if a wing breaks upon landing, I can pay to replace it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn intermediate step could be a special \u0022refurbish mode\u0022 for VAB/SPH:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer could either recover/sell or recover/store a landed craft on Kerbin (with any rules for costs anyone would like, not important right now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stored crafts could be loaded into VAB/SPH, but the player can only add subassemblies - refueling would be automatic and charge for the full amount to simulate additional costs like inspection and vacuuming the cockpit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T07:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey could have it so that anything that passes into despawn range over kerbin is auto-recovered, but you get a massive refund penalty for not recovering it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T07:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey could have it so that anything that passes into despawn range over kerbin is auto-recovered, but you get a massive refund penalty for not recovering it manually.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore like every assembly of parts with a parachute below a certain height and inside a few minutes time frame since launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A-r-c-h-o-n","CreatedById":93695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T07:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis actually strikes me as a good balance. Reusability is difficult to make work well in real life, and it is so in KSP.

You can get good reusability but you have to work a bit for it. If the recovery mechanic worked the way some are suggesting (i.e. 100% recovery), we\u0027d basically \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to use reusable craft to be economically efficient; I like that the system doesn\u0027t railroad players that way and supports different play styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another thread talking about recovery mechanics, I suggested that there be a line of tech nodes that grant ever better recovery percentages; this struck me as a good compromise in that players who aren\u0027t interested in reusability can still be economically competitive, while players who do want reusability can pursue those techs and recover most or all of their reusable ships\u0027 cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
