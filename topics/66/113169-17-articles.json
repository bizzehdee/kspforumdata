That configuration can hold prograde (with the heat shield in front) so long as the power lasts. the moment you lose power, your command pod would flip around because aerodynamic stability was 180 degrees from what it should have been.\n\nThey fixed that right quick, and also made it so the fix wasn\u0027t necessary by turning the heat down so far that you can re-enter at over 6km/s withOUT a heat shield and still survive.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E However, all this raging over a console port absolutely is nothing but insufferable whining.

The communication could have been handled better.

Sony is doing things pretty much right when it comes to Playstation Plus and indie games. The fact that KSP is accepted, is more or less a mark of quality. (Still won\u0027t buy a console, though)\n\nOn top of that, half the company was on a well-deserved vacation. I\u0027m not usually my best at work two days after I get back from vacation. That\u0027s not to say I don\u0027t look forwards to the devnotes. I missed them as well last Tuesday. But there will be a Tuesday next week.

I teach aerospace courses to college kids, and I was actually really excited about the EDU version, enough so that I went in and told my boss and colleagues how awesome KSP is. Egg on my face. I love playing KSP, crashes and all, but there\u0027s no way in HELL I\u0027m introducing this in my classroom. I think this game has massive potential, and I really like the way it illustrates concepts of flight in an easy to understand way (like weight and balance in the SPH)... but more and more I\u0027ve been turned off by the fact that the 1.0 version feels like it should be a pre-release candidate, what with so many bugs, that the timing of 1.0 had more to do with the dev\u0027s vacation schedule than it did with production, and the fact that there are GLARING BUGS in the game that squad is taking their time fixing and spending virtually no time addressing.\n\nLet me tell you guys something. Yes, NASA showed interest in your game. Yes, you got a ps4 deal.

What it boils down to is the \u0022PC masterrace\u0022 crowd losing exclusiveness and feeling betrayed.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head. I can see no way the degree of the response is proportional to anything. It\u0027s whiny, rude, graceless, thoughtless, and completely free--as the internet so often is--of any degree of proportion. I find it absolutely fetid rubbish and a big bowl of sour grapes.\n\nPoint by point:\n\n- I congratulate Squad on getting to PS4 and the dream of popularizing an amazing game amongst Playstation gamers and especially their countrymen who deserve to understand what a wonderful development team they have right in their backyard. This should be a point of national pride and joy for Mexico and, if nothing else, a true victory lap for these guys.\n\n- I congratulate Flying Tiger on getting the contract. I trust that their experience will help KSP translate well to a living room experience. The most difficult task will be UI design, but I\u0027ve seen previous efforts such as X-Com done well elsewhere that I would not have anticipated being as clean or controllable. It doesn\u0027t use the same mechanical design, but then I didn\u0027t expect X-Com to do as well as it did. I express my optimism.\n\n- I really don\u0027t care about Flying Tiger\u0027s pedigree. inXile has done small games I care little for but which paid the bills and they\u0027re working on a spiritual sequel to my favorite game of all time: Planescape Torment. Other studios have done the same. I look on this as their big break and a chance to show what they can do.\n\n- I also don\u0027t care about the console politics. PC vs console conflicts are largely garbage in any case. I\u0027ll cheer any great game that makes the leap from one platform to the other. It means the game is doing well and deserves to do well on a cousin platform.\n\n- The release pattern of KSP follows very closely to Minecraft. I have not seen Minecraft\u0027s development degrade with either the Xbox release or any of their mobile releases or even the Raspberry Pi (hey there\u0027s an idea and a challenge Squad!). So far as I know (I\u0027m about played out on Minecraft for a long time), the development is still going well post Microsoft acquisition. The software company has state publicly and repeatedly they don\u0027t want to kill or hurt what Mojang is doing. It could change in the future, certainly. Public companies can sometimes get fickle over a long period such as a decade, but so far so good. The key takeaway is that the PC game Minecraft hasn\u0027t actually been actively damaged. It\u0027s still there in all its Java \u0022glory\u0022 as playable and fund as it was three years ago. Mods are still actively developed and used. I cannot see KSP being any different.\n\n- Read the clues carefully. Harvester is doing everything he can by hints and outright internet yelling to tell you all they\u0027re working really hard on KSP. Check out his article: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/345-KSP-and-Unity-5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/345-KSP-and-Unity-5).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Little footnote: In case you\u0027re wondering why we don\u0027t write articles like this more often, it took me over an hour to write and proof-read this, which could have been development time. In the time it takes to write an article post, we can fix an average of 0.9 bugs, tweak 10\u002B balance items, run one test build, or put exactly one article writing\u0027s worth of time into a developing a new feature. \n\u003E Cheers\n\nHow about that, huh? He\u0027s measuring his time to the hour and rues every one wasted not developing KSP. Doesn\u0027t remotely sound like \u0022abandonment\u0022.\n\nAlso:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s worth mentioning though, that our moving to U5, which I think is fair to say is something everyone has been asking for quite a while, has been largely sped up by our collab with FlyingTiger, who are developing the PS4 version. The first step for them was to move the game into U5, and because that was something that affected the entire project, we felt the best way to go about it was to work together on upgrading the project, so the PC version wouldn\u0027t be stuck on Unity4 as they moved on. So contrary to popular belief, the move into PS4 is actually giving PC development a boost, not hindering it.\n\nWell goodness gracious. If you have any modicum of trust in Squad and in Harvester\u0027s word (And don\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t because you\u0027re taking actual time to write actual words in response to a missing weekly blurb from the same guy. Claiming your disgust with Squad and making dramatic \u0022It\u0027s over!\u0022 gestures ring hollow when you post here. Of course you care.), then it sounds like this is win-win, not remotely a zero-sum tradeoff.\n\n- The PS4 announcement was a little strange. It would have been better to be a separate announcement rather than replace dev notes. I look forward to Tuesdays as much as anyone here, but I\u0027m surely not going to fly off the handle about a missing installment. For those who need some social guidance, the proper response if you\u0027re annoyed by that would be something like: \n\n\u0022Huh. Hey Squad, thanks for that announcement, but could you not displace the dev notes to do so in the future? I get that you\u0027re excited, but we look forward to dev notes and it\u0027s a little cheeky to drop them like that. Thanks!\u0022 \n\nSee? No overreaction required and Squad would be much more likely to respond kindly. You don\u0027t always have to get so damned dramatic. In fact I\u0027ll go further. A lot of you guys need to learn to restrain yourselves. It\u0027s the internet, I get it, and a lot of people do this. But you\u0027re not classy grown-ups when you do that. Seek a better, restrained, classier self alright? \\*Even on the semi-anonymous internet\\*. You\u0027ll go farther in life. I wouldn\u0027t normally lecture random people like that, but you all have the patience to play and love a hard-core physics simulation so you already get more respect and regard from me than, say, Something Awful. So don\u0027t consider it patronizing. Consider it an embarrassed acquaintance whispering to you to back off the volume a hair.\n\n![image.jpg?w=600\u0026c=1](http://memecrunch.com/meme/3EGZV/drama-free-zone/image.jpg?w=600\u0026c=1)\n\nSummary: Good gravy you guys are overreacting. Back it off and stay off the boards for a week. Take a breather. Play some sandbox mode. Enjoy the sunshine.
