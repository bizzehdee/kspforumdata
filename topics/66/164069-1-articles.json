In 1971, the ninth manned mission of the Apollo program took place, \u003Ci\u003EApollo 15\u003C/i\u003E. It was the fourth to land on the Moon and it was the first mission on which the \u003Ci\u003ELunar Rover Vehicle \u003C/i\u003Ewas used. The mission began on July 26 and ended on August 7, but it was on this day, an hour before the burn to take the crew back home, that the last activity in lunar orbit took place: the release of the \u003Ci\u003EApollo 15 Particles and Fields Subsatellite\u003C/i\u003E (PFS-1). The satellite was released into lunar orbit from the SIM bay. Its main objectives were to study the plasma, particle, and magnetic field environment of the Moon and map the lunar gravity field. Specifically, it measured plasma and energetic particle intensities and vector magnetic fields, and facilitated tracking of the satellite velocity to high precision. The satellite orbited the Moon and returned data from August 4, 1971 until January 1973. In later years, through a study of many lunar orbiting satellites, scientists came to discover that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable. Fortunately, PFS-1 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, very near to one of only four lunar frozen orbits, where a lunar satellite may remain indefinitely. The \u003Ci\u003EApollo 15\u003C/i\u003E mission was regarded at the time as the most successful manned flight ever achieved and it was very well documented, giving us some of the most emblematic video and photographic footage of the Apollo missions (NASA\u2019s full image archive for the mission is located \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/images15.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E). How many of you have tried to recreate this mission on KSP, with both the LRV and PFS-1 deployments? It\u2019s certainly a challenge worth trying, but now let\u2019s move on to what you all came here for\u2026news regarding KSP development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe QA team is continuing with the \u003Cb\u003Everification testing of the final bug fixes for the upcoming 1.3.1 patch release\u003C/b\u003E. As part of this effort, the team has to double-check various hard-to-find strings, to ensure that they are present and correct. String testing, in case you didn\u2019t know, is the testing of a collection of units that have a logical relationship or flow from the user\u2019s perspective. As with every patch, we try to include the biggest amount of fixes we can and QA plays a crucial part identifying the issues and verifying the ones reported by the community, so that the devs can correct them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, QA is playing a huge role on the current phase of the development of the updated version of KSP for consoles. As we\u2019ve explained, we are currently \u003Cb\u003Eputting the console builds under the most scrutinous testing we can\u003C/b\u003E with both the internal and external testing teams throwing everything at them. This close inspection has allowed us to detect even the smallest issues. For instance, the team recently found an interesting console bug, where going back to the Space Center will also revert a craft to the runway under some circumstances. This and any issue found is immediately and directly reported to our friends at \u003Ci\u003EBlitworks\u003C/i\u003E, who with the help and expertise from our team work to find a solution and implement it for the following builds. Additionally, at this point we can confirm that there will be partial support for the cheats menu on consoles, but not everything will work as it does on PC today. However, we will try to improve the support in future versions we release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cb\u003Edevelopment of the \u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E continues\u003C/b\u003E and each passing week it\u2019s looking better. Although the work on its design continues, that hasn\u2019t stopped the devs to advance with the development and to continue the work on some of the features. Some of the tasks involves \u003Cb\u003Eimproving processes that help to organize ourselves\u003C/b\u003E. For example, this week we\u2019ve spent some time on the build pipeline so we can start testing the work on asset bundles and expansion loading throughout the entire process. This involves updating the \u003Ci\u003EJenkins \u003C/i\u003Ebuild jobs, adding steps where necessary and sorting out the distribution endpoints as well. \u003Ci\u003EJenkins \u003C/i\u003Eis a server that helps to automate the non-human part of the development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery. It\u2019s not as exciting as coding in KSP, but is sort of important if we want people to be able to play all our work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other respects, the devs \u003Cb\u003Ecompleted the work from last week regarding the UI elements for all vessel parameters and setup for the start of a mission\u003C/b\u003E. They also completed hooking up the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E scene to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E scenes to allow the Mission Creator to switch to these scenes in order to create vessels they wish to supply as part of a mission. Also saving of vessels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E during mission building persists these files to the mission folder and when the Mission Creator returns to the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E Scene directly from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E any craft files they have saved become immediately available for them to assign in their mission. As a Mission Creator you can provide already built vessels for a mission or allow the player to build their own within the constraints defined by the Mission Creator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cb\u003Evessel placement on celestial bodies feature got its final touches this week\u003C/b\u003E, too. It is now integrated with the rest of the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E and the Mission Creator will now be able to rotate vessels and edit their positional values in the different panels of the UI. So now we are able to add vessel placement and information within mission nodes. Hopefully this will all be finalized in the next week and this will bring a great deal of functionality to the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E, along with the other features that are already implemented as we are starting to see some features of the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E drawing closer to development complete. Similarly, some of the devs have been \u003Cb\u003Eworking on a new \u003Ci\u003EOrbit Editor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E, which will let Mission Creators manipulate the orbit of different objects, such as the vessel location, and make orbit comparison tests around the celestial bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from the tasks mentioned above, the team has been working on importing and exporting missions in nice compressed packages, as well as on a UI \u003Cb\u003Eselection system for the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E parameters\u003C/b\u003E. This new system shows visual cues on the selected parameters and handles the activation and deactivation of the parameter Graphic Action Pane, for short, GAP ( if the parameters have one). The team also spent some time working on the new service module\u2019s code - yes, the one we showed you last week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimultaneously, on the artistic side of the development,\u00A0the team finished with the modeling of the Voskhod 1- and 2-inspired IVAs and are now texturing the details. The artists have also \u003Cb\u003Ebegan designing a mobile launch pad\u003C/b\u003E! This launch pad has to be modular to fit various diameters, and has to have a terrain leveling system. The artists are taking inspiration from the crawler-transporter with some elements from other industrial facilities and applications. More details will be released later about this mobile launch pad and how it will work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we remind you that you still have another week to participate in our latest \u003Ci\u003E\u003Cb\u003EKSP Challenge\u003C/b\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163697-ksp-challenge-the-mun-arch-speed-challenge/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThe Mun Arch Speed Challenge!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/i\u003E \u00A0So go check it out and share your creations!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s it for this week.
