I think you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll agree when I tell you what it is\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Which is now: Editor Gizmos! \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Tired of trying to guess which key from WSADQE you should press to rotate some way or another? So are we. The gizmos are but one part of a massive Editor overhaul we are working on for 0.26, and they should make life a LOT easier. Really, there aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t many ways to overstate just how much of an improvement this should be.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m adding both a rotation and a translation gizmo here. Translating parts is going to be something of a new feature actually\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 More on that later, but construction is going to feel like a whole new game if things go as planned here.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Another big thing I was able to do here, which isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very visible but should make life much easier going forward, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve merged both the VAB and SPH into one single scene. How? Well, apart from scenery, craft orientation, designated launch site and camera behavior, there isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t anything else the SPH and VAB scenes have different from each other. In fact, about 90% of the scene logic is an exact copy on both of them, so instead of having two scenes with a lot of repeated components, there is now a single Editor scene, and the game moves into it by calling a method where you specify which Facility you want to head into. The options there being SPH or VAB, of course. The implications of such a feature are very far-reaching, but at the moment all we want from it is the added simplicity of working with a single Editor scene (the scenery is loaded on top from separate scenes). Also, this should make it very simple to add a switch to the editor UI to let you simply flick between Mirror (SPH-style) or Radial (VAB-style) symmetry modes. On the same build, on the same vessel. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;To cut it short, all I can say is, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very happy with the stuff I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on.

As you may have noticed, the changes I was doing to the KSP Store website included \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CZone Pricing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, different prices and currency according to the user geographical zone. The main goal of this was to keep our KSP Store prices equal to Steam ones. Also, now you can buy Steam keys directly from our website and use them to activate the game in your Steam account. You should be aware that Steam keys purchased from the KSP Store are not refundable because once you get them, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no way for us to prove that the key has not been redeemed and is still valid for another user. Right now and for the last week, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been checking that this system is working as it should and that everyone is getting what they purchased.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been putting the finishing touches to the new Kerbal career logging system and building the new experience system.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been on that for more than 2 months, give or take. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a very interesting experience, since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m supervising the asset creation and had to establish a pipeline to work with the assets that Nick, Roger and myself are doing. I had to dig back into Unity, the different texture maps, and all that technical stuff needed to create environmental models for KSP. You can rest assured that the buildings are in good hands, and that it will meet your expectations. I could write pages and pages here with the details, technicalities, images, concept designs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s better to present all that info in a more interesting way, like a dev blog post or the sort, with everything that concerns those different buildings. .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on a new system to organize parts in the VAB/SPH part lists. Basically we are planning on introducing a bunch of new categories and subcategories for parts. Think of a category as the whole ordering system we have atm. and subcategories as the tabs currently in use: pods, propulsion, structural etc. This ordering will remain as it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own category in the new system, but we are also adding more ways to order the parts.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Max (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/312-The-Grand-0-26-Plan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/312-The-Grand-0-26-Plan\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;READ THIS\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Bob (Calisker):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on our communications plan for 0.26 and making sure we give ourselves enough time for each step of the process. We were stoked to have Nassault deliver a trailer at launch for KSP: Economic Boom, but we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t factor enough time into it and were forced to finish quite a few things last minute.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll likely be naming 0.26 as well so expect to see some question about that sooner than later.
