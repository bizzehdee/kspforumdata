It\u0027s a relatively simple environment in which people can learn how spaceflight roughly works. People have been known to spring for astrodynamics and aeronautics degrees *because* of their exposure to KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever its weakest point as a learning tool has always been \u0022how the actual rocket engines work\u0022. A rocket engine is so much more than just an engine bell, arguably a rocket can not have one and still function. And since time immortal KSP rocket engines have been \u0022an engine bell, maybe some greebling, and not much else\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my point is that by choosing consistently to opt for things like the new Mainsail\u0027s cover over where all the turbomachinery should go you\u0027re giving up an opportunity for a learning moment. Those moments that make KSP so magical in my eyes. I\u0027m not saying we go in and make people design their own engines from scratch.
