But there is a lot of crap on here from people.\n\n1. Is this really a devnote? Not really but apparently they didnt have anything much else to say. Still working, read last weeks and it would probably be close. Though I will say that some actual comments from someone would have been nice, even if it was a link to the reddit articles or something.\n\n2. Do we want a PS4 version? Mostly no it would seem but thats us. Others might. Harv wanted it on many platforms for a while but was limited. When one of those limitations was removed he went for it. (Coulda been why there was a rush to release.)\n\n3. Will this harm the PC version? Nope. Devs said it wouldnt and it apparently helped with the move to U5 so its a gain for the PC crowd.\n\n4. \u0022But the PS4 version will be made by people we dont like.\u0022 Who cares? Its the PS4 version. If they do good or bad it really doesnt matter to us so why fret?\n\n5. SQUAD isnt a charity. They are a company who likes to make money. Suck it up. They had a chance to expand the kerbal license to another platform and get other people to do the work. If someone comes with an offer like \u0022We like your product, can we sell it in our platform and get other people to do the work? We will give you a cut of the sales.\u0022 Why wouldnt they accept it?\n\nJust calm down people, sure, be annoyed that the devnotes were a single picture. No matter what it was Id be annoyed. But PC Kerbal isnt going to stop, PS4 wont effect you unless its something you want. In that case this is good news."},{"CreatedByName":"TheRag","CreatedById":144674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:24:37Z","Content":"Please add to the discussion, simple conjectures do little to add the (heated) discussion."},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:35:03Z","Content":"![XkeaBlQ.gif](http://i.imgur.com/XkeaBlQ.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t like where this is going.

If your a fan-boy beware.\n\nChrist, I\u0027m fed up with KSP and I\u0027m not the only one: I know four other friends - two of whom introduced me to the game \u0026 two I introduced to it - who were hard-core KSP addicts (I\u0027ve been at it since 18.5). But, as they started delving more into 1.02, one-by-one they all lost interest, fed up with the bugs (my spaceplanes just hit the KSC in orbit and gone kaboom!), dodgy physics (how can one strut produce more drag than 4 wings?!?!!) and the stupid part balancing issues (frying nukes, anyone?).\n\nNow I\u0027ve stopped playing, too, waiting (probably in vain) for 1.03 to fix the issues and make KSP worth playing again. \n\nSeriously, I think Squad has lost the plot: judging by some of the half-baked decisions they\u0027ve made over the last year, they can\u0027t even manage the development of the PC version properly, so how the hell are they going to manage the PS4 port as well, especially as Flying Tiger are just a bunch of pound-shop developers, by the looks of it?\n\nMoreover, as the game is built around mods, Squad can\u0027t fall back on them, in the ported,version, to plug over the gaps in KSPs functionality. \n\nIn fact, mods aside, I can\u0027t think of a game LESS suited to a games console because of its sheer complexity; (this situation reminds me of what happened to IL2 when it got ported: the ported-version became a dumbed-down, thumb-aching borefest, while the PC version became so buggy, it got blasted by the reviewers, failed to sell, and the franchise died in the process). \n\nWhat is going on with this decision? Is this a joke? Are Squad so arrogant to think the existing player-base doesn\u0027t matter anymore? I\u0027ve always felt these guy\u0027s were making it up as they went along and now it looks to me like, Squad are either in-over-their-heads and trying to sell-off the game before its development stalls completely through poor project-management - or their plan, all along, was to not to finish the game, but to bash-it-out and make a quick buck by selling the project off, half-done to one of the big-boyz to finish (or ruin).\n\nUnfortunately for them, it\u0027s taken the FOUR YEARS to get it to that state and I don\u0027t see Squad making a bundle anytime soon: it\u0027ll cost them a-plenty to get \u0022Flying-Tiger\u0022 to come up with something workable for the PS4 (which is a bit of a flop anyway) and even longer before all that investment turns into profit, so all this stuff about money being ploughed back into better development is wishful thinking, in my view.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T14:03:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**\n  \nFixed some language filter skirting."},{"CreatedByName":"Interplanet Janet","CreatedById":146268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:38:47Z","Content":"I only own the last-gen consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360, and an unused Wii).

Players have been *demanding* it since Unity started pre-announcing it! Unity 5 was always expected to make KSP better - better performance, better UI, better graphics. Also, Unity 5 is expected to fix the 64-bit problems under Windows, which has been a bugbear for a long time, especially for those with mod-heavy games.\n\nWith all those advantages, there was no way Squad were going to waste that opportunity, regardless of whether another company helped them or not.

We get the Unity 5 upgrade sooner, which means better performance, better graphics and a working 64-bit build under Windows.
