I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean hoverboards and self-tying sneakers (2015, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re counting on you), I mean.\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;the future of Kerbal Space Program.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;The next update will mark a big milestone for us at Squad, as it is the last update focused on Career Mode. After the next release,.\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Kerbal Space Program will reach an internal milestone we call \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CScope Complete\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Let me back up a little here and explain what Scope Complete means, it means KSP now has all the features we considered vital to be in the game that HarvesteR came up with so many years ago. It doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean the game has everything we want it to have, it means it has everything we considered necessary for it to be Kerbal Space Program. It means everything the game is supposed to have exists, even if only in a minimal form.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Scope completion means that every big system that the game needed is there\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, some closer to completion than others, of course, but they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all there. So, what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s next then? This is the good news: After Scope Completion, development focus shifts towards completing those unfinished features, balancing and adding some smaller stuff. No more groundwork, no more laying down infrastructure. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve finished building the kitchen, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time for us to start cooking.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;As soon as the next update is released, KSP will enter a new phase of development\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, which for want of a better term, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re calling \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Beta\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Beta development is going to be a new stage for the project, and that also means our development workflow will change, and by consequence, this will have an effect on the releases. There shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be any huge updates that we have to build for months on end and still have to release with barely more than enough content to showcase the system..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Beta means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be focusing on creating content, on using the tools we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve built..\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;It means a different approach to selecting which features go in, since we won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be constrained by the development constraints of one feature requiring another. Priorities should level out, which means the things we consider important should also match what everyone considers important. Beta essentially means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be working a lot more on stability, usability, performance, balance, aesthetics, all the while still throwing in little and some not-so-little things we hope you will enjoy..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;To make this clear to everyone, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve decided to not call the next release version 0.26, as convention would have it. Instead.\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;once the update is out, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be officially in Beta\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re calling the.\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;next release version 0.90.0\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.(zero-ninety-zero).\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a ton of things we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re constantly discussing internally regarding what exactly we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll add during Beta, but I figure we should at least tell you about the first two things we really want to add to the game before we can call it anything close to ready:\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Overhauled Aerodynamics\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.- The current system has been fantastic at\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 existing, really. It can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be beat at \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153being a system that exists and works within KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, but we can do better. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been a long time planning a major overhaul to make it more realistic, reliable, predictable, and hopefully a lot less arcane.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Deep Space Refueling\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.- We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re aware there is one big end-game mechanic missing in the game: Being able to refuel a vessel once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re out in Space. This is what we originally set out to achieve with the old Resource Mining plan and saw ourselves running into a very tedious dead-end. The Resources system was flawed because it overcomplicated accomplishing a basic need: To be able to find something out in space which can be used to fill up the tanks again. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the essence of it, and we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need 40\u002B single-purpose parts and 9 different resources to do it. In fact, all that complexity was going to be very effective at making sure most attempts to build a refueling outpost would fail. We are now planning a new, more elegant system, which hopefully will add a new, fun element of gameplay, as well as the massive boost to continuity this feature implies.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Here is also a (not so) small FAQ with some answers we imagine you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably be wanting to ask about:\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not pulling the plug on KSP, are you?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Of course not! We still have a long way to go. We just want to let everyone know we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to reach a new stage of development soon.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t consider KSP complete until Feature X is implemented!\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a question. However, if you asked everyone which features they would like to see in KSP, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d get different answers from just about everybody. We all have our wishlist of ideas and features we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to see, us devs included. The fact is, we must be very level-headed here with what we want to do, and what we can in fact achieve in the time we have. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not to say of course, we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t planning to tackle the biggests requests from our community. Just remember that all features are judged in a big-picture perspective, and how it affects the game experience for everyone, and sometimes even what would seem like fun ideas are going to fall outside the scope of the game, or just be plain too much to take on. Time and Manpower is our main limiting resource now, and that must be spent wisely, pursuing the goals that will add the most enjoyment for everyone.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: What about the features you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cpromised\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 on the Wiki\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Planned Feature List?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: That list is maintained by the community, and doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t imply any promise on our part. In fact, the best thing to do about that list is disregard it. We did implement a significant portion of it, in any case, but let me go ahead and quote the very first lines on that page:.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;This list is not an official road-map for KSP. It is maintained by the community, and has no direct relation to what may or may not be included in the final product..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Can you give us an official list of planned features for 1.0 then?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Not without a time machine. Seriously though, any lists we publish can only result in leaving people disappointed. The problem here is that no amount of disclaimers and notices will keep everyone from taking every feature on a list as a commitment from us. We don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to commit to anything we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not sure about ourselves, so if we do have to leave something out, we should be only ones to be disappointed. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not great, we know, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s for the best.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Are you going to make KSP more realistic?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: That depends. Does that added realism make KSP more fun? The key point to keep in mind here is that KSP is a game first, a simulator second. We want to add realism in places where we feel those additions will make the game more enjoyable, but we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just going to add realism features just for the sake of being realistic..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: How long until 1.0 now, then?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a very good question, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m afraid it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s kind of the same as asking \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153when is the next release coming?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. We can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t give you a release date, because chances are high we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll end up changing it afterwards. Knowing in advance will only lead to disappointment..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: And after 1.0 comes out, is that the end?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Nope. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still going to be a lot to be done even after that, but when we hit 1.0, KSP will be coming out of Early Access. Our main focus during the Beta phase will be to improve the overall playing experience of the game as much as possible. Once we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re outside the Early Access umbrella, KSP will have to stand on its own as-is, and not rely on upcoming features and perceived potential affecting players\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 opinions. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not to say we rely on that now (or have ever), but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an unavoidable side-effect of being in Early Access. People will fill in the gaps with imagined features, and no real addition can hope to live up to everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hopes and expectations. We can only try our best to have a solid game when release time comes.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: What\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s coming after 1.0 then?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting way ahead of ourselves. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wind this back to the near future.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: What about Multiplayer?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Multiplayer is something we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on for quite a while, but it still has a long way to go before it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ready. MP is planned for after 1.0. So that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still coming, but let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s take this one step at a time.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Does the term Beta really apply here?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Not in the strictest sense, but then again, there isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a term that would better describe what we are planning. Beta is the period in software development when all planned capabilities are implemented, and dev focus is centered on polish and bugfixing. Yes, we do that already in experimentals, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to be doing it in a wider scope during Beta phase. For an update\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s QA and Experimental periods, testing is focused mostly on the new features being added. Beta means taking a step back, and seeing all areas of the game under equal focus for testing and improvement. We know there are several bugs we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fixed yet. This is the time to make those fixes and assure the game is working as well as possible. The term Beta is definitely fitting here.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Does that mean we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to have access to Experimental releases?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: No. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still going to go through the same branch-testing-\u0026gt;QA-\u0026gt;Experimentals system as we have always done. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just saying we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to work on the game under a wider perspective, more focused on the overall experience than on any single feature.

We have tried shortening updates once before, and became aware of how the QA and experimental phases don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really scale in proportion to the shorter update, so the result was that we spent more time testing, and less time developing, which needless to say, wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very efficient. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to find our stride again for Beta, just as we did during Alpha.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Are updates going to be released in a regular interval?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: Most likely not. Imposing such a strict process on us would either cause features to be rushed to make a release, or some releases having very few features on them. Probably both. The plan is to play it by ear, and do a release when we feel we have something worth releasing.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still concerned this means you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to abandon KSP.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: We know, and this is why we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re doing this announcement now. We want to give everyone as much early notice as possible about what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s coming up, so nobody runs into any surprises. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not even in Beta yet actually. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still the next update to go, and after that, a period of Beta updates until 1.0, and even after that, we still have more stuff planned. So worry not, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to be at it for quite a while..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Are you going to add more whatever-it-is-you-want-added?.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: We want to add as much content as we can during Beta, but time is the main limiting factor, and development manpower is finite. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to make choices through the Beta period about what we want to add, against how much time and effort that will take, compared to adding something else instead in the same span of time. As always, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be weighing the gains of adding some piece of content versus another, and choosing the ones we feel will have the best effect in improving the game overall..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Of course, some areas are obviously short on content at the moment (Contracts and Biomes come to mind). Those are going to be highest on our lists as they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re the least developed sets of content at the moment. The logic behind reaching for Feature-Completion and 1.0 is very similar to the logic we used to reach for Scope Completion. We focus on the area of least development. The good news now is that the area of least development is always going to be something we already have in the game, and the lack of content there is likely noticed by everyone already.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Q: Are you going to integrate \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMod X\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 into the game? (a.k.a. Q:How can I get my mod integrated into stock?)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;A: This depends on several factors. First of all, we have to ask ourselves: Is this mod doing something we wanted to do ourselves already? Some mods, awesome though they are, aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t part of what we have planned for KSP, and that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fine. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why we support modding in the first place, but it also means a mod isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to be auto-added just because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cool..\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Second of all, if we do find a mod that does exactly what we wanted to do ourselves, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done well, follows the style of the game, all that stuff, then we get in touch with the author, and we get the conversation rolling from there. There isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a system for adding a mod into the game. That said, we very well might find mods that do stuff we wanted to do, and we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to reinvent the wheel if we can avoid it.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;A: Being in version 0.25 now, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t you have 75 updates left to do before 1.0?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Q: Eek, no! Thankfully, version numbers don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work that way. The minor version (as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 in v0.n.0 is called), isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a decimal fraction of the major version. There isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a pre-established convention in the software industry on how to increment version numbers, so each studio tends to do it in their own way. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been relatively consistent with our versioning scheme, adding 1 to the minor version on each new update, and a 1 to the revision number when we release hotfixes and small patches. So the answer here is, there won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be 75 updates between 0.25 and 1.0 in the same way we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to release 10 revisions to go from 0.24.0 to 0.25.0.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;A: How is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153release 26\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 going to be identified as Beta then?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Q: We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to call our first Beta version KSP v0.90.0 (zero-ninety-zero, or oh-ninety-oh if you live across the pond), to make it clear to everyone that KSP is nearing a state of completion. Of course, that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean we plan to do exactly 10 Beta patches to reach 1.0. It could be more, it could be less, we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell. If we run past 0.99. the next version could be 0.100.0, or we could change the system a bit, and increment the revision numbers instead, depending on how much we feel a release has added. In a way, Beta updates really are more like revision patches actually. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep announcing new releases as we have always done in any case, so just hang around the community and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll never miss a release.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart for supporting our crazy project all the way from the earliest alphas builds up to Scope Completion, and we hope you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll stick with us from here through Beta and up to the long-awaited 1.0\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Many Cheers,\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;The KSP Development Team, and everyone at Squad.\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T21:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/313-Beta-Than-Ever-The-Future-of-KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
