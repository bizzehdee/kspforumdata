And if stating facts is disrespecting people then perhaps its the people creating the facts that are disrespecting us! Remember us? The loyal KSP user? The people that bought your product,and spread the word about its greatness all over the world? The people that helped mod the game and make it even more fun and helped it become the number one game?
