I guess I always think of it as silly from an \u0022immersive\u0022 perspective to take a small rover to a biome, do all of your experiments, then leave and have all of the science that there is to have from said biome and never have to return again. Personally, I like have a little reward, tiny though it may be, for coming back. Maybe my first surface sample from the Mun\u0027s East Farside Crater had some small traces of some different material, and now Wernher Von Kerman wants more of that material for further study. I absolutely don\u0027t think it should be insanely grind-y (which is why I like that most of the available science can be retrieved the first time, as opposed to say only getting a quarter each time or something). I think the way it is now, if you just want to visit a biome, grab science, and go, the amount of leftover science shouldn\u0027t be so much that it will really hurt your program not to have it.
