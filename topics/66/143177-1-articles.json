They\u2019re de-LINQing and\nremoving unnecessary loops at a staggering pace. As a result we\u2019ve limited the\ndevnotes to a few small highlights, and everyone\u2019s goodbye message to our technical\nproducer Ted, who left the team earlier this week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChris (Porkjet) spent his week focused\non improving the Interior lighting of the Editor scenes. It\u2019s much softer now\nand more consistent throughout the various space center tiers. While working on\nthe lighting, he also made tweaks to the textures of the building interiors and\nexteriors. The brightness and colors are now more balanced and consistent and\nthe early tiers got a slightly different color scheme which makes it easier to\ntell them apart.
