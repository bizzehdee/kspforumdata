Maybe this will even open the door to telling the player what science they still have to get from a biome ( that was also in the package of stuff that would break \u0022 the joy of discovery\u0022 , like if grinding blindly was the universal definition of joy, especially for newbies :/ ) will be displayed on the science archives instead of just the stuff you discovered so far ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T14:37:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r\\_rolo1**"},{"CreatedByName":"forenci","CreatedById":63070,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T14:53:42Z","Content":"Nice everything sounds good!

The expanded bubble will only be able to handle edge cases where you drop things fairly close to the ground and at low enough speeds, aka right after launch or from planes (the dropping things from planes will be IMMENSELY helpful). I\u0027ll probably add in some code to automatically deploy Stock parachutes on vessels that aren\u0027t the active one when they get within range of the ground to help reduce the amount of \u0022My boosters exploded when they hit the ground without deployed parachutes!\u0022 reports, which are going to likely increase. If you have to deploy the chutes when you decouple, there\u0027s a good chance the boosters will never even get close to the ground before leaving the bubble, and there\u0027s a noticeable increase in the chance of them smacking into each other/the main rocket. RealChutes are smart enough that I probably won\u0027t add in any code for them.\n\nI really hope the values are adjustable for each situation. I\u0027d honestly like to reduce/keep the same bubble size in space and on the ground. With FMRS and StageRecovery I might even reduce it in atmosphere. But when playing with kOS I\u0027d like to be able to make it pretty large in case I want to do things with multiple craft. The biggest benefit will be dropping things from planes though."},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T15:10:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m looking forward to the balance changes to career mode.

Which is really rather unfortunate.\n\nRight now, water is a placeholder. It\u0027s a bit laggy, it\u0027s pretty dang ugly, and it\u0027s far deadlier than land... I really, really hope that SQUAD doesn\u0027t try to ship a \u0022finished\u0022 game with water in its current state.\n\nThere are some other placeholders, too:\n\n- Many parts\u0027 descriptions (especially the new wing bits) are a measly one sentence long, and contain very little information about the part. These should be expanded: it\u0027s easy to do so, and it would help new players and add a little more polish.\n- The beautiful, cloudy sky that you can see when in the VAB and SPH is a pretty obvious mismatch with the \u0027real\u0027 cloudless sky on Kerbin. I would love SQUAD to either add clouds to Kerbin or remove them from the background of the VAB/SPH. (The latter would be easier, but the former would be very nice.)\n- Also, it\u0027s always daytime in the VAB and SPH! I know it may be a little more difficult to realistically simulate lighting throughout the day and into the night, but it would add a nice touch.\n\nJust little things like this (I could go on, but I don\u0027t have time to). I haven\u0027t heard anything about these little things yet, and you guys could probably do each of these in a day or less, with the possible exception of the water one. It would really add to the gameplay experience, show that y\u0027all pay attention to detail, and make it clear that all placeholders in this game are gone. Just throwing this out there...\n\n...oh, and because the above may have sounded a little critical and because I\u0027m *trying* to be nicer, I would just like to say that the additions made this week sound great.
