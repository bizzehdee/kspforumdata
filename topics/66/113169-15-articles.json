A different, perhaps less satisfactory (arguably) aero module is less damaging than a game that crashes too often.\n\n3) Some sort of internal recognition within squad that announcing a PS4 port, without any real context as why I should care, would be met with a giant MEH from a forum/reddit board/etc. of PC users. It doesn\u0027t need to be a 1 page hour long post either. It could be a bulletized list. The way that this was handled shows a shocking lack of community awareness. It is not like this occurred in a vacuum. We had a number of teaser posts over a number of weeks that something REALLY BIG and REALLY COOL was about to be announced. yes it big \u0026 cool for you! Gratz! Seriously, Gratz. But its not big and cool for us. I don\u0027t know how this basic communication dysfunction happened, but I think Squad should realize that they made this happen by the way they generated per-announcement hype.\n\nFair?\n\n--- another edit ---\n\n\u0022Yeah that\u0027s why it\u0027s getting fixed, but until the update you can turn off that plugin, a 3rd party plugin which has a bug in it.\n\nOr you can leave it on and let your PC crash. \u0022\n\nYes, and you realize that something like 80% of PC users dont use mods, right? As it happens, I do use mods, I know of the fix, and I would point out that the fix has its own disadvantages (like I can\u0027t monitor heat!), and while you may think that an acceptable response by a company is to say \u0027meh, go use a mod\u0027 (Which i will admit they did NOT do, YOU are putting those words in their mouths) I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s a proper response.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T01:57:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Seyvern**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:54:56Z","Content":"another thing about this PS4 announcment is the timing. its been weeks and we are still waiting on the next hotfix for the critical memory leak that requires end arounds to deal with.\n\nIf 1.0.3 was already out, I think the reception would have been much MUCH warmer."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:58:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Fair?\n\nNope not in the slightest, check the past devnotes for info on the coming patch, PS4 support (and Xbox) has been asked for by this community and others for quite some time.\n\nEdit:\n\nNever hurts to repost these.\n\n[**PS4 and you!**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/344-Kerbal-Space-Program-is-coming-to-PlayStation-4-What-does-that-mean-for-you)\n\n[**KSP and Unity5.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/345-KSP-and-Unity-5)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T02:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Seyvern","CreatedById":1875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T02:00:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope not in the slightest, check the past devnotes for info on the coming patch, PS4 support (and Xbox) has been asked for by this community and others for quite some time.\n\nKeep on spinning, then.
