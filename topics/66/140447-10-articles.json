science labs suddenly flying off into space at warp 6 - that game is not feature complete. \u00A0It\u0027s a work in progress. \u00A0With every devnote, and every update, I hope against hope that THIS will the THE ONE that gets the game to its full potential, but in a year\u002B of playing KSP, I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever really considered the game stable. \u00A0I\u0027m in the habit of saving frequently now, not because I\u0027m worried about screwing the pooch and doing something wrong, but because I know at any moment the game could freeze, CTD, or do some other unexpected thing. \u00A0Just today, playing with Roverdude\u0027s awesome mods, I was trying to launch some greenhouses up to an orbiting station. \u00A0It took a dozen tries. \u00A0I have a standard lifter that will give me 15,000 DV up to 5t of payload, so I should have no problem hitting my station with it. \u00A0But it took so many tries because of crashes, random launchpad explosions, my rocket performing unscheduled disassembly in flight a few times for no discernible reason, my payload just vanishing (yeah, here one minute, gone the next). \u00A0Not one was a launch failure due\u00A0to gameplay, it was all due to game failures. \u00A0That\u0027s not complete, and that\u0027s frustrating. \u00A0I don\u0027t collect logs and I don\u0027t do crash reports because what\u0027s the point? \u00A0I just restart and cross my fingers that it\u0027ll work this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, Devs, in the unlikely chance that you\u0027re actually reading this, you\u0027re doing good work. \u00A0Keep doing good work. \u00A0And then do more good work. \u00A0Get this game to where it so deserves to be. \u00A0We\u0027re all counting on you. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-27T04:10:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2016 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JJE64\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eshameful typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T05:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222599861\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140447\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464138385\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145248\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JJE64\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/25/2016 at 8:06 PM, JJE64 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not really locking in the design then. \u00A0LOL. \u00A0I swear KSP is the textbook outcome of feature creep. \u00A0If KSP were a house, it would have 7 floors, only the first 3 would have windows, the front door would require a locksmith to open, and the top 4 floors would be in a perpetual state of construction, but yet never any nearer to completion. \u00A0And it wouldn\u0027t take long until plans would be announced for an 8th floor! \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I applaud the fantastic job the devs have done getting us here, and for a labor of love, KSP is an incredible product. \u00A0But the production seems very unfocused at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nreminds me of this *cough* EA *cough* company \u0022electronic farts\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeeGeenie","CreatedById":161175,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T06:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheeze and Crackers, what has this thread become?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was expecting more people welcoming the team back.

As NathanKell said in the latest squadcast, most games just don\u0027t compare to KSP. Sure, their art assets are amazing (amusing point: because I can read and understand Japanese, I probably get a lot more out of TR2013 than most players), but their game mechanics are... spartan (for want of a less derogatory term). KSP is incredibly complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many other games scale from sub-centimeter to super-gigameter? Have no restrictions other than those imposed by Newton, Kepler, etc? Actually implement those restrictions to a high degree of accuracy? (note: sure, patch conics aren\u0027t how things really work, but they were good enough for the Apollo and Voyager missions!). KSP lets you build and pilot rockets, planes, boats, \u0022cars\u0022, submarines, trains (hi, Overlander!). Rendezvous vessels in orbit and build space stations (or monstrous rockets to do a Jool-5). In other words, KSP gives you freedom of which most games can\u0027t even conceive, let alone dream. And then you can add mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNathanKell mentioned that KSP\u0027s complexity is both its strength and its weakness. I say he hit the nail on the head, Karate Kid II style. It is KSP\u0027s complexity that gives it the above freedom and is why I make the claim that KSP is not a game (nor is it a simulator). I do not know what KSP is, but for those who want to insist that KSP is a game, I say this: KSP is not a game, KSP is a new game every day (to borrow from Lego\u0027s \u0022Lego is a new toy every day\u0022). However, KSP\u0027s complexity comes at a hefty cost: it pushes the underlying engine (Unity) beyond its limits (eg, Unity\u0027s wheels were designed for racing games where gravity is 1g and down is down), and it pushes us devs to our limits (NathanKell\u0027s quip about a 60h day not being inconceivable is too close to the truth for comfort: I\u0027ve come close to doing it (once, many many moons ago)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that got a bit long. The tl;dr is this: calm down and hold your horses. Yes 1.1.2 has some pretty serious issues, but when you consider what KSP is, they are mere blips. We will do our best to fix as much as we can in a reasonable time frame without adding new features (and a new engine version counts as a new feature), but sadly this means that some issues will have to remain unfixed (though we may find bandaids) until we can update the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, keep this in mind: most of us devs either were KSP players, or still are.
