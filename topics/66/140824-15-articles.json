When I first opened the game in 2012, I thought all it had to offer were a couple of fuel tanks, a couple of engines, and a pod. Now, after opening it again years later,\u00A0I see this has gone a long (\u003Cem\u003ELONG\u003C/em\u003E) way. Multiple projects (kerbalstuff, lazor system, etc) have risen to huge levels and fell with time. Mods appeared to make this game more advanced.
