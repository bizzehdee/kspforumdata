I played that game a lot back then -- if the tilt was just right, it would hold the weight of my arm without my doing it; when the car slowed down, I had to increase the tilt, but that only worked to a point: suddenly all lift would be gone. I don\u0027t think I already had heard about \u0022stall\u0022 back then, but that seems to be just what happened.
