So it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fair to say that at least part of this new GUI will come in the form of an app. We are also looking at ways to improve the whole CoM/CoL trick to gauge the stability of airplanes.

I\u2019ve been deep in the part balancing component of the overall balancing \u2018feature\u2019. For the vast number of the changes I\u2019m making, they\u2019re more tentative ones to get all of the parts onto the same page, with further balancing needing to be done once other, more low-level, gameplay changes are made. Additionally, a number of people from the community have been messaging me about balance suggestions and this is greatly appreciated! Obviously the changes made aren\u2019t going to satisfy one single idea of balance that members of the community, or myself, may have, but instead should use as many sources as possible to compile a well-rounded idea of what balance should be. While we have our own ideas for that as a team, community sources are always valued as alternate views are very useful when it comes to changes like this. So! If you have any threads or little write-ups about the balance of a component of the game, feel free to send them over to me via Forum PM or reddit PM and I\u2019ll gladly give them a look over to consider in this.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Anthony (Rowsdower):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Tuesday is here again and I\u2019ve been going back and forth between the think tank and some very dark corners of YouTube.
