The UI work is coming along nicely, although it has admittedly proven to be far more involved than anyone could have expected. The game is running relatively nice and stable in Unity 5 now, which is a definite improvement compared to how it was a month or so ago, when we gauged progress by how far we could get without seeing some major crash.\n\u003E \n\u003E On my end, the assembly framework is for the most part set up, although the build pipeline is still pending. That will probably stay like that until we need to run builds again, which hopefully shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be so far off now.\n\u003E \n\u003E All in all, not the most exciting week, but definitely beats being under crunch time like we were a couple months back. \n\n**Mike (Mu)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Mike was not available for the devnotes this week*.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart)** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a very diverse week, for one part I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been dealing with the licensing part of working with the PS4 SDK in Unity, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been working with Ted and our new hosting guys to move to our final server and get the patcher working again.\n\u003E \n\u003E On a side note, the major office remo is done and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all back to our desks, which is definitely great, the provisional table we had was too low for me and my back was screaming bad things at me.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the same assets for the past couple of days. Everything is going well. Experimenting with some shaders. Got a little help from Marco to keep up with that. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve moved to our new space here at the offices. Everything looks new now! Next thing is to fill it with Kerbals, screaming Kerbals to be more precise. Some rockets here and there. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m doing some renders to fill that up.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This week i have been working on integrating the KnowledgeBase into ApplicationLauncher. As it turns out it became 6 apps instead of 5 as i wrote last time and 4 of the 6 are ready as i write this. In order to make this happen i rewrote knowledgebase and made it into a mini-applauncher because kb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s apps are externally controlled in the way they are not only scene dependant but target dependent as well.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Office renovations have been completed! New place still needs decoration and as such it may look a little bit bland and sterile, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure we can throw in a bunch of Kerbal appeal to it. Working with Andrea and Kasper has been absolutely fantastic, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s great having them be part of our community team. \n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Ted is currently on vacation, getting his yearly dose of sun and .blistering his feet with hiking.*\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a lot to report on from my end this week. Mostly I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been helping Andrea get started and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve helped some streamers and YouTubers getting KSP to run correctly when they encountered some problems after upgrading to Windows 10, mostly related to drivers.\n\u003E \n\u003E Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget that KPE 3 starts next week. During this live event Harvey from HOCgaming and many other YouTube and Twitch personalities will attempt to raise money for Charity: Water whilst driving a rover from Duna\u2019s south pole to its north pole. The event has raised over $30,000 in the past two editions, bringing safe, fresh water supplies to people who do not have access to even this most basic of commodities.

I\u2019ve been learning and meeting people thanks to Kasper, he has been so patient. Working with everyone here has been amazing.\n\u003E \n\u003E This week I\u2019ll try to learn more and play KSP a little better, I felt so sad cause i\u2019m really bad at it, but I watched Scott Manley\u2019s tutorials and I hope they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll help me."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:19:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Andrea (Badie)**\n\u003E This was my first week as Community Manager for KSP.
