Thanks Max!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndrea and Kasper (KasperVld) have been working on the number-crunching side of our Facebook and Twitter accounts to determine which content resonates the most with you, so we can share the most interesting things the community does. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also busy organizing a contest that should go live this week, and are preparing to take in applications for smaller channels to join the Media Group next week. For those of you who aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t aware, the Media Group consists of YouTubers and livestreamers who collaborate and also get early access to new versions of Kerbal Space Program to showcase the new features of an update. The Media Group consists of both small and large media channels, but are united in the high quality content they put out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the development side things have been progressing a bit more slowly than we anticipated, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re optimistic we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be moving the Unity 5 update to QA testing very soon. Felipe (HarvesteR) ended up having to rewrite the backend code for the orbit icons because it turned out to be largely incompatible with Unity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new user interface system. If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re wondering what the orbit icons are, think of the apoapsis and periapsis icons, as well as the ascending and descending nodes. Of course, rewriting the code provides an excellent opportunity to improve upon these sometimes hard-to-use interface elements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new implementation should be far more robust and flexible, and should make the map icons much more responsive in the UI too.

Each icon now has full control over the input events they receive. They are also all tied to a MapObject, which is a representation of a point in the map view. That means every icon can potentially be a camera target. Not all of them will be camera-focusable, but this should be a good addition to improve usability in the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwile Jim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (Romfarer) work on the staging interface is progressing steadily. The Staging interface is a core part of the game, and is used in many different scenes such as the Flight scene and the Editor scenes, not to mention many mods. The code behind it then is also some of the oldest found in the game, and indeed the staging list can be found in some the oldest versions of the game. The interface used an OnGUI() method, which makes transition from the old system to Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new event driven interface system a bit trickier than many parts of the interface that were updated previously. The system is being completely redesigned, rather than just rewritten.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we mentioned earlier we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still gunning for QA testing of the main development branches soon, and no person is more involved with that part of development than Ted. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been chasing us around, making sure any and all internal requirements for the update are swiftly being met. Part of that work was finalizing an upgrade to the web servers that host the website, forums, wiki, bug tracker and other systems. Staff changes over the past few months have delayed this task, but now that the paperwork is being finalized we should see a lot more reliability on the servers, including better peak-load handling capabilities. Once the upgrades take effect various glitches on the bug tracker and wiki should be remedied, including issues with uploading images and embedding mathematical formulas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the QA team is focusing on their first task for update 1.1: testing a series of thermal fixes Nathanael (NathanKell) has been working on. Most areas of the thermal code ran solidly, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen many bug reports of specific configurations that would cause issues. Ultimately we decided that the conduction code needed to be rewritten to account for these cases as there were two core issues here, both causing large amounts of energy to be transferred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first core issue revolves around the constraints on the amount of heat that could be conducted in multi-part configurations. Individual part-part conduction are constrained so that a source part can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t transfer so much energy from itself that the receiving part would become hotter than it. This system worked perfectly in situations where parts are connected to each other serially, but unfortunately a bunch of hot parts attached to a cold part would each transfer a lot of energy, causing the receiving part to potentially overheat very quickly. To overcome this problem the new system analyzes groups of parts as a whole and uses the resting temperature of the entire \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153cluster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to work out the heat transfers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second core issue boils down to the fact that the heating system didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a particular order in which it would conduct heat between parts, causing previous constraints to be undone when a hot part was being processed after a cold part. The heating system now processes all parts in order of hottest to coldest to overcome this. These two changes seem to have made the thermal spikes a thing of the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat convection has received some attention as well, or rather the input data of the system have. The game will now support convective shock temperature multipliers for different celestial bodies to simulate different types of atmospheres such as the low-shock-temperature hydrogen atmosphere of a gas giant, and the upper atmospheres of the atmospheric planets have been revised to have a more exponential falloff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the analytic thermodynamic code has been improved to give it a more gradual transition between temperatures, which can be configured globally and on a per-part basis. All this is a fancy way of saying that the game will support (for example) refrigerated interiors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarco (Samssonart) has been busy getting used to living in the Netherlands and has been getting started with his studies. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s already sharing knowledge gained from his optimization and vectorization course with the team. This course deals with high- and low level optimization and parallelization of code. Although the Unity engine takes care of the code at the low level, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s certainly possibilities to further optimize the high level code in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it for this week, be sure to post any questions you have below!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T20:16:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T20:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA contest?
