Early feedback sounds very good so far, and based on my own subjective experience, flying does feel a lot better now. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re far from done though, as with the new changes, new possibilities arise and must be accounted for. Cargo bays haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t had much of a use until now, but with the new aero system, they will shield whatever is inside them from the airstream. This means more than reduced drag and reentry heat though. Wing surfaces placed inside (closed) bays won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t function, neither will parachutes, RCS blocks, solar panels, air intakes or science experiments which must be performed in an atmosphere. To get those to work again, you will have to open the bays first. These parts which were mostly just for show so far should now become a much more important (and useful) consideration when building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlex (aLeXmOrA):\u003C/strong\u003E Still working on the KerbalEdu License system tweaks I have to do.

Also, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m helping with other Squad projects (web development side). .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike (Mu):\u003C/strong\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a week of fixing bugs and expanding the drag system. Some great responses/feedback from the QA team about it all. The design for re-entry and mach effects is coming along nicely too but my main focus has been performance and stability of the drag systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarco (Samssonart):\u003C/strong\u003E The KSP new demo is starting to take shape, now basically all of the sandbox restrictions are set, as for the restrictions that affect all play modes the only one I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m missing is having limited concurrent flights. The next step, which is arguably the most time consuming will be to create the new career mode demo, this is harder than sandbox because the current demo already has a sandbox implementation, but career will have to be done from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel (danRosas):\u003C/strong\u003E Been working on the final touches of the upgraded rig for the animations. Shoulders are moving a bit funky, but nothing grave. Should be fixed with a couple of constraints. Imported into the game two new buildings for revision, in order to bounce back comments to Nick. Same thing with the female version of the Kerbals, needs to be approved inside the engine, to move forward with the implementation. On the other hand, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re considering making some adjustments to the production schedule for the buildings, in order to give them more priority for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJim (Romfarer):\u003C/strong\u003E This week i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve finally gotten around to adding more of the planned design concern tests to the Engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Report.

If not, I don\u0027t see what the point of having IVA/EVA suits that you can see up-close that look worse in the actual game than they do on tiny little pictures in the astronaut complex. Now, I\u0027m not suggesting implementing the 1000\u002B polycount model for the cinematics into the game, But having a better model in the cinematics than the game is inconsistent and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Why make the suits for two-or-three minute long cinematics better than the thousands of hours seen on a Kerbal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--It is possible, i suppose, that the re-rigging of the Kerbal\u0027s skeleton is evidence for an in-game remodel, but this is not obvious if true at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Still excited to see female Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022A (female) friend of mine, speaking sarcastically\u0022 data-cite=\u0022A (female) friend of mine, speaking sarcastically\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill they be forced to stay in their kerbal homes ti take care of the kerbal children?\u003Cp\u003EOr when using them, will the risk of a crash elevate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I don\u0027t suppose the implementation of female Kerbals might add a bit of modding support to the Kerbals as parts/vessels? Perhaps changing the model or something? Would be wonderful for RealSolarSystem if a human astronaut could be substituted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The new demo ought to include the Aeris 3a, but no spaceplane hangar or other plane parts. Just allow you to fly a plane, no more, to make the full game even more want!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I think the demo should either not include docking ports or not include more than a few flights, but not both. And I think the demo should definitely have docking ports. (So you can dock two ships together to make room for another!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The demo should have some structural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I might be a bit hopeful for having a demo with such freedom, but arguably there\u0027s more freedom in the equally free 0.13.3 demo. You can even mod the 0.13.3 demo. (Though I don\u0027t think the demo should be moddable or anything!) I feel that up to a certain point, the more features in a demo, the more people will want the full game, especially if those features themselves are limited. It\u0027s like giving you several potato chips instead of a single chocolate. The potato chip is less filling on it\u0027s own, but it makes you want more. Potato chip metaphors ftw!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If the Kerbal models are updated, even if it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E just in the cinematics, the Shapeways Kerbals might should be updated as well.
