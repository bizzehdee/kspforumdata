We are proud of Daniel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s work, he did the Xbox One animation trailer, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the fastest animation he have made, with only one week to prep it. .On top of all that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen the year\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s largest community-organised event (KPE 3) raise over $17,000 for charity: water. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re proud of our community for many reasons, and this event proved that is rightly so.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C Co-hosting KPE 3 on Friday (with Ted), Saturday and Sunday was definitely a highlight in my week. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, -Kasper (KasperVld)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the development side, this week has been spent filling in holes, fixing bugs, and revising the new UI systems. Felipe has been focussing on the staging interface and the orbit splines. For the latter we use an external tool called Vectrosity, which handles drawing lines on screen. It seems that just like Kerbal Space Program, Vectrosity was overhauled for the new Unity UI system, which means that a lot has changed with it now, which in turn means that our orbits are all messed up and need fixing. This is a good opportunity to rewrite the code that draws the orbit, as it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s never been one of the most efficient parts of the game.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re really happy about the decision to push the Unity 5 upgrade to it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own distinct patch. Mike and Felipe especially put a lot of time and work to get KSP running on Unity 5, and we feel it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be great to be able to run and profile the two games back-to-back both and get a good measure of the performance tweaks. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C We are so very close to having a QA worthy build of the new patch.

The short answer is, we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sure how it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll work exactly. The insides of PhysX are hardcoded deep under Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hood, which means we have very little access to it from our end. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C Our own code hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t changed to support multithreaded physics simulation, so how exactly it will handle KSP objects like multi-rigidbody vessels, is not something we can see in detail.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 -Felipe (HarvesteR)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There also seems to be some confusion about the difference between the terms multi-threading and multi-core. When we talk about cores, we are generally talking about hardware. Software, however, deals with threads. Threads and Cores are related, but they are different concepts altogether. Threads are virtual, abstract entities used by software to split their workload for separate. Cores are the hardware used to actually process multiple threads at the same time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What this means for KSP is that there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no way to know which CPU cores will get used for any given vessel, part, or anything along those lines, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also not sure how simulation is split into separate threads. The way PhysX handles its multithreaded execution is internal to PhysX, and we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really get to see behind those curtains\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a bad thing though. We get to focus on making the game on top of the physics engine, and PhysX handles the low-level simulation/computation stuff.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T18:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
