They should have realized this was only an \u0022in-cred-i-ble\u0022 announcement from Squad\u0027s perspective, not from ours. They got me all fired up over nothing, as this really doesn\u0027t benefit current KSP customers a bit.\n\nIt\u0027ll be interesting to see how they handle the UI through a game controller, but mostly I\u0027m worried about the mods. Personally, I don\u0027t consider KSP a viable product without mods. While there may be ways to use parts mods, plugins certainly aren\u0027t going to be directly compatible between PC and PS4."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:39:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh and regex, multiple platforms was a long term goal...\n\nAnd had there been a publicly available long-term roadmap (instead of obscure forum posts) no one would have been surprised by this announcement."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:47:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And had there been a publicly available long-term roadmap (instead of obscure forum posts) no one would have been surprised by this announcement.\n\nAre there closed-source companies that \u0027do it right?\u0027 I think you want to see a document that is linked to a change log, with full disclosure of all business reasons that prompted this or that feature to move up the list, down the list, or off it entirely."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:54:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Red herring. It has nothing to do with his point.\n\nCorrect, it\u0027s a a completely different point and one I think bears talking about. \n\nListen, PS4 players (likely) won\u0027t be able to access the huge library of mods. If they are, to my knowledge, it\u0027ll be the first time a console game will allow itself to be legally modded. All those things so many players take for granted now - Kerbal Alarm Clock auto-slowing warp near a node, EnhancedNavball scaling the navball up (something useful if you\u0027re playing from the couch), EVE and Scatterer producing amazing visual effects and even just clouds, DefaultThrottle making the default throttle less stupid, FAR, CSS (both the Shuttle and Science mods), a different skybox, DistantObjectEnhancement.. even Claws bugfixes directed towards a released game (why are these even needed? They should be unnecessary. Instead FTE will be porting a broken game) - will be entirely inaccessible to this new market. So we then have to rely on Squad themselves to release updates that fix more bugs than they introduce and we all know how well they do that ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) Rolling out an update to console will take ages as Sony will have to review it. If we have the same situation as in 1.0./0/1/2, where releases were a few days apart, that could be disastrous for console players as they\u0027ll have no choice but to play a broken release until it\u0027s fixed. So they\u0027ll more than likely be behind PC versions by a few weeks or months - something I don\u0027t think will go down too well. So again, Squad will really have to improve their releases to not include memory leaks, broken code, incorrect cfg values, unbalanced parts etc etc.. can they do it? I\u0027m not confident."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:54:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are there closed-source companies that \u0027do it right?\u0027 I think you want to see a document that is linked to a change log, with full disclosure of all business reasons that prompted this or that feature to move up the list, down the list, or off it entirely.\n\nNice, many would be hard-pressed to top that level of exaggeration, you\u0027re on your way to top-poaster status.\nNo, I want to see a feature roadmap and evidence of actually long-term planning, something [like this](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html) would be fantastic but I don\u0027t actually expect that of Squad.

This could be something they learn from though, because obviously some of the fans got \u0027a little\u0027 concerned.\n\nAnd although not all responses were thought out very well, they were based on the (initial) feelings of the writers. They show us that 1, the community likes this game very much and would not like to see it get hurt. And 2, the community very much appreciates the few lines of text the team writes each week (and that they are probably nagged about and have to squeeze in between all that hard work). So please keep these coming!\n\nAnyways, congratulations on this deal.

So much entitled whining. Even a former dev throwing a tantrum.\n\nThis isn\u0027t at the heart of the issue. Nobody\u0027s throwing a fit at squad, though sarcasm about flying tiger and their past exploits abounds.\n\nConsider this example, J.R.R. Tolkien writes a book, to make money, and some random translates that book into French (so that both the translator and Tolkien can make money). Now, in order to be written in good french some things will not appear in translation. This is 100% fine, I read books in my other languages and I read books in translation, and they are *overall* just as good as the original.\n\nBut if Tolkien has to re-word and re-write his book so that the English and French match perfectly then the artistic vision of the book has been fairly seriously compromised.\n\nThis I think is everyone\u0027s concern, and it should be the concern of future PS4 players too. Squad has assured us that this will not happen, and I think they have the sense not to sanitize the PC version to make a PS4 and PC game.\n\nIn short, I\u0027m all for making money and I want squad to have plenty because they deserve it, just like Tolkien deserved/deserves it. My giving said money however, is conditional on receipt of Tolkien\u0027s books, and Harvester\u0027s KSP.

Especially if the process is mostly hands off, and [other studios](http://www.ftmobile.com/images/products/screens/Hookups-Wallpaper/Hookups-2.jpg) work on the brunt of the port. \n\nSurely developing in an Xbox environment *first* is going to help a *PC* game develop faster. The Xbox One is going to be given DirectX12 alongside its rollout with Windows 10 - and with the tighter PC\\Console integration Win10 is pushing - cross platform play will apparently be easier to develop for. [Unity has already adopted DX12](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/01/22/staying-ahead-with-directx-12/) and Microsoft touts it unlocks [better use of the GPU](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/directx-12-a-game-changer-for-xbox-one-and-pc/1100-6427422/)with its new [multithreading tech](http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1544/15443861/2867957-api\u002Bcomparison\u002Bv2.png), something KSP currently under-utilizes. \n\nXbox or not, the majority of KSP users are suddenly (if they choose to upgrade to Win10 for free) going to have far more capable systems soon with DX12, and Squad are surely going to be working to optimize the game to use it. Why backtrack and port to the competitors environment? Most of KSP\u0027s userbase run Windows. Sure, the PS4 has double the marketshare - but there are still 10 million Xbox One owners around the world. \n\nIf the goal is to reach new markets, so be it. But 10 million consoles that run API\u0027s that the current version of KSP is going to be using (and they\u0027d be silly not to) is terribly low hanging fruit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T18:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daishi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:41:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As I have not been around for the whole 4 year journey so far, I definately have less scars than some folks when it comes to coloring my view of Squad.
