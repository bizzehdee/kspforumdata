Often times there\u2019s a big gap between the two, but ultimately only the latter type is relevant to a released product. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe testing process also brings welcome breaks away from pure user interface work for the developers. Felipe (HarvesteR) for example has been hard at work making sure the mesh colliders are compatible with Unity 5\u2019s new way of handling them. Because the colliders attached to rigidbodies couldn\u2019t be concave anymore the fairings needed some tweaking to get them to behave as expected again. This job went quite smoothly: because the fairings are assembled procedurally from user input it was a relatively simple job to change the underlying systems. Instead of a single concave mesh collider the fairings now create a series of small, convex \u2018chunks\u2019 that work together as a compound collider for each fairing panel. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile working on the fairings, Felipe also managed to code in a much requested feature: when the fairings are closed they now create an invisible physical joint (like a strut) that secures the payload inside to prevent the payload wobbling. Of course, once you deploy the fairing this structural support also vanishes and we\u2019re already looking forward to all the rockets that fail as a result of this oversight. In case of interstage fairings, the joint is created against the interstage \u2018cap\u2019 part. That means fairings also get a new use as a stack-reinforcement strut of sorts. Which will eventually break off. And adds weight, and cost. But it does make stacks really solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn to bugfixing then: while we\u2019ve tasked Felipe to take a look at map view splines and orbit context menus Mike (Mu) is still hard at work on the user interface, fixing miscellaneous bugs throughout the game in general and in the new settings screen in particular. Jim (Romfarer) notes one particularly critical bug with the Application Launcher that was fixed due to an excellent performance by the QA team who provided us with high quality bug reports with solid reproduction steps, which helped us to connect the dots on a list of bugs that at first seemed unrelated, but ultimately proved to have a common cause.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since joining the team Nathanael (NathanKell) has been hard at work squashing bugs at a leopard\u2019s pace and this week is no exception. His time has been spent between some bugs that popped up due to Unity 5\u2019s new physics system and working on the tutorials. In fact, the latter has to do with the former as a lot of the physics systems in KSP have changed in recent times and the tutorials sometimes needed to be updated to reflect that. If you have some small tips to improve the tutorials please leave a comment on our forums.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Technical Producer Ted has dug himself into the QA trenches. He\u2019s enjoying himself though: seeing the project come together is very satisfying from a project management point of view, and the progress the developers are making are very easily kept track of. We\u2019ll be sure to take good care of him over the next weeks though, as the constant managing of new (sometimes critical) issues while still battling the old ones can be quite stressful. With everyone focused on a common goal we should be able to contain the flood of issues that has come our way this week, some of which even kept the QA team from being able to test the game in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s not all bugfixes around the office though: Chris (Porkjet) has been polishing the landing gear effects and animations. A new six-wheeled model is making an appearance in the game and it\u2019ll be replacing the largest landing gear, while the other models have also been swapped with the next biggest models \u2013 and rescaled to match their size. The result is a selection of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mW4wjuP.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003Efour different sizes of landing gear\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, while your favorite craft files will not be affected between 1.0.5 and 1.1. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the landing gear Chris, with help from Nathanael and the experimental test team, has started working on a concept for overhauling the rocket parts in a similar fashion as the plane parts. This is more of a long-term plan, which will most likely start showing up in version 1.2, but regardless it\u2019s good to get the planning phase started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob (RoverDude) has been finalizing the telemetry interface for the relay system. Specifically this has meant he\u2019s tackled the task of making the game draw lines in the map view to show lines of communication used to control craft. It\u2019s a fine balance between information and keeping the screen from becoming a huge spider web like appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn community news, we\u2019d like to celebrate that our Facebook page has hit the magical milestone of 100,000 likes today!
