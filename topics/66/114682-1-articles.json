Work on the new wheels is progressing, but not as quickly as I would like. I got the steering module working last week, and had to step back to work on the suspension again. It required a few more days of investigating and moving things around, but they are now much more stable than before, and their internal logic is much simpler. Yesterday I wrote the new extend/retract module, which is about as interesting as a two-state animation controller can be\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which admittedly isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t much. The wheels can deploy and retract again though, which is a good thing.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also fixed the way wheels respond to being aligned to ground at launch. When you hit Launch in the editor, the game figures out where the bottom-most bits of your ship are, and uses that to place it flush with the launchpad or runway surface, so if you had your ship hovering 5m up in the air in the editor, it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fall and smash itself to bits on starting flight. This lowest-point-on-ship system relies on collider bounds to figure out where the ship is, but wheel colliders are special cases, because they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not actual solid objects, but rather just a physics behaviour component, so they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t figure in for the bounds detection, and as a result, ships would tend to spawn with their wheels below ground.\n\nNow, wheels use the same system launch clamps use (and had it developed for, in fact) to override this ground alignment. Wheels don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do anything as dramatic as the clamps do, but they add the height of the wheels at full extension, so when you spawn, the tires are flush against the tarmac.\n\nThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about all I have so far, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve evidently not had the most exciting week. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also .going through different ideas here to split the project into multiple DLLs, because this slowness is mainly being caused by the time it takes to compile and run the game after making changes. The time it takes between saving your latest tweak to the code, switching to unity, waiting for the project to compile, then launching the game and waiting for it to load, even with all the development tools we have to speed up this process, is still taking several minutes, which is more than enough time to lose focus, forget what you were doing, fire up a browser and ADHD yourself into total disconnection. Any amount of time spent optimizing this process is definitely going to be time well spent.\n\nWell, this has been my week.\n\n **Mike (Mu)**\n\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been another long week of UI work. I wrote some nice new editor scripts last week to aid us in working faster. Should have done them much sooner! The various scenes are getting debugged and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all coming together. Staging is still a thorn in my side but decided to have a day or two on other areas before going back to it refreshed.\n\n **Marco (Samssonart)**\n\nLast week was mostly about ensuring every store that sells KSP has version 1.0.4 available, most already do, KerbalEdu is on the way, the only one that has been giving trouble is Amazon. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re having trouble getting the update up, so for now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re giving KSP Store accounts to those who bought the game on Amazon and wish to receive the update now, so spread the word.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\nDid the Asteroid Day graphic for Kasper, I hope you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re enjoying the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153official mod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 in your games. This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on several visual improvements to different game assets. You know the drill, a little adjustment in the topology, some textures over here and there, shaders and all that jazz.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\nAt the start of the week I broke the research and development facility and today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve putting it together using the Unity 5 GUI system. Visually R\u0026D is going to look the same as it did before, that is the goal at least. The back end driving the GUI has changed tremendously though: the tech tree. itself which had to be redone from scratch. Luckily this time around half of its logic is handled by the Unity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00B2s GUI system so I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to write the code to update the scrollbars, snap the grid area to the edges, etcetera. Another advantage is that this GUI system has proper clipping implemented, so the tech tree area is no longer visible through a hole in the rest of the GUI.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**\n\nFinally back from my break. Had a lovely time in Canada. Not a whole lot to report, just playing catchup on everything that I missed throughout the week. Next week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s devnotes should be a tad meatier.\n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working away on internal documentation for the past week. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s less code or asset documentation and more training-style documentation for the methodologies we follow, the tools we commonly use and any resources that we find useful. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not something we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve really needed in the past given our small team size, but as we continue to work on the future of KSP it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s definitely something that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll prove useful and will only bring benefit.\n\nApart from that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been working with Marco to solve some issues with the Amazon distribution of KSP as well as moving towards the goal of having a functioning Patcher for all. (Hotfixes with no Patcher does not make for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153hot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 fixes.)\n\nAdditionally, the time has come again to refresh our voluntary testing team (Experimental Team). I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be accepting new applications around this time next week. They will be accepted through an online form (Google Docs). As I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure you can all understand, owing to the sheer number of applications, I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be reviewing or replying to any PM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d to me on the forums.\n\nLastly, like Kasper, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d been focusing on my studies recently and am proud to say that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve finished up my BSc and have now graduated, receiving a 1st in my dissertation and 2:1 overall!\n\nHappy Asteroid Day!\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\nToday is Asteroid Day and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been coordinating a few things we did to highlight the occasion. The results for the\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987\n[Oscar-B awards](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115987\nhave also been announced and I had fun looking at all the nominees, although the choices I was faced with as a judge weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t always easy. I think we have some very deserving winners in the end, though all the nominees definitely deserve an honorary mention.\n\nOutside that and the obligatory \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstuff I cannot talk about\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been focussing on my studies, as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got one more exam coming up next month before I obtain my BSc (Bachelor of Science) degree. Busy times, but sadly not much news to report on this week.\n\n**Bob (Roverdude)**\n\nAs most of you probably know by now, Arsonide and I have been working on a little surprise for Asteroid day - a representation of the B612 Foundation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Sentinel mission! Arsonide handling most of the code and contract goodness (more about that in his devnote), while I built out several new parts.\n\nOne of the interesting things was figuring out how to take a unique satellite (the Sentinel infrared telescope) and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Kerbalize\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 this in a way that we could release it as several multi-use parts instead of just releasing a single unique one-off. Hence, you will be getting a new jumbo probe core, antenna dish, and large static solar panel in addition to a slightly reimagined version of the telescope itself. Fun note - I had to change the HECS-2 from silver to gold because (a) it matched the Sentinel better, and (\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png)\nit was almost impossible to distinguish from the original HECS probe in the VAB toolbox! Have fun with the new toys!\n\n**Brian (Arsonide)**\n\nAfter 1.0 I had a nice break, which gave me plenty of time to read through feedback and prototype crazy new ideas. Following that, for the past few weeks RoverDude and I have been in a small dark room quietly toiling away on a secret side project to celebrate Asteroid Day!\n\nBy now, most of you will know that as a representation of the B612 Foundation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Sentinel mission in Kerbal Space Program. I handled most of the code that the telescope utilizes to discover asteroids, as well as the new contract that comes with the add-on.\n\nIt is a bit different than the stock contracts, as it encourages long-term passive income, building infrastructure, and planning. It really opens up a lot of new options in both career mode and sandbox, so I hope you guys enjoy it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T21:56:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld**"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T21:04:02Z","Content":"Great!

After like 230 years(whatever the 32bit interger limit is for seconds) in game stuff would break down. will U5 change any of that?\n\nTime in Unity (4, anyway) of any bitness is counted as seconds in a double -- that\u0027s a 64-bit floating point number (available in both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms; 64-bit platforms should just execute it a little faster). The maximum value is a bit more than 179E\u002B306, so you never \u0022run out\u0022 of time, but at some point you may run out of *precision*.\n\nExpressed in decimal, a double has 15-17 significant figures of precision at any given value. So, if your game has been around for a number of seconds with more than 15 digits in the number -- about 30 million (Earth) years -- the notion of a \u0022second\u0022 will no longer be possible. Milliseconds will be impossible 1000 times sooner; about 30 thousand (Earth) years.\n\nSince the game runs at a max of say 180 FPS, the delay between frames is at least about 5 milliseconds. At time warp that number gets *bigger*, not smaller, so the worst case for adding time to the clock is at 1x warp after 150 thousand (Earth) years of game time or so.\n\nI\u0027m going to guess that clock model instability is not actually why the clock display goes funny after a long period of time. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEdit: As an aside; it is a falsehood that 64-bit data structures like double-precision floating point numbers and \u0022long\u0022 integers are not available in 32-bit games or builds. They are constructs handled somewhat differently by the runtimes of various bitness, but they absolutely *are* available in any modern language, and certainly in .NET.\n\nActual example of 64-bit precision loss, using Mono\u0027s 32-bit CSharp CLI interpreter:\n\n    csharp\u003E double big = 1e18d;csharp\u003E double small = 1d;csharp\u003E double sum = big \u002B small;csharp\u003E big == sum;true\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T22:42:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by toadicus**"},{"CreatedByName":"LividPumpkin","CreatedById":133424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:31:17Z","Content":"Is multiplayer going to be a fantastic thing ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:34:31Z","Content":"Good to see the preogression on wheels and UI.
