The point of watching a twitch stream is you are watching a personality playing a game. While I respect and abide by Squads language requirements while streaming on their official channel, my own channel will contain swearing. I\u0027m of the opinion that if language is offensive, then we have given it far too much power. I understand that\u0027s not how everyone feels.
