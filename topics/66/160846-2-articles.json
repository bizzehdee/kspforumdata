I really do like career mode, though. The added incentive of money really does make it more interesting to me. I\u0027ve said before that it must be my inner greed, because I\u0027m closing in on 100 million and yet, for every ship, I want to make sure it\u0027s going to be profitable. But the way in which they\u0027re structured could definitely use some work. I know what they\u0027re trying to do with the balancing system, but it just doesn\u0027t quite work right. I would really like to see a contract menu. For instance, one of the menus in mission control would be \u0022planets\u0022. Click on Jool and see all the available contracts for Jool and it\u0027s moons. You could have another where contracts are separated by type. Tourist contracts in one menu, Exploration contracts in another, and so on. The game could still rotate the available contracts, but this would give you more of a say in how to run your program. And I\u0027d really like to see a greater number of the creative, more involved contracts. I just recently got the Ultimate Jool 6 and the Eeloo 4. Both were pretty cool. And I think everybody gets the Ike 3 Course early on. More of those would be great. \u0022Land on Eve and Gilly with a single vessel\u0022; things of that nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-20T06:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223061810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495235789\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002266485\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, SQUAD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0As an added bonus for those players that enjoy more \u2018creative\u2019 uses for our parts - all of the new separators and decouplers will be set up with hollow collider configurations (in this case, four mesh colliders)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor giant bearings and other moving parts?

This has always been the case even when KSP was in Early Access. New versions have always been built and provided in such a manner as to be the final version even if more work was planned. Furthermore, Squad\u00A0is currently working on KSP in a manner which implies they are focusing on revenue producing updates (localization to sell additional copies in newly available languages) and paid add-on content (the Making History Expansion). There\u0027s no way to know if this is motivated by necessity or not.

In this particular instance, I believe it\u0027s a privilege, not a right, to have a roadmap, but I also believe that most problems that can happen can be mitigated or resolved with clear and accurate communication. If excellent communication does not prevent or correct\u00A0misunderstandings caused by a roadmap, it is likely that the problem is not with the existence of the roadmap but rather with the person viewing the roadmap (at which point there\u0027s not much anyone can do besides hoping the individual chooses to understand how the world works).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T13:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495368873\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269375\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mako\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Mako said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy speculation is 1.4 will mostly consist of more work on localization since Squad originally mentioned a desire to translate KSP to more languages than what we know is coming in 1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks a lot like Squad is implementing the localization such that new languages will be a minor release, if that.\u00A0 That is not to say that they would not call a new package of languages 1.4 for marketing purposes, but from a programming standpoint new languages should not even need a minor release version, just a new download option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Mako said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that Squad feels that since some people can\u0027t handle a roadmap\u00A0no one should have one, but I feel like this is like removing the swings from the playground because a few children were injured when they used it improperly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have an effective and reasonable method of making a roadmap available only to those who can handle it maturely, then I imagine that every single game company with a PR department would be eager to hear about it, and no small number of non-gaming companies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus far, the only (usually)effective means that I am aware of involves a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E signed by every single person who is given access.\u00A0 From the \u0027sorry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027 responses RoverDude is providing to some questions, it looks like Squad is already using this method to allow access to the Roadmap to as broad an audience as they can with reasonable security.

Squad seems to believe that no one should be given the privilege of a roadmap because it is sometimes misunderstood by a limited number of individuals. While I will agree that it is probably easier for Squad to refuse a public roadmap, I do not agree with anyone who might suggest that refusal is the best solution. Furthermore, I believe the best solution, releasing a\u00A0public roadmap to all and ignoring individuals who persist in misunderstanding the roadmap, is relatively easy to implement and manage. At the very least I suspect it to be a break-even proposal: complaints about the direction of the roadmap could increase while\u00A0rampant speculation, confusion about direction, and any related discussions would decrease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, your post seems to imply public roadmaps are not used in games development. Maybe I\u0027m misreading or misinterpreting your post, but I will be happy to provide references and links upon request of games which have (or had during active development) public roadmaps. I can think of a few off the top of my head, and I\u0027m sure if I do some research I can find even more. Having not previously done research on the reception or success of public roadmaps for in-development games, I cannot say with certainty that roadmaps are a net positive tool. I believe they are: the truth, whatever you may think of it, is still the truth and it is better than nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can offer anecdotally that the still-in-Early-Access game Subnautica has had a public roadmap and its community was seems to have in general acted reasonably and favorably when deviations or changes to the roadmap were announced and explained in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood PR isn\u0027t always easy, but I don\u0027t believe it\u00A0has to be hard.
