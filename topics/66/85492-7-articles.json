Realistic, y\u0027know, Newtonian physics.

It sets out to make spaceship design approachable and fun, combining it with realistic physics to make flying them challenging and educational. FAR-level realistic aerodynamics will take the \u0022approachable and fun\u0022 out of the equation, moving the latter two qualifiers in their place, and adding \u0022frustrating\u0022 on top of that due to repeatedly failing to fly simple things that would otherwise be at worst unstable or hard to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEAR is, heh, nearer to the mark, but I honestly expect to see nothing more than a fix to stock drag parameters (i.e. removing mass from the equation), plus some basic airflow shielding to allow for nosecones\u0027 and fairings\u0027 usefulness, prevent hidden intakes and control surfaces, and make low atmosphere feel a little less like soup while retaining most of stock ascent difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
