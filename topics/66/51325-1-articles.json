Transmitting data does not allow you to max out a subject anymore as the science gain for transmission decays to 0% as repeated data is sent. Also, removing the data from an experiment module for transmission will render some experiment modules unusable. You can still reset and discard an experiment freely, as long as you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t remove the data from it. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;EVAs are now able to pick up data from data containers, which include not just experiments but also pods and even other EVAs. Also added some more info and progress bars to the science dialog, to give a better sense of how the data will be turned into science. Just now working on the new Lab module, which will let you take collected data and analyze it, increasing its transmission yield. Lots of work as you can probably imagine, but all this should make the gathering of science much more interesting, and eliminate most of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153grindy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 strategies for making quick science.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Chad (C7)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;: *\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;This week I worked with Ted and the QA team to test and fix the speed refactor and Unity engine upgrade branches.
