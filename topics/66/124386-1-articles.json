Overall it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a very smooth process so far which increases our hopes for a quick release. Everyone is now focusing on fixing the bugs the experimental team is encountering, including the developers that are also working on 1.1: Felipe (HarvesteR), Mike (Mu) and Jim (Romfarer). Smashing these bugs now means we won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to do it later on, in the 1.1 dev cycle. Felipe said that downgrading to the Unity 4 work environment \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfelt like starting up a car that hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t run in many months\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve followed the KSP Twitter feeds you may have learned that during this week in which builds rapidly succeed each other we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve passed the magical build 1000 mark. Unfortunately, bugs pop up everywhere and we did not foresee the KSP store encountering a bug not unlike the Y2k bug \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and some people on Twitter already dubbed this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KasperVld/status/661177037114208256\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe B1k bug\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E as a result.

A lot of fun was also had when the Whack-A-Kerbal dialog was stuck open in the Space Centre scenes - many hours were spent whacking buildings and Kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should keep stalking Ted\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s busywork for one more paragraph here, because as you may know KSP won the Best Indie Game award at the Golden Joysticks last week, and Ted himself was attending to receive the award. He wants to thank each and every one who voted for us! We also came third in the Best Original Game category - an excellent achievement! It was all made even better by the wonderful things people had to say about KSP and its community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris (Porkjet) meanwhile has been going over some details: polishing up textures, improving exhaust effects, creating heat animation and fixing various smaller issues, directed by the ever-watchful eyes of the experimental testers. Speaking of experiments, one little \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153experiment\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been testing is an inner turbine model for the jet engines. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s placed at opposite the jet nozzles and will just clip into other parts when attached. The parts basically handle the same as before, but give a better representation of what jet engines actually are, being more than just a nozzle with a hole that produces .flames. Also it adds a logical explanation for their COM offset. We advise you to make sure you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re sat down before you click \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JXBbVK6.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethis link\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter regaining our collective composure, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to look at what else has been going on in the process. Bob (Roverdude) has new resource parts - specifically a small radial tank as well as a new, smaller drill. These smaller bits will have certain drawbacks, for example the smaller ISRU converter cannot operate for long periods, and the drill requires a minimum ore concentration to be present. This makes the smaller ISRU good for biome hopping, but not so good for your long-term refuelling base. The smaller drill can work great for smaller ships, but will require more careful planning compared to the usual \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153land, drill, and pray\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 prospecting mechanic some are used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the career front Brian (Arsonide) has been working on the career compatibility process that checks out older saves just before they get loaded into a career. This allows us to upgrade any outdated contracts that have changed, and makes sure that all older careers remain compatible with the new version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile working on this, Brian also introduced a new form of contract, adding a variant of part test contract that does not require the player to actually perform a test. The contract simply completes when you fly the part to the destination, so it behaves more like a payload contract. The goal is to break up the early game with a bit more variety. A few small Easter eggs were also added to the passive reward system, to reward the more adventurous players. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking forward to see how quickly these get discovered!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanael (Nathankell) has seen few issues with his code in experimentals so far, and has shifted his attention to fixing ye olde bugs and filling in a few small holes in the code.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve officially flagged this part of the user interface as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfinished\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, and will now move on to such things as the editor, tracking station and the settings screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValve was kind enough to send us a couple of early access Steam controllers, and Felipe and Jesus immediately grabbed one to put together an official profile. KSP has usually been regarded as nearly impossible to play with anything other than a keyboard and mouse, but the flexibility of the Steam controller really comes through in this regard. The work in progress profile already has all the essential controls to both build and fly.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that concludes the devnotes for this week.

I have a certain opinion about the effect of the number of avaliable contracts in the career game and how 15 is a quite small number unless you expect the player to fast forward a lot ( and actually punishes a player that doesn\u0027t do so ). And OFC, the stock number should be displayed in the ingame options IMHO, because Unlimited =15 looks so much like something out of *insert name of evil telecom company of choice* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T22:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELuckily this is already in the game!
