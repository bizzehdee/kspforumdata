His Odyssey and Alexandria KSP series are certainly of a very high quality. \n\nThose of you who follow him will have certainly seen the interludes, which he uses to insert the story line into the Project Odyssey videos. Now Bob gives us a behind the scenes look at how these videos come together, a great video for his followers, but also for people who wonder how video editing works."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:24:29Z","Content":"The project Alexandria is so well and meticulously made. Bob uses real life models of probes for each of his historic launches. And the videos from historic archives about rocket building and mass media covering the events really make you relive the launches again.\n\nBravo Bob!"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:25:35Z","Content":"Love bob\u0027s videos.

Given the comparatively huge broadband cost of videos like this PLEASE can\u0027t you at least nod in the direction of something else?"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:37:58Z","Content":"That video editor looks familiar.
