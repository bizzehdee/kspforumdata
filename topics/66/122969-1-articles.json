For 1.0.5 that means the QA team is hard at work testing the various aspects of the update individually before the experimental test team gets their hands on the full update for playtesting.

Apart from \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153preparing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 for the trip by playing all the games that will be on display there, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also been working on the ingame models for the Kerbals, which is a longer-term project. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In Norway, Jim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s work has revolved around optimizing the tweening operations we talked about last week. The original implementation was rather cumbersome and required a lot of bookkeeping for all the elements in the interface, but a new algorithm has greatly simplified and optimized the process.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As some of you may have noticed we had planned on updating the servers that run our website, Wiki, Bugtracker and Forums last week, but due to a technical issue we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had to postpone it. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still very much on top of this issue though and we hope we can isolate the problem quickly and reschedule the update. Once that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s done we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to solve some issues that have been plaguing the Wiki and Bugtracker in particular for far too long now.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We were happy to see your positive response to the 1.0.5 announcement. After all, the decision to push the completed content from 1.1 forward in a separate patch was done because we felt you guys shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to wait for content we could release in the short term when a completely different and independent part of the update was taking longer than we initially thought. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Speaking of the 1.0.5 patch, Ted spent yesterday \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwith his head in Jenkins [the build server]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 because we were having build issues that prevented OSX and Linux builds from completing. The reasons for these failures seemed random at first, and every time we fixed one issue another one popped up. Almost \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 amounts of coffee thankfully cleared our brains enough to figure out the problem though so now the members of the QA team who use Linux or Mac OSX are swimming in many new builds.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many new builds because aside from Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (RoverDude) thermal fixes, Nathanael\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (NathanKell) thermal fixes and Chris\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 (Porkjet) parts we are now also testing Brian\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (Arsonide) contextual contracts and miscellaneous bug fixes. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a lot of different branches that are on our QA channels and which branch is tested can change frequently on a per build basis. Thankfully the QA test team is managing this phenomenally and they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re powering through the testing progress like never before. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still at the beginning of the testing process, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very happy about the progress.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the community end we remember promising you a few pictures of the renovated office once the work was complete, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll add these in below.
