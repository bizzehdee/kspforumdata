I\u2019ve watched it grow from this little unassuming idea\nfor a 2D game in which you\u2019d put together rocket parts to see how high\nyou could get, into a complete spaceflight simulator, a space agency\ntycoon, a planetarium of truly astronomical scale, a home for little\ngreen men and their space program, a Kerbal space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has become far more than the game I imagined half a decade ago.\nWhen we first set out to take on this project, I could not have expected\nanything even remotely close to what it ended up becoming. To say KSP\nsurpassed my every expectation would be, at best, a colossal\nunderstatement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a time, years ago, when any single design decision of mine\nhad the power to drastically change the direction of the project. There\nwas the danger that by even moving ahead on development of one area\ninstead of another, the entire feel of the game, the intent it carried,\ncould be morphed into something else. There was a fine line we needed to\nstay on, lest we let the project slip and become something other than\nwhat we intended. That is no longer the case, and that\u2019s a very good\nthing. It means that conceptually, the game is complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u2019t to say KSP\u2019s development is complete, however. Far from it.\nPlans for KSP reach far into the future, and there are enough ideas to\nkeep us all going for years. The console versions are coming up, there\nare new updates in development, the list goes on. For myself, however, I\ndesperately need to have something new, to create more than one game in\nmy life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need to make one thing perfectly clear: development on KSP will continue as always. No features, upgrades, bugfixes or anything of the sort are being discontinued because of my leaving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis I say with absolute confidence, because I have complete trust in\nevery member of the KSP team, and I know they are fully capable of\nhandling anything that comes their way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP team deserves more praise than I can give them. This is a band\nof outstanding people, all brilliant and excellent at what they do,\nnever tiring, never doing anything less than their best. I\u2019m very proud\nof what we have accomplished together. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll carry with me\nfor ever. I also know beyond any question that KSP would not have\nbecome what it is without every single one of them. I am forever\ngrateful and in awe of all the work they put in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, I must give all my thanks to the founders at Squad,\nEzequiel and Adrian, who took this wild leap of faith with me, putting\ntheir unconditional trust in me without ever requiring any failsafes or\nguarantees of success. We all know games are a notoriously risky\nproposition in the best of times, and they nonetheless extended their\nfull support to me, at a time when none could tell what lay ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, but most certainly not least, I have to thank every single one\nof you, the community, our players, kerbalnauts, space enthusiasts,\nreckless rocket engineers, our friends. All of you, who like us,\nbelieved in our weird little game and supported us throughout the years\nwith your ever-inspired ideas, your unparalleled willingness to help,\nyour relentless honesty and your unfailing loyalty. I cannot thank you\nenough for all of it, and I can only hope I am so lucky to see you again\nin whatever comes next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u2019t goodbye. It\u2019s just farewell for now. In the meantime,\nhowever, I hope you all enjoy playing KSP as much as I enjoyed being\npart of its making.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSigning off,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFelipe Falanghe, aka HarvesteR \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure data-orig-height=\u0022300\u0022 data-orig-width=\u0022242\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg data-orig-height=\u0022300\u0022 data-orig-width=\u0022242\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 src=\u0022https://67.media.tumblr.com/35128d94ad338ee594e25e719a48b7e1/tumblr_inline_o8031yfIhc1rr2wit_540.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T17:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoodbye Felipe, and thanks again for making such a fantastic little world for all of us to explore!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T17:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry to see you go, all the best!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T17:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFarewell, Felipe!
