Or will it be something truer to the term \u0022budget\u0022, where you have (for example) a per-launch \u0022allowance\u0022 provided by some third party that does not decrease based on buying parts but rather increases/decreases based on objective completion/failure or the spending of reputation? (I feel that this is an important question because it directly plays into how the feature is designed from the ground up, how it is intended to be played, how stable/usable the system is for exceptionally good and exceptionally bad players, and the like.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are the two new currencies a core feature that is required for progress in career mode, like the existing currency of science points? If that is the case (and I expect it to be), in what way do currencies and contracts interact as features? Previously Squad described contracts as completely optional. I understand that this may have changed during development, and I ask this question completely without bias either way: can you earn these currencies just through regular launches, like you can earn science just by flying up there and conducting an experiment? Or does money/budget and reputation come exclusively from contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will the mission control building be accessible in sandbox mode, or will it be locked like the R\u0026amp;D facility?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If contracts are procedurally generated, do you have a system in place that prevents specific contract repetitions, or are contracts designed to be repeating?

And does the contract system itself in return hook into modded content, i.e. does it auto-generate contracts based on non-stock parts, planets etc.? After all, the recently revealed logos are a big thing in .24, and I expect them to feature quite prominently in the contract system. And since it\u0027s effortless to add a new manufacturer (just write it in the part.cfg), just about every single part addon does it. The contract system would need to work with this manufacturer entry somehow if it was to hook into these parts automatically, and it would need to associate some kind of logo to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are the new tutorials coming that were talked about before the advent of the .23.5 release?

My current launch vehicles use large amounts of solid rockets at launch, many have no liquid engines at all in their first stage. This greatly lowers the cost of the first stage compared to an equivalent liquid fuelled design (based on current part costs as shown in the VAB), but the solids disappear after falling back into the atmosphere and are thus not recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logic is that if I design my launch vehicle to be completely recoverable, I\u0027m recovering mostly engines and empty fuel tanks. If solid fuel is a lot cheaper than liquid fuel, then the savings I get from recovering engines and fuel tanks might not be competitive. Recovering the launch vehicle means that I\u0027ll have to add either wings and landing gear, or parachutes, which add additional cost and weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if I recover parts, is there an incentive for me to return them to the KSC?
