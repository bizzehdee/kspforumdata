I wanted contra rotating props due to the enormous torque one of these engines produce, and still there\u0027s a small thrust differential due to small differences in the placement of the jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve modified the KAX Jumpjet to remove the smoke, decrease heat development and increase thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to a limitation in the aerodynamics system, the amount of thrust every blade develops decreases rapidly with increasing speed of the plane. But I have an idea that might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that the blades are pulled from the rotatrons is something that might be handled with some editing in the part.cfg.
