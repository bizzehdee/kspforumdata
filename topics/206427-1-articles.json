I won\u0027t bore you with the details or ask for feedback or suggestions about it, but there is one thing I\u0027m curious about\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know Blueshift and KSPIE kind of do the same thing - offering a way to get FTL. I also have all of Nertea\u0027s mods on my list, and then I realised that Far Future likely has some FTL as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I\u0027m wondering about how those 3 mods would interplay. I think I\u0027m most excited about Blueshift, then Far Future, then KSPIE, but from what I\u0027ve seen from Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest, and read about Blueshift, they use very different systems to do it, different fuels, and I think Far Future uses a different thermal system altogether... My initial plan was to have all 3, but it\u0027s seeming like I should only get one of them? Maybe two? Anyone have any experience with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-16T23:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/218346-myste_rae/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022218346\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/218346-myste_rae/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@myste_rae\u003C/a\u003E, I tend to play with KSPIE, But I don\u0027t use faster than light, FTL is fine, but try getting as far as ya can without it, you will be surprised\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFFT has no FTL drives, not at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlueshift is a standalone FTL mod, but has the issue of the fact that the tyranny of the rocket equation still exists\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"myste_rae","CreatedById":218346,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-17T02:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078116\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206427\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642376314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199169\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kspnerd122\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, kspnerd122 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/218346-myste_rae/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022218346\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/218346-myste_rae/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@myste_rae\u003C/a\u003E, I tend to play with KSPIE, But I don\u0027t use faster than light, FTL is fine, but try getting as far as ya can without it, you will be surprised\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFFT has no FTL drives, not at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlueshift is a standalone FTL mod, but has the issue of the fact that the tyranny of the rocket equation still exists\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, I\u0027m not that worried about FTL specifically, it\u0027s just that... all 3 of those mods seem to add fuels and technologies, and I\u0027m worried that they might clash, when I play.
