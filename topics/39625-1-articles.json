Because SCIENCE !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are few ideas about this, which could be cool :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add a stock part which would be a Data Computer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would the Data Computer do :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData Computer could be use to store informations gathered by all the sensors, not having one would just do like this version of the game : you can manually check the data by clicking the sensor, but they wont be stored and unless you are taking huge amount of notes on paper, you wouldn\u0027t be able to do anything with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese Data could be sent via communication stuff to the KSC ( here come a use for the communotron ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could imagine a debit system in bit/s ( or kerbit/s ) which would be another characteristic making a difference Between Communotron 88-88 and Communotron 16, a certain amount of data would take a certain amount of time to reach the KSC ( but a reasonable amount of time though, considerig the speed of light as information speed ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData received in the KSC could get stored in a research facility and we could use them for scientific purpose, such as : GRAPHS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking graphs to study, by exemple, temperature in function of altitude, or air pressure in fonction of temperature, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll we would have to do is choose the bank of data, then choose which one goes on Abscissa and which one on Ordinate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, there could be a mapping system ( like ISA Mapsat ) compatible with the Data computer, allowing people to see on which point of the planet they took their measure ( could be then usefull for future mining update ), and access these measures by clicking the point on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea GPS system could be used, with some condition, by exemple if you have a constellation of at least 4 GPS Satellites orbiting Kerbol you could be able to make a 3D map of your flight and access informations you gathered via this map, just like with the map system. Basically this 3D Map would be the orbit view with the trajectory of the vessel/satellite you launched during the whole mission ( perhaps could get some improvement by only drawing trajectory when it changes, preventing useless resources use by drawing stable orbiting probe\u0027s trajectory ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there could be more scientific stuff, we already have a gravity sensor, a thermometer, a barometer and an accelerometer, which is already awesome, but there could be others like, as I saw on other suggest, Geiger counters, luxmeters, teslameters ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really cool and we could really use this informations ( by exemple pressure/altitude to find which altitude is flyable for a jet plane depending of planets etc ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you\u0027ll like my ideas !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T10:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sol_invictus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sol_invictus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi everyone, I was thinking it would be cool to increase the science and research part in the game.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty likely for career mode IMO.
