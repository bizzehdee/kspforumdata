I can\u0027t remember how much CO2 each Kerbal produces per day, but basically the efficiency relates to how much extra oxygen you get back from CO2 recyling per day, reducing the Kerbal\u0027s Oxygen useage by that much. Base it on the total oxygen content of the tanks and you\u0027d get an exponential life expectancy. Doubling the tankage would only gain you a fixed amount of time rather than doubling the duration.

The raw numbers were gaining 0.7 O2 per hour for 8 Kerbals and one large Recycler, and CO2 going down by 8.7 per hour for warp 7. Then O2 going DOWN by 7.7 per hour for 8 Kerbals and one large Recycler and CO2 the same at 8.7 down per hour. Assuming (big assumption I know) that the Kerbals were still using air and producing CO2 at the same rate as normal and it was the recycler that was messing up, this gives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge Recycler results\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp 6 and below: 16 CO2 converted to 11 O2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp 7: 16 CO2 converted to 9 O2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp 8: 16 CO2 converted to 0.3 O2!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo wonder flights were using a lot of oxygen at high warp! If it is the recycler that\u0027s messing up you may as well not carry one if you go to max warp. If you carry a lot of oxygen you can still make the trip of course, but the recycler isn\u0027t doing you much good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T03:19:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
