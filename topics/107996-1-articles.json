Get yourself a Skyjay today for the low price of 12000 credits! There\u0027s no better aircraft for afternoon flying, with it\u0027s spacious one-man cockpit and whisper-quiet turbojet half a meter from your seat.

The horizontal stabilizers are rotated a couple of degrees to compensate for this, but this also means at low power levels there is a stronger nose down tendency. It\u0027s still not much more than a few degrees of nose up trim, but do watch out for it when in low thrust situations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruising speed is about 140m/s, using 1/3 thrust. I haven\u0027t tested it with higher thrust levels, but if you want to push it all the way up and see what it does, go right ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt cruising speed, about a half a degree of nose up trim should be necessary to maintain straight and level flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotation speed is 35m/s, and takeoff occurs shortly after at about 38 or 39 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got the control surfaces set to standard configuration for an aircraft, and the torque from the cockpit is disabled. Only the outer ailerons actually control roll, the inner ones are just there to streamline the wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s about it, if you have any tips and tweaks just let me know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T01:18:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adinfinitum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emessed up a tag\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, it\u0027s a cessna!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, at least as close as I could get to a Cessna and still find a place for that huge turbine haha\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
