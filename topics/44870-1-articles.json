The White Dart SSTO is now mostly tested, and because the design went so well, the engineers at R-SUV went ahead and modified the prototype to create two different serial models to appeal to the discerning customer, a VTOL and a nuclear powered long-range scout. Not that the prototype is short range (flown right, there is enough for a KSO mission and return to runway), but it is equipped with landing gear to allow tail landings on airless moons. But, you know, the discerning customer, mostly wants something that looks good and fast. This achieves both objectives with a minimal part count and awesome performance. And I seriously don\u0027t really know how I got it to look so... well, \u003Cem\u003Eclean\u003C/em\u003E. I just love it.

As such, the main rocket propulsion should only be used to provide 200-400 m/s on the climb to orbit: Milk those turbojets as long as you can! The prototype also has amazing T/W on rocket power, so if you don\u0027t like tedious waits on the way to orbit, that is definitely your version. It also has somewhat cleaner lines, with less parts due to the missing subsystems. But if you are after efficiency or plain VTOL awesomeness, the other two versions get the added performance at the cost of a low T/W ratio outside of the atmosphere, so remember to make sure you keep your apoapsis in front of you during the climb to orbit with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EUpdate!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelebrating 0.23 and the RAPIER engine, here\u0027s a complete rebuild of the White Dart.

But there are changes, and they are substantial! First, a single engine means way less T/W on jets. No more vertical climbs, but the reduced engine weight gives is much better mass ratio, and should give it more delta-v than the previous chemical version. Won\u0027t be able to hold a candle against the old nuke version, though, but it\u0027ll have much better T/W. Also, the reduced weight means better aerodynamic characteristics due to low wing loading, and I finally gave up and installed almost hidden frontal control surfaces, so maneuverability is truly spectacular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VTOL system is also new and shiny: a cluster of rockomax 48-7S\u0027s gives it enough T/W to lift on kerbin (though it eats fuel like there is no tomorrow) adding very little weight and instant response, allowing for controlled landings in airless bodies or bodies with a thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, part count efficiency has increased dramatically: just 50 parts in total!
