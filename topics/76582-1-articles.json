But having it be a mined resource with severely diminishing returns that go to zero isn\u0027t really ideal either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically why you do the science and how you do it would be the key thing I\u0027d be looking at. Why might you want to set up a base? Why are surface landings so valuable? Why is a Kerbal better than a probe? I think maybe we should be able to collect items, such as surface samples... but maybe more kinds of samples maybe some mechanic where we can look for different things around our landing zone on EVA much like what the astronauts on the moon did. This could probably be procedurally generated and would be different at each landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see measurements from return trips regain their value because repetition is important in science. Comparing results over time is critical. Maybe even be even MORE valuable on that second or third trip because you are increasing the number of data points. Maybe even be directed to new sites because of what you learned the first time. That the big science doesn\u0027t come from the first flight, but a later one as the world is studied and better samples and measurements are returned based on what you\u0027re learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think some science like the gravity scan should be about mapping and remaining on station. I don\u0027t like the current mechanic of taking lots and lots of gravity scans. I think you should have a total you can get if you have a complete map, and any transmissions are partials up until that total. Then you can scan it again at a certain time interval later and you can get more science for the repeated measurement. Some measurements we\u0027ll find do not change over time and you cannot get more science over a certain maximum amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one thing that could certainly be good is value of remaining on station. So building a space-station or a surface base makes certain experiments or contracts possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think splitting it out into separate fields is unnecessary. Biology is chemistry is physics. They\u0027re one in the same really (because really everything is physics). I think it\u0027s more important to find out what those experiments are then design missions to best do those rather than a 1 size fits all space craft that can extract all the science from a biome and sometimes worlds even with multiple biomes in a single flight. There should be a reason to keep visiting the Mun and Minmus rather than testing new designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these ideas are looking at a non-tech tree implementation of science mostly. I know I\u0027m starting to find less of a point to going places because I\u0027ve read all the funny messages from the community science project and I\u0027ve got a good way to max stuff out. Land, collect, take off, dock, repeat.
