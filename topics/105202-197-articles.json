Not to replace recycling or farming systems, but as an additional factor to consider - basically, a kerbal\u0027s life-style determines their base rate of supply consumption/unit-time (how often do they shower, do they demand cake for dessert, are they washing laundry/dishes, etc), and that number is then further modified by recyclers just as it is currently.\n\u003E \n\nIf you have MKS installed(and the parts unlocked) you can readily do all of that.\n\nWater purifiers which dramatically cut supply usage(so long as you have a steady supply of water to consume), Greenhouses supplying either supplying supplies directly from minerals\u002Bfertilizer or producing bulk organics for further processing into luxuries(which maintain crew happiness/reverse the habitation clock when consumed through a colonization module), etc.\n\nI think it is generally along the lines of:\n\nJust supplies: snacks for a short trip\n\nSupplies\u002Brecyclers: short-term endurance\n\nNom-o-Matic: longer endurance missions (at this point primary concern is cabin fever)\n\nFull base with 50\u002B year habitation(stops habitation clock) and Fertilizer harvesting: bare-bones long term colony\n\nBase with 50\u002B years habitation and Production/consumption of Colony supplies: Long term colony/vacation spot where kerbals would bring or bring up families(yes MKS can add \u0027baby\u0027 colonists over time)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-04T15:06:08Z","Content":"My two cents: I don\u0027t think 10.8 kg/day is excessive, if you are talking about a 24 hour day.

Add in a few observation copulas and a habitat or two and you should be good on that front.\n\nFor Supplies you will want the 2.5m recycler (\u0027Mobile Processing Lab\u0027 I think) supplemented by roughly 10 RT-500\u0027s(the surface-attach ones) to reduce consumption to 21% for 10 kerbals and an inline Nom-o-matic(which could support 2.6 kerbals without recyclers or ~12.5 kerbals with 79% recycling)  To keep the in-line recycler fully stocked with ferilizer for 5 years would take ~5500 fertilizer, which could be supplied by 1 2.5m fertilizer tank and 2 1.25m fertilizer tanks.\n\nFill up the supplies and fertilizer tanks in your nom-o-matic for extra margin(and because kerbals can\u0027t eat fertilizer so you need at least some supplies to start)\n\nAdd in enough power to keep everything running, and that should keep your kerbals healthy for  the duration you are after."},{"CreatedByName":"Loskene","CreatedById":141778,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-21T20:48:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/11/2018 at 9:34 PM, Johould said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I assume your \u0022die\u0022 is accurate, but if so I\u0027m curious how you like that difficulty setting. I went with the \u0022Normal\u0022 career default of Kerbals just getting \u0022grumpy\u0022 because I wanted to leave things easy for myself, but I think it has also made life support failures or poor planning more interesting, by leaving living tourists that need a rescue mission (maybe losing parts to \u0022mutiny\u0022 would make things even more interesting).\n\u003E \n\nWell I don\u0027t have them die for every situation, I try to keep my modded installs realistic without going full realism overhaul, which never runs properly for me anyway.

This is to simulate a complete life support failure resulting in loss of crew. If for some reason a ship or base goes without power for 2 weeks that\u0027s kind of on me, and it\u0027s probably longer than a crew would really survive if the ship\u0027s air scrubbers stopped scrubbing and the lights went out.\n\nI don\u0027t play with mutiny or anything on though because I don\u0027t like leaving mission failure scenarios up to random chance.

Once they respawned, they remained tourists. I even tried putting them in a craft with supplies on the launching pad and they still remain tourists.\n\nHow do I reset them to their original status? I am concerned this would happen on a trip and I could do nothing about it, even after providing supplies subsequently.\n\nPerhaps it is not a bug but that something needs to happen in game? I couldn\u0027t find what to do and am still looking.\n\nThanks!\n\n---------\n\nUpdate\u003E\n\nThe kerbal I put in a pod with food then recalled is now back to her normal pilot self...but the kerbal I did nothing with is still a tourist.\n\nSeems like a bug that needs fixing because it would be unreasonable to do this with every kerbal who enters tourist mode, so please let me know if I missed something.
