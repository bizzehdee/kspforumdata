This footage is usually mistakenly attributed to the Apollo 11 mission, when it was actually filmed on the flights of Apollo 4 and Apollo 6.[13] A compilation of original NASA footage shows the jettisoning of the first stage (S-IC) and the interstage, filmed from the bottom of the second stage (S-II), both from Apollo 4.[14] This is followed by footage of the separation of an S-IVB second stage from the first stage of a Saturn IB. The glow seen on the jettisoned stages is due to the hot, invisible hydrogen-oxygen flames of the J-2 engines used by the S-II and S-IVB.[13] The footage also shows the more conspicuous plumes of the solid ullage motors as they pull the stages apart before the main engines are fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cameras ran at four-times normal speed to show the events in slow motion.[14] The camera capsules were jettisoned soon after the first stage separation and though at about 200,000 feet (61*km) in altitude, were well below orbital velocity.[13] They then reentered the atmosphere and parachuted to the ocean where they floated waiting for recovery. Both S-II cameras from Apollo 4 were recovered so that there is footage from both sides of the vehicle.[1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_4#Saturn_V_cameras\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_4#Saturn_V_cameras\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T14:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that these films weren\u0027t just for PR.

The engineers can pick a *lot* of valuable information on how the systems performed from those films, which is why, for example, the Mobile Launchers and LC39 launch pads themselves were just *covered* in high-speed 16mm and 35mm motion picture cameras that started at about T-9 seconds, when the ignition command was sent to the booster, and filming the entire ignition and launch sequence, including a rarely-seen but truly awe-inspiring shot *up the throat of the Saturn V\u0027s engines* from *inside* the flame trench. (Shuttle didn\u0027t have that angle because the SSMEs were above the top level of the Mobile Launch Platform and thus could have their startup behavior recorded from the sides, but with the Saturn V\u0027s engines sticking down below the platform top, the only place to film their startup behavior was from below.) The S-II didn\u0027t just carry staging cameras for the S-IC jettison on SA-501 and SA-502 (Apollo 4 and 6), it also carried staging cameras for S-II jettison on those flights, looking *up* to show how well it separated from the S-IVB. Since the S-IVB did the \u0022heavy lifting\u0022 in terms of getting the spacecraft up to orbital velocity (the S-IC was basically for initial loft, to get out of the atmosphere, and the S-II was more for the gravity turn and starting to push apogee around the planet), the S-II Jettison staging cameras didn\u0027t need any sort of retrofire engine to deorbit, though their thermal protection system had to be much more robust than that on the S-IC Jettison cameras due to the higher speed and altitude when they were ejected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For the record, the pad- and Mobile Launcher-mounted cameras were, to survive the environment they were going to be in, mounted in heavily shock-, blast-, and vibration-insulated boxes, with the pad- and deck-mounted cameras buried inside the structure for further protection, while the tower-mounted ones were well back, ideally on the tower itself rather than a swingarm, and used the then-brand new technology of fiber optics to transmit light from the half-inch thick quartz lenses to the actual camera.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"palioxis1248","CreatedById":100635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T15:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you good sirs (and ma\u0027ams, don\u0027t kill me!)!
