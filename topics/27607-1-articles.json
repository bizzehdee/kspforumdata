There were a few dozen races in that game. (If you haven\u0027t played it, go to sc2.sourceforge.net and download the open-source version, dubbed \u0022The Ur-Quan Masters\u0022 because Atari owns the rights to the name \u0022Star Control\u0022. Seriously, get it. It\u0027s a lot of fun.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, one of the things they threw out there was that Humans are relatively small compared to most intelligent species, and we\u0027re still pretty closely related to arboreal mammals. Which means that if you need something to clamber up into a tight space, or if you need a task that requires physical dexterity and flexibility, get a Human; we\u0027re like little spider monkeys compared to most of them. We\u0027re also somewhat frighteningly adept at applying new concepts. We sent murmurs through the sentient races of the galaxy when we went from putting the first Human in space to walking around on the surface of our homeworld\u0027s satellite in \u003Cstrong\u003Eless than a decade\u003C/strong\u003E.

Lots of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this is empty conjecture, of course, but it\u0027s fun to speculate. A co-worker of mine toyed with the idea of trying to write a story about aliens that lacked sense organs that could detect subtle pressure changes in the atmosphere in the form of \u0022sound waves\u0022; the fact that we could communicate with one another without a direct line-of-sight was nothing short of miraculous to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-20T06:37:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2013 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nikolai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarified some punctuation and phrasing\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olha","CreatedById":66555,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T14:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts wrong perception.
