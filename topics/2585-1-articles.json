There are few things to consider. First the node collider is responsible for handling the physics of your object, such as collisions and applications of forces to the ship. Really the mesh for your part is purely visual. The node collider is where everything happens. Also, in order to move and select your part in the build screen, the mouse selects the node collider. So the size and shape of the collider will determine where and how you grab a part. For instance, if you had a tiny collider on a big part, you\\\u0027d have to hunt for it with the mouse to pick the part up and move it. That\\\u0027s the reason the struts are hard to grab, they have a really small collider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"korda","CreatedById":9114,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-01T14:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know collider is critical, but part I was making had more aesthetic purpose.

Perhaps there\\\u0027s some way to do what you want. If the part needs to intersect other physics objects, that\\\u0027s not an issue. You just have to set the allowcollision flag to 1 in the part.cfg. Even if you want the part not to collide, you can make a thin node collider that is close to the attachment point so it could still be grabbed. The rest of the mesh would then not collide with objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"korda","CreatedById":9114,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-01T21:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to make sort of container.

But you normally have to do it in two parts. If you take a look at the shrouds made by captain slug, that will give you an idea of how it works.
