I think it would be interesting for some additional challenge to put an option in the options menu to prohibit usage of the other camera modes, other than the ones you put on your space craft ( so no \u0022orbital; locked or free modes).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI think this feature would open to a more cinematic side of KSP to a broader audience, that is also why I would like this feature as a Stock feature not mode, I am, however, absolutely ok with it being in an update later after the release but I guess the choice is yours\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lonewaffle","CreatedById":217169,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-31T05:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to use mods for KSP that added these sorts of items and would like to see them too.
