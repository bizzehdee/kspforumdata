I like that it now has a separate niche of wide-load (plenty of room for extra surface-mounted bits on the sides of a 2.5m fuselage) or rover deployment with that flat bottom and the tail ramp, making it nicely distinct from the stock Mk3, which is a bit more of a snug fit on 2.5m cargo and can\u0027t really do rovers (outside of maybe dropping them from an inverted cargo bay).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faile","CreatedById":59519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T11:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why a spaceplane built using MKIV parts and stock wings would flatspin after takeoff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ccoJJKI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ccoJJKI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you care to take a look, here\u0027s the CRAFT file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgfskuoik7r9f9a/Spaceplane%20MkIV%20flatspin.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sgfskuoik7r9f9a/Spaceplane%20MkIV%20flatspin.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T11:05:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Faile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded craft file\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkona","CreatedById":99172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T16:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello all, specially Nertea, and thanks for these epic parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I find them extemely light for their size, either that or they have insane lift!
