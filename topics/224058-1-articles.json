I understand the game is in early access and bugs are to be expected. But nothing has annoyed me more than the terrain colliders, which feel the exact same as KSP 1 to me, and just as buggy and clippy. Rover wheels clipping through the ground (especially on the runway), landing legs sinking weirdly into the Mun/Minmus. Couple that with craft loading with a jump (or worse) when coming within 2.4km and it\u0027s a recipe for disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night I launched an Apollo-style lander to the Mun with a rover on its side (as an aside, it\u0027s really tough packing those things without robotics, which I hope comes back in the future). I landed near an intersection of 3 biomes to expedite science collection. One of my rover trips led me about 5km from my craft. On my return journey, I got a notification that \u0022combined-xx\u0022 was on a crashing trajectory, which I ignored because I had no idea which ship \u0022combined-xx\u0022 was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I get back to my ship only to find it... completely missing. Like someone stole it. All that was left was my flag and the stack separator I used for detaching my rover. I assume that was the notification I got -- that when my ship loaded in, it jumped or glitched through terrain (another annoying bug). After a minute of just staring, I used the cheat menu for the first time to teleport my kerbals to my CSM and called it a night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing that always stopped me from doing bases in KSP 1 was the jumps when they would load, and now we\u0027re getting the same thing in KSP2. Craft jumping on loading, landing legs/wheels clipping into the ground, and the combination of those causing wild physics glitches. I know there\u0027s a future a new terrain system coming eventually -- I hope part of that development fixes these issues. The 2.4km load issue is especially galling, and basically makes doing long-range rover exploration a complete gamble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-14T09:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an known issue but its weird that the lander went missing.
