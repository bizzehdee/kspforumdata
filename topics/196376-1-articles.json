I\u0027m wondering what a good way to start is, and some tips along my journey?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a few potential mod ideas, and I would like insight on how doable thee mods are, and whether they\u0027re good for beginners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOverhauling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and mining to make certain planets have different resources, and you need to be wary of what planets have resources to get good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff. Each of these resources can be converted one way or another into usable things like Liquid Fuel, Xenon, Oxidiser, Monopropellant, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdding more electric generators. Just solar panels and RTGs are boring. I mean, technically there are fuel cells, but not once have I EVER used them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdding some new cross section sizes, to make even smaller things or even bigger things than what is typically allowed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVery near future technologies (like moar engines and stuffs), along with an expansion of the tech tree. Basically Interstellar, but more stretched out and doesn\u0027t go too far into the future.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you more experienced modders recommend about going about these mods, or modding in general?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Context on my skill. I have barely any experience with Blendr and modeling, but I do have a lot of experience with programming. I know how to navigate and properly edit config files. I do not know a lot about how the mod folder directories work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-17T21:44:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2020 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by LittleBitMore\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T21:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223839820\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196376\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597700222\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201924\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LittleBitMore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/17/2020 at 3:37 PM, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverhauling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and mining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like it could be done mostly or entirely with config files (depending on whether you add new converters).
