How about a naming plaque part one the station core that defines the destination of the new station? When the plaque is in any orbit the following contracts like adding moduls getting available. That way its possible to add modules before the launch windows or at a seperate windows. The contracts are naturally only fulfilled when the destination is reached.\n\nThe part only needs to have a selector for the destination.
