I understand what lagrange points are, and somewhat how they work due to gravity. The only thing that stumps me is what the benefit of having spacecraft in these points is. Just satisfying curiosity, here!\n\nI assume they would be good for making observations of planets or the sun? Something regarding communication?"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:33:24Z","Content":"For astronomical observations, it\u0027s good because you never lose the signal.

That\u0027s where we put all of our solar observation spacecraft and Al Gore\u0027s Triana, which was supposed to continuously broadcast a live feed of Earth, but evolved into another solar observatory, and got renamed DSCOVR. .02 astronomical units away, at Sun L2, one side will also permanently face the Sun, but the other side is facing out into the cosmos unobstructed by the face of our planet. That\u0027s where James Webb Space Telescope is going.\n\nThe Earth/Moon Lagrange points are also interesting - a little nudge from El Too or El Wun can do wonders! A path described by legendary rocket scientist Robert Farquhar (designer of ISEE-3) from EML2 takes .4 km/s to get to an atmosphere-grazing perigee. Aerobrake to low circular orbit, or enjoy a huge Oberth benefit to send something interplanetary. There are countless other promising paths and weak stability trajectories too."},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:20:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For astronomical observations, it\u0027s good because you never lose the signal.

It has produced some of the most amazing movies of the active, dynamic solar surface, corona and even subsurface, featuring flares, sun spots, coronal mass ejections (eruptions which dump huge amounts of plasma into space), flux tubes (loops of magnetic fields jutting from the surface with high energy particles zipping along them), and even deep sun convection cells and whole-sun vibrations (helioseismology)."}]}
