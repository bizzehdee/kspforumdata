Possibly also is Plasma Thrusters... This would be useful for atmosphere-skimmer ships working off any CO2-containing upper atmosphere to harvest and store one more type of useful propellant. Currently, the only atmospheric gas that can currently be used in this way is Hydrogen (in the form of LiquidFuel), harvested from the atmosphere of Jool...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and more importantly, CO2 harvested in this way could be fed as feedstock into the existing pipeline of ISRU reactions- being usable for the Sabatier Reaction instead of the reaction having to be carried out in-atmosphere. This would enable small landers or atmospheric skimmer ships to feed inline refineries in a larger orbital mothership (itself incapable of entering the atmosphere or landing) with CO2, enabling a player to carry out the Sabatier Reaction in space. Even if CO2 (LiquidCO2) were not enabled as a propellant in and of itself, LiquidMethane and LiquidWater both would be. Further, players could always then electrolyze that LiquidWater for a higher-thrust solution than using LiquidWater in thermal rocket nozzles; and the ability to use the LiquidFuel component in Plasma Thrusters, and the Oxidizer component to combust the LiquidMethane in chemical (rather than nuclear) rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, a lot of interesting ISRU opportunities could be opened up simply by enabling players to harvest and store CO2 from CO2-containnig atmospheres, and use it as a feedstock into the Sabatier Reaction (which then would have to be added to inline refineries, in a version using LiquidCO2- and also preferable to the landable versions, under the same button if possible, to increase the flexibility of their potential usage...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einarr","CreatedById":4809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T04:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWaveFunctionP, get outta my head.

Currently, such designs are not really feasible on Kerbin or most other planets; as too large a fraction of the atmosphere is unusable for it to be worthwhile (the Nitrogen in the atmosphere still creates drag, even if it cannot yet be used as propellant, for instance). Being able to use captured Nitrogen as a propellant would increase the feasibility of such skimmer ships everywhere- but especially on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was inspired by a real-life proposal to harvest Oxygen using a satellite in Earth\u0027s upper atmosphere, for combustion with Hydrogen shipped up from launch centers, as well as for life-support; that would rely on Nitrogen-capture and a Nitrogen ion engine/ plasma thruster to provide the thrust necessary to make up for drag, and would rely on beamed microwave power from solar satellites in higher orbits...
