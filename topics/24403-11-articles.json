I am finally getting them to work but I still have some weird problems; check out my short stream tonite I made some additions earlier today to resources: I now have a Heating Supply Unit and a Coolant Unit; both will provide a temperature controlled environment (sort of) for the Kerbals ! There are other uses for them though which I am working on; I now will have Waste Heat ported over; making Liquid CO2 for refridgerant; amd 220 units short of CO2 even to provide for the Greenhouse !!
