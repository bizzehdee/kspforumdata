Never played any other modes, I simply installed, played the tutorials, and started a Career on normal difficulty. The thing is, i maxxed out the science tree just by exploring mun, minmus, and duna. At first i didn\u0027t even know how to get science . . . i wasnt aware i could do crew reports or thermal reading and such, so i spent a lot of time doing contracts for science. What i mean with this is, i wasn\u0027t power gaming or anything like that. I never did any biome hopping to max out a planet. It seems to me it was rather easy. What else do i do now with science, i have about 5k science from moho, gilly, eve, and ike (i think).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T21:29:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tazin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T00:59:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am playing my first career game ever.
