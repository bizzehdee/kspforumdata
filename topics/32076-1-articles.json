So, for instance, if you have a docking port mounted at the \u0022bottom\u0022 of your ship, or if you\u0027re using one of those inline ones where the port comes out the side, clicking on that part and selecting \u0022control from here\u0022 will reorient the navball so that it\u0027s reflecting where that particular part is pointed, rather than where the main command pod is pointing. Also, the rcs translation controls will now work with respect to the new part, so if you press \u0022i\u0022, for instance, your rcs will thrust in whatever direction that docking port is facing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Molson","CreatedById":63688,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T00:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs said above. Imagine you make a minishuttle with a cockpit at the fore and a docking port at the aft. You\u0027re going to have a pain to achieve docking, because you\u0027ll have to make it reverse ! But if you control things from the aft docking port, all nav tools will be configured in the right direction. Very handy. Basically, it changes the \u0022point of view\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T02:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems to determine which piece you stay in personal control of after undocking part of an assembly.
