The accuracy of these numbers was entirely up to the skill of Michael Collins and as the mission progressed he figured out what worked and didn\u0027t in 0g and with the actual view out the window as compared to what had worked in the simulators with different optics and lighting conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they landed on the moon, NASA wasn\u0027t entirely sure where they were landed. They knew the general area to within a crater or two but that\u0027s about it. On every orbital pass they had Collins searching a different (incorrect) area of the moon below based on their guesses from the length and direction of the various burns and thruster firings, and from the descriptions of the local features from Neil and Buzz.

More experienced pilots should be able to carry out maneuvers better (more accurately, using less fuel) than less experienced ones. However, as a caveat, NO pilot should be able to exceed the mathematical limit on efficiency as determined by the stats of the rocket.
