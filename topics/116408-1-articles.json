I quickly came to realize that RT only affects probes (which I rarely use), not manned missions. What I would love to see is an addon for this mod that uses Custom Barn Kit (or some other way) to disable the players ability to create and use maneuver nodes when contact with KSC is lost. So if you have a manned mission, you\u0027d essentially lose the FlightPlanning upgrade you get with level 2 of the Tracking Station and Mission Control. You\u0027d still be able to manually pilot your ship, but you really need that contact with KSC\u0027s experts and tracking station to plan those precise maneuvers. This would really make this mod one of \u0022satellite networks, or else\u0022. (copied from my post in the RT thread, moved here to hopefully get some attention by modders).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere I saw a config file for a mod that had \u0022enableFlightPlanning\u0022 as a variable. I\u0027m pretty sure they were adjusting the building upgrades, but not sure if MM can be used to address this as a variable that can be toggled, and also integrated to Remote Tech\u0027s communications on/off behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERT does not only affect probes.

I do not know how you play, personally I play career, I use RT2 and many other survival mods that makes the game more realistic and hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science grind is my main problem when starting a new game. But as soon I can send a probe to the mum or Minmus to scan for kerbonite, my lander needs a connection to KSC to send EVA reports and crew reports since I will do several biomes before I came home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not send them, they get replaced when you get a new one, instead of the goo, temp and other science that you can store in your module. I find it rewarding to be able to transmit this to KSC, sometimes I have to wait a few hours (or days) before I have a connection, adding this to life support, my manned missions must be calculated very carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey!

You simply need to EVA to remove crew reports, then store them back in the command pod.
