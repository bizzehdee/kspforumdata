The number of reignites depends upon the size of those tanks. Another way that is used is what might be described as heavy duty sparkplugs. The reliability comes down to how you engineer the system to survive the hostile environment its got to live in. Generally speaking, thats not as bad as it sounds, because engines you might want to start and stop often - e.g. manuvering thrusters, are generally relatively low power and so the reignition system (or in teh case of hypergolic engines, the reaction chamber) can be made more robust without a huge weight penalty. Space shuttle OMS is a reasonably good example of that. They were designed to deal with multiple, relatively short lived, re-igntion sequences as necessary (and indeed be reusable after overhaul from flight to flight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we ever do a mission to mars, we will probably need a robust re-igniteable non-hypergolic system. Robust because it needs to be able to reignite multiple times, over the span of years. non-hybergolic because we want it to have some reasonable ISP so the mission can be done. In that way KSPs ahead of our real space program. We don\u0027t have many situations yet where we are sending vehicles on long distance travel and doing significant re-ignites (other than small course correction burns on space probes), which can be very small hypergolic engines and thus probably count from this mod\u0027s point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T02:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if amount varies--my guess is at least modern engines spray a carefully measured amount into the reaction chamber.

Thats equally true for LH2 /LOX chemical engine, or a LH2 NERVA. Someone mentioned above that Kerosene has problems, which is true, not due to boil off, but due to fouling. Some options do exist tho:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor long duration deep space missions, there are hypergolics that have very low loss. Their ISP kinda sucks, but thats what we currently use now for satellites and space probes (when not using Ion engines, which is becoming more common). For non-hypergolics, there are still options. One of the most popular right now is Liquid Methane / Liquid Oxygen. It has fairly good ISP (about 380, not LOX / LH2 numbers, but not bad), can be stored at relatively high density compared to LH2 (which makes the size of the tank much smaller for a given mass, and thus makes up for some of the ISP deficiency) and while technically cryogenic, is relatively easy to prevent boil-off. It also has the ability to be \u0027mined\u0027 from places you can get ahold of carbon and water and electricity (e.g. mars). Space-X is looking to make their next generation upper stage engine Methalox, probably more for the storage of the propellent features i mentioned than the \u0027mining\u0027 feature (as one can also make LOX/LH2 from water and electricity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor NERVA engines, you can use most anything. LH2 still has the problem of boil off and large tank mass, so generally the consensus is that the best option for long duration missions is Ammonia, which is still very light (and thus has good ISP) and isn\u0027t cryogenic. It also can be stored at relatively high densities (small tank volumes). In a pinch, you could use LOX or methane, but they are less optimal (although perhaps easier to \u0027mine\u0027). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a really good article someone wrote up (I think on Space.com, but I can\u0027t find it anymore) where somone build huge spreadsheets of the various fuel options as a function of engine size and tankage, looking for the optimal points. It was a good article, and went into great detail on which fuels work best for what.

Clarke used in 2001/2010 for the reaction mass of the Discovery space craft, which I believe was using a plasma engine (not sure if that last bit was true).

That way a sparkplug ignitor will consume ElectricCharge while others can consume MonoPropellant or some other dedicated resources like in Module Fuel System... uh-huh... So what if some of the resources are insufficient or even absent... reduce the possibility of a successful ignition? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh and the above design actually diminishes the need to check whether some fuel is hypergolic or not, simply because if we use the same type of fuel to ignite as to burn then it can be considered as hypergolic. Otherwise it\u0027s not and it needs specified types of fuel which means the ignition count will be automatically limited by the amount of that igniting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T02:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T02:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds right to me...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T15:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi all.\u003Cp\u003EAs we know the liquid engines in KSP can ignite for infinite times, which seems a bit making life too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I came to an idea, what if we only have limited times of ignitions for an engine, thus we will have to plan \u0026amp; execute our maneuvers more precisely and carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes this will make game much harder but hey that\u0027 a good challenge and that\u0027s kind of realistic too, especially because we also have quite good autopilot plugin like MechJeb. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;The game is too hard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Let\u0027s make an autopilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;The game is too easy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Let\u0027s make the game harder for our autopilot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy must you be like this? you were doing so well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut, yeah i do love the idea man thanks for the upload, i\u0027ll try it out tomorrow morning!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T17:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gas should be inert in both cases.
