I was worried that if I miscalculate one of these long BirdDog flights between distant islands, I could end up with one of the pilots having to ditch his plane in the drink. And I know from experience trying to fly BirdDod-derived SSTOs into orbit around Kerbin that a BirdDog will not survive a water landing intact, but the cockpit and pilot will survive (I know this because I had to ditch a few failed SSTO attempts into the ocean). So how do I rescue a pilot from far offshore? I was hoping that a VTOL could fill the bill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made a VTOL varient of a BirdDog. Double the fuel capacity for extra range...double the wings and canards for more lift to haul that extra mass around...stick a downward-facing jet engine in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I had problems getting the tanks to drain evenly (KSP did not agree with me on how it should be handling fuel flow), but I got that sorted out well enough. And then I practiced flying the thing, and I crashed it over and over and over again...although I crashed it less violently as time went on. Now I can semi-reliably liftoff with the thing, but I have much more difficulty in getting it to land where I want it (if safely at all)...since it takes me a lot of hovering, moving along slowly, to set the thing down, usually well past my aiming point. There are times during hovering or moving slowly around phase when the plane just pitches too far backward or forward and I can\u0027t hold it (my most common mode of crashing it now is when it pitches over onto its back and smashes in).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... I tried to land it in water (which I could do somewhat sloppily), but I could not get it to liftoff safely from water. It keeps wanting to slide off some direction or other, then parts catch in the water and flip it and smash it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I can get the good ol\u0027 BirdDog to land reliably in a relatively short space in a variety of terrain, and lift off after a short run in a variety of terrain, I can\u0027t see this VTOL as a general BirdDog replacement as yet (especially if I can\u0027t manage to use it for sea landing and takeoff).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been up to recently.
