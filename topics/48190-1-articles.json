It took me about three or four tries, but I finally got it--a round-trip with three kerbals, with a brief (and nearly tragic) landing to plant a flag and appreciate the scorched scenery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe expeditionary ship was a core engine (with command module and nano-lander), capable of about 12k delta-v. I launched it first, then docked two tugs to it, bumping the final vessel to over 17k delta-v. When all was said and done, the ship returned home with just about 2k delta-v remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all, my Moho adventures have been a sad and often-tragic tale of underestimation. Even my lander, with its 2500 delta-v, was just barely adequate for the landing, orbit, and subsequent rendezvous. But it all came together!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoto proof of my adventure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/kROyp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/kROyp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now I\u0027m curious: what\u0027s the minimum delta-v you\u0027ve spent on a round-trip to Moho, including landing? I feel like 15k is steep, but maybe that\u0027s just the price you pay to visit a rock so deep inside a gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
