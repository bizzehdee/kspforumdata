Useful, and non-cheaty. You still have to haul all the mass and fuel out- just you assemble it on-site.

Or, well, maybe see what they could discover about nuclear science in the ship\u0027s Science Lab module (from KSP Interstellar). With the new R\u0026amp;D system in KSP, the mod\u0027s science lab now produces science points that go towards tech nodes to upgrade the propulsion and energy systems it offers. Not quite sure how you best retrieve the Science points yet though, since the lab appears to be too large and heavy to easily land back on Kerbin. I\u0027ll have to see if I can transmit the data with the ship\u0027s antenna once I have a few science points saved up...

Instead of ruining Kerbal\u0027s environment launching rocket after rocket into orbit; only to design the launches for the boosters to fall back to the planet and be obliterated, and leave further up transfer stages littering the orbital planes until I decide to shoot them down with missiles (read \u0022Terminate\u0022 everything I don\u0027t need anymore to save FPS/lag)- how about if we recycle the metal frames of the rockets, and reuse some of the mass to eventually build new ships in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn keeping with this idea, my green-conscious Kerbals (hey, eco-friendliness is in their skin, right? Or maybe that\u0027s just a love of all the imaginary money they\u0027ll save by doing this...) have designed and built their first \u0022Scrapper Ship\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LgXC7fT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LgXC7fT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquipped with a front-mounted \u0022Large Recycling Bin\u0022 (I may have the part-name a bit off here) from the Extraplanetary Launchpads mod, and a Medium Parts Module from the Orbital Construction mod; this craft is capable of scooping up orbital debris at LOW speed (if you decide to design a ship like this, don\u0027t try it at high speed- either your recycling ship, or the debris, or both, will explode- depending on their relative mass values) and recycling them for a rather substantial portion of their Rocket Parts cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready, by recycling an abandoned design of the Nuclear Science Lab (the one I was working on earlier- with the Plasmodynamic thruster that ate through its fuel supply way too quickly to be useful- and a bunch of then worthless super-heavy battery banks to support it) I had left in orbit- after transferring the Kerbals to the newer version pictured above by EVA of course- I was able to recover approximately 2,885 Rocket Parts from the front section of the ship (it had a 2.5 meter reactor, a Science Lab, and a ton of battery banks- don\u0027t expect these kinds of returns from your average-sized rocket payload), three of its drop tanks, and I think a used sustainment stage I found lying around in orbit. I was also able to refuel its fuel tanks just as it ran out of fuel, from leftover fuel in the decommissioned Nuclear Laboratory (I had a KSP attachment port on the ship for refueling, and couple of winches on the Scrapper- as well as a couple extra attachment ports that I could have detached from the Scrapper and re-attached to any fuel tanks lacking a KSP port if I wanted...) before I scrapped the main section of the ship- but left the completely full fuel tanks in orbit so I could drain them later, rather than scrapping them then and losing all the fuel in the process...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other note on the Scrapper. I used TAC Fuel Balancer to launch it with an only 50% full Parts Module (5000/10000 Rocket Parts). This was absolutely essential to get it to work right. Otherwise, I would have needed a super-heavy lifter stage just to get it to orbit efficiently (a single completely full Medium Parts Module weighs *over 25 TONS*), and wouldn\u0027t have had any free space on the ship to store the ELP/OC mod Rocket Parts from the recycling operations...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next priority, of course, is to establish an orbital Parts-Warehouse/Spacedock, at which to store my Rocket Parts and construct new ships- since I already filled my Scrapper to more than 3/4th capacity with my recycling profits and the launch load parts- and otherwise I\u0027m just going to waste a lot of fuel just hauling all that weight around chasing the occasional orbital booster (even with a Fusion Nuclear Propulsion Engine from the Near-Future mod: which is basically just like a more compact stock nuclear engine with higher thrust and a slightly improved TWR). For a reminder, a full Medium Parts Module weighs in at a little over 25 tons- so I estimate I\u0027m already hauling around 19 tons of scrap metal (aka Rocket Parts) around in that tiny little ship...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T08:38:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 08:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T03:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you\u0027re making some very respectable progress.

Getting this huge thing off the ground in a single launch was probably one of the most difficult things I\u0027ve ever successfully accomplished in KSP this far...

Here\u0027s an image of the tug I designed for moving my earlier model of depot, by the way. Ignore the bottom part- which is just a lifter stage- the tug is the top part with the upside-down thrusters (the lander can is also constructed upside-down, so I just switch control to it after detaching from the lifter stage). She\u0027s a front-end tug- meaning she pulls cargo behind her rather than attempting to push it from behind- after a KAS winch lock is established, of course (otherwise, the cargo will go swinging widely, and the pair will become completely uncontrollable- possibly even disintegrating from the centripetal forces involved.

Then I eventually de-orbited her.) to scan the magnetic fields near Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus (a scientific instrument for scanning magnetic fields, that becomes available very late in the tech tree, was added by KSP Interstellar- truly a very interesting and useful mod).

Note that the whole contraption will do a flip at about 6000-8000 meters and nose-dive into the ground if the spacedock\u0027s tanks aren\u0027t drained first, and the solid rocket boosters aren\u0027t launched with only about 60% of their maximum fuel load (all with TAC Fuel Balancer. Note that the SRB\u0027s still caused the craft to begin a nose-flip towards the end of their burn time- just as they burn out and are decoupled.

Not content to leave them to their fates though, I had them jump out and thrust to some of my other orbital craft by EVA. One made it to the Scrapper ship (which has a crew capacity of 2, but launched with just one Kerbal) and the other made it to my Nuclear Science Lab (which also had an extra crew slot- as I only filled 3 of the 4 seats on launch.) It would have made for some awesome storytelling pics, so I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t think to Screenshot it. Here is the abandoned spaceplane though (my Scrapper ship will get around to recycling it for RocketParts eventually), and here are the ships they escaped to by EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G8Betl6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G8Betl6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sXMbNQR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sXMbNQR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA brief note on the design of the Nuclear Science Lab you see here, by the way. You might have noticed those are six 2-meter long LiquidFuel only tanks (from B9 Aerospace) on the nose end, spaced by mechanical decouplers (from NovaPunch2). That\u0027s because the NSL hosts a Nuclear Thermal Rocket Nozzle- which gets higher ISP (but lower thrust) from just expelling heated LiquidFuel (which is supposed to simulate superheated, originally liquid, hydrogen being expelled out a Thermal Rocket in real life) than from expelling an LFO mix- which I take it from my dabbling knowledge of rocket science is superheated separately and THEN mixed and allowed to combust. Since the ISP is very high, I broke the staging of the empty tanks into rather small fuel \u0022packets\u0022, as each tank represents a LOT of potential energy (the ISP is a little over 915)- so I would be wasting a lot more energy accelerating the empty tanks with fewer stages than with a lower-ISP rocket where it wouldn\u0027t be worth the extra decoupler mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Hp9sZB.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Hp9sZB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I present my Kerbals\u0027 next project. Shown here (below) is their design for an \u0022Atmospheric Scooper\u0022 ship, that is meant to repeatedly dip through a planet\u0027s upper atmosphere (by setting an atmospheric periapsis, but a sufficiently high apoapsis to safely return to orbit) to harvest any resources that might be there. In KSP Interstellar mod (which adds the necessary parts to do this), that means Oxidizer from the atmospheres of Kerbin and Laythe, and LiquidFuel from the atmosphere of Jool- the upper reaches of which are assumed to be essentially made out of Hydrogen, like with real-life Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe process isn\u0027t free, of course. Not only do you need to get the proper equipment in position, you also need a sufficiently powerful source of electricity to refine and store the IntakeAtmosphere resource, as it\u0027s being taken in. Even with the smaller, 1.25 meter variant of the refiner shown here (the thing that looks like a Radial Engine Body), it takes 6 MEGAWATTS of power to run the thing at full capacity (that\u0027s 6,000 ElectricCharge a second). Obviously, the small 1.25 meter nuclear reactor on my design here can\u0027t provide that kind of power- but my intention is to dip only through the highest reaches of the atmosphere each time, where the moderate power supply of the craft might have chance of keeping up with the refining module\u0027s power demands... If testing shows it\u0027s not enough, of course, I\u0027ll have to launch one with a more powerful reactor- or perhaps make use of my recently-discovered technology for microwave power transmission to save on weight (yet another feature of KSP Interstellar- though as I understand it the transmission losses are pretty high, and for some reason only collected solar power can be transmitted, rather than, say, power from a large orbital nuclear reactor.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hxTTQKD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hxTTQKD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5zGp0DG.png\u0022 alt=\u00225zGp0DG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point of the thing is to collect more Delta V (in the form of Oxidizer- and the fuel saved needing to lift it to orbit) than it expends getting into position and accelerating back up after each pass- at least as measured by the ISP\u0027s of the highly efficient nuclear thermal rocket nozzle the design is equipped with for its movement. So, since drag is proportional to weight times the weighted drag coefficients of your parts in KSP (unlike in real life, where shape matters more), unless I were to have FAR installed, which improves the aerodynamic model substantially- I\u0027ll need to save on weight with the design as much as possible to ensure it turns a net profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching oxidizer to LKO isn\u0027t all that hard, of course- but the point of the thing is to create a design that will work well enough for the higher gravity of Jool- which will make fuel collection more challenging (higher gravity means higher orbital velocities. Since drag increases exponentially with speed, but atmosphere scoop efficiencies don\u0027t quite keep up with the drag curve in terms of output relative to speed, this means relatively much higher drag losses when scooping from Jool than at Kerbin, and lower losses from Laythe- even with adjustments to scooping altitude based on speed). I aim for the highest Delta-V margins possible, otherwise scooping won\u0027t really be worthwhile- even around Jool- so I\u0027m really trying to save as much mass as possible on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, some of you might have noticed the design has no launch vehicle. This is as I do not plan to launch it from Kerbin\u0027s surface. Instead, I intend to construct it in-orbit with spare RocketParts from my scrapping operation, at my newly launched spacedock. Given the vessel\u0027s relatively low weight, I imagine the RocektParts count of this should be reasonable enough to accomplish. The greater challenge will actually be supplying the craft with Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6 in the resources tab) for its nuclear reactor once built (in the newer version of Orbital Construction I use, craft still need to be filled with all fuel and resources once built, or supplied with it from the constructing dock\u0027s stores during construction. Sorry, no free lunches here.) Since I drained the Space Dock\u0027s nuclear reactor down to a very low level of UF6 with TAC Fuel Balancer in order to get it to orbit in one piece, I\u0027m not sure I can spare much from the main reactor core for fueling the smaller ship\u0027s reactor. Of course, this is another reason for the smaller reactor core other than higher efficiency (lower-drag) atmospheric scooping- so that its reactor can last a reasonable while on the meager amount of UF6 I\u0027ll be able to provide it with- before needing to return to the space dock for re-enrichment/reprocessing (since the reactor heats its engines, without UF6 the scooper will be dead in the water, so to speak, no matter how much LiquidFuel and Oxidizer I have aboard.

Though, I\u0027ll probably try landing the probe on Minmus since my probe has enough fuel and TWR, and the low gravity and flat \u0022lakebeds\u0022 should make it fairly easy...) After that, I\u0027ve got some ambitious plans- including the redeployment of my Nuclear Science Lab to Mun or Minmus orbit, the movement of my old fuel depot to one of these orbits as well, the construction and testing of my atmospheric scooping ship, and the establishment of electrolysis operations on the Mun (KSP Interstellar allows you to electrolyze Regolith into Aluminum and Oxidizer, which can be used for aluminum-fueled rockets, or just for the Oxidizer...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, some of you might have noticed that my sensor probe has four solar panels deployed in some pictures, but only two in others. No, that wasn\u0027t because I was smashing the action group buttons by accident or somesuch- that was intentional, and because KSP Interstellar adds a heat-management mechanism to all your rockets. Essentially, many electrical systems (especially solar panels and nuclear reactors) produce excess heat when they run (simulated by the WasteHeat resource). If too much of this heat is allowed to accumulate, it can damage the equipment (KSP Interstellar simulates this by causing parts to explode if the heat levels climb high enough). In the vacuum of space, this heat doesn\u0027t convect away from the surface of a rocket, so it just tends to accumulate- and its management is a serious challenge for any space program. KSP Interstellar\u0027s simulation of this mechanism is just one way it makes the game a little more realistic- and balances out the utility of some of its parts a little with extra challenge in other parts of the game. I\u0027m really falling in love with that mod...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar allows you to manage this heat in a variety of ways- one of them is by use of heat radiator parts specifically designed to dissipate heat. Another is to simply control and limit its generation, since spacecraft still have a certain base level of heat dissipation that occurs even without specialized equipment to manage it- which in KSP is proportional to the vessel\u0027s mass (in real life, it is proportional to exposed surface area). Unlike in real life, vessels don\u0027t seem to give off more heat as they get hotter- so there isn\u0027t a realistic self-limiting effect on the temperatures a vessel can reach. So, as my probe\u0027s solar panels generate slightly more WasteHeat than my probe can dissipate, I was closing two to three of the solar panels whenever the batteries were fully charged and the power wasn\u0027t needed for a data transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T08:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T10:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, so my probe\u0027s visit to Minmus (and landing on it) turned out to be a little bumpy, to say the least.

For that matter, I usually have enough to stop it form tipping in the first place. However, in designing this probe I was a little sloppy- and the antennae isn\u0027t perfectly centered. As a result, that tiny bit of off-center gravity seemed to completely disable my probe\u0027s ability to tip upright (trust me, I\u0027ve tipped back much heavier vessels with the same probe core when they were perfectly balanced), probably thanks to the lovely quirks of the game\u0027s physics engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I was still able to get plenty of transmissions on the gravity from the surface, which is what I came for (previous missions had only collected Crew Reports, EVA reports, surface samples, temperature scans, and seismic data.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j77o7Rx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j77o7Rx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nUkROd8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nUkROd8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, simulations back at Mission Control (F5/F9 runs) revealed that there was a high chance of the probe exploding into a million tiny bits if I attempted to use its engines to help it right itself- but I was out of other options, so I tried it anyways.

However given the more than doubling of overall fuel mass- LFO mix burns in a 9:11 ration of LiquidFuel to Oxidizer- you get over 50% more overall Delta-V if you collect Oxidizer in the field, and use LFO instead) I decided it was time to develop a new line of fuel tankers, designed to haul pure LiquidFuel to orbit without all that heavy Oxidizer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy previous \u0022heavy\u0022 fuel tanker design was outdated, anyways- having been developed when the largest tanks I had available for its launch vehicle were half-height 3.75 meter tanks, and was only marginally upgraded since its development- to carry one full-length 3.75 meter tank instead of two half-length 3.75 meter tanks on the launch vehicle, after I developed the appropriate technology for full-length 3.75 meter tanks... I now had all the way up to Novapunch2\u0027s full-length 5 meter tanks available for my launch vehicles- so it was time to upgrade my heavy fuel tankers to versions with heavier payload stages, so I could carry more fuel to orbit in one launch, Oxidizer or not...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese were the two main designs I tried for my new model of heavy fuel tanker. A key design criteria for any heavy tanker line I develop is the ability to carry its fuel a very long-range and perform efficient capture burns around other planets if necessary: so I utilized nuclear engines for the upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne design featured 4 stock LV-N nuclear engines to carry the payload stage. It was designed to shed two of these once their fuel tanks were depleted- such as after a long capture burn from which no return trip was necessary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u2WSZML.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u2WSZML.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h2ErOb4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h2ErOb4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other design featured two of Near Future Mod\u0027s twin-fusion nuclear engines- which feature slightly better thrust (75 instead of 60 kN), a smaller profile, and a better TWR- though they are heavier than LV-N\u0027s. It had lower overall thrust- but I decided I didn\u0027t really need 240 kN of thrust for a vessel of that size: 150 kN would do, and would save weight (and extend range) in the process... It still had four radial 1.25 meter LFO tanks- just two of them were drop tanks with no engines attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DcPCmhe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DcPCmhe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth designs made orbit, though the LV-N design did have a bit of trouble with the engines extending too close to the ascent stage decoupler in earlier versions- leading to a pair of the engines detaching prematurely (before circularization) in one of the final test flights. LV-N\u0027s also have the annoying tendency for the engines to overheat- and if allowed to run full-thrust in the upper atmosphere for too long, all four of them would explode simultaneously- leaving my tanker without thrust. This exact problem doomed one of my earlier test flights of the tanker design. As a side-note, LV-N\u0027s tend to be able to run indefinitely in vacuum, if there are a couple parts nearby to act as heat-sinks. Their overheating only a truly dangerous issue in the atmosphere, since the game simulates friction heat to a limited degree- but does nothing to simulate convective cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI settled on the twin-fusion design because of its reduced engine weight and thus superior efficiency, and the slightly reduced (though still very dangerous) tendency of the engines to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also considered creating an even lower-thrust design with just two LV-N\u0027s, for reasons of efficiency: but abandoned that line of designs because of how efficiently it required my ascent to be in order for the two LV-N\u0027s to still be able to reach a stable orbit (if I started my gravity turn a little too late, or too early, I could easily find myself unable to reach orbit. The twin-fusion design also could experience this issue- but with 25% more upper-stage thrust, it required a significantly more inefficient ascent.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI performed one successful launch of the final version of each design before making my decision. So now, I have two rather large LiquidFuel tankers in low Kerbin orbit. They\u0027re not the largest designs I could build, mind you (if lag were less of an issue for me, I might utilize four much taller 5-meter stacks tied to the \u0022root\u0022 stack with XL girders and struts. I used to launch rockets like these with 2.5 meter stacks, back before I discovered the Novapunch2 pack: now I just use one 5-meter stack; which has the same effective cross-sectional area, less drag, and less lag) not even with a single 5-meter stack (the wonders of radial boosters for raising center of thrust: they allow much taller rockets). But the twin-fusion design I settled on is a very utilitarian and efficient design, with a VERY reasonable part-count once it dumps its boosters and ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my typical efficiency-minded fashion, though, I did try one trick during the circularization of my twin-fusion design that cost me rather severely... I noticed during my test launches that my fuel tankers were reaching their circularization burns with a little bit of fuel still left in the ascent stage (though not enough to bring it to orbit as well). So, rather than leaving the fusion engines idle while coasting to my circularization burn, and simply burning the ascent stage dry and decoupling it, I tried to run the fusion engines on a *LOW* power level (running the upper-stage engines, even though they were radial, tended to very quickly overheat and explode the lower stage\u0027s 5 to 3.75 meter adapter- something I noticed during one of my early test flights of the design). However, after noticing that I could safely run the engines at about 20-25% thrust without any parts exploding, I decided to step it up to 35% thrust or so... This turned out to be a huge mistake:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xfpin5u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xfpin5u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up overheating the large fuel tank of the 5 meter stage by doing this- and the resultant explosion cost me the approximately 830 LiquidFuel (and corresponding amount of Oxidizer) still left in the tank... Since the last bit of fuel in a stage always is worth the most Delta-V, I was a little bit peeved with this (conversely, the first bit is worth the least- so I would end up burning a lot more impulse in upper-stage fuel to make up for the loss). Nonetheless, the tanker still reached a stable orbit easily enough, and should still be able to deliver its LiquidFuel payload to the Orbital Spacedock with plenty of LFO mix to spare (which I intend to drain into the Orbital Spacedock\u0027s LFO tanks- and recycle the tanker with my Scrapper Ship- having no more use for it at the moment.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital rendezvous are horribly annoying to achieve, so I decided to save that for a later post (coming very soon)- but here\u0027s an image of my twin-fusion engine heavy fuel tanker in circular LKO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/phJPiL2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022phJPiL2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plans for the future involve landing a KSP-Interstellar Science Lab on the Mun\u0027s surface to electrolyze Regolith (mainly for the oxidizer to mix with my liquid fuel- which it produces in a 4:1 ratio with aluminum- which also happens to be the ratio the mod\u0027s aluminum-oxidizer engines burn it at.) I\u0027m not quite sure yet if I\u0027ll need to land an aluminum-oxide rocket or two on the surface to store the aluminum that is produces, or if I\u0027ll be able to run the electrolysis without anywhere to store the aluminum and just throw it out. Aluminum-Oxidizer engines are decent, and they perform better than other SolidFuel rockets- perhaps because they\u0027re a solid-liquid hybrid design- but they\u0027re still not nearly as efficient (ISP-wise) as liquid-fueled rockets (especially if I pump the LFO mix into one of my Nuclear Thermal Rocket Nozzles). What\u0027s more- and the main reason I don\u0027t wish to use them too much if I can avoid it- they only come in one, huge, unwieldy size (which I have a hard time fitting into the upper stages of my rockets). The mod hasn\u0027t even given them their own texture yet- their texture is basically just an upsized version of the ugly Route-10 boosters you start the game off with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, while I *CAN* haul a few (empty) Aluminum-Oxidizer engines out to the Mun from Kerbin\u0027s surface- or more likely due to their high dry-mass weight will just make a couple empty ones out of recycled scrap metal in low Kerbin orbit (which is probably a lot more realistic than, say, making a huge solar array out of recycled used rockets that were mostly metal and only had a few small solar panels on them...) I probably won\u0027t. If I do, the only reason will probably be that it turns out I need aluminum storage space for my elecrolysis operations on the Mun to work- and even then I\u0027ll probably just periodically dump the aluminum with TAC Fuel Balancer (if it allows me to), and divert the oxidizer to LFO rockets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also am going to test out that Atmospheric Scooping Ship pretty soon- some time after I refuel my Orbital Spacedock with enough LiquidFuel to fuel it, and deliver my Scrap Ship\u0027s load of RocketParts to it so I have something to build it out of... (And possibly, I might also send some additional Uranium Hexafluoride in a small throwaway reactor, since this is the only way to transport it. It turns out the Science Lab uses an \u0022always active\u0022 flag to produce its gradual trickle of Science Points when set to research-mode, even when it is not the \u0022Focus\u0022. However this also means it consumes UF6 to fuel its reactor even when not actively loaded as well. I\u0027ve already had to reprocess the spacedock\u0027s UF6 supply once- since thanks to time-warping with my SensorSat from a couple posts back, it\u0027s been nearly two in-game months since I launched the thing with a less than 5% uranium load. Luckily, it appears the reprocessing is close to 100% efficient or actually is 100% efficient, because I didn\u0027t notice any significant reduction in my total UF6 levels compared to launch after the reprocessing was complete...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, but not least, here are a couple nice pictures of my Mun Rover and my Eve Probe (when landed on Gilly) viewing their respective sunsets I took a while back and uploaded on one of my other threads.

I certainly do. Well it turns out it has a fuel routing problem- apparently one of the pieces in the stack between the liquid fuel tanks (the two that AREN\u0027T separated by decouplers from the rest of the ship) and the 3.75 meter Thermal Rocket Nozzle (the HUGE engine at the bottom) isn\u0027t fuel-crossfeed capable. So, after going through all the effort to launch that thing into orbit over Kerbin, it looks like my plans of sending it to Jool are at an end. Of course, I only discovered this AFTER I started a burn towards the Mun for a gravity assist towards Jool, and had burned out and decoupled what was left of the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I F5/F9\u0027s (I mean, if this was for real, somebody would have noticed something like that the engineers forgot to run fuel pipes to the main engine, right?), and instead docked the Scrapper Ship- which was running low on fuel by the time it got to that orbit (which had a lot of other debris floating it it anyways) with it and drained msot of the remaining LFO mix to fill all its fuel tanks. Here it is docked with the Nuclear Science Lab via KAS winch (hard to see the fuel/winch line against the dark of space, sorry about that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wJMMTbf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wJMMTbf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I burned out what was left of the ascent stage to bring the Nuclear Science Lab to a little bit of a higher orbit (it produced more Science the further it is away from Kerbin- and I get also get a lot less lag at higher orbits), decoupled it, and then recycled that stage with my Scrapper Ship- completely filling what was left of its storage space for RocketParts, and probably wasting a good bit of of the value of the ascent stage as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it looks like maybe I should have built a Scrapper Ship with more storage capacity for rocket parts- currently it can only hold 25 tons of them, and it takes so much fuel to bring it back to the Orbital Spacedock that I still haven\u0027t gotten around to it yet... I\u0027ll probably be upgrading the Orbital Spacedock to a bigger, better version with a lower part count anyways (and no giant Thermal Rocket Nozzle- which I built to help get it to orbit making use of the reactor/generator I already had included, thinking the Science Lab would only run on a Nuclear Reactor. Turns out I was wrong about that- it can at the very least run on a Microwave Beamed Power Receiver as well, if the resource it consumes is Megajoules, and maybe even just on a huge solar array if it is capable of running on enough ElectricCharge- it needs 5 Megajoules a second to run research at its full trickle- which equates to 5,000 ElectricCharge per second.) and so maybe I could haul the existing Orbital Spacedock to a higher, less laggy orbit after the new one is constructed (or, just recycle the thing- I don\u0027t need too many flights in progress lagging down my computer).

Well for those of you who didn\u0027t play SimCity2000 and 3000 when you were a kid until your face turned blue, a Microwave Power system is one that collects solar energy in-orbit with a gigantic solar array, like the one I built there (makes sense so far, right?) and then beams the power to a target in the form of a phased beam of microwave energy- where it is converted back into electrical energy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you wondering what that had to do with SimCity, in the 2000/3000 versions of the game, Microwave Power was one of the more advanced options for powering your city- featuring a lack of any pollution production, and much higher energy density than conventional solar power on the ground- but also a MUCH higher financial cost...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big, gridiron-looking thing on the top of the image here is the Microwave Beamed Power Transmitter- it\u0027s what allows that solar energy to get wherever I need it (with some not-insignificant transmission losses, of course). The smaller looking thing on the bottom is just a Yawmaster Service Module (it\u0027s the lightest enclosed way to hold a single Kerbal in-orbit, in terms of Dry Mass; and it also features a bit of room for LFO mix, Monopropellant, and ElectircCharge storage)- and is mostly just for the electrical storage and roleplaying purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow why would I go through all the trouble of building such a thing out of my hard-earned (or rather, hauled) RocketParts, you might ask? Well, remember that spaceplane I showed you a teaser of before:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u2971ah.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u2971ah.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose four blue-colored engines at the back are VASMIR Plasma Thrusters. They take ArgonGas, and a lot of ElectricCharge, and combine them for a very high ISP (over 6400) and modest thrust of 9.6 kN each. I designed my spaceplane (which I am *still* simply calling \u0022Advanced Spaceplane\u0022- somebody propose a better name for it before I just name it after another type of bird; like I did the Eagle, the Egret, and in a previous stock-only save the \u0022Falcon\u0027s Nest\u0022 and \u0022Rooster\u0027s Nest\u0022- which were just glamorized fuel depots with a bit of roleplaying as space stations.) to use four of them (at 38.4 kN of thrust) to escape Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally, I\u0027d use something more powerful for a spaceplane- like LFO mix or at least LiquidFuel on a Thermal Rocket Nozzle- but this one is designed to fly on Duna, and so needs to be as light as possible to minimize wingload. An ArgonGas propellant system was one of the lightest-weight options: due mostly to the very high ISP ratings of VASMIR Plasma Thrusters, and the very low Dry Mass of ArgonGas fuel tanks (actually several times lighter than a 2.5 meter fuselage when empty, and only marginally heavier by length when full of ArgonGas). The thrusters were kind of heavy, of course- weighing in at a solid 1 ton each- but it was worth it considering the weight I saved vs. hauling around at least 2 or 3 tons of LFO mix. The total increase in the mass of the plane, vs. using structural fuselages (the thermal turbojet engines, while they require rather heavy reactors, use no fuel) was about 5.4 tons. Not bad for a system that not only gets the plane to orbit, but carries enough impulse to bring it all the way to Duna without a single refueling! (if I wanted to cut down weight further, I could use a partial load of ArgonGas- and reduce the mass increase to only about 4.4-4.2 tons while still having enough to make orbit, the full-load weight of ArgonGas being a little over 2.09 tons. The plane uses half its ArgonGas just getting to orbit.) One of the other advantages of the system was the extremely low cost of refueling- since ArgonGas gets such high ISP\u0027s, I wouldn\u0027t need to haul nearly as much of it out to Duna for a refueling trip if, say, I was to use the plane for repeated trips to Ike and back to support a colony there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the Advanced Spaceplane doesn\u0027t have quite enough electrical generation capacity and storage to make orbit as was (1 ton of the 5.4 tons extra mass, besides the 2 tons of Argon and 4 tons of thrusters, minus about 1.6 tons of weight saved in fuselages; was the inclusion of two 0.5 ton electric generators on the plane- which produce power from the nuclear reactors when they\u0027re not being fully used to power the thermal turbojets, and when \u0022spun-up\u0022 on the runway before liftoff, can store an immense amount of electricity in the form of stored mechanical energy.) So, I decided rather than carrying a bunch of heavy solar panels on the plane, or a huge weight in batteries, or switching to a heavier LFO-based propulsion system; I\u0027d put the extra needed electrical generation capacity in orbit and just beam it down to the spaceplane as it attempts to escape the atmosphere (it still needs a receiver dish for this though). This should also have immense utility with any other craft I build that relies even partially on electric power systems- ranging from electric propeller aircraft (these I have conventionally had to power by making them carry their own solar panels- greatly increasing their wingload and reducing their already low TWR, lowering their altitude ceiling as a result) to VASMIR-lifted light rockets (VASMIR plasma thrusters till get a decent ISP in-atmosphere). In fact, the possibilities for use of the technology are nearly endless!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(An aside for those who are curious: thermal generators usually store such mechanical energy in \u0022flywheels\u0022- disc\u0027s that spin rapidly in a vacuum chambe, often on magnetic ultra-low-friction bearings- and the kinds of energy storage density you can achieve with this technology immensely exceed batteries- leading one company in my home state of Massachusetts to pioneer their use as energy storage for \u0022smoothing\u0022 the electrical grid at a much lower cost than any existing methods. The company is called \u0022Beacon Power\u0022, and I highly recommend looking it up...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways... Writing about all this has given me an idea on how I might save even more weight on my spaceplane (the NearFuture mod also introduces a couple other types of argon-propellant thrusters besides the VASMIR ones. One of them achieves a slightly greater thrust than the VASMIR of 9.7 kN, and weighs less than half as much- though at the cost of a huge reduction in ISP, and increased electrical power requirements.) So, if this design doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027m going to have to try something like that- though, while the spaceplane is currently capable of escaping Duna\u0027s atmosphere without the assistance of a Microwave Power Station in orbit nearby (its generators store enough energy to escape the lesser gravity and shorter atmosphere), it wouldn\u0027t be able to if I used a more power-hungry design: so I\u0027d have to think carefully about that or whether I should just try and go with LFO mix after all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eZeESUN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eZeESUN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-17T02:17:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2013 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T00:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working some more on my SSTDABK spaceplane.

I also stretched the fuselage quite a bit longer with more argon tanks, added a lot more wing area, and reduced the crew capacity from 7 to 5. The idea is to minimize weight, maximize lift relative to mass, and give the thing a decent enough range to hopefully make it require fewer refueling stops... I\u0027m having some stability problems with the longer variants, though (they like to tip nose-up if my angle of attack goes too high)- so I haven\u0027t managed to get one to orbit yet...

My computer has lagged KSP since the very start (my very first rockets were over-engineered, and launched at like 2 FPS)- if anything, it\u0027s gotten better over time- though that may have to do with my figuring out many tricks to cut down on extraneous CPU usage. This is unlike, say, Minecraft- where I found my computer just kept getting slower and slower at it the more I played it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I do have one additional short report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got to giving my atmospheric scooping ship a try... (I can easily run it in the background while I got and do other things)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere was the model I introduced earlier, minus the 2.5 meter ASAS, and with an OKTO2 probe core just below the atmo scoop for the root part- since it\u0027s the lowest-mass (and thus most fuel-efficient) way to control a rocket...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uurt51k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uurt51k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had several major issues though. First of all, it was gathering WasteHeat at an obscene rate, even when the Atmospheric Scoop wasn\u0027t running (and faster when it was)... After one or two atmosphere passes, I figured if I did this for too long, the whole thing would probably end up exploding or the reactor going into emergency shutdown (leaving the ship dead in the water, and possibly without control in an unstable orbit). Second, while the Atmosphere Scoop consumed electrical power at a breathtaking rate- therefore confirming that it was definitely working (and apparently, power consumption was unrelated to rate of Oxidizer production)- it produced Oxidizer at an amazingly slow rate. After two passes at 64000 meters, I has just barely accumulated .03 Oxidizer, and lost more Delta-V than that in terms of lost Apoapsis height due to atmospheric drag...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it became clear to me, I was going to have to let the thing drag down to lower passes through the atmosphere (where speed would be lower, reducing the exponential effects of drag, and air pressure would be higher...) The atmosphere scoop also showed no signs of saturation (I was accumulating no excess IntakeAtm)- so I knew it could keep up with lower atmospheric passes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I reverted, and redesigned the thing to take the lessons learned and its new, lower-dipping operational profile into account... I added several more winglets (using my personal favorites- Heavy Control Winglets form B9 Aerospace- as they offer both control authority and the best lift:mass ratio of any aerodynamic surface in the [modded] game). I also switched the tiny radial radiator for a bigger inline one (since the largest amount of heat is produced while in-atmosphere- which is where they work best, and where the deployable sort will snap off if drag becomes too high). Here is the new, redesigned Atmospheric Scooping Ship, exiting an initial pass (it takes less Delta-V to set periapsis to just inside the atmosphere and let drag do the rest of the work in gradually lowering both Periapsis and Apoapsis, than to perform burns going deeper in)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/80ZKGT7.png\u0022 alt=\u002280ZKGT7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, this thing can turn a profit. I calculated it took about 4 liquid fuel and 5 oxidizer to get into position with its highly efficient Thermal Rocket Nozzle engine- so it needs to produce at least 13 oxidizer just to make that up before it\u0027s so low it needs a burn to keep it from crashing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this doesn\u0027t work (can\u0027t turn a substantial Delta-V profit), then the only real use for atmo scoops may be for ships that are intended to touch down eventually on Laythe, possibly for collecting Liquidfuel from Jool\u0027s atmosphere due to its higher value; and most of all, for bases on the surface of Laythe (stationary atmo scoops still work...) or for ships that require no fuel to maintain altitude (such as balloon-airships, for which I don\u0027t have a mod installed; for electric planes or helicopters; and most of all, for thermal turbojets- provided their intakes can still reasonably take in enough atmosphere to run both the atmo scoop and their engines without super intake-spamming...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. Thorough testing revealed that by the time the thing had even made up the Delta- needed to send it to 54,000 meters into the atmosphere (after a quicksave-load, I sent it a bit lower- since last time the reactor shut down due to overheating long before the thing could get anywhere near low enough to convect away heat at the rate it was generating it), it was already at under 20,000 meters in altitude (drag pulled the thing deeper and deeper in). Therefore, there\u0027s absolutely no way this technology is going to be viable except on electric propeller, balloon, and thermal turbojet aircraft; and ground installations- and only really useful on Laythe and possibly Jool... Or on a constructed launchpad to complement hauled LiquidFuel (using Extraplanetary Launchpads\u0027 deployable launchpads) on top of one of Kerbin\u0027s highest mountains...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did discover by flipping through the atmosphere scoop\u0027s settings, however, that it also has the ability to collect Argon (KSP Interstellar\u0027s Argon- not NearFuture mod\u0027s ArgonGas) at an insanely slow rate (0.1% of atmospheric composition on Kerbin) and maybe also deuterium (which showed up as 0.0% on Kerbin- but might be more elsewhere) and Hydrogen (i.e. LiquidFuel- also 0.0% on Kerbin) in atmospheres other than Kerbin. Prudence would direct testing on ground installations on Laythe and Eve- but really, I have no desire to go to Eve (it lags my computer terribly)- so I\u0027ll only eventually be testing it on the ground on Laythe and *maybe* with escape-capable (read: fusion engine-carrying) electric propeller aircraft on Jool...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027ll be going to the Mun for oxidizer...
