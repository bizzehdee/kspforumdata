I\u0027ve found some ways to reduce the ability to cheat. One being if you design a ship, boat, plane or vehicle please send the craft file to either Fleet or myself. If they are classified we will not post them or give them out or use them to our advantage. This will benefit all when it comes to skirmishes if they break out trust me. Also an allotted time limit on how long someone has to say they are done with there turn will help prevent people from just reloading persist files and trying again, or at least trying as many times as they want. This time will be mentioned in the rules and will depend on they type of battle. Combat will not be the only way to earn point however and there will be plenty for those more passive players to compete in other ways. So the most aggressive Player may not necessarily be the one with the most points. There will be a certain number of launches a play can make per day so they will have to plan these things in advance. (Just like there are only a limited number of launch windows in real life). This will only affect space based game mechanics when you get to that. There will be no standardized models that each player is forced to use so don\u0027t worry about having no creative license with your designs. There will however be a set of parameters that a vehicle type should follow. Foe example. (A light tank is classified as having no more than 50 parts and weighs no more than 8 tons.) that is just an example.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould the UKSC be able to work with Arcadia Armoury in the Central Mountain Lands?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Fleet Master","CreatedById":78352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T00:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course Comrade \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I\u0027m guessing I\u0027ll take ground and air duties and you\u0027ll get space?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FallingIntoBlack","CreatedById":63836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is said (no one is certain that it\u0027s true) that several years ago, a significant number of Erusean forces \u0022defected\u0022 from the Erusean army.
