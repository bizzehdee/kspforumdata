The bridge would be constructed from stock parts somewhat like my [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130227-Kerbahashi-Maru-Command-Bridge-Simulator\u0022]Kerbahashi Maru Command Bridge Simulator[/URL], and the crew would sit in command chairs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/sfVjrT1.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course the Kerbahashi Maru test took place on Kerbin, and with Texture Replacer installed the crew could relax a bit, wear their IVA suits and remove their helmets. If I tried to do the same thing in space they\u0026#39;d be forced to wear EVA suits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnless....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is where you wonderful clever modders come in :) I was thinking that since the game recognizes whether or not a part is in a cargo bay, it might be possible to make the game consider a part that\u0026#39;s in a bay to be in an oxygen atmosphere, thus signaling Texture Replacer to allow the helmet to come off. (or otherwise mod TR to let the helmets come off inside the bay) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternative approach would be a button for Texture Replacer that allows you to switch to IVA suit/no helmet anywhere. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternate and inferior approach would be a mod that makes the game consider a Kerbal in a command chair to be \u0026#39;inside\u0026#39;. This doesn\u0026#39;t work as well for me, as then anyone who leaves his or her bridge seat would go to EVA suit immediately even though in-story they\u0026#39;re still \u0026#39;inside\u0026#39;.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course there are plenty of clever people out there who will maybe come up with a smarter way to do this than I ever could--I think you get the idea :) Thanks folks for considering this, helper(s) will get a shoutout on my comic thread and most likely some measure of rep-bombing :)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T03:05:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T13:56:09Z","Content":"\nInteresting! :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo clue on a solution though.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahim","CreatedById":78568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T16:30:46Z","Content":"\nThere\u0026#39;s a way.
