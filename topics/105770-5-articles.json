I\u0027d never have the patience to discover such a route for myself. Though, it\u0027s a really slow path in real-time, at least for me. Around 3-4 hours it has taken to reach Jool, each of the 3 times I\u0027ve used it. Maybe I lack the right tools or skill to do it faster. Most of the time is spent in the MJ Node Editor, trying to find those encounters, and then trying to find them again, when the first burn was too inaccurate.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how much dV will be left after ascent from Laythe. In my previous attempt with the smaller M-5 Space Hustler, it cost 1.2 km/s of the 2.6 km/s I landed with. If it costs the same for this one, I\u0027ll have ~1.9 km/s dV left. Not sure if I can do anything with that other than heading back to Kerbin.\n\nI\u0027ll be sure to take pics when I go flying in the Nano Jet. I did [circumnavigate Kerbin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=2087022#post2087022) to test it\u0027s range before departing for Laythe.\n\nNot sure when I\u0027ll have time to continue the journey, though.

Yeah I haven\u0027t had too many issues with the wings overheating, although they are usually the first things to show temperature indicators. (well apart from my first attempt at aerocapture at Laythe doing 3700m/sec... it was a very short attempt ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ). I did make sure they had fuel in them to help soak up some of the heat, though.. \n\nThe only thing to watch for is that as the wings are mounted close to the CoM some of the control surfaces are reversed on the pitch axis. (on that design the innermost control surfaces work ok, but all of the outermost ones are reversed (and of course, \u0022invert\u0022 only works on deployment, not the pitch axis...)). Also as the control surfaces are close to the pitch axis, they don\u0027t have much effect anyway.\n\nI worked around the issue by disabling and inverting 2 of the control surfaces, and dedicating the other 2 to roll control, and binding the 2 disabled control surfaces to an action group. That way I could \u0022trim\u0022 the aircraft for takeoff and low-speed flight with heavy fuel loads. - you can see them active on image number 3. It also comes in handy if you want to pitch the nose up for re-entry) - The inner most control surfaces were used for pitch control only. The only other way of dealing with the issue is to move the wings back further behind the CoM and use canards - but then it isn\u0027t a flying wing anymore...\n\nHmmm.

Getting the orbital inclination at launch just right to avoid a plane correction later was also too much of a bother for me, so I ended up losing another 70m/s or so doing that right after leaving Kerbin orbit. The rest was just tiny little corrections this way and that to get each approach just right. It\u0027s hard for me to imagine how one could actually do a perfect launch into this route manually, as the stock interface just doesn\u0027t have the resolution.
