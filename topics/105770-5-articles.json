It also comes in handy if you want to pitch the nose up for re-entry) - The inner most control surfaces were used for pitch control only.

The problem is that a Jool-Eve-Kerbin route will have you hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere faster than you would with just a direct Jool-Kerbin flight. However if you are willing to go Jool-Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin then there is a route that will allow you to arrive at Kerbin at less than the Jool-Kerbin value (about 2000m/s at 70km) about half the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThanks, PLAD.\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had time to try the return yet, so the UT date is still Year 9, Day 229, 2h, 54m according to the load screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T00:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoh!

Congrats to everyone who\u0027s made it already. I\u0027ve managed to get a fleet of 4 SSTO12s to Jool encounter trajectories using the famous PLAD K-E-K-K-J route.

So far the best I\u0027ve gotten it to LKO with is 4.8km/s dV, which is obviously not record territory but nonetheless respectable. The best I\u0027ve done so far for the Jool multi-assist route is 1,231 dV all told, with all flying done manually. It\u0027s so hard to set up all the other parts that I never managed to work in a Munar assist, so my Eve ejection burns were around 1060 dV. Getting the orbital inclination at launch just right to avoid a plane correction later was also too much of a bother for me, so I ended up losing another 70m/s or so doing that right after leaving Kerbin orbit. The rest was just tiny little corrections this way and that to get each approach just right. It\u0027s hard for me to imagine how one could actually do a perfect launch into this route manually, as the stock interface just doesn\u0027t have the resolution. I did so many burns that were under 1m/s. anyway, I will post the whole story once I get finished.
