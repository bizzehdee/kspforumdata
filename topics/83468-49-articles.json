Result : all parts refuse to attach to it, surface or node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Magnet, winch operates it ok.

An intermediate structural part separates port from IR part to avoid problems. Suffers from same docking glitch and same scene-rerload solution applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Using Expando Tube from MKS. Animates lengthwise to retract/expand. Having a predefined \u0022static\u0022 (i don\u0027t know how to call it properly) animation docking is not bugging it. It is designed for these tasks. In vertical arrangement however it goes through target docking port, or in case of stock port senior, it can also dock misaligned, which just looks odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize : Does KAS even provide unmanned vehicle docking via winches ?

If you don\u0027t want to eva. Docking with IR usually works jus fine for me. The trick I found (for those minecraft junkies out there) treat IR parts like repeaters. Treat them as directional I have an IR test arm with 3 attachments around it. Using RKE docking ports. One is a winch one is a dextre attachment like the one on the ISS. And finally a mining drone with a drill. I can swap between all three without reloading the scene. The trick there is time delay between disconnect and connecting to the end of the arm. Use the mange at a distance to float the attachment to the arm after disconnecting from its previous docking port. You want there to be a 2-3 second delay from disconnect to attachment. And 9 times out of 10 it works. I\u0027ll try and make a video this weekend to show what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
