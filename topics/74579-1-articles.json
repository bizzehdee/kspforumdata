Using MM would change all of those parts. For an example, suppose you had 2 hitchhiker crew capsules end to end on a vessel and you wanted one of them to be the control pod. My idea is to have a radially attached part that you attach to one of the Hitchhikers and gives it ModuleCommand. Would this require custom plugin?
