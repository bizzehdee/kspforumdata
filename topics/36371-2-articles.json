The Squad engines have their built-in interstages, of course, but I don\u0027t know of any third-party engines that have them. Not even the KW ones. So to satisfy my completely bonkers OCD tendencies, I either have to use those hollow interstage decouplers that were all the rage back in the day, or use only Squad models for upper-stage engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s kind of hard to imagine how a procedural one would work, exactly. The most naive idea would be to put a thin ring-shaped part on top of the lower stage that would act like a stack separator, then put another similar part between the upper-stage engine and the tank above it, then have the surface part or whatever construct an interstage between the two parts. If the two parts have the same diameter, you get a cylinder. If not, you get a frustum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut working out the details of that strikes me as very tricky. It\u0027d be a fantastic addition to the game, for me, but it sounds like a lot to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"e-dog","CreatedById":73796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T02:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mushroomman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mushroomman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKW rocketry fairings, AIES fairings, and (I think) NP fairings all work with FAR.\u003Cp\u003EToo bad this doesn\u0027t work with FAR yet.
