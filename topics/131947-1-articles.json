The files for the existing work done look pretty great. (You can find them below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/32332-caterpillar-tracks-now-open-source-all-files-open-to-public/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am by no means a modder but I would love if someone would resurrect this mod. It would bring a great new dynamic to the game. I have several ideas for the mod myself, including the ability to launch vessels on the crawler just outside the VAB so a short drive would be needed down the crawlerway to the launchpad. If anyone is interested in continuing work on this mod I for one would be very pleased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T14:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast iteration is this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/mod/58/Kerbal_Foundries_Wheels_and_Repulsors_ALPHA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://beta.kerbalstuff.com/mod/58/Kerbal_Foundries_Wheels_and_Repulsors_ALPHA\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChristopherJon","CreatedById":136135,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T15:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I am aware of this mod, I\u0027m just hoping someone will implement the stockalike crawler and tracks pictured here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg height=\u0022522\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.gyazo.com/4aa1adc3214a101d6edfb05d5e94bfb8.png\u0022 style=\u0022margin-top:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022935\u0022 alt=\u00224aa1adc3214a101d6edfb05d5e94bfb8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rushligh","CreatedById":31038,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T07:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou could make that with Kerbal Foundries, B9, Infernal robotics, and Buffalo Base/vehicle pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
