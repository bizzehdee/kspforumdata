The idea is that since flags came out, we\u0027re going to send the same Kerbal to every planet except Eve and Jool to plant one. Eve and Jool get satellites placed by that same Kerbal. It\u0027s not a public challenge, just a little sport between friends to see how our designs differ. The rules are, if you lose your Kerbal, you have to plant a flag in memorial, return to Kerbin, then continue the tour with a second Kerbal. If you get stranded, you just have to send help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight off the bat I realized I am the Bill to his Jeb. While I\u0027m using as much math as I understand to plan my builds, he\u0027s strapping on MOAR BOOSTERS to get out there. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t do much math on my Minmus and Mun lander. It\u0027s currently stranded in Mun orbit. I\u0027m sending a beefier version though that (with a few modular assists like parachutes for Laythe) should be capable of landing on and returning to orbit from every body in the system except Eve, Jool (of course) and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where I\u0027m logging my progress: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/q4YZc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/q4YZc\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis album: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/xZciQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/xZciQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor you who have completed or attempted a grand tour like this, what advice would you give? I must admit, this will be my first time visiting many of the planets. Despite playing for over a year, I\u0027ve never been to Moho, Eeloo or any of Jool\u0027s moons. I\u0027m most anxious about the DeltaV to reach Moho and the ascent from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T17:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EIts possible to take off from Eve and return to Kerbin so you should add it to the list of targets.

For Tylo make a mini lander with lots of fuel (watch Manley\u0027s Tylo or bust videos), Tylo is the gravity equivalent of Kerbin second is Vall with no atmosphere and lastly Laythe. For the Jool system i would send refueling ships at each planet so i could land on all the planets in one ship.
