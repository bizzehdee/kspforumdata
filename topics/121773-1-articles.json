The rotor section is pitched up about 15 degrees The only wings on the craft were the rotor arms, plus a vertical stabiliser at the back. Whether the design is fundamentally flawed or my engineering ability failed me, the whole rotor assembly exploded and flew away as soon as I separated the stage. But it\u0027s what happened next that struck me as interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my frustration, I decided to throw the rest of the craft down the runway. And... it took off. And flew.
