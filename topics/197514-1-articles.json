I want to land it, then drive it around to dock with the core. I put the wheels on in mirror symmetry in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, but when I take it for a test drive, the wheels turn in opposite directions. I.e., when I want to go left, the wheels on the right side turn to the left the way they should, but the wheels on the left side turn to the right. So the beast ends up going nowhere.
