I am trying to dock to a very simple spacecraft, but it is super hard because it keeps randomly rotating without any cause that I can determine. The target ship consists of just a few parts: a clamp-o-tron Jr., a mk1 command pod (no occupant), two parachutes symmetrically mounted, a small fuel tank, and a spark engine. Whenever I accelerate time warp, the rotation stops, of course, but as soon as I return to x1 speed the ship starts spinning in some random direction at perhaps one rotation per 15 seconds, which makes docking to it very very difficult as the alignment of the docking port is constantly changing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any thoughts as to what might be causing this?
