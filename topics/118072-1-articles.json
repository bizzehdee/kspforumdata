I want to take all the original four kerbals on a mission because OCD, but my current selection of mod and stock parts don\u0027t really have a way of doing things that works for my lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my brainstorming designs either are some combination of the below\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A bit on the heavy side 2) Don\u0027t have a decent form factor (too long and prone to tipping over, just plain ugly etc) 3) Split my kerbals up into unpleasing groups (ie not 2 or 4, although I\u0027d rather not split at all if I can help it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer a 2.5 form factor, but it\u0027s really not essential I suppose \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short I\u0027m hoping there\u0027s a mod somewhere that I\u0027ve missed that has a decent 4-person pod.

Taurus HCV is a wonderful pack that has a large capacity cockpit. Edit the CFG to rescale it to the right size and then turn down the number of kerbals it can fit.
