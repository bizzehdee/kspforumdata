I want to take all the original four kerbals on a mission because OCD, but my current selection of mod and stock parts don\u0027t really have a way of doing things that works for my lander.\n\nAll my brainstorming designs either are some combination of the below\n\n1) A bit on the heavy side 2) Don\u0027t have a decent form factor (too long and prone to tipping over, just plain ugly etc) 3) Split my kerbals up into unpleasing groups (ie not 2 or 4, although I\u0027d rather not split at all if I can help it)\n\nI\u0027d prefer a 2.5 form factor, but it\u0027s really not essential I suppose ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo in short I\u0027m hoping there\u0027s a mod somewhere that I\u0027ve missed that has a decent 4-person pod. Thank you anyone who can point me in the right direction ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T21:39:41Z","Content":"There are some that hold 6 that you can cut back to 4 ?\n\nEDIT- You can edit the cfg for the pod you want to hold 4 but might bug if you change view to a kerbal that don\u0027t have one."},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T21:44:23Z","Content":"The best that I would recommend is what MeCripp said. Taurus HCV is a wonderful pack that has a large capacity cockpit. Edit the CFG to rescale it to the right size and then turn down the number of kerbals it can fit. I am sure that there are other high capacity capsules out there, but I like good ole Taurus"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:13:45Z","Content":"Necrobone made one.
