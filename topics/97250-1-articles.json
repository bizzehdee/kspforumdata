The thread was up for a maximum of 16 hours before your subsequent post saying this is \u0022cold forum\u0022. That isn\u0027t a lot of time, especially when there are a \u003Cstrong\u003Eton\u003C/strong\u003E of other mods on this subforum all pertaining to different things and all having different levels of popularity. Combine that with the time of day when it was posted; it may of had a bit less traffic (ergo less people to see your post). On top of those two things, this is an add-on to another mod. That means that this is only really going to be relevant to the people that have the dependency installed and actively use it to get any benefit from this part. All in all the amount of people that are gonna see this is already determined to be lower than if this was a standalone mod and even if someone does see the post and download the part, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that they\u0027re gonna post something about it either. Another thing that may turn people off is that you openly admit that the part\u0027s mass, volume, and cost don\u0027t make much sense either.

Tell me again before I continue, why should I even consider using a part that is so poorly made that you can\u0027t even give it the proper mass, volume, or cost?

Maybe that isn\u0027t accurate in the real world but it should be good enough for ksp.. If you make the same approximation for maximum fuel content then maybe you\u0027re not being accurate. But seriously I wouldn\u0027t care... It\u0027d be a cosmetic difference. You\u0027re still paying for the fuel on a mass per unit basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DracovaXIV","CreatedById":97121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T22:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod has tremendous potential, I\u0027ll definitely keep my eye on it.
