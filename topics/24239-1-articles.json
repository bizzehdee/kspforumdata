They are called turbopumps, and all rockets that aren\u0027t pressure-fed have them. The issue are the fuel lines (and what happens if they leak), and the momentum that moving that much fuel that fast creates IRL. No asparagus in the real world, the configurations have to be symmetrical so the forces cancel each other out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to orbital fuel transfer, it\u0027s only been done with storables, but there are a couple of tests/ideas planned to make cryogenic fuel transfer and storage work. For deep space, my personal favourite is Methane/LOX: similar moderate temperature, low boiloff rate, amazing isp, and ISRU potential in pretty much anywhere, especially Mars and asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Transport, and it\u0027s a single stage vehicle that goes on top of a Falcon heavy, and can land on Mars (half aerobrake/half propulsively) with enough payload to carry a ISRU plant, refuel there, and then make it back to Earth throwing nothing away. Mars and back for a few hundred million dollars a flight. Redundancy can be achieved by launching several on each window, in case you are worried about safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload margins are tight for that (~5km/s for MTI\u002BMars capture\u002BTerminal braking means mass ratio around 4, which means 13.25mT payload\u002Brocket, essentially the same weight class as Dragon), but then again, they might have in mind an even bigger rocket (~100mT) to launch it, Musk has also hinted that. The thing I\u0027m sure of is, it could do a lunar mission by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Every action has a reaction. So, if you move fuel from one side of the ship to the other, you are moving the mass, therefore, the ship would react and move into the opposite way. Imagine you were on a small boat and you tried to jump to another boat, the boat you are jumping from would move back and most likely, if you have E in physics, you would splash in water in between the boats as a punishment. Now what you see in KSP would be as if the boat was nailed in stone, the ship doesn\u0027t move at all. Therefore, you can exploit this error like Scott Manley did in that fuel transfer video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL, fuel transfers would probably be slow cause you don\u0027t want to make ship jump around during transfers. The same reasons why robotic arms move so slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T07:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERune.
