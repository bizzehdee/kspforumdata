However production of denser and more storable propellants (LH2 tends to rapidly boil off) such as Kerosene (can be made from Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen via the Fischer-Tropsch Cycle), Hydrazine, UMDH, and Aerozine (which is really just a 50/50 mixture of UMDH and Hydrazine) would require significant expansion on the current set of ISRU reactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts for Interstellar always come back to ISRU system.

Basically, you burn Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen together which were originally electrolyzed from atmospheric Carbon Dioxide for a quick-and-easy propellant on Mars/Duna that doesn\u0027t require a source of Hydrogen... It can also be coupled with the Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction (CO2 \u002B H2 --\u0026gt; CO \u002B H2O) and the Fischer-Tropsch reaction (CO \u002B H2 --\u0026gt; Kerosene \u002B O2) for a more efficient overall utilization of Mars/Duna resources than anything dependent on the Sabatier Reaction...
