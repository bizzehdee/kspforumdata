I will be starting a mission log of my newly created series using the Galileo System!

We had done what we wanted to. Most of our greatest scientists said \u0022How about Ceti, It is incredibly close relatively speaking, and we don\u0027t know a lot about it\u0022. Most of the press took this as a statement and a challenge, and were excited to hear more about this fabled \u0022Ceti program\u0022. Before then, we need to learn a lot more about space. Most missions lasted 1-10 days, with the longest being Jebediah\u0027s Iota mission. For this, Skylab was created. It had enough food to feed a crew of 5 for a month, and was made to test how long one could stay in space for, and to test other effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XdftgbQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XdftgbQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first crew to dock at the space station wasn\u0027t a qualified Astronaut at all.

I was trying to download another KSP, so I could test out some stuff in the stock Kerbol system. Upon moving the file to desktop, it replaced this save file. I apologize, but to compensate, I have created a new 3.2x Galileo save that can be found below! It also will allow me to do a proper mission report, starting from the beginning.
