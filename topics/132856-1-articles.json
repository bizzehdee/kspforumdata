Mirror symmetry really means pulling something \u0022inside out\u0022 through the mirror. There\u0027s no way to rotate your left hand to make it match your right hand.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, there is an exception to this rule. If the object is already symmetrical, then you can rotate it to produce a \u0022mirrored\u0022 copy. But then way you need to rotate it depends on which way it is oriented.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd there is a third possibility: if the part\u0027s plane of mirror symmetry is the same as the plane by which you are trying to mirror it, then you need to \u003Cem\u003Etranslate\u003C/em\u003E (not rotate) the part along the axis through that plane.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the image below, you will see an example of this. The cockpit geometry (but not the texture!)\u00A0is itself symmetrical: In its \u0022natural\u0022 orientation You can cut it vertically lengthwise\u00A0down the middle and produce two halves that are the same. So we can in fact produce a \u0022mirrored\u0022 copy in the construction facility by performing the appropriate rotatin or translation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: in principle, the game could theoretically create a true mirror. It could examine the model and textures and\u00A0invert all of the coordinates along the axis through the desired symmetry plane, effectively creating a \u0022new\u0022 (virtual) part. But the game doesn\u0027t appear to be doing this, because note how the cockpit door texture is not, in fact, mirrored. The part has been rotated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut how does the game figure out which way to do the rotation? It depends on where the plane of symmetry of original shape is in its natural orientation, as well as depending on how I have subsequently rotated it before placing it onto the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reason why I ask is because I am making some custom \u0022welded\u0022 parts, and ideally I would like to make them so that the game can correctly place them with mirror symmetry. But at the moment some of the parts end up being rotated the wrong way. Is there something in a part config file that can be set to tell the game what the \u0022natural\u0022 plane of symmetry is (if any)?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LGKj1a7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LGKj1a7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-24T17:26:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2016 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T19:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Crzyrndm/B9-PWings-Fork/blob/master/GameData/B9_Aerospace_ProceduralWings/Parts/Aero_Wing_Procedural/wing_procedural_typeA.cfg#L42\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Crzyrndm/B9-PWings-Fork/blob/master/GameData/B9_Aerospace_ProceduralWings/Parts/Aero_Wing_Procedural/wing_procedural_typeA.cfg#L42\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, a unit vector that tells KSP which axis to rotate the model around (and in this case, to turn it inside out by applying a negative scale factor)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T22:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething about how its plane is, as the part is going left/right relative to itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
