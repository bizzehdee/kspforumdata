A passive radiation shield with a density of 5500 kg per square meter would reduce the radiation dose rate inside the ship to 0.5 rem/year...which is equivalent to living in Denver, CO. You can half that and bring the dose levels to 5 rem/year (the allowed dose for workers in the nuclear industry) which I think is quite reasonable, since they will not be spending their entire lives in the ship.
