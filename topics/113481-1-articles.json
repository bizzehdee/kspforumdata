I can mouseover parts like normal but can\u0027t click on any of the parts that do exist to place them. I can open existing craft and get the highlight from mouseover, but also can\u0027t click on those parts and grab them. The place, offset, rotate, and root tools don\u0027t work, but you can set action groups and pick crew. There are buttons for parts I deleted, and things that aren\u0027t normally parts - a flag, a potato-like rock easter egg, even kerbals! (And instead of spinning in place, flag and kerbals zoom in, getting bigger than the buttons.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing it has something to do with all the amazingly awesome new ways to sort parts introduced with 1.0.
