Call me pedantic but nothing I\u0027ve tried has remedied them; be it external GPU anti-aliasing overrides, giving the suspect UV\u0027s a ton of space to average reduced pixels onto, sewing the UVs at the termination of the structures edge so the seam is on the inside of the part, and ensuring every UV face has at least some texture space. The pic (at 100% zoom) shows what I mean, with its texture map and the relevant UV outlines overlaid on top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fYXlFNo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fYXlFNo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand why I\u0027m still seeing a white line - no UV on any externally visible quarter of the map is anywhere near where the mipmap could grab erroneous colour from. And if its mesh being AA\u0027d incorrectly, why doesn\u0027t it do it on other parts? I\u0027ve never seen it happen on anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas? Is there some import\\export setting in Unity I\u0027ve overlooked? This hasn\u0027t suddenly happened; but I figured before I release my next update, I should try fix whatever is causing problems that will translate onto 90% of my work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T13:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe seams are appearing between pieces of mesh right? no along all UV seams. you sometimes get z-fighting between adjacent thin pieces of mesh when zoomed out farway. it\u0027s dependent on Near Clip setting on Unity camera, I don\u0027t know why, all I know is it happens in Unity. probably not much you can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daishi","CreatedById":85055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T10:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe seams are appearing between pieces of mesh right? no along all UV seams. you sometimes get z-fighting between adjacent thin pieces of mesh when zoomed out farway. it\u0027s dependent on Near Clip setting on Unity camera, I don\u0027t know why, all I know is it happens in Unity. probably not much you can do about it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah its between pieces of mesh - the top and bottom of stacked wedges. The bottom right image in the above pic has an individual piece highlighted so you have an idea where they meet. They\u0027re physically not touching at all (and if they are, its \u003Cem\u003Every \u003C/em\u003Eborderline, you get no shimmering at all when you zoom in) so z-fighting shouldn\u0027t be happening at those distances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EBut as you say it could be a Unity limitation and totally out of my control, I just figured that because mipmaps generate the further you get from the camera, that they were responsible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScratch that, it \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Ethe camera clip settings - i just noticed the objects and shadows around the launch pad flicker in and out of existence based on how far you are from them. Specifically the shadows around the ramps that run over the pipes to the coolant tanks. Happens around the KSC buildings too with their cast shadows. Parts with other things within them shimmer their contents the further away you get (like an orange tank covered in metal plating, zoom out and the orange shows through). Never really noticed it before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would be happening? Is Unity shrinking\\reducing the complexity of meshes based on the distance from the camera? They must still be partially rendered, so they cant have been totally clipped away to nothing.
