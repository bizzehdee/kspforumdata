In the mean time I\u0027m just having fun playing Kerbal with FASA. The only reason I brought up anything about the Delta engine was your post about wanting to increase it\u0027s thrust while not wanting us to make use the the Thor for basically every flight. In my game I tend to use the Titan and Atlas when I\u0027m putting up a satellite for my own purposes, and use the Thor/Delta when I\u0027m fulfilling some satellite contracts. But I only do that because I like the Titan and Atlas. With the current engine, the Thor/Delta is powerful enough for pretty much every launch. I could probably even fit a capsule and lander, and do manned mun launches with it. So if your intent is to keep it fun but also make it so the other rockets have relevance, increasing the thrust on the Delta MB3 is probably not the best option. Just one opinion, of course. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cytosine","CreatedById":129097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi FASA peeps, I got a fun one for ya....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier today Jeb and Bill were out on pad 29 doing some prototype testing of the newly designed LEM 1.0.2.

But when he tried to re-enter the LEM his body was suddenly cloned inside the LEM preventing him from entering! At first Bill was excited that he could get twice as much work done, but after realizing he\u0027d have to share his snacks with alter-Bill he was less than enthused! That and having to give his seat to his clone while he remained on the Mun kind of bummed him out too...

After Bill got back in he looked at me with a sad and very pale face (which is odd for a Kerbal). Next he pulled out a Corned Beef sandwich from his inventory and I said \u0022DAMMIT MAN!

Storing it in the VAB is technically \u0027legal\u0027 but when you exit and try to re-enter a vehicle the game pukes. However if you add the backpack outside then the expected behaviour works where the Kerbal wears the backpack and when he enters the vehicle then backpack drops off onto the ground. Minor logic bug in how KIS handles objects in the VAB versus outdoors. The work-around is simply don\u0027t try to enter a vehicle without wearing the backpack and leave any paraphernalia like Corned Beef sandwiches at home!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, Mun-shot testing is back on schedule!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed something with my launch clamps.
