Doubling your fuel doesn\\\u0027t double your total available moving power (called delta-v).\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]There\\\u0027s a maximum amount of delta-v achievable per stage, period. Increasing the number of fuel tanks past a certain point does nothing unless you use decouplers to shed dead weight.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Once you get into orbit, you don\\\u0027t need a lot of fuel to change your orbit and go places. Once you\\\u0027re safely in orbit, a single fuel tank should be able to take you to escape velocity, to the Mun, or wherever else you\\\u0027d like to go. I\\\u0027ve set up an orbit with a maximum altitude of 1 light second, and accomplished re-entry with nothing but RCS thrusters.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Modifying your orbit\\\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Emaximum\u003C/strong\u003E altitude is done when you\\\u0027re at your orbit\\\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Eminimum\u003C/strong\u003E altitude. Modifying your orbit\\\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Eminimum\u003C/strong\u003E altitude is done when you\\\u0027re at your orbit\\\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Emaximum\u003C/strong\u003E altitude. Not only is this the most efficient way to do it, it\\\u0027s also the most controllable.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]The greater the different between your maximum and minimum altitudes, the less fuel it takes to modify either one. When in a circular orbit, it takes a lot of fuel to start raising your maximum altitude -- however, as you keep raising it, it raises faster and faster, until you\\\u0027re using small RCS bursts to change your peak altitude by \u003Cem\u003Emillions of meters.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]SAS is only truly useful when you need it to keep from crashing a large rocket just after liftoff. Once you\\\u0027ve made orbit, SAS is certainly convenient if you have plenty of fuel available; however, if you\\\u0027re trying to do anything extreme or your energy budget is tight, it\\\u0027s best to shed your SAS early or leave them off the rocket entirely. Remember -- everything you lift to orbit requires a large amount of fuel to get it there, and putting on more fuel means you need even more fuel, which might mean more engines, which might mean even more fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Gravity and drag are your two greatest enemies. Beating gravity means blasting off as fast as possible and spending as little time as possible going straight up. Beating drag means going as slow as possible and spending as much time as possible going straight up. There\\\u0027s a delicate balance between the two, or instead you can...\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]...use more boosters. I\\\u0027m serious on this one; booster rockets which are decoupled as soon as they\\\u0027re spent have very little in the way of downsides, but help you cut through gravity and the atmosphere quicker so you have more fuel left when you get to the other side. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E, carrying extra boosters is a weight penalty, so boosters are best used once at liftoff to cut through as much atmosphere as possible in those first 25 seconds, before easing back to play the gravity/drag balance game.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Efficiency is important. In real life it\\\u0027s because of cost. In KSP it\\\u0027s because of lag. You can\\\u0027t fly something you can\\\u0027t control, and you can\\\u0027t control anything at 2 FPS. If your rocket is too big, think about your goals and think about where your inefficiencies are in your design. Build towards the goal, and try to cut it as close as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-11T22:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding on top of the previous posting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Try to put as much thrust into the first stage (the \u0027takeoff\u0027 stage) as possible. Any rocket you lift into orbit that doesn\\\u0027t fire right from the start is dead weight until it fires. Usually, it\\\u0027s useless to carry boosters on upper stages, since they are dead weight until they start to burn. 6 boosters in first stage are better than 3 in first and 3 in second.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]SAS will try to keep your rocket pointed in the direction it is going when SAS is turned on. EVEN AGAINST YOU. If you want to start banking, turn SAS off first or it will try to compensate your maneuvers. Also, SAS tends to be slow, if your rocket sways slowly, SAS can well aggravate the problem rather than solve it.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]The taller your rocket is, the harder it is to bank and pitch.

This is your rocket wobbling like crazy. Put a thruster in the back and it\\\u0027s sure to break off.[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]The \u0027sweet spot\u0027 of stacking stock liquid fuel tanks on stock liquid engines is about 3-4 for first stage. More tanks means just more weight to be lifted, you climb slower and burn more fuel to achieve the same.
