Is the general rule of thumb to always burn at half the time of the total burn no matter what? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it depends on the length of the burn. For longer burns you can do several burns, the transit windows are usually open for days and even if you miss the optimal then it doesn\u0027t cost that much extra dV. Personally I just check my current date and build a vehicle capable of transit without having to timewarp for more than a couple weeks at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause this is impossible for me because id say 90% of the time it says N/A for me until I fire the engines. So..how is it I can go about long burns when it doesn\u0027t give me that information?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can throttle up your engines for a second or two to get a reliable estimate in anticipation of your burn. It won\u0027t change your orbit/planned node enough to be an issue. The estimate burn duration relies on what thrust you had last time your engines were active, so it\u0027s wise to do a pre-burn to get the correct reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Also lets say that halfway through a burn a stage runs out and I decouple it. This would effect the burn time. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, not enough to be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow it takes me a good while of messing with the maneuver nodes to get an intercept. And it takes precision to perform that maneuver. So when stuff like this happens...that precision is lost, no?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, the manouver node target reticle keeps pointing in the direction you need to burn to get the planned orbit. If the burn is long enough and you\u0027re off target enough then you can just do a correction burn afterwards. For interplanetary burns I do a course correction anyway about halfway to my destination to ensure I get the correct SOI entry/PE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T20:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much that\u0027s exactly what I needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot quite, if you decouple a stage and the TWR changes dramatically that can have a huge effect on the burn time.

If you dont mind abusing the clipping, you can rotate with WASDQE so that it\u0027s mounted flush with the surface. It can be a little tricky to (re)move later if it\u0027s not visible from the outside of the part, but you can pan and zoom the camera inside the part to grab the strut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you have a new topic just start a new thread.
