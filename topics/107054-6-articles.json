So if they want to give us major setbacks, what can they do? They can\u0027t get us in treble, and it\u0027s not like they have enough staff that care. Pff, retarde-s.\n- Just not measuring up, is it? Go take a minuet to consider and see if you can Handel it then.\n- Well I didn\u0027t mean to **** harp **** on about it. It was purely accidental: I didn\u0027t want to harm-ony one! I\u0027m only A minor!\n- Oboe-y! This is gonna be fun!\n- I see you finally decided to enter the action, huh? Well, here\u0027s a small note: now that you are in concert with my plans, I will try my best to turn these puns up an extra step, I\u0027m gonna whammy the hell out of you.

Quit fretting about the amount of puns we have here. We will only turn the volume up.\n- Look, guys, not to crash the party, but I think we need a rest from these puns.\n- I\u0027ll bet you baroque that thing tons of times before it finally flew.\n- ODEar.
