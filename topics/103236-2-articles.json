Just that they can go 15 days without supplies before going on a ship-wide rampage.\n\nIf you had, let\u0027s say, the basic MKS/OKS pioneer module, you can count on getting 25% of that goodness recycled. But in general, if you\u0027re not using MKS/OKS or any other \u0027greenhouse\u0027 mod, assume you just pack the three years worth.\n\nIf you run out... well, you have a fifteen day grace period.\n\nIf that runs out, the Kerbal is going to look around the ship for any container you cleverly locked (using the right mouse button menu and explicitly locking that resource). The first Kerbal to find that stash will eat a meal, then the rest gets dumped. This is to prevent the situation were you just starve all of your kerbals and use a probe core to \u0027unlock\u0027 supplies at your destination.\n\nNow, I suppose one could be clever and make tiny 1-supply packs and radially strap a zillion of these to a ship, but at that point you\u0027re just cheating anyway ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSide note... if you were out of supplies and at the point where the Kerbals have ransacked your ship, they are already grouchy... they are not going to leave the ship as EVA is disabled."},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T02:41:24Z","Content":"This mod looks very promising!
