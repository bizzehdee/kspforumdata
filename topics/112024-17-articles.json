On a white SLS with Shuttle-derived boosters, and the EUS (TALUS), with a payload of a procedural fairings interstage for the USA, an Orion and Orion fairing above and the Altair from some other CMES craft file, I was able to reach the Mun, land and return to Kerbin. No second upper stage for Orion. I used the following mission profile:\u003Cp\u003EKSC \u0026gt; 400km orbit \u0026gt; Orion separation and redock to now-exposed Altair \u0026gt; TLI burn with EUS \u0026gt; Course Correction to set Pe at 150 km with EUS \u0026gt; Circularisation at Mun Pe with EUS \u0026gt; Separation from EUS \u0026gt; Land Altair (I\u0027ll see about adding latitude limits to this mission profile later) \u0026gt; Reorbit, dock and return to Kerbin without establishing orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet it be known, however, that this was pushing the upper limits of the configuration. I had 100-200 m/s dV left in the EUS after circularising into a 0-inclination orbit around the Mun. The limiting factor, though, was the Altair. From 150km 0-inclination orbit, I was able to land in the centre of the polar crater, but just about not quite reach the original orbit with the NOS ascent module. I was about 40 m/s short, I think. I was using Mechjeb throughout, so there may be a way of doing it manually to make it more dV efficient (doglegging the ascent?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note about the USA. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d use the procedural version. I\u0027d be happiest with something that just fits the Altair inside, as anything else would likely be smaller than that (the Extended Mission Module, which I use without the Orbital Orb). I can\u0027t really think of other payloads in there, though. What would you suggest to ride along with Orion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to utilize the fairing base you provided with a few issues. I took the top stages of the Otion after the adaptor, and put a rover underneath it. I used a SLS bottom two stages for orbit and transition burn to the moon. I added two more SF boosters and additional fuel. I was able to achieve orbit at 150 km then burned to the mun. However, when I went to deploy the fairings, for the rover, I had a catastrophic disaster! The fairings hung on to the upper stage, which caused it to blow up and abort the mission. My second attempt was much better and they deployed nicely, allowing me to get into a mun orbit. When I separated the rover something happened that I didn\u0027t see which caused the same stage to blowup. I\u0027m not sure what caused the second explosion since the fairings didn\u0027t hang up. It was probably something I did in the construction of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei created a few more configurations since then; one with a lander the other with a lander with a rover attached to it. I have not gotten around to launching them yet. I will later tonight. A note on the fairings. They are sort of hard to get a clean look and you have to fiddle around with the settings to get them to look right. With that said though they still go over the top of the middle stage which is what caused the first ship to have problems. I\u0027m either doing it in correctly or maybe that\u0027s how they\u0027re supposed to look. Let me know what settings you have on your fairing base so I can duplicate here on my end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the nice thing about having this is you can launch the Orion with hardware instead of just Kebals. I always found that to be a bit annoying having the Orion just for Kerbals. Now I can send it up with all kinds of equipment. If you add more fuel and two more boosters on the SLS it has plenty of fuel for even Duna, however getting home might be a problem? I\u0027ll have to try it and see what the dV is. I think the best configuration for the Orion is with a Lander or a Rover, in my opinion. I just went back and looked at some of your photos. The fairings that I\u0027m able to make are not half cylinders. They look like a regular fairing but pushed down to the middle of the rocket. I\u0027m not sure how your doing that, as per your pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet it me know your fairing base settings and I\u0027ll duplicate them on my builds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/D5N2Sg7\u0022 alt=\u0022D5N2Sg7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T00:37:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ebphoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T00:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uFQXmNe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uFQXmNe.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGRJNf8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iGRJNf8.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TvFTQK4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TvFTQK4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3EQ6JuN.png\u0022 alt=\u00223EQ6JuN.png\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T01:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MgRSZT7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MgRSZT7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GMNZnoG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GMNZnoG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uploaded some images to imgur so you could see what I\u0027m referring to.
