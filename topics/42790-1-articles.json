Okay, fine. \u003Cstrong\u003EI \u003C/strong\u003Eam recruiting a texturer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently joined the WPA team with my modeling skills, and with the intention of marketing my parts both with them and by myself on the side. So far, we have a bunch of parts to market including some resized parts from another mod that we obtained permission to modify and three of m models, which sit untextured. I\u0027d like to get these out, soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am lookng for someone who, assuming I provide the UV unwrap from Blender and the model in a format of their choosing, can create a simple, yet decent quality texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested in helping out, please submit a small sample of your work (a basic preview texture under 1024x1024 is more than sufficent) and let me know the best way to contact you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those interested, here is one of my models:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is probably one of the hardest because I did detail the turbines some and all that internal area on the engine is supposed to get an emmisive too. Another hard one is the intake that matches this. I fully detailed the fanblades on it. If you wish for me to make these simpler and thus easier to texture, I will do so at your request (if you end up working with me of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote: this stuff has been , up until now, marketed under Sierra\u0027s Spare Parts. With the addition of a partner, that name may come under review. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T00:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks fun to texture.

You can texture. You got the skills, and you are interested, but this is a full time position (I use the term \u0027full time\u0027 loosely)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I work whenever I feel like it and can usually crank out a rough model in an hour or so (I can do some really detailed modeling really fast). This is a no-pressure gig. I do models and config work, you do models and texturing, the two of us get a nice little pack going.
