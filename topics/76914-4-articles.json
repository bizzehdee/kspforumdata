Interestingly it properly loses speed when climbing, but in level flight it effectively has 0 drag.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve been doing some \u0022balance beam\u0022 testing with wings, and it seems that the #1 criteria for a \u0022best\u0022 wing is lift coefficient to induced drag coefficient ratio. The parasitic drag isn\u0027t nil, but it\u0027s so much less than induced drag that it\u0027s neglible. Likewise, the mass of a wing as pure weight is very little compared to the mass of whatever it\u0027s lifting, and can be safely ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s also important to have the correct balance of craft mass to lift coefficient (you don\u0027t want too much or too little wing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E According to my preliminary results, the delta wing should yield the best results among non-control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T13:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cerberusti","CreatedById":89638,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T16:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone made a lifting surface comparison I find useful a while ago, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29788-How-to-calculate-lift/page3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29788-How-to-calculate-lift/page3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll wings should have no drag when in level flight.
