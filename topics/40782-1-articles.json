More often than not it will calculate your maneuver in accordance the the rotational direction of planetary body you were last in such as Kerbin and just sends you whichever way around the planet/satellite that it chooses, normally requiring you make a manual burn at some point, wasting yet more fuel.

Makes things much easier, I must say! Some planets have very... interesting... transfer windows. Often for about 10% extra dV you can arrive much, much sooner than the absolute optimal timing would allow for. For example, the classic first Duna transfer window at around day 58 is nice, but if you wait \u0027til day 61, you can get to Duna about 25% sooner for a very small extra amount (we\u0027re talking sub-100m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T17:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep most launch windows are pretty flexible. The phase angles currently used are only for exact Hohmann transfers. But for a little extra delta-v, depending on how far you are from the ideal phase angle, you can still encounter the other planet on a modified Hohmann transfer. At the beginning of a new game Eve is in front of Kerbin (rather than 50 degrees behind for an ideal transfer) and yet you can still get to Eve for 1300 m/s (as opposed to 1040 m/s for an ideal transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why in real life a crewed Mars mission is designed to use a modified Hohmann transfer to get a significant reduction in transfer time at the cost of very little extra delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
