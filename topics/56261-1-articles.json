Just make a LV-N tug with detachable tanks, axially and radially. 3-fold symmetry for tanks, 3-fold symmetry for three LV-N engines between. Small lander with 48-7S or 24-77 engines on top and there you go. You can even use the tug, now a lot smaller and spent, during the early stages of the landing, and watch it crash down below after it\u0027s detached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T03:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been to Eeloo once, in career mode. Definatley get the launch window right, or else getting there will be very unforgiving. I think i went from low kerbin orbit to there with about 8000 delta-v, with a little left when i landed (about 500). Also, it\u0027s very creepy but cool there. No surface scatter, no rocks, just bare white ground, and the sun is a speck. Use nukes once in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
