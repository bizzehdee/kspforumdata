These games are space program \u003Cstrong\u003Emanagement \u003C/strong\u003Egames with Mars Horizon being more user friendly and easier to get into with a more lightweight approach to the matter, while Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager is more management simulation oriented and bit harder to get in with far less hand holding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMars Horizon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReading reviews on this game, it is often compared to KSP to explain what type of the game this is - which I found to be a bit lazy writing since it is like comparing horses to radish on account that they are both carbon based life forms...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game itself is a space program management game, where you pick your space agency (NASA, ESA, Soviet, Chinese, etc...) starting in 1957 and have as the ultimate goal to achieve crewed landing at Mars. To achieve that you must accomplish so-called milestones (first satellite, EVA, landing on moon, etc...) which will be unlocked mostly through mission research. You are competing with AI led space agencies for being first to achieve these milestones and rewards they give - being second, third, etc reduces the reward you get for doing this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn more practical terms this means that you are managing the space program directly - you are in charge of base building, research of rockets, missions and buildings, very simplified rocket design and finally also launch dates. All of these activities are financed through research points (unlocked through rewards for missions and milestones) and monthly money income which is increased through public support for your program (mainly) which again is increased through successfully completing missions and achieving milestones . Simply put - the better you are at your job, the easier it gets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince if you are reading this, this being KSP forum and all, you will be perhaps interested in how the rocket design and piloting of such designs is implemented. Nothing at all as in KSP....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are basically setting up pre-designed two parts rocket, consisting of a booster and upper stage which you have unlocked through research. The rockets you create cannot be used outside of the missions AND the piloting is being done through puzzle mini games (which can be skipped, but I did not because of the extra resources you\u00A0 get if you are very successful).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Nhf6Spv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Nhf6Spv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I think:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is extremely easy to get in, with a very good UI and can be surprisingly challenging on higher difficulties\u00A0 - in a good way.\u00A0 Competition with rival agencies really spiced up this game - I launched in the middle of storm, suffered electric errors which increased difficulty in the subsequent puzzle game, all in order to beat NASA\u0027s mission to the moon. Easy is really Easy in this game, so I recommend to play in higher difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you are playing chiefly KSP because you are enjoying building your own designs and are looking to\u00A0 scratch this scratch - this game is not for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay (I am not affiliated with this guy, he was the first result in youtube)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIP6dMECaSw?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBuzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you know what Slitherin stands for or BARIS is a game you played in 90s, you don\u0027t need to read further. And probably you know already about BASPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rest of you this game is in same venue as Mars Horizon except being limited to the race to the moon as end objective, where this is just intermediary goal for Mars Horizon . Both games share many concepts but differ in implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as in Mars Horizon you are in charge of base building (technically here you are just upgrading buildings), research (much more complicated than in Mars Horizon) and deciding on which program to focus on. The biggest difference is the complexity of manpower management - recruitment and training of astronauts (each having several skillets) , researchers (which have 5 areas of expertise) and mission controllers (again - several area of expertise). People don\u0027t get productive at their job the day you hire them and they are not 100% experts in their field. This means that all you employees will sooner or later need additional training/education to become better at their job and \u003Cu\u003Eall of this takes time\u003C/u\u003E. If you want to be landing on moon in 1969, you better lay groundwork for it in 1954. And finances are much tighter here in the beginning compared to the Mars Horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBASPM is a much more complex game where you really need\u00A0 to plan years ahead. In this game I first checked out the moon landing mission and then worked my way back to the first Sputnik mission (played as soviet). Notepad (electronic or paper) is a recommended secondary tool. My experience with project planning IRL helped here - it made game definitely easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screen_5c8a93315f836.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.slitherine.com/images/screens/200/screen_5c8a93315f836.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResearch is organized around programs and rockets and unlike Mars Horizon, the launch dates are organized abstractly. However you have directly hand in picking the team/crew that is organizing and expediting the launch of the rocket/misision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unlike Mars Horizon there is no a puzzle game here but rather you are observing entire mission from sort of a mission control overview where you can see how the mission progresses through rendering of trajectory and videos/animations showing events.\u00A0 If things go bad (and often they did for me) you can call in extra teams to help or use your own crew to try to solve them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/308270/ss_6c863923836da46bda1cdeb3d27fa89a5f7c49a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1579704396\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/308270/ss_6c863923836da46bda1cdeb3d27fa89a5f7c49a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1579704396\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Mars Horizon and BASPM have really interesting ingame encyclopedia which are good reads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I think:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUser hostile GUI, not greatest graphics out ther, hard to understood details of the game and generally very punishing game if you commit some early mistakes in your career may be discouraging for many. I restarted 4 times so I could correct early mistakes (I run also three saves with end of season time stamp, beginning of new season, current save). That said,\u003Cu\u003E the sense of accomplishment here is much greater\u003C/u\u003E than in Mars Horizon (and I am no fan of puzzles). If you are fan of Slitherine as publisher, you know what you are in for - both the bad and good. If you have no idea what I just wrote, do yourself a favor and watch a gameplay video before buying this game.

A well researched game with a somewhat painful UI. It\u0027s an older game now, maybe 5 years old? Really wish it was more amenable to mods or user-added missions. The late parts of the game are very empty.\u00A0Perfect example of a game that could\u0027ve been improved with some community access. The \u0022Tiger Teams\u0022 nonsense they added\u00A0is hot garbage though, and breaks mission game flow in a bad way. I know some of that was inherited from BARIS, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a good mechanism. It\u0027s occasionally on sale on Steam but hasn\u0027t been updated in years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve played Mars Horizon\u00A0(both months ago with the prelaunch demo and here recently after release), probably 30 hours or so in total. While the UI looks nice, is reasonably well organized, and the game as a whole has great artwork, I absolutely despise the math minigame.\u00A0I also get the distinct impression the game designer has a poor working knowledge of space exploration, and at times lacks even the most basic concept of orbital mechanics. Neither of those directly affect the game, but they do detract from the feel it. Lots of things in it just feel _\u003Cem\u003Eoff\u003C/em\u003E_. (Ex: As USSR you\u0027ve unlocked Buran as a launch vehicle, but can\u0027t use it as a payload. So you end up doing silly things like launching a Vostok capsule in the cargo bay and then do the mission from the Vostok.) Don\u0027t get me wrong though - it\u0027s a decent enough game for the money, and reasonably entertaining. I have to turn off the\u00A0screen warping \u0022failure\u0022 animations in the accessibility menu every time I launch the game though, because the game refuses to remember the setting and the animations\u00A0themselves give me a migraine (which is the first time in my life anything like that has bothered me). \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither of these games are anything like KSP though.
