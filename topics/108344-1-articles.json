Looks easy enough to explain: Your fins are basically acting as weak lifting surfaces, especially because of your low speed. And since they are so far behind the COM, they give your rocket a minimal bias to slowly turn. As said, the direction of the turn is caused by the slight misalignment of the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally a rocket get\u0027s enough speed to counteract that lift, but your rocket is just above hovering speed, so the slightest imbalance builds up really fast.

Canards and other control surfaces did not cause tilt. But if control on all three axis was disabled for the control surfaces, then the rocket did tilt towards the 270. Furthermore, the bigger the wings and/or the further back they were, the quicker it tilted. By using a launch clamp to start the rocket slightly tilted off to the 90, it exhibited the same behavior, but in the opposite direction. This has led me to conclude that the issue is simply that the center of lift is too far below the center of mass (too stable) for the available control forces to correct. Now, you may be asking why does it seem to have a tendency to tilt towards the 270 much of the time? I believe it is caused by the fact that if you point a ship straight upwards and try to fly with no input, the ship will appear to be rotating westward ever so slightly, when actually the planet is rotating eastward, and the ship is maintaining an absolute heading. (This effect is much more pronounced in low orbit). And as the ship tilts slightly westward (relative to Kerbin), its engine will start giving the ship a tiny westward velocity, which the extremely low center of lift will only exacerbate. On top of this, the launchpad is slightly tilted towards the 270. There are probably other factors at play though, as this does not happen 100% of the time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
