So I recently got into the field of mods and one of the first ones i downloaded was Karbonite, as I wanted a way to refill larger ships far from Earth. Someone suggested that I also download scansat, so I could scan planets and find where the resources are. So I have done that, and fully scanned both Kerbin and the Mun, but I have a problem. The map just shows altitudes at different points. I know that the resources are tied to the biome, but I don\u0027t know what biome to target, nor do I know what the biomes are on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I don\u0027t understand is the Anomalies.
