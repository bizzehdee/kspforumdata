In Earth, we have days, weeks, months, and years. And, from what we see in the game, Kerbals have a very similar way of telling time. Except, we only get days and years, and nothing in between. However, this is still a lot of information to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s start with structuring weeks. On Earth, a week is 7 days. On Kerbin, a week could also be 7 days. If we do the math, 6x7, which is 42, a Kerbin day can fit perfectly into a 7 week period. This doesn\u2019t translate very well when compared to a year, though. If we do 426/7, we get 60.8571429, which is a really odd decimal. But if we do 426/6, we get a round 71. It\u2019s be easier to structure a calendar like this, so a Kerbin week is most likely 6 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, what about a month? On Earth, a month is averagely 30 days. If we do the math, 30 days fits well into a year. 426/30=14.2. Much like on Earth, Kerbals can shift around days, making months longer or shorter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay = 6 Hours\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeek = 6 Days\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMonth = 30 Days\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear = 14 Months\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminal Gremlin","CreatedById":221533,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-02T03:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome months can have more days than others\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalsaurus","CreatedById":222386,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-02T15:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214808\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672631997\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022221533\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superluminal Gremlin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Superluminal Gremlin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome months can have more days than others\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said that. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Much like on Earth, Kerbals can shift around days, making months longer or shorter.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E It\u0027s phrased pretty weirdly, but yeah they can just make months longer or shorter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MythicalHeFF","CreatedById":176690,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-02T22:09:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel that, like the moon defines months in our calendar, the Mun would define months in a Kerbal calendar.

Calendars are based on observable effects: for example, Earth\u0027s year is defined not by its orbital period but by the period of the seasonal cycle (which is about 20 minutes shorter), and the month was originally defined not by the Moon\u0027s orbital period but by its phases (which are about two days longer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Kerbin, there is no seasonal variation at all, so Kerbin\u0027s location in its orbit doesn\u0027t produce any easily noticeable effects unless you\u0027re actually paying attention to the constellations. This means its orbital period wouldn\u0027t have the same importance that Earth\u0027s year does. Instead, it seems more likely that the calendar would be based more directly on Mun. (Remember that Mun has about four times the angular diameter of the Moon, so it\u0027s way more noticeable in the sky.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a Munar eclipse every 6.534 days, but half of them occur at night, so from a given location, visible eclipses usually occur about every 13 days. The time of day of the eclipse advances by 25 minutes each time until it reaches sunset. Then, the alternating daytime and nighttime eclipses would swap, and the time of day of the visible eclipse would return to sunrise. This happens every 95.4 days, after seven or eight visible eclipses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery five of these \u0022eclipse cycles\u0022 (477.00044 days), the eclipse would occur at almost exactly the same time of day, off by less than ten seconds. Anyone with a watch who could see the sky getting dark due to a Munar eclipse would probably notice this, so a calendar based on this unit of time seems likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(The phases of Mun cycle at the same rate as eclipses, so any such calendar would also include them as a bonus.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy proposal would be as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA \u0022year\u0022 is 477 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe error between this and 73 Munar eclipses is so small that it would add up to less than an hour over the course of a human lifetime, so it\u0027s unlikely that further precision would be needed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe year\u00A0is broken into five \u0022cycles\u0022, each of 95 or 96 days.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSeparately,\u00A0a\u00A0\u0022week\u0022 lasts 13 days, but the last week of every other\u00A0cycle is followed by an extra day not part of the week.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure \u0022week\u0022 is exactly the right word since 13 is not that close to 7, but I can\u0027t think of a better alternative other than obscure terms\u00A0like \u0022fortnight\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would this work?

(At other longitudes, it\u0027s other days of the cycle,\u00A0not the 57th.) During the first cycle (Day 57), it was from the fifth to the twelfth day of the week, whereas during the second cycle (Day 153), it moves from the twelfth to the sixth day of the week. The next visible eclipse is on Day 161 at 03:19.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWait, the sixth day of the week, not the fifth? It remains off for now, but then at the end of the second cycle, after the week ends on Day 195, an extra day is\u00A0added between weeks, and the next week doesn\u0027t start until Day 197.\u00A0The\u00A0eclipse after that, on Day 201, is consequently pushed\u00A0back to the fifth day of the week.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn this way,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0visible\u00A0eclipse occurs on the fifth, sixth, or twelfth day\u00A0of the week.
