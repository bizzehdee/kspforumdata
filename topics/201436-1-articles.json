I am just going\u00A0tp have to live with this station bouncing over. The good thing is that I have gotten teh Sismic data I needed to complet the contract. I would just stay away but I also dropped a couple of Rovers there so I could complete some surface science at several different way points and the rovers are right next to the Science station. Of course the bounce does not bother the rovers but I hate to see the station \u0022messed up\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
