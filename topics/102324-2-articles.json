Whilst batteries will keep getting better \u0026 better, hydrogen\u0027s problems are simply insurmountable. It takes a lot of energy to compress, which just reduces efficiency. It also requires very heavy-duty tanks to store it safely, meaning it\u0027s absolutely hopeless as a transport fuel as 90% of the mass is storage tank and only 10% is fuel. So if you want to transport hydrogen over any great distance, you\u0027re lugging around a lot of dead weight. It\u0027s also extremely difficult to pipe anywhere, so that\u0027s out of the question.\n\u003E These are problems created by the physical properties of hydrogen and cannot be changed.\n\nThey \\*could\\* be worked around... Maybe if there was a catalyst that released hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules (there might be one, I have no idea), we could store the hydrogen in water form, run it over the catalyst and then burn it with oxygen from the atmosphere. Maybe the exhaust would be almost completely steam... Or recycled.

A lot. Like, orders of magnitude. We have fantastic public transport where I live, by international standards. And yet, going the same distance by car takes me one third of the time, never runs late on me, is quieter, smells nicer, always has a free seat, isn\u0027t filled with drunk people trying to tell me their life story and swag kids playing hiphop on cellphone loudspeakers, doesn\u0027t require me to sprint through the rain to change buses or trains multiple times per trip, doesn\u0027t get wrecked with grafitty and chewing gums and burnmarks in a matter of days, has proper proper climate control and, get this - *costs me half as much on a daily basis*.\n\u003E \n\u003E Public transport has an even longer way to come towards the cities of the future than we as people have.\n\nI live in a city where people commute by bike daily. This winter it never got to -20 C, but that\u0027s a rare occurance. In Sweden we have this saying: There\u0027s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing. It\u0027s so true in this case. Once people get used to it, dressing for -20 degrees C biking is really no big deal. You need insulating pants, a jacket, gloves, and a good cap.

Then cars use it with a 50% or 60% of efficiency fuel cells, that is a similar conversion that if you produce electricity and storage electricity in other ways.

Why all electric cars needs to be extra luxuries than any other normal car?\n\nIn fact, all the car industry is very wrong with city cars, cars that does not need go beyond 90km/h, cars that brake all the time (losing big part of the energy of acceleration). Why you need 1500kg car to move 100kg (payload average)?\n\nIt does not have any sense from the energy point, if you focus in move those 100 kg instead 1500 you are wasting 10 times less energy. And I am not talk about bikes, you can make very safety electric car for 2 people with only 200 or 300 kg.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For those who didn\u0027t learn chemistry in school : methane is not really any more polluting than using hydrogen.

The CO2 could have come from the atmosphere, giving you zero net CO2 emission. Or, the CO2 could have been captured from the smokestack of a coal power plant.\n\nWe need to reduce the emmisions, zero net co2 does not help now, we need negative values if we want to dodge the worst consequences of the next 50 years.\n\nAlso methane fuel cells had much lower efficiencies than hydrogen fuel cell. And if you use simple combustion you end with 25% efficiency.\n\nAlso graphene oxyde is the answer to any leak on hydrogen, that technology will kick in just 5 years due how easy is to make graphene oxyde.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Using raw hydrogen has never, ever been a good idea. I guess the people pushing it do it because the general public doesn\u0027t realize this?\n\nI read all the time enviroment science, that is kinda my thing, hydrogen has a real value. But I am agree that for small cars or city cars, battery cars are better than fuel cell.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Given that this method is much less energy efficient than batteries, it would only be appropriate for vehicles that cannot run on batteries - such as airplanes and possibly long haul trucks.\n\nis not less energy efficient, I already explain this in the link that I show you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The other half of the solution is better batteries. Lithium-iron chemistry batteries use raw materials that are far cheaper than the assembled batteries cost, so their prices could be brought down by a factor of 5-10, probably. (the lithium-cobalt batteries we use in laptops, etc today are only a few pennies more than the cost of the cobalt, so they won\u0027t get any cheaper). Right now, it\u0027s about $30,000 for the lithium iron batteries equivalent to what\u0027s in a Tesla, bought as an individual. A 5 fold cost reduction would make electric cars affordable for everyone.\n\nenergy storage (any kind) is one of the technologies branch with higher growth on the moment."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T20:00:24Z","Content":"Until electric becomes at least roughly as easy and quick to use as fossil fuels, it is not going to happen.

So it can become viable when the hardware with it goes down in price and/or range increases.\n\nThe problem with that is that most of the cost of fuel comes from taxes, though how much depends on the country. In some it is as much as 85-90%. As soon as electric driving takes off, the cost to the respective governments will become too big, and electric driving will be taxed one way or another.\n\nRight now, the cost difference is hardly relevant, due to the earlier mentioned charging problems. If you drive a lot, charging is not viable, so it is hard to recoup your investment. We come to the same conclusion again, being that electric cars need to become better. When price goes down and range goes up, yes, it will be interesting ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
