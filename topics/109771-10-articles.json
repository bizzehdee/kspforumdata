Sulphur dioxide is 150ppm on Venus, and the acid forms the cloud layer, so realistically both can be considered a feasible output of an air intake?\n\nIf you have plans to add these, can I help by creating configs for these reactions and their thermal inputs/outputs?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T06:03:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 06:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nanomage**\n  \nformatting went wonky"},{"CreatedByName":"Kotagi","CreatedById":157838,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T21:23:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/15/2016 at 0:54 PM, Sol Invictus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m amazed by your work upon this marvel of a mod.
