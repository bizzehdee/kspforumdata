Mississippi in sufficient quantity to fill 2000 acres of polders every year.\u00A0\u00A0From what I can see the mud being reclaimed gives us much less value than it could.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is bring firewood grade timber to the dredging polders.\u00A0 Assemble crude wooden formworks above the water level and set them on fire enough to lightly char, but not fully burn them.\u00A0 Then discharge the river material into the wooden formworks.\u00A0 We allow mud to overflow the formworks permanently burying them.\u00A0 Vehicles driving on top will compress the soil and fill in cavities.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will build mounds spaced out in the Mississippi delta.\u00A0 The charred wood will absorb nitrates and phosphates, and lock them for a very long time.\u00A0 The carbon will be immobilized for millennia.\u00A0 The higher altitude mounds absorb the impact of hurricanes better.\u00A0 There will still be plenty of wetland, but higher ground interspersed enriches biodiversity and human use.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does the engineering math work out?\u00A0 That mostly depends on how much labor is required to collect the wood and get it to small ports anywhere on the river.\u00A0 And how much labor goes into the form work for the mounds.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt costs very little to carry 1000 tons of wood on a single barge down the river.\u00A0 \u00A0Say out standard mound site is 10 acres, and we work on about 100 mound sites at a time.\u00A0 Then one barge worth of wood is enough to build up more than a foot around the perimeter on a site, with plenty extra to burn or bury randomly in the middle.\u00A0 How much forest is that?\u00A0 We can probably get 5 tons of scrap wood per acre consistent with sustainable thinning practices.\u00A0 So 200 acres of forest thinned to load one barge one time.\u00A0 Essentially we are feeding 20 acres worth of excess vegetative scrap per\u00A01 acre of elevated reclaimed land.\u00A0 \u00A0Where the living matter continuously renews while the buried stuff is immobilized.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a lot of questions still to consider of economic, social, and political importance.\u00A0 I\u0027m looking at it first and foremost in terms of the waste streams and externalities we currently generate, and looking for better places to put them.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike it or not, we live in an era when too many\u00A0of the young people are under-employed and dependent on others.\u00A0 You know what they do?\u00A0 By day\u00A0they ride around on ATV\u0027s looking for mud puddles and steep embankments tearing up as much forest as possible.\u00A0 At night they set fires, take drugs, and yell at each other.\u00A0 That\u0027s fine, it\u0027s a free country.\u00A0 But could they\u00A0please do something useful and not be so annoying.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
