so 2, 4, 8, or 12 stripes only), and even then edges of the stripes HAVE to run exactly down the UV seams or they will result in ugly distortion when radius are scaled differently.\u00A0 For this reason normal-mapped stringers will -not- work, as they cannot all run down the UV seams, and any not on the seams will get some really ugly distortion (unacceptable for me anyway)..... this is all why I didn\u0027t want to get into custom fairing textures in the first place... very very few people understand the difficulty of UV mapping a dynamic mesh, and what that means regarding what textures can be used due to the limitations brought about by the UV mapping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, I have to go back to -- you are free to try out this stuff yourself (and see how badly it turns out), but I\u0027m not going to spend my time on it, as I already know how bad it will look (and I consider how it would look to be unacceptable;
