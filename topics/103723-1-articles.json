Maybe some MS Paint, but that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, you have to decide for the background. It can either be a picture or just a color of a color scheme. It should fit your topic (f.e. your challenge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Then you put the text (the challenge name/a description/something else) around the main part of the picture. The color of the text should correspondent with you picture/background color and if possible with your topic (f.e. green and black for the calculator challenge), and so should the font (digital for the calculator challenge, alien encounter for my military company). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t have a picture for background, put the text in the middle and one or two small pictures/paintings/diagramms next to it. Your badge should be more wide than high, because it fits better in a sig then. You can also round the corners, make a frame etc. Just try not to overdo it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have done all this with powerpoint, go to presentation mode and make a screenshot. Open the screenshot with MS paint and cut away the white pieces. (You can also directly screenshot just the badge with SnippingTool, but I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t know if you have it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpload the picture to imgur and resize it to ___x100. Then it fits the signature perfectly. If you resize to ___x88 (I use this, 90 or something else might work, too) the user can also write a line of text beneath the signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my way for people-who-have-neither-good-programs-nor-art-skills. If you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re an awesome artist with awesome programs you can do way better, but it also works like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
