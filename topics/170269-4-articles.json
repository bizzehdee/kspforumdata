the book is far more than a sci-fi action story.\u00A0 \u00A0(I wonder why nobody\u0027s ever tried to do a movie of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMoon is a Harsh Mistress?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 Perhaps it\u0027s

too.\u00A0 \u00A0If you\u0027re going to tell a historical story, you have an obligation to make the story have some recognizable resemblance to the history-- if you\u0027re going to bill a SF movie as science-based, you have an obligation to have some concept of the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsimov had a good essay about this sort of thing once.\u00A0 He simply noted that there were certain technologies (FTL travel and communication, for instance) that, scientifically speaking, he couldn\u0027t accept as valid-- yet they were necessary from a storytelling point of view.\u00A0 (If your plot depends on a person starting on one planet in one star system and ending up in another, a multigenerational colony ship is not the correct way to do it, however much more physically possible it is.)\u00A0 I might be mixing up my essays, but he basically said that a SF starship is a\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Eplot\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0vehicle, a dramatic convention, rather than a physically possible vehicle.\u00A0 \u00A0Once one realizes that, then one can mitigate in in ways that ease the necessary suspension of disbelief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking back to Edgar Rice Burroughs... the way he got John Carter to Mars was by some sort of psychic transference.\u00A0 The way he got Carson Napier to Venus was a rocket ship that was aimed at Mars but missed and landed on Venus instead.\u00A0 Which one is more \u0027realistic\u0027?\u00A0 Neither one, really-- the point was that he needed his hero to be on Mars (or Venus) and needed some quick explanation to put him there.\u00A0 I admit I prefer the Carson of Venus method because it seems less fantastical... but looking closely, it\u0027s not really all \u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E much more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... things like \u0027Star Wars\u0027 and \u0027Star Trek\u0027 work for me because they\u0027re so obviously divorced from reality that I don\u0027t even feel the need to make them fit into reality.\u00A0 It\u0027s when somebody\u00A0gets it close but wrong that things are really jarring (such as the losing-the-grip thing in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EGravity\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Why couldn\u0027t they simply have had Clooney fly by, miss the grab, and then play out the scene as he\u0027s coasting irreversibly away?\u00A0 Would have worked dramatically just as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of it is what the viewer brings along in terms of prior knowledge and expectations, too, such as me and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStarship Troopers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(you just can\u0027t rewrite Heinlein and expect a Heinlein fan to like it, bottom line) or when I watch a WW2 movie like\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMidway\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and get annoyed when they\u0027re talking about one sort of plane (like a F4F Wildcat) and showing a different one (like a TBF Avenger), where either the filmmaker doesn\u0027t know the difference, or thinks that the audience won\u0027t know it.\u00A0 In another vein, American Civil War scholars are highly divided on the movie\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EGettysburg\u003C/em\u003E, because it gets so much right and also so much wrong... or, on another tack, I really enjoy the movie\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStargate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for the fact they went to some trouble to reasonably reconstruct the ancient Egyptian language-- no matter that the plot itself is firmly in the\u00A0realm of fantasy (so much so, I can ignore the vast chasm between it and reality).\u00A0 So, to bring this ramble to a close, better a wide gulf between the movie and reality than a narrow crack, IMHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA:\u00A0 For instance, it bothers me that in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHidden Figures\u003C/em\u003E, they magically transported Mercury Control to Langley.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t necessary.\u00A0 They could perfectly well have had Katherine Goble Johnson fly to Florida if they really wanted her in Mercury Control.\u00A0 What the what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a better vein... try listening to the commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell on the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EApollo 13\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0DVD.\u00A0 It\u0027s quite interesting.\u00A0 For instance, Marilyn notes how many of Jim\u0027s mannerisms Tom Hanks picked up for the movie, or Jim noted that the characterization of Jack Swigert wasn\u0027t right-- he was in fact a Command Module control systems expert, so there was no question at all that he knew his stuff, but they wanted to have a
