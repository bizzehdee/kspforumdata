I haven\u0027t yet heard of any solution where everyone says \u201C\u003Cem\u003Eyeah, that\u0027s it, that\u0027s the way to deal with time warp.

Finally built that space station that took you 12 trips and hours of launching and docking (because you\u0027re not good at docking)? Proud to share it with the rest of the community? Well, that is until you run into this one 12yr old who thinks it\u0027s hysterical to crash a Jumbo 64 tank into your station from a retrograde orbit. LULZ!!

And maybe we need to get creative. Maybe combining multiplayer with Twitch streams is the best thing since sliced bread, and Squad should look at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0kind of multiplayer (following another player but with the ability to zoom in/out, switch to map view when you want it, etc).
