While developing them, I thought, \u0022My craft list could get pretty cluttered once I get all of the rockets developed and certified.\u0022 So, I propose SQUAD implements a system that can place crafts into folders at command. I also suggest that crafts can be moved in and out of folders at will. I believe this will get rid of some clutter, and allow for some more organization among shipbuilder\u0027s saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunity, what are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Vec\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T01:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this allows me to hide the stock craft in my sandbox games, I\u0027m in!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T01:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if that might also make it load faster (by showing one folder at a time instead of everything at once).
