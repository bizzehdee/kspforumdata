Especially with a lot of s\u0027s to it, and luckily KSP has the potential to implement a lot of aspects, I think, even when the obvious/announced things aren\u0027t accounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just came across an idea with how to make use of the antennas in a way that will effect the way you design the spacecraft, adjust your attitude in space and thereby your flying as a whole plus some other things. Don\u0027t know if parts of it has been suggested, but quickly scanned the lists and it wasn\u0027t there so forgive me, but I tend to forget things quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing is that I think the antennas should be pointing towards Kerbin. After all, it is at KSC that some little kerbal sits with his joystick maneuvering his craft down to the surface of Duna for instance. Since this will lead to a lot of limits, it should perhaps be something to be enabled/disabled i settings. But it affects several things. You have to put solarpanels the right places, you wanna put the antenna the right places, maybe even put several on like they do on real spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will affect your flying because lets say, while heading for Duna, you orbit the sun and now if you timewarp, only the solarpanels will try and follow the sun. Here it should be possible to make the craft\u0027s antenna follow Kerbin. But then watch out for the solar panels! Also it should still be possible to land while you are on the blind side of things. The way to do this would be to have some sort of orbiter that can recieve and transmit the \u0022signal\u0022 to kerbin. This would pave the way for orbiter-lander missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be as if the antenna was pointing just next to Kerbin then your mission would be over, as if you ran out of power. Perhaps a movement penalty would occur, meaning the effect of the reactionwheels would be a bit lower or perhaps unreliable as a consequence of not entire commands are being recieved by the craft\u0027s antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
