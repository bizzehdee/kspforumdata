I have done many animations and for some reason the most simple one ever, extending an antenna, is causing in game fps lag. There are no errors in the debug window or logs that I can see related to this. Once loading the craft the physics warp turns from green to yellow and there is noticeable fps drops. The only way to fix it seems to be deploying the retracting the antennas. The physics warp then goes back to green and all lag disappears. I remember this being an issue before with other mods, most specifically the JEM from the ISS pack but I can\u0027t figure out what is causing it or how to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T07:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill don\u0027t know what was causing this but after editing other parts of the model and re-exporting a dozen more times it seems to have magically fixed itself.
