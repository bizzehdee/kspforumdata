To each their own, and I see lots of requests to add features to this mod, but IMHO, this is perfect. I can do completely blind rendezvous with this mod just the way it is. It is not overcluttered with xyz axis velocities and distances, everything you need to make a picture perfect slow controlled RZ is here.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ok, maybe 1 thing I\u0027d like to see. Often times I want to dock off rotation, rather than just the 30 degrees left and right at the top of the hud, could we get rotational marks around the full 360 degrees? Thanks, and it\u0027s not even a huge thing, it\u0027s just that for my space planes expecially, I often have to shoe horn them into a station off of the rotational axis.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the comments!

I\u0027m used to Lazor Docking Cam and those 6 degrees just visually appeared to be far greater to me on DPAI. I didn\u0027t realize the ticks on the reticle represented five degrees. It\u0027s not an exaggeration. It\u0027s just different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to see these two mods merge because I like NavyFish\u0027s analog visual representation of distance, and I like his visual design a lot. On the other hand, I really like Romfarer\u0027s mock camera image, plus it suits my docking style better. Which is best described as \u0022seat of my pants\u0022 -- why move along just one axis when you can careen around all three at once. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, both of these mods are fantastic.
