How accurate is the estimated time? Is it like within \u002B/-2secs?

So for a 15 sec burn I start at T-5. Using KES or MechJeb this results in long burns delta-V consumption match the originally predicted burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what engines to use, this is a loaded question. Technically the delta-V calculated assumes an instantaneous burn - or infinite thrust to weight ratio. The lower your TWR, the longer the burn and potentially less efficient burn - especially when in a highly elliptic orbit. The tradeoff is that the low thrust engines tend to have the best ISP which more than offsets the losses due to long duration burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to minimize losses due to long-duration burns is to break your maneuvers up. As an example, when attempting to get to Mun rather than performing a single burn to get away from Kerbin, perform multiple burns over a few orbits at periapsis to raise your apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazen","CreatedById":62704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T23:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the first method.

What I tend to do is cut the time of the maneuver in half, add two seconds (for throttle up time, since it\u0027s not instant in most cases), and burn that amount of time before the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is you want half of the burn before the mark, and half after it. Splitting it in half is a good enough estimate for most cases. However, if the maneuver is changing a large portion of your velocity, or if you\u0027re burning enough fuel that your TWR will change significantly, you might want to shift the timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zerro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zerro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.
