However, I\u0027m a much better artist than I am an electrician/programmer. This may take some extra time.\n\nI will be contacting the community for help. In return, I can offer my skills as an artist.\n\n-FULL THROTTLE!!

That defacing stuff has happened everywhere I worked (as tongue-in-cheek jokes) so I thought that the Kerbals would have some fun with their co-workers too! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n-It will be an evolving project, since I only know how to wire buttons and joysticks (from building MAME arcades) but I\u0027ve been learning electronics and programming lately and will\n\nsoon include LEDs, SoundFX, and digital readouts. I\u0027ve been drawing since before my earliest moments, so I thought I can come to the community for help regarding my wiring\n\nand programming and can trade my artistic talents ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThanks for your kind words, btw."}]}
