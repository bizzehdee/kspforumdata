All parts are available and visible in sandbox so hiding what parts are coming up in career mode seems to be pointless. I do find that unless i pick the correct nodes to research it can be tricky to progress further - which has already been said, and I agree that it\u0027s down to research balancing. Whether the parts are hidden or not players will soon memorise what is where, will put it into a wiki and it will make hiding things pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have said before that I\u0027d love to see several research categories and a more linear approach to research rather than an ever widening tree, to control research progress a bit better, rather than allowing people to cherry pick the best stuff all the time. A single category for each of the part types (Pods, control, propulsion etc) might be good, possibly separate categories for space places too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
