With the method I\u0027m going to share you can easily and repeatedly dock your ships together without using RCS at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need two ships with Mechjeb 2 installed on them, as well as matching docking ports. Once you have rendezvoused with your target ship in orbit and are within docking range (either done by hand or done with Mechjeb) simply select your target docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s the magic. Switch over to the ship you just met in orbit, select \u0027control from here\u0027 on the docking port that you plan to connect with. target the docking port of the new ship that you want docked and open SASS, TGT and press \u002Btarget\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow switch back to the second ship using ] or [, don\u0027t go to the tracking station and don\u0027t time accelerate. Both of which will end dual control cia mechjeb. Press control from here on your local docking port, now in SASS select TGT and \u002Btarget again. The two ships now being controlled by Mechjeb 2 will automatically point their docking ports at each other using magic torque, you simply need to use your main engine for a tiny puff of thrust to close the distance at between 0.1-0.3 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Will be making this into a video for my tutorial series, I just wanted people who don\u0027t watch that sort of thing to know as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: video uploading, here she is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyTTzJvZqjI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T03:55:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleven","CreatedById":60502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T20:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing to try this right now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T21:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding this to the Drawing Board \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EMy cunning plan is working!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firerider521","CreatedById":60860,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T21:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdding this to the Drawing Board \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EMy cunning plan is working!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENO!
