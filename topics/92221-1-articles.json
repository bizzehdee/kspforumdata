I actually requested Sarbian add a combined Ap kick and inclination change maneuver since GTO-\u0026gt;GEO has to be done manually if you want to combine them \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the impulsive assumption nodes makes is bad news. Centaur is bad enough, but trying to do the above on RCS rather than a solid kick motor is...heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I meant by the MJ point is that you can create a maneuver at AN or DN just to have the maneuver node icon as visible representation of where the AN/DN is. I don\u0027t know of anything that adds AN/DN indicators, though, sadly. Can look at how FinePrint adds them to its orbital conics and try doing the same for the active orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzzou","CreatedById":100703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T10:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPrecise node lets you place a maneuver node on AN or DN, and Engineer can tell your angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T11:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Buzzou\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Buzzou\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(...) and Engineer can tell your angle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only your angle, but even your \u0022time to AN\u0022 and \u0022time to DN\u0022, which I find even more useful.

I guess for now, I\u0027ll just rely on keeping \u0022Time to Equ. AN/DN\u0022 lined up with \u0022Time to AP.\u0022 The map view would just be a nice visual short-cut. The \u0022add point at AN\u0022 doesn\u0027t really work because I\u0027m trying to manually tweak the relative positions of the node line and apse line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathan: here\u0027s a trick for doing both at the same time:Set up MJ to do the inclination change. Take your circularization burn prograde dV and multiply by cos(delta_i) and sin(delta_i). Manually add these values to the prograde and normal components using precise node. The radial component is straight up addition or subtraction.
