This time, I kept things simple with a small lander that will do the return also, and no docking. Threw a lander together in a minute or so, stuck it atop my light lifter and sent it up. Circularised, then adjusted inclination with a couple of burns, then timewarped until it looked about like Minmus-rise by the map screen.

It was also the first real test flight for my heavy Eve-O-Tanker. The tanker performed surprisingly well, bringing more than two full Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks to the lander. While this tanker will return to LKO and be refilled there, I\u0027m still going to change the design for future ships of that type by realigning the thrusters to make docking easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I saw that a transfer window to Moho is open soon, so I started the design of a manned mission there. The ship is based on the 14000 dV design I posted yesterday, yet in addition it carries a relatively heavy lander (Mk2 can and enough fuel to land on Moho), so the total dV is slightly lower. Since a trip to Moho should not use that much dV, I might replace some of the tanks with smaller variants, in order to decrease the burn times. Or maybe I\u0027m lazy and leave it as it is, since fuel costs are not yet implemented in the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I have to be careful about: Jebbediah mustn\u0027t find out about this mission, for he might otherwise sneak in the Hitchhiker storage container and come along, while he actually should to stay close to the space center to be available for the Eve landing mission when finally the crew will be transferred.
