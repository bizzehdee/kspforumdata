You can set it to update every so often to show the satellite positions in realtime as they orbit, just like our map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it doesn\\\u0027t allow zooming out to see Lunar and other planet\\\u0027s orbits, but it\\\u0027s still fun. I know there are quite a few launches that had \u0027classified payloads\u0027 that don\\\u0027t show up on the list, but that\\\u0027s what you get when visiting the public tracking website ;D It\\\u0027s beautiful to zoom out to see the whole Geosynchrous band and then spin it slowly, looking at the ring of artificial moons we\\\u0027ve built for ourselves and the clutter in low earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s instructions on the page and the map view opens in a separate window, but the basics: left-click on one of the dots to see satellite name and orbit path, drag with left mouse button to rotate the view in 3D, shift-click zooms out, cntrl-click zooms in, menus at the top provide options. If you find a satellite you want to know more about, go to satellite, select, find it in the list, and click the sat info. button to display details in a new browser window. (the xxx R/B are discarded stages that are still in orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T22:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool link, also there is this one that shows all current NASA missions in our solar system at their live positions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eyes/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eyes/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T22:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice indeed.
