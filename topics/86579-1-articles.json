When my KSP updated today to v0.25.XX, I am now unable to connect parts together without gaps between the vehicle parts. When the vehicle is placed on the pad for launch, there are large gaps between the parts! What\u0027s the deal? I have been using KSP for 2 months before and never had this issue... Is it a settings issue?? Thanks in advance!
