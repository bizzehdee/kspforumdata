I think range is going to be an issue too even with substantial development. Compressed air might eventually become feasible for municipal vehicles but I doubt there\u0027ll be much consumer demand for them.\n\nEdit: I suspect poor economics did more to kill air car development than some mysterious murderer. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:31:44Z","Content":"I think they\u0027re impractical due to the immense energy requirement to \u0022refuel\u0022. Just look at the wikipedia article... a 360 kW compressor running for 5 minutes (that\u0027s 30 kWh of energy) just to put 2.5 kWh worth of air into the car\u0027s tank. 2.5 kWh... A Tesla Model S carries 85 kWh onboard with a full charge!\n\nThis is crippling. Because ultimately, if your energy source is clean (like solar), it all boils down to how you can best use that energy. And a li-ion battery with an electric motor just converts *so much more* of the harvested solar power into actually moving your vehicle. Even if mentioned theoretical improvements are realized, air compressors aren\u0027t going to get to that level. Ever. And battery technology isn\u0027t maxed out yet either, so citing theoretical future improvements equalizing the imbalance is moot. If anything, I\u0027d put my money on batteries *increasing* the gap. (This is actually a trend that has been crystallizing itself during the last 2-3 years - it\u0027s increasingly becoming clear that pure electric will begin to significantly outperform all other sensible options in the near future. Even hydrogen fuel cell tech is seeing its advantages in energy density melt away before the first series vehicles even hit the road, and efficiency-wise fuel cells were already worse. Battery tech is hauling ass right now.)\n\nAlso: air compressors are freaking loud, especially in the hundreds-of-kilowatts range. Compressed air decompressing and exhausting is loud. Electric charging is noiseless. Electric motors are very quiet. I know which one I prefer for my driving and housing comfort! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:38:30Z","Content":"Just my 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A2 here, but I\u0027d rather see Fuel Cells get a better stronghold in ground transportation.

The isentropic efficiency of compressors is around 80-90% in the best case scenario, as is the isentropic efficiency of turbines, so you lose 20% straight off the bat. Compression also heats up the air. Compressing air from 1 to 100 bar heats the air up 700K. That heat is just lost as the air is cooled and liquefied."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:57:23Z","Content":"I was dissappointed by this:\n\n[http://blog.caranddriver.com/deflated-peugeot-citroen-shelves-its-air-hybrid-technology/](http://blog.caranddriver.com/deflated-peugeot-citroen-shelves-its-air-hybrid-technology/)\n\nI don\u0027t see why operating an air pump would be so energy inefficient?\n\nIt should work well if truly cheap solar or fusion power became a reality.\n\nI\u0027m still waiting for the \u0022revolution\u0022 to happen from cheap \u0022printable\u0022 thin film PV systems :/"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T15:04:01Z","Content":"The only way I see Air Cars ever being used on a large scale in the world would be a \u0022peak oil\u0022 crisis situation, where the entire world would experience a huge and worsening fossil fuel shortage. Air Cars would be a quick, cheap, simple, and effective way to keep world economies limping on without oil. Electric cars are better, but the price could only go down so much, and there isn\u0027t much of a second hand market for lower class people to buy at cheaper prices. Small Air Cars could be mass produced, distributed, and sold very cheaply to keep people going to work, keep goods moving, keep things working.
