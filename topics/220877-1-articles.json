I\u0027ve tried logging on and resetting passwords on the store with all of my email addresses, I haven\u0027t gotten rid of any I\u0027ve ever used and have got NOTHING! Do I have to buy it again then or something? Was there a time limit where you had to migrate over? If so that\u0027s kind of frustrating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevermind, was able to figure it out. Turns out I do in fact have one email I don\u0027t use, fortunately I have forwarding set up for it so all good.
