When you\u0027ve traveled a long way from your lander in EVA on, say, Minmus, how do you go about finding your way back? I target the vehicle in map mode, but there\u0027s no indicators that I can see in normal view to help direct me. Am I just being blind and missing something? I suppose I could use the sun/skybox to get my bearings, like an oldschool navigator, but that sounds like a real PITA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T16:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T21:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you select the thing as your target the indicator turns yellow and is highly visible, if you are more than 60km away (Or have them turned off, press F4 to check) you won\u0027t see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T21:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpaceships need panic buttons in case you forget where you parked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll kidding asside, as Taki says, you should see an indicator and if not you have bigger problems because you are going to have a very long walk to get back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T21:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually 100km, not 60km, but otherwise that\u0027s correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T22:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eby the way, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-0-90-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-1-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENavHud\u003C/a\u003E works in EVA.. basically turning your world into a giant navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluding the target direction indicator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to bump this old thread, but I just wanted to shout out that NavHud mod. It not only makes the EVA navigation easier, but makes landing planes WAY easier too.
