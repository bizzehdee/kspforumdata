And the ethnicity thing is really messed up. Not only because it\u0027s racist and won\u0027t give any meaningful data, but it\u0027s also wrong in so many frikkin\u0027 other ways. Why is there a differentation between South, East and West African? Just Say African(Sub-Sahara) or Central African. And are you saying all Asians are either middle eastern, mongoloid, indo-aryan(Or indian-pakistan, as you call it), polynesian or chinese? Because that\u0027s what your survey says. Speaking of stuff your survey says, arctic canada and alaska aren\u0027t part of north america? Last time I checked, it was. And I\u0027m pretty sure bunching Maya and Inca together while having seperate Aztec options is also wrong, though then again there aren\u0027t any of any of those really since like 500 years...just say native latin american or something. In fact, if you wanna get any useful data, just ask for caucasian, middle eastern, african, asian, native american, and maybe indo-aryan. Or, if you don\u0027t want to offend anyone and not be racist and get even better data, just ask for nationality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T10:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a troll poll to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it isn\u0027t it needs redoing completely..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T10:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry guys but I\u0027m shutting this down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese polls are becoming far too personal and serve only as a source of argument over topics unrelated to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
