After 1.0.2 - I used the same design but this time couldn\u0027t reach past 50k without it tilting slowly and then spiralling out of control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- first thing that comes to my mind is elements of drag, design symmetry, fuel payload imbalance, - but all seems fine (seems so), and it worked a day before but not after?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I have tried all I can think of. Added and took off various parts, changed to very basic design, but anything that has the potential to bring me anywhere near the mun spirals out at around 30-40k.
