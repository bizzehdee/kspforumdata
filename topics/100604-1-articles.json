Took the keyboard and dunked it into a sink of warm (close to hot) water for a few moments, to let the sugar from the soda dissolve. Then pulled it out and drained it off, took it outside and shook the life out of it to get as much water out of it as possible. Then I packed it in a plastic bag full of white rice and sealed it shut. I let it sit about a week on a windowsill in the sun. The rice absorbed the rest of the water. After I took it out of the bag I let it sit for a day, then I plugged it in ... it worked again. That was many years ago though, and I don\u0027t know if today\u0027s keyboards can handle a dunking in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to take the whole thing apart, and use a spray \u0027contact cleaner\u0027, electronics supply store should have it... denatured alcohol is another option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T17:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to take it apart, remove the electronics - there\u0027s usually a small circuit board - and clean the rest.
