Furthermore, I could\u0027ve sworn I had it installed.\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t have it installed, and I can\u0027t find any reference to it either (neither Google nor forum search has helped so far..).\n\nSo: Was this just a dream, or is there really such a mod and my search skills have abandoned me?\n\n(Reason being, I, uh, I mean Chuck, may have come down ever so slightly harder than planned and may have slighly dented the lander. And of course Dunnard is fresh out of Grad school..)"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T20:39:47Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663-Magico13-s-Modlets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663-Magico13-s-Modlets) - possibly this one ( I had to dig through my download folder to find it, not easy to search for ), although I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve seen another one.\n\nEdit: I did!

(And hopefully next time I\u0027ll remember what to search for).\n\nEDIT: The mod is definitely running; the Kerbals just have accrued less experience points so far than I was expecting based on the stats in the [Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience).. Hmm.\n\nEDIT2: Nvm; re-reading the text instead of just looking at the tables highlights the important bit: only the largest chunk of XP around a given body counts. Which, IMHO, is pants.
