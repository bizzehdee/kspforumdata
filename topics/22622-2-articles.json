The current plan is to add six MPD engines, two types for each of the three stock part sizes. One type will produce more thrust, but will require more energy to run. Essentially there will be applied-field MPDs and self-field MPDs. Their thrust will be somewhere around the LV-N, with ISP in the thousands. To offset that, the power requirements will be massive, though quite how massive I\u0027ve not yet determined. I need to have a play about with stats to figure out something cool. As for VASIMR, I would like to do something like that, but it would require a plugin to do. Apparently a plugin to toggle between \u0022gears\u0022 is fairly easy to write so I may do it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore those however, I still need to get what I\u0027m working on finished and out for download. The Xenon tanks in particular are a step towards the MPDs, since you\u0027re still going to need a lot of propellent to run them. They may have high ISP but having 160 times the thrust of the Ion means they\u0027re going to consume the Xenon an awful lot quicker. Something to work out in stats though. I\u0027ll probably also change the stock Xenon resource so it doesn\u0027t draw from all tanks simultaneously and draws like liquid fuel and oxidiser. That would allow you to use Xenon asparagus or drop tanks, assuming I\u0027m not actually wrong and stock Xenon already works like that of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T21:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Wiki article is accurate, you could safely go with thrust in low 200-ish for big MPDs.

RLA scientists may have secretly just stuffed the box full of MMRTG\u0027s and claim it has better efficiency, so it is currently rated at the same mass and output as six stock RTG\u0027s. The overall plan for the Power Generation pack is to provide more power generation options for whatever purpose you need boatloads of power for. Since the current stock game doesn\u0027t have much that requires significant amounts of power, you may be stuck with using up all that juice with mods like Kethane, or my own Electric Engines. So what will the pack contain? The MMRTG will be moved across into it, the ASRG posted above, some stackable nuclear generators, medium sized solar panels, some really quite big solar panels, and possibly some ridiculously huge solar panels. To store all of that there will also be high-density batteries, essentially twice the mass and storage of the stock ones in roughly the same size part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to balance the Nuclear Generators, and to perhaps make the RTG\u0027s more interesting, I\u0027m planning to have them all run on a new resource called Blutonium Oxide, and maybe have the RTG\u0027s provide (effective) power for something like fifteen years, and the bigger generators would last five or less. I\u0027m also considering making them refuelable with the Kethane plugin by adding an ore version of the resource which can be refined and enriched with oxidiser to enable long term power. It wouldn\u0027t be terribly realistic, but it\u0027s better than creating a whole line of parts and resources to get to the fuel for the generators. That means I might be making a drill, converter and possibly a scanner as well. Plenty to do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also doing a little update to Stockalike to take advantage of the 0.20 texture sharing now that I have it figured out, and to redo the folders.
