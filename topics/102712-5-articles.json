I saw it happening before the rework and still see it happening but haven\u0027t had the time to test it independent of all other mods. I do know that I can open the servo editor and watch either GC or the external Memory Usage utility to watch it spool away. I can also confirm that I\u0027ve watched the memory remain stable without it open, or closing it and watching it stop. That said, I see no information in a log file or, exception monitor or anywhere else that points to a definitive source but thought that I would relay the same thing I\u0027ve been watching and wondering about for a while. Will be interested to see the results of where it\u0027s coming from and would be more than happy to try and help find some time to test it out in varying setups if needs be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, great job everyone on this mod - hands down my favorite thing to play with in KSP.
