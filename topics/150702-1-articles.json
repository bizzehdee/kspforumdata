I\u0027m not an expert in HL by any stretch of the imagination. I was planning originally to create 7.5m dirigible parts but skipped that and went right to 10m parts. I currently don\u0027t have plans for 15m or 20m parts; JewelShisen already has those in the works from what I saw. But, I\u0027ve set up the attachment nodes to let you easily attach dirigible parts end-to-end and side-by-side to make truly large vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2.5m parts I was referring to were for the gondola; I\u0027m just starting to do some concept designs for that too. Given that IVAs are a large time investment for so little return (most just look at them once or twice and then ignore them), and because highly detailed interiors eat into the rendering frame rate, I\u0027m looking more in terms of the Skyship or Goodyear blimp than Graf Zepplin.

I ran into a snag on the current design- not enough headroom for two decks- so I\u0027m doing some redesigning. It\u0027s a challenge to design something that meets my requirements (two decks, wide enough to host Buckboard 3000s on the wide flatbeds, look good as a gondola and as a rover, compatible with the Buffalo chassis system) but I\u0027m getting there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll look into the name plates, it does look like from my references that names for some airships are on the lower hulls. Some have them midships too. I\u0027ll have to think about the tails; meanwhile you can press \u0022R\u0022 to switch between radial and symmetry mode, The problem with the tails is that the \u0022\u002B\u0022 pattern makes the bottom fin strike the ground as you noted, unless you use absurdly long landing gear. Lately I\u0027ve been attaching the fins and then rotating the tail cone until the fins are at 45 degrees, an \u0022X\u0022 pattern. That seems to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have to cheat a bit and give the nose and tail cones the same lift capacity as the HL-10L. That lift capacity would be a bit much for the nose and a bit too little for the tail. Maybe try giving just the nose the lift of the HL-10L and see what that does. It\u0027s easy to do: just open the hl10NoseCone.cfg, find the envelopeVolume, and change it from 918.53 to 2500.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo help explain the planned flight deck parts, this might give you some ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022533d15a1c751e0cb4a0711b6def89115.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022620\u0022 src=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/53/3d/15/533d15a1c751e0cb4a0711b6def89115.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight deck parts would be akin to the carrier in the lower right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022as26.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JMVkNJPITvA/UeS34R7WmtI/AAAAAAACH4s/wc73Dtbgpec/s900/as26.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-30T15:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2016 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shnyrik","CreatedById":16014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T19:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222829996\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477813056\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153436\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirrliv\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, sirrliv said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one, I found that I wanted to remove the bottom tail fin as it is too large and impacts the ground on landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that reason Germans use 3-way symmetry on their Zeppelins-NT \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zeppelin2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.skavsta.se/bulletin/7/images/zeppelin2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirrliv","CreatedById":153436,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T20:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a similar note, I found this image of the first American rigid airship, USS Shenandoah, which clearly shows her lower rudder fin to be cut off so that it does not extend below the envelop, having a straight edge rather than curved.
