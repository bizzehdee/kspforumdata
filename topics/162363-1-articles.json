I successfully rescued the person, but could not find the hulk anywhere. Thinking that maybe it was in orbit, I cleaned up all of the orbiting junk (needed to happen anyway, but no luck. In the Tracking Station I could see her on the moon, but the hulk didn\u0027t show up then, and still doesn\u0027t now that she has bee rescued. The mission still shows that I have not completed that part of it. Any ideas?

This is some sort of bug. It\u0027s happened to me so many times that I don\u0027t even take these contracts anymore unless it says \u0022rescue so and so and his hulk\u0022 and it\u0027s in orbit. Then the Kerbal will be inside the ship and so it wont disappear. I can\u0027t even take the \u0022recover this or that piece of ship or debris\u0022, because it always disappears. The first couple times it happened at Duna, so I (perhaps wrongly) blamed it on Ike. But it also happened at Minmus, Bop, Pol, Vall, and Tylo. They were all stable orbits before disappearing, so a bug is about the only explanation. This has gone on in 1.1, 1.2, and now in 1.3 as well. With each update I think the problem will be solved, so I try again, but it\u0027s always the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-21T11:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on some mystery circumstances, sometimes (apparently) the hulk can be generated a few km above the ground.
