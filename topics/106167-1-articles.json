It wasn\u0027t until I brought my altitude up closer to 70km that I was able to perform a scan. Also I wonder what the point is of being in a stable polar orbit when you don\u0027t need to complete a single orbit to get data for an entire celestial body.

If I\u0027m going through the trouble of building a satellite, launching it and getting it into a very specific orbit, I want it to work like an actual satellite. I might add that resources on asteroids are just assumed it would seem. It just seems to be a rough percentage of the asteroid is resources and once those are gone you are left with an extremely lightweight asteroid. No scanning or anything is required. I guess I was sort-of hoping there would be a way to visualize this. I honestly was also expecting the asteroid to collapse once it was depleted, but since they don\u0027t I guess I\u0027ll make a sculpture out of them or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Wayland","CreatedById":16204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:26:04Z","Content":"I just put a sat into a polar orbit around the Mun and cannot perform survey.
