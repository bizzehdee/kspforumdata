Any sort of pasta with a smooth \u0026amp; sweet tomato sauce is also a favorite. I also like a straight lettuce or lettuce, onion, and tomato salad with italian dressing or my own special dressing that uses Ken\u0027s Steak House Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing as a base. I\u0027ve loved Sub sandwiches for as long as I can remember. Vanilla ice cream in a bowl or a milkshake has also been a long-loved favorite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also hate pancakes, or as you call them, flapjacks. I\u0027ve never been keen on any breakfast food now that I think of it; The only thing I\u0027ve ever liked in the breakfast category is toast, and that\u0027s good anytime, and can be used as part of a Canape, so it isn\u0027t strictly confined to breakfast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T04:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elearn 2 grill. i hate it when people overcook their meat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T05:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever heard of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favourite food is beefsteak with either cream pepper sauce or cream mushroom sauce, steak potatoes, green beans and bacon and some good vine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like sushi, fajitas and generally anything beef/pork(or boar)/turkey/fish that includes a piece of meat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, even though I\u0027ve been in many high class restaurants, nothing comes close to my father\u0027s cooking.
