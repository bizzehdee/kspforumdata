The ships mass\u0027s dry (without fuel) are 100 tons.

While it will be a VERY slow acceleration at the start, because of the fuel mass differences the first ship will have almost twice the delta V of the first one. (moving the fuel will be expensive in force, but eventually it will break even and exceed the ISP difference because you have so much more mass to use)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some real values:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100t vessel I just created dry weight (I am using some oxygen to get it to the weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA full interstellar fuel tank of hydrogen only has 11.5 tons of fuel in it.
