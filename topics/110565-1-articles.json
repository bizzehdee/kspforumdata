Once that\u0027s done, I set up a maneuver node to change the inclination from 95 to 0, warp while mining to refuel the tanks and engage mechjeb to handle the 8 minutes burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I find out that all that refueling had emptied the asteroid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is it worth it, or how is it worth it? I was thinking of grabbing the asteroid while it\u0027s still on solar orbit, so it can be directed to an aerobreak with Kerbin. Or is it better to try to capture D or C classes, since their slower weight means less fuel to maneuver them? But even then, if refueling something like three MK3 fuel tanks three times (plus monoprop and oxidizer for the vernors) can empty an E class asteroid, are asteroids worth it as refuelling stations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you couldn\u0027t do with a E class, that would probably be the same for a D class. Less fuel expenditure, but also less ore to mine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I tried to get a D class asteroid to do that, but I was too late (rendez-vous would have occur 1day after periaps). The asteroid had also a nearly polar orbit which would have taken a very long time to set to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best hope is to meet the asteroid out of SOI and change it course there. It should get to a most equatorial hyperbolic as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe aero braking is an option, I don\u0027t know. The problem is we have to wait to find a suitable candidate and have a try. Meanwhile, launch windows occurs and we don\u0027t want to miss them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou have to begin maneuvering the asteroid before it hits your SOI, preferably even 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of its encounter with kerbin to alter its close approach inclination and 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to close its approach to kerbin, ideally. More than likely 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of the encounter is more realistic. What it seems like that you\u0027re doing is maneuvering the asteroid at its highest relative velocity to kerbin and that is extremely expensive and generally unfeasible. Changing its orbit well before its encounter will allow a much cheaper option of hitting the atmosphere at a Pe of 15-40km and aerobrake it from there. I haven\u0027t done it before myself. You may have to decouple your ship until it has passed the kerbin atmosphere to prevent your asteroid redirection vessel from burning up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce attached to your asteroid at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or more from the encounter (relative to Kerbol) it should be easily possible to change an asteroids periapsis to 20-30km. In my sandbox test, the 2,500t asteroid needed to be at a Pe of 25km to aerobrake enough velocity to be captured. Any lower than that and it re-encountered the atmosphere too soon and it did not allow the redirect vessel to reattach and raise its Ap fast enough. ~10km higher and it would escape.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T10:08:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 10:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SanderB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I was thinking was to fully mine the asteroid.

By the time I had it near Kerbin it was almost out of juice and that was with a very long burn from a long way out. Was a bit of a pointless exercise really.
