But every time I try to fly it, It wont even manage to get off the runway. I have batteries so It has power, and the thrust to weight I believe is enough for lift off. And the CoL is behind the CoM so as far as I can tell there shouldnt be anything hindering this plane, but it just will not fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-mia1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/13081667_664095123728518_1381691122_n.png?oh=deef48aa981765b0a5efa456c16bc8af\u0026amp;oe=5721495E\u0022 alt=\u002213081667_664095123728518_1381691122_n.pn\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my craft at the moment. can anyone tell me what the heck the issue is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeKerbal","CreatedById":161827,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T14:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you press F12 does aerodynamic forces show up?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T14:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222538621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461593986\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162732\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThePhoenixSol\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, ThePhoenixSol said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my craft at the moment. can anyone tell me what the heck the issue is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith just giving it a quick look, I see two things that you could change.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst is to move the rear landing gear forward towards the CoM.

The reason to do this is because in KSP wings will only generate lift if they have some angle of attack.
