I could not find other help on the subject.\n\nProblem:\n\nWhen in the Space Center view, all of my buildings appear to be fully upgraded. However, upon entering a building, it has the limitations of a Level 1 building. Since it appears as a Level 3 building in the Space Center view, there is no way to upgrade the building. Where I presume the Upgrade button would be there is a button that says Fully Upgraded.\n\nConditions:\n\nFresh install (using a previous settings.cfg file, but everything else fresh) of the manually-downloaded and extracted ksp-win64-0-90-0.zip file.\n\nI ran the updater/patcher (2.0.200) from the launcher screen.\n\nGame says it\u0027s version 0.90.0.705 beta (x64) upon launching.\n\nStart a new career.\n\nSpace Center shows all buildings Level 3.\n\nEnter any building, and it has Level 1 limitations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T15:59:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WunderBeard**\n  \nSolved"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T15:36:41Z","Content":"That is a known bug with the Windows 64-bit version of KSP.
