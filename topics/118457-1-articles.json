It will have a new button on the pop-up called Process. Do that and the lab gains \u0022data\u0022, which is a separate thing from the actual experiment. You can now take the experiment back out and either fly it home or transmit it (or but it in a second, separate lab on another ship to process it again), but the \u0022data\u0022 derived from it stays in the MPL. Now you can put 1 or 2 Scientists in the MPL and they will start \u0022analyzing\u0022 the \u0022data\u0022, which consumes \u0022data\u0022 and generates science points over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, this is a way to get more science points out of fewer flights, as the \u0022analyzed\u0022 data usually amounts to about 5x what the original experiment was worth. In practice, however, this is completely useless and counterproductive because the \u0022analysis\u0022 takes eons of gametime, especially early in the game when you Kerbals have less than 3 stars. Just doing a single surface sample (which is all the MPL can hold at once) will take the better part of a year to complete. You can speed this up by having more experienced Kerbals or using multiple labs to crunch the same data (must be in separate ships). However, that takes a lot of money and effort to set up, and the faster it works, the sooner it all becomes obsolete and useless when you complete the tech tree. So I don\u0027t recommend ever doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only marginally useful function the MPL serves now is that it can store duplicate copies of experiments (like 2 Goo reports from the same biome), whereas capsules can only have 1 copy. Then you can return the MPL itself to Kerbin to get slightly more science per biome this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt used to be, the MPL had the essential function of being able to reset Goo and Material experiments for re-use, so any biome-hopping mission really needed an MPL, and the lander had to return to it after visiting each biome to drop off the science and have its experiments reset. But nowadays, a 0-level Scientist can reset Goo and Materials in the field so there\u0027s no more need of an MPL when biome-hopping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, MPLs have no practical value in 1.x.

This generally involves a small lander which can hop to several biomes before returning to orbit for refueling. Now that scientists can reset experiments, this is much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiting fuel station which is returned to after a few biomes has a crewed MPL. When the lander docks for refueling, I review all the experiments on board and select the analyze option for each one. This adds \u0027data\u0027 to the MPL which it then works through, over time, to produce further science. The thing is, the science is still in the lander, and will be transferred to a return vehicle which lands on Kerbin for the full value of all the science. This, of course, is a one-shot science bonanza. But if the lab has been filled to capacity with data (it took data from a lot of experiments to fill it up), it keeps churning out science over time, and depleting the data. The science return rate will slowly drop as this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few time-warps, you check back and find that science has built up, but the \u0027data\u0027 has depleted. The science that has built up may then be transmitted home (be sure to have sufficient power and an antenna). More data can then be added to increase the science return rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limitation in the early game of using inexperienced scientists does make it a bit slow, but time-warp usually happens at some point, and then you can get a chunk of bonus science. This can be significantly mitigated by leveling up scientists early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked for me.
