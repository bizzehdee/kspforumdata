I cannot get the drag model to work properly on it. For some reason it seems unaffected by atmospheric drag in any way. For exmaple, when in the atmosphere a typical pod will \u0022right\u0022 itself in a stable direction based on its shape. My pod does nothing. It acts the same way it does in a vacuum. It doesn\u0027t spin out of control, it just sits in whatever direction it was in before entering atmosphere and doesn\u0027t move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I am missing besides the configuration options?
