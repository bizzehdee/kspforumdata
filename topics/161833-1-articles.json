Its blazing hot surface kept it relatively un-touched. There was also the fact it wasn\u0027t very appealing\u00A0since Minmus was colonized and now people looked to Laythe, a\u00A0moon of Jool, with expectant eyes.

Maintenance crew 17 was going to duty. The great flats stretched out forever before them, never reaching the horizon. A kerbal grumbled something to himself, I ignored him. We needed to reach mass driver number 3 in eight minutes, and this was the speed necessary to reach there in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBill, why are we up at this crazy hour? It\u2019s supposed to be 3o\u2019clock at night, and we are driving faster than this machine can go with damaging anything.\u201D Jihed asked me, still half-asleep. He was notorious for his laziness, but he knew everything about Minmus there was, and circled it more than once so he was needed. Every one of them had to be up here or the colony would be lacking something. If they weren\u2019t needed, they would be sent back to Kerbin in the extremely cramped fuel shuttle that sent fuel back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause the MD is overheating because of some blown circuit. We have to fix it fast.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy the eight other kerbals in this jeep?\u201D he often crossed the line for disrespect when he was tired, I chose to ignore\u00A0it since every kerbal\u0027s cooperation was needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause we need them, I\u2019m the chief engineer of these MDs, and I\u2019m going to make sure nothing goes wrong.\u201D The responsibility rested heavily on my shoulders. If anything went wrong, somebody would replace me, that was a fact of life. The other day a worker who caused a brief electrical cut had been sent packing by the administrator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey reached the mass driver and the driver pulled over, \u201CEverybody head to the airlock. Move it.\u201D I hastened everyone along, every minute counted. There was more grumbling than usual, but that was because of sleep. Here on Minmus you were allowed only six hours of rest, and these laborers were losing an hour of sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airlock cycled slowly, almost too slowly for my liking. After a good while the doors opened and we stepped out into the night. Everything was pitch black. Somebody switched on their lights and the others followed suit. These lights illumined the long track, running out of the ice into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mass drivers symbolled the one reason that the five thousand inhabitants of Minmus City 1 stayed here. Each track was two kilometers and could accelerate barrels of raw materials back down to Kerbin orbit where they were guided into even longer tracks suspended in majesty which captured the barrel using magnetic leverage. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI felt proud of these works of machinery that I pioneered through countless difficulties. One of these difficulties was that overheating due to an extra-heavy barrel or multiple launches too close together. The wiring for such a complex object was immense, that was the reason behind that two-hundred and fifty electrical engineers were stationed here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGentlekerbs, let\u2019s get to work.\u201D I said taking the lead. They followed me dutifully, completely aware of the consequences if they didn\u2019t. I grinned to myself, the shoulders of authority were heavily laden but they were shoulders of complete authority which was a useful benefit on a world which wanted to kill you at every step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find the broken circuit and once repaired, the radiators turned on and started their duty. Not too see either, it had been a good hour\u2019s work and even I was sweating. As we stepped back a black object fired from the mass driver. It was there for an instant, then it wasn\u2019t. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the black speck flying off into infinity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one needed any word to lead them back into the transport for maintenance crew 17. Everyone stank, which luckily kept them awake during the uncomfortable drive back to their hard beds. Nobody had a smidgen of comfort here, the only more or less discomfort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe driver hit a rock, sending the transport into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCrap!\u201D one of the crew exclaimed. From the cockpit, a curse sounded. The transport tumbled. I had strapped myself in, but most of the crew hadn\u2019t so they went tumbling around the closed interior, cursing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHell!\u201D cried one as he slammed into the back of the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gripped the sides of the chair hard and grounded my teeth, this really stank. When we hit the ground, we were facing sideways. The transport was made of titanium fused with platinum, the hardest substance available on Minmus. We hit the ground with a crunch and the metal bent all around me. The floating crew were thrown against a wall, the smash of kerbal flesh against metal audible in such an enclosed space. The transport hit again, this time the driver managed to use the control thrusters in the front to land on the wheels. The control thrusters burned downwards, keeping us on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few seconds later the driver turned on the brakes and everyone\u2019s neck whiplashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy the crap did you do that!\u201D a crew member pouted, nursing a swollen jaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe driver unbuckled and deactivated the transport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re home, that\u2019s why you jackass.\u201D He glared at the others, daring them on. None took the challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI unbuckled, and felt my neck. It throbbed like nobody\u2019s business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou hear that, it\u2019s time for all of you to crawl into your comfortable feather beds and have good dreams.\u201D It was the customary speech which meant, \u2018Sleep until you\u2019re needed.\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals groaned as they stood up. Several had bleeding noses and one a cracked jaw. It was a running joke that if you hadn\u2019t broken your jaw, you weren\u2019t a Minmusling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sighed, it was a night out of three. I stumbled out the airlock with the rest of the kerbals and made my way to the administrative quarter. This quarter was built above ground, living space for twenty-five. You had to be good to have your living quarters here, and I was good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI entered block number 6 and made my way to door 12 in the row. When I pushed it, it opened. There were no locks or keys on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room was quite bare, each room was meant to be converted into an office once the sleeping period was finished. The bed folded up against the right wall and the desk the left wall. I climbed onto the harsh metal bed and pulled a sheet over myself. Tomorrow would be a new day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-12T03:36:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2017 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alpha 360\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T17:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EA Tale of Two Space Programs\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI woke up at the sound of the buzzer in my room. I sighed then readied for breakfast. Minutes later I entered the cafeteria and sat down at a table. Most of my friends were there, all minor chiefs of certain divisions. My brother, Bob, sat at the \u2018big boys\u2019 table with the administrator and the deputy administrator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI heard that MD 3 broke down yesterday.\u201D stated Fiffey, \u201CI also heard that your transport flipped on the way back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nodded, there was no denying that, \u201CBut MD 3 is back on line.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe nodded. She was concerned with the landing pad and lander maintenance, and was put a level higher than me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the newer, lower level chiefs leaned into the center of the table and asked, \u201CHave you heard the news? KSI is planning to send a manned mission to moho, of all places, in a year. It\u2019s causing quite a commotion.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiffey piped up, \u201CHa, they\u2019ll get nowhere. We have already since a hundred probes to the surface and they know it. It\u2019ll be completely fruitless. Look at us, does KSI have any colonies? No. Does KSI have all the infrastructure in place for planetary colonization? No.\u201D\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the veterans interrupted her, an older skotch gentlekerb, \u201CYou\u2019re forgetting one thing lassie, and that\u2019s that we\u2019re all on the same side. I worked for KSI in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for three years before coming up here. They are the ones who have all the fancy equipment in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E which are receiving our exports.

I was very loyal to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, international space program, and I viewed KSI with my nose in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe elder decided it was fruitless to press the delicate subject and resumed his morning meal. In was in the middle of a conversation with the chief habitat engineer on how crews could be stationed at MDs which could repair it at a moment\u2019s notice when Bob beckoned me over to the big boy\u2019s table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood luck.\u201D Fiffey wished me well as I stood up and went up to by my brother\u2019s side.

Listen, I have admired you for a while and now I realize that you have admired me for a while also. Why don\u2019t we go out on a date just to celebrate my promotion?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, whose cabin are we going to feast at?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMine, I can push a few favors here and there to get us adequate supplies.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll be there at eight.

Are you with me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gave it only a second\u2019s thought, looking back I should have thought more, \u201CYes, what do you want me to do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the beginning of my troubles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T13:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0A Peculiar Arrival\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next week important news came to me. I had been promoted in a bare bones ceremony of a few dozen kerbals witness and a simple, \u201CYou\u2019re the chief engineer now, get to work.\u201D Laxness was not practiced habit on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read the news on my desk, my brow furrowed in concentration. It read, \u2018The chief science director of KSI, Werhner Kerman, had proposed a visit to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s colony on Minmus. He says that the transport to the colony has been arranged with KSI officials and the goal of this visit is to investigate how the Minmus colony is run and to observe the inner working of the social society.\u201D It went on to say that Werhner was pleased to have the opportunity to work with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and that sharing of knowledge is vital for space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was rereading it when Fiffey entered my room, \u201CBill, an amateur telescope has picked up a large lander heading for the Minmus station and that this particular lander has inflatable habitats on the side for extra room. Please tell me who or what it is.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grinned at her, then I told her, \u201CIt\u2019s a VIP, a big deal VIP. From KSI to, quote on quote, investigate how the Minmus colony is run and to observe the inner working of the social society.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA psychologist?\u201D Fiffey\u2019s face screwed up in disbelief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA scientist.\u201D Her face didn\u2019t show any revelation on who the VIP was, and I left it at that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell me plainly.\u201D She demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI smirked even wider, \u201CIts confidential, I already gave you plenty of hints. Why else were you here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked around, trying to counter my ace, but then she hung her head in defeat, \u201CWe need more material and kerbpower to repair launch pad 1, you remember that the cargo transport we since back full of metals. It broke the ice underneath the launch pad, not to mention what happened to the actual launch pad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can get you the materials, but not the manpower. Remember we are building another mass driver, you will have to drive yourself and your men through the night. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shrugged, \u201CYou\u2019re a jerk, but I can manage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to return a compliment, \u201CYou\u2019re a whinner, can you return to your work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe rolled her eyes and left room 12.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs she left Bill got a call from the administrator, \u201CThis is your boss. Have you read that clip of newspaper I sent?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, I have. Everything will be shipshape, I promise.\u201D Bill thought of all the things needed to get done, a blown circuit in a solar array, the landing-pad, the hot water heater had a pressure leak and constant observation on everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf there is a mash-up with Werhner, you\u2019re fired instantly. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll place you with somebody else with enough sense to keep their job. I hear.\u201D The administrator had been all smiles up to this point. Bill suspected it was to give him a bit of wayward movement to get comfortable. No there was none of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next two days were a nightmare for Bill. He was rushing to and fro with crews engineers behind him. The solar panels were fixed, the interiors cleaned and scrubbed down, the launch pad repaired just in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the morning of the third day, Bill stood outside with five hundred kerbals who could be spared on the moment to attend to the VIP\u2019s arrival. Bill wiped the visor of suit, then remembered he could get the sweat off his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere it was. A streak of blue in the black sky as the nuclear powered landed was making its deorbit burn. The light reflected off of the object for a brief instant, a flash of light brighter than any ordinary star. The blue light beginning to grow brighter. A star was obscured by its body. Short, squat, and ugly as crap was the general descriptions of the landers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E armada. It crossed in front of the sun, a long black shape with unique curves. It was now descending straight for the pad. It was painted a yellow and black, like a bee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe yellow name on the side read, \u201CThe Yellow Jacket\u201D. It was now at 50 meters, and falling at twenty meters a second. A quick burn later and the beautiful creation was sitting smugly on landing pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hatch opened on the bottom of the vehicle and three Kerbals stepped out in single file. Their visors weren\u2019t transparent like ours, they reflected the sunlight, making them looked like burnished bronze or gold. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one in the front faced me, then the gold/bronze shade slide upwards and a kerbal looked out from the helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an awkward silence for a few seconds as we searched for each other\u2019s links, but it only took a second to connect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m Werhner Von Kerman, chief scientist of KSI.\u201D He introduced himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shook his hand, \u201CI\u2019m Bill Kerman, chief engineer of the Minmus colony.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took a little while for introductions to be made to everyone important. Fiffey was a little troublesome, and gave me a mischievous glance as she pretended spit on the ground, even when she was wearing a helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI switched to our private channel, \u201CFiffey, stop that this instant or you\u2019re fired!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen did you get too big for your boots, mr. bossy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gave her a meaningful glare, then guided the VIPs into the base. I was fairly interested with the Werhner\u2019s party. Werhner was an older gentlekerb who was energetic for his age of 63. He was inquisitive on everything like the materials used in the building of these tunnels to the closed-loop life-support malfunctions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a psychologist with him. He was a chirpy little fellow which was surprising given his job. He was also the most difficult to get out of a bar as I later discovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last fellow, Lejyl, I found most intriguing though. She was very tall for a kerbette, but she was very much a beautiful kerbal. She was thin as a wire and she walked slightly unstably but she didn\u2019t seem to be a weakling. She had introduced herself as Werhner\u2019s personal assistant. I thought there was more to her than meets the I, but I didn\u0027t have time to dwell on it. We were on our way to the administrator\u2019s office when a slab of concrete went hurdling through space directly at our small party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-13T17:05:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2017 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alpha 360\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
