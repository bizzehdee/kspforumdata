It would be great to see wich port is the parent one to each other etc. For this it is reqired, to know the right parent to set it in the save file so the ports can undock. However, this depends on the build order of your ship wich is not really guessable after you put two pre made ships together to one big one....\n\nAs space stations are made up of different subasseblies it is not clear waht parent number one docking port has. \n\nThis sould be a real simple request, all what is needed is as ingame filed who displays the correct parent vars for two docking ports. So we can see (maybe higlight?) what parent number is the right one for the two docking ports. \n\nIf somene is interested, please read: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5)\n\nThanks\n\nManuel\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T20:59:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:22:39Z","Content":"As I get time, I plan on putting up a docking port fix (in my stock bug fixes).
