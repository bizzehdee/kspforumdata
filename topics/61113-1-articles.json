I\u0027ve got my first eve launch window coming up soon in my career mode save, and I wanted to get some science done in the atmosphere. Normally I\u0027d just make a conventional landing probe with parachutes and all the usual gubbins, but I thought I\u0027d take a stab at making a glider instead. I\u0027ve not done much more than an eve flyby before, and I\u0027m not exactly an expert when it comes to planes/atmospheric flight, but the glider itself seems to fly really well on Kerbin, and, I assume, should be just as good on Eve (as I understand it, I\u0027d be getting much more lift due to the thicker atmosphere, right?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue, however, is getting it into orbit. Every time I strap it onto a rocket the entire thing spins out and wobbles around madly like Jebediah on crack, once I get too fast. I\u0027ve tried multiple rocket designs, but it just doesn\u0027t work; I assume this is due to the lift from the wings causing problems, but I don\u0027t how to counteract that. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escreenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3317200789733345457/A2CFEE02B3407BBF159F6274C7CAE3AC2A8E7579/\u0022 alt=\u0022A2CFEE02B3407BBF159F6274C7CAE3AC2A8E7579\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the glider itself isn\u0027t the best thing on the planet, but it works, so I\u0027m happy with that.

That small engine on the glider is just for short bursts to extend my glide time a bit, or to get in the air again if I land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked the CoM and CoL, the CoL is always behind the CoM on the glider. I\u0027ve tried doing the same for the rocket, but even with a bunch of tail fins it still wants to flip about when it gets above 100m/s or so. As I said, the glider itself works fine on its own, it just doesn\u0027t like being on the rocket at all. I\u0027ve used multiple reaction wheels on the rocket, I can\u0027t fit one onto the glider since the body is made of the tiny probe parts, and I want to keep the weight down anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T00:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe try taking it easier as you boost.

Obviously Eve doesn\u0027t actually have biomes yet, but one can pretend, I guess.

But all that lift is probably what is causing your rocket to tumble. Just stapping wings to the bottom of your rocket might not fix that.

Once you strap a rocket to the bottom, I\u0027m sure the CoM shifts back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso realize the CoM indicator in the SPH lies to you once you put landing gear on. In flight, they actually have zero mass or drag (ignored by physics). So do all your CoM/CoL designing with landing gear off, then put the gear on.
