Or is that just something we have to live with?\n\nCould you give the parachutes an oversized collider so that they can bump into each other and spread out like real parachutes, rather than phasing into each other with magic?\n\nAlso, in regards to the change in contracts, I think it would be better if, rather than making those basic contracts insta-accepted or however it will work, you could just combine them into 1 contract that still has to be accepted.\n\ni.e. the first contract has all of the altitude records as objectives in the same contract, so you still have to accept it (seems like a better mechanic, rather than just getting money out the blue for doing things you\u0027ll do anyway) and you would get the money for each objective as you complete them, with a big bonus at the end of them all (orbit). Other ones could be Explore the Kerbin System, including all objectives for exploring the Mun and Minmus, or Explore the Jool system, including Jool and all the moons in one(with a MASSIVE payday at the end of it)."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T05:34:21Z","Content":"The impression I got from Feb 24 Devnote Tuesday below, was that they MIGHT split along more than 2 vertical lines.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So will a single fairing that\u0027s 10 \u0022pieces\u0022 tall and 4 \u0022pieces\u0022 around count as 40 parts, 4 parts, or 1 part?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s only one part, which is the fairing as a whole.

How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings.

With the post there it\u0027s hard/impossible to fit a tiny rover.\n\nXenon tank: Maxmaps mentioned that the larger container size is a more efficient choice than smaller sizes because it uses less material (ie has a lower dry weight) than stacking multiple smaller tanks which hold the same volume. Will this be true of other fuel tanks? IE it\u0027ll be more efficient to use one large fuel tank than 2 smaller tanks which hold the same total fuel volume because the dry weight would be lower on the larger tank?
