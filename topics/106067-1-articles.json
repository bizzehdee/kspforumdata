When it was integrated into stock they made it a little more tolerant, so all you really have to do is put your satellite in a position that the little orbit lines look like that match up. It will clear quite quickly without needing to worry about really any numbers at all, you really don\u0027t even need to look at Ap, Pe, or Inclination, you can do it entirely by sight. Just make sure you are orbiting in the right direction, the little moving indicators tell you which way you should be traveling. One of the most common mistakes is to launch into an equatorial orbit only to find out it should be a retrograde equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zhollett","CreatedById":62547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thats good information, and I get it, but it still doesn\u0027t really answer my initial question (unless your answer is \u0022just eyeball it\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am doing now to launch in the proper direction is place my craft on the launch pad, and then go into map mode and ffwd time until my craft is roughly lined up with the orbit of the contract, then launch and try to keep my degrees roughly matched up.
