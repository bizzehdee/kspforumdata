This doesn\u0027t pose much of a problem usually, because you only have to suffer through it for a few moments after liftoff, and the ultimate target is only the Mun or Mimus. With nearby targets such as these, the according vehicles don\u0027t grow TOO too big. Some of us might chug along abit at first, but after you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, its easy going on our somewhat slower CPUs and GPUs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed a trend in the Kerbal updates: every new version brings with it more lag. I suspect this version will be no different, particularly because of all the new things to simulate (more celestial bodies, higher detailed background sky, physical kerbals inside the cockpit, etc.). Now, when we launch an interplanetary rocket, it will be by no means small. The rockets we take to other planetary systems will no doubt have many times more parts and pieces than our mun and minmus rockets. coupled with the expected increase in lag, I wouldnt be surprised at all if the game simply crashed before it even rendered on the launchpad (on those of us who have budget PCs anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy request is that along with all the other cool stuff coming in 0.17, some time is invested in making enormous performance improvements (multicore support (if it isnt there already) would be nice too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T01:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the ball is in unity\u0027s court to make the physics multi-core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shortsonfire79","CreatedById":10824,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T01:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAddendum:DunaLab!
