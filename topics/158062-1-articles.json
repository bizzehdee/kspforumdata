I couldn\u0027t find a similar idea on the forum on my quick search, so forgive me if this was already discussed before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is taking part development to the next level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of having a set of parts offered by the game or other mods that you can simply unlock based on the science points you have, you actually develop these parts yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, you can dig for ore, find a set of metals with different properties, develop a new type of combustion chamber based on these new metals that allows for a higher compression rate, combine different techs into testing benches, experiment with different compression ratios, materials and fuels and watch them blow up when you go overboard, finally settling down on a value that proves to be efficient and reliable, and using it on your rockets. Then maybe on another planet, you can dig a new type of metal that allows you to build more powerful engines, etc. I love the idea of trial and error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe smelting 2 new types of metal you just discovered, creating a brand new type of metal with new properties, comparing them to what you already had, building, testing....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod would provide the player with a testing bench which provides part information, such as temperature, thrust, weight, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, and more, and would let the player control the amount of fuel injection and compression rates on the fly during these tests, to find out the sweet spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SpaceX_Testing_Merlin_1D_Engine_In_Texas\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/SpaceX_Testing_Merlin_1D_Engine_In_Texas.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t have to be limited to engines, I guess, but would be a good start. I for one would certainly spend hours and hours creating new tech out of nothing, testing again and again to find the sweet spot, and finally using it and feeling proud of it. Would be pretty awesome seeing people here on the forums discussing about the new compounds they\u0027ve created and discovered. The mod would be set to give each metal/compound/material/ore random different properties when you start a new game, so each time you play it\u0027s a different experience, instead of already knowing which ones are the best and what combination works best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod would also add the option to uprate an engine to around 125% of it\u0027s intended thrust, for heavy launches, but with a higher probability of catastrophic failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if I managed to illustrate my idea well enough, I\u0027ve got so much going on in my head at the moment, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know a bit of 3D (for creating new parts) but kinda hate coding so I\u0027m probably not the right person to start the development of something this big... but the idea is out there for anyone interested. =)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-23T00:39:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2017 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by JeeF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeeF","CreatedById":143053,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-23T04:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I was hoping for a reply after 125 views...

Your idea seems to be distinguished by the amount of detail you want to see on the hardware development side.

For instance, why not create a few mock-up screenshots in mspaint for the screens where you\u0027d be doing all this experimental metallurgy and materials science work? Show us the engine nozzle lab.\u00A0Show us the screen where you design a testing bench and the screen where you turn a successful testing bench into a production part. Think about what needs to be shown in each window and what actions the user needs to be able to take, then turn that info into displays and buttons. Get feedback and iterate till it\u0027s clear and polished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen start specifying how the materials will be generated/populated on the planets and how they interact. You don\u0027t need to be able to write code to design the rules that would govern this. Will it be the same mystery metal names with randomized properties each time, or randomized names? Will there be more than 8 of them, fewer than 20, unlimited? Which specific properties of each metal will the game track for part simulations? How will they be randomized, with what distributions? How do the properties interact when the user tries to make an alloy or build a part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now my reaction is, \u0022I dunno, that sounds really complicated,\u0022 but if you\u00A0can lay out the vision at a sufficient level of detail, it\u0027ll be easier to convince a C# programmer to fill in the technical blanks for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeeF","CreatedById":143053,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-23T12:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah Im working on a concept to be able to show, I was just interested to see replies to gather whether or not people were interested or liked the idea, and whether or not this has been tried or discussed before.

It gives the option to select material used for combustion chamber/nozzle/pumps etc. select size and shape of\u00A0the combustion chamber and nozzle, select fuel pressures and such, and you can do this for every part in the game, guns, reactors, hulls etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever trying to accomplish this in KSP would be an absolutely massive undertaking and not one that just one or two developers could pull off. You are essentially asking for someone to develop an entirely new game and integrate that into KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust off the top of my head there is one glaringly massive problem that would need to be overcome and that is how KSP loads and handles parts. The ability to generate at runtime a new part cfg is something that, to my knowledge at least, no modder has been able to achieve. The closest thing would be Shadowmage\u0027s procedural parts in SSTU, and that took an incredible amount of work in his(or hers I don\u0027t actually know) plugin to get already loaded parts to generate new MODULEs at runtime and change parameters already loaded by a\u00A0MODULE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel it would take the combined efforts of the likes of ferram, sarbian, Shadowmage, Angel-125, and Rover Dude to accomplish something like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for being such a negative nancey here, it\u0027s an insanely\u00A0cool idea\u00A0that sounds super awesome, but is absolutely gargantuan in scope, at least as described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you abstract\u00A0things a little bit it could work though. But you would essentially just end up with a more complex version of KR\u0026amp;D...
