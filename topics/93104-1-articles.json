I dunno, it just felt a bit overwhelming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of this is going to stop me from playing the game, but I wondered if anyone else had the same feeling of drowning in a sea of contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T14:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a good rule of thumb should be to never let the list become scrollable at the lowest common screen resolution.
