To be clear, I\u0027m not asking for more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who has ever removed Oxidizer or Liquid fuel from an LFO tank knows that you will not be able to use the part at full volume, wasting space and becoming difficult for aesthetics and balancing. I would like some sort of variable fuel composition slider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis slider would allow one to increase the volume of one type of fuel as the other is decreased, allowing one to utilize all available volume for fuel. There would still need to be an option to carry the tank at less than max volume though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasier Explanation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx. I have a spaceplane that needs extra liquid fuel. I take the LFO adapter and remove some oxidizer to give the jets more fuel to run on to keep fuel balanced. But now I\u0027m not using the full volume of the tank. Instead, I would have a slider (on the tank) that slightly decreases oxidizer while proportionally increasing liquid fuel. Or greatly increases LF when greatly decreasing O. Or totally removing O and making the total fuel volume composed of only LF. Or Vice versa for all three of the former.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T21:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the devs first described \u0022tweakables\u0022 about a year and a half ago, it was made to sound like it was \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what you have described.
