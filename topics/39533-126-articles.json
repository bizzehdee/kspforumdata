One being the minimum and maximum firing range, or some allotted amount of time per turn so that the games are not just a tic tack toe competition. Not because of his ships but because of mine. If I fought a fleet with long ranged weapons like mine the winner would be determined by who goes first as long as we are equally skilled in maneuvering a guided missile and have the same amount of ships. I don\u0027t think that the answer is real time battles because then hitting someone with the amount of ammo each ship carries and the speed or accuracy of each projectile is highly unlikely especially with part lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply a minimum and maximum firing range would fix the issue on both sides allowing the possibility of a miss with SRB\u0027s and the chance to strike back at ships with an extra planetary weapons range. It will allow for longer more interesting battles that take more than four full turns and reduce the massive advantage of going first when both players are very experienced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is of course not a demand but rather a question on how people feel on the matter of making battles more challenging and give a sense of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that this would be an optional set of rules for more experienced players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
