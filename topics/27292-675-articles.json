I\u0027m still weird about career mode so I just made a Science game and started to go at it. Probably since the days when I spent hours on end playing were back before there was a career mode and it never sat right with me... So I started building some crappy looking stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this was my first rocket in this game to make it to stable orbit.

Everything on the launch went fine, I separated the fairing parts and was cruising to a better inclination for scanning, then the probe started spinning dead on the dark side of Kerbin. The battery resource meter said 0/15 even though I had 6 small batteries on board. I started thinking, oh crap I read somewhere that you can\u0027t use certain things inside service bays! I thought I\u0027d have to scrap the mission. Once I got back into sunlight I opened up the bay and saw that (duh) not one but all six of the batteries were set to lockout, AND it was oriented in a way that barely charged anything while it was in the sun.

Had a TR-2V test in orbit contract that paid \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A150k, so I built a little SSTO sounding rocket (the \u003Cem\u003EDerpnaught 7h\u003C/em\u003E) to do the job. Aside from it wanting to fly backwards once the engine was turned off, all went well with that mission and I was able to retrieve it for a nice little profit. Also had a Nerv test in Minmus orbit; since I\u0027d recovered some science from when Berris had brought back her last group from Mun, I went ahead and unlocked the Nerv engine so I wouldn\u0027t have to keep a hold of that contract anymore (still keeping a hold of one for an Aerospike test on Kerbin just so I\u0027ve got access to the part) and sent up a cheap little probe to go take care of that. It\u0027s now en route to Minmus and should arrive in two weeks or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter turning down a tourist contract (was okay except that one of the tourists wanted a sun-dive; I\u0027ve already got one of those in progress and I\u0027m not confident of its chances of success), I got a contract to perform pressure test on Kerbin. The waypoints were in the vicinity of KSC and as a whole the contract paid something close to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1120k, so I went for it. Designed the \u003Cem\u003EPressure Cooker 7\u003C/em\u003E and off I went. Plane\u0027s handling was okay; had some issues with pitch control in the trans-sonic but that\u0027s not unusual for a tail-less delta and canard configuration. Whole flight took about forty minutes RL and I retrieved the plane intact - total lost revenue for the craft was fuel, a mere \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1300 for a really nice profit margin. Picked up another Minmus rescue contract; since I\u0027ve already got folks there (Jeb and \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird 7\u003C/em\u003E are parked at Minmusport at the moment), I\u0027ll need to see if I can squeeze in a quick rescue mission. Possibly tonight. Fuel\u0027s a concern but not a big one since a Mun Buggy is on its way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plume \u0026amp; Akakak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Plume \u0026amp; Akakak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETime to \u003Cem\u003Ereturn window\u003C/em\u003E : 121 days.\u003Cp\u003EBob conversing with the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is why I never send them alone... though I am suddenly missing a kerbal from my Minmus mining outpost.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said...
