Basically, liquid-fuel rockets come in three flavors: kerbolox, burning kerbosene and liquid oxygen; hydrolox, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen; and hypergolic, burning hyprazol and nitrox. The fuel ratios are simpler than in Real Fuels: 37.5% kerbosene/62.5% LO\u2082, 75% LH\u2082/25% LO\u2082, and 45% hyprazol/55% nitrox. All fuels are adjusted to take up 1.0 liter, including monoprop, solid fuel, and xenon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRequires Community Resource Pack, Cryo Engines, and B9 Part Switch; the latter is only required because all the stock hydrolox engine configs would be a straight copy of its patches, and I\u2019m debating whether it\u2019s worth duplicating. The fuel switcher here \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E override Cryo Tank\u2019s; I\u2019m used to modding only for myself and nuking every patch with a FINAL tag in Mod Manager, so paying attention to order is still a bit new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the future, I\u2019ll be working on updating resource configs, especially for Rational Resources; I\u2019m still thinking through numbers on that. I have a config for kerbolox fuel cells, which will eventually go here. I\u2019m sure there are a million things I\u2019m forgetting to mention, just like \u201Chey, I should\u2019ve included CRP, B9PartSwitch, and Module Manager in the upload.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all came about because I was wishing for an \u201Cin-between\u201D fuel mod, like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support: enough of the flavor of a more detailed mod (TAC-LS or Real Fuels) to make things interesting, but not enough to bog down in bookkeeping. I mean, seriously, I\u2019ve crunched so many more numbers than I need to for \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E much detail; I don\u2019t need to spend \u003Cem\u003Eeven more\u003C/em\u003E time in Excel than in-game. So when thinking about it, I misread \u201Ckerolox\u201D as \u201Ckerbolox,\u201D and most of the rest of it came pretty quickly. \u201CHyprazol\u201D is obviously a stand-up guyization of \u201Chydrazine\u201D and \u201Chypergol\u201D (with a brief stop at \u201Chyperkol\u201D), and \u201Cnitrox\u201D is the best I could do for N\u2082O\u2084; it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s a start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/2582/Akme%20Fuel%20Depot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpacedock\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/grylliade/AkmeFuelDepot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGithub\u003C/a\u003E; probably will go on Curseforge too, eventually, but not right now.
