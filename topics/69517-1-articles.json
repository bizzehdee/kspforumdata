If the moon suddenly completely stopped in its orbit and began to fall towards the earth, what effect would that have on the earths position in relation to is. I can visualize what would happen, both bodies would spiral together (assuming both bodies where just single points for the sake of the maths) Is there an equation which can back this up and include for the movement of both bodies relative to each other instead of just the movement of the moon?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T11:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKepler\u0027s/Newton\u0027s laws hold for two bodies as well, with the center being the barycenter.
