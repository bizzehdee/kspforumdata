I had previously released a two kerbal SSTO called the [A-2 Masamune](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123470-The-A-2-Masamune-%28Mun-Minmus-SSTO%29), but it had various problems and the lander could only carry one kerbal. I looked at the feedback and decided to completely rebuild the A-2 from the ground up, fixing all the problems and giving it a proper two kerbal lander. I am happy to present the A-3 Masamune!\n\n![uc?export=view\u0026id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdbE15cXJBckJsQjA](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdbE15cXJBckJsQjA)\n\nImprovements over the [A-2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123470-The-A-2-Masamune-%28Mun-Minmus-SSTO%29):\n\n~ Better design produces zero torque\n\n~ 5.4% less mass and 9 less parts (only 56 parts!)\n\n~ Lander has more delta-v and 2 seats\n\n-Instruction Manual-\n\n1. Use the air breathing engines to fly up to around 10,000m, while ending up around 350m/s in speed.\n\n2. Get your nose around 5 degrees north of the horizon, then just let it ride to around 21,000m and 1,475m/s.\n\n3. When you start losing power, press 1 to switch to closed cycle. Pull up to get your apoapsis above 70k before running out of oxidizer.\n\n4. While coasting to apoasis, hit space to activate nuclear engines. Use oxidizer if any and nuclear to circularize your orbit. \n\n5. Use your nuclear engine to do a orbital transfer to Mun or Minmus, then circularize your orbit when you get there. \n\n6. When you run out of liquid fuel, enable the reserve tanks inside the wings while at zero throttle.\n\n7. Press 3 to open your cargo bay doors. Then, have the two Kerbals go into EVA mode and board the \u0022Bulldog\u0022 inside cargo bay.\n\n8. Undock with the ship, switch to the Bulldog and use RCS to get out of the bay. Finally, click \u0022control from here\u0022 on the probe core.\n\n9. Press 0 to activate engines, then land and return to orbit. When close to the ship, click \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port.\n\n10. Lightly tap RCS to dock with the ship. The lander is extremely small and light, so only quick taps are needed.\n\n11. Once docked, unboard the kerbals from the Bulldog and get them back inside the ship. Press 0 to disable the Bulldog engine.\n\n12. Preform a orbital transfer back to Kerbin. You can easily aero brake to save fuel and / or slow down.\n\n13. Once back in the Kerbin atmosphere, press 2 to disable your nuclear engine and 1 to enable your air breathing engines.\n\n14. Cruise down to the landing site of your choice for a safe, powered landing.\n\n15. \\*OPTIONAL: Build and load a refueling truck, then dock/refuel the A-3 to do it all over again!\n\n-Custom Action Groups-\n\n1 = Switch R.A.P.I.E.R. engine mode / toggle air intakes.\n\n2 = Toggle Nuclear engine.\n\n3 = Toggle Cargo Bay doors.\n\n4 = Toggle night time landing lights.\n\n5 = Toggle ladder.\n\n6 = Toggle docking port heat shield.\n\n9 = Toggle cockpit lights.\n\n0 = Toggle lander engine.\n\n-Basic Stats-\n\nMax Weight: 29,637kg\n\nDry Weight: 13,857kg\n\nMax AB speed: ~1,480m/s (normal end of air breathing stage)\n\nMax CC speed: ~2,0??m/s (normal end of closed cycle stage)\n\nDelta-V left in 75k orbit: ~2,700m/s (nuclear engines)\n\nVariations in lander delta-V: \n\n 2,078m/s (with two kerbals, normal configuration)\n\n 2,225m/s (with one kerbal, unbalanced!)\n\n 2,397m/s (no kerbals, probe mode)\n\n[Click here to DOWNLOAD the CRAFT FILE!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByBa_yWHU4TdT1pzbUVIT3B1M2s/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Click here for SCREENSHOTS of a successful mission!](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByBa_yWHU4TdfndZMkpySUlIVGNTcjhwbzZENkx2a1RPUEtlY2lYSko4OThGd0JqblJteW8\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nWhat do you people think of my second generation SSTO?
