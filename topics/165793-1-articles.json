Alternatively one could use a variable speed motor for the tail but for the sake of detail madness, a fully fledged tail would be sweet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if it is possible to have a \u0022collar\u0022 part around a mast or if the mast would need to be in 2 pieces, one below and one aboe the swashplate assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMad dream or doable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T14:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, as a bit of a heli nut myself I can see the why,\u00A0 sadly unless i\u0027ve missed something in the depths of IR you can only have 1 moving and 1 fixed mesh, and only 1 plane of movement ,\u00A0 so you can have slide or roll but not both,\u00A0 there are odd things around that look like they break these rules but in truth it\u0027s just clever hierarchy manipulation, and if examined will show only two meshes.\u00A0\u00A0 .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll is not lost though as it is possible to make compound elements, that is parts made from more than one part\u00A0 that seem to function as one.\u00A0 I\u0027ve a feeling that some of the function and linkages may be able to be simulated using the constrain FX ( part of the animation suite)\u00A0 this ensures that part X follows part Y as if attached, when in fact they are not.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith winter drawing in I may pull a rotor head off one of my large RC\u0027s and see how and if it could be replicated in IR.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Not even thinking about the control right now, just the parts.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot easy , and harder as the number of mod makers who make IR parts is tiny, for something so simple ( 1 moving mesh 1 fixed mesh) \u00A0 it can be very frustrating for anyone attempting IR part creation\u00A0 for the first time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T16:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy IR prototype swash is working... as long as the rotor hub with the blade grips aren\u0027t involved (d\u0027oh) but on its own, it works.
