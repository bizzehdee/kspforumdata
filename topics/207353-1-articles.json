You can also lob landers at it, use winged aircraft very effectively in the thick air and even send boats or amphibious rovers to explore the surface. The alternative targets are either Moho, which has very high delta-V requirements, or Duna, which needs more solar power and has a wimpy atmosphere that might just support a parachute assisted powered landing, plus the perpetual hazard of Ike waiting to throw you back into solar orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your staging isn\u2019t working, try adding a blank stage at the bottom and staging that; alternatively you might need to clear input locks in the debug window. Staging doesn\u2019t work in map view as far as I know, probably to avoid fat-fingering the button and getting stranded.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe only times I\u2019ve seen UI windows prevent control inputs is with MechJeb windows; all the stock ones will behave the same whether you have UI windows open or not.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtmospheres don\u2019t interact with communication signals at all- the different connection settings for atmospheric and airless bodies is intended to imitate either signal refraction through the atmosphere (allowing connections when line-of-sight is blocked by terrain) or signal reflection off the atmosphere (blocking connections that go through the atmosphere), but there\u2019s no attenuation anywhere except during re-entry and that\u2019s a separate option.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can make your own radial separators using cubic octagonal struts and stack decouplers- attach the cubic struts radially, attach the \u201Ctop\u201D node of the decoupler to one end of the strut and then attach the stuff you want to separate to the \u201Cbottom\u201D decoupler node, then a bit of part rotating and moving to make it look nice. The decoupler will leave with the booster and all you\u2019re left with are tiny, physicsless cubic struts hidden inside the body of your craft contributing minimal mass.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTurn down spring strengths and turn up damper strengths on landing legs and wheels to avoid the jumping on load problem, and wait until they\u2019ve settled again before switching away. It\u2019s only really a problem where the gravity is really low e.g. Gilly, where it takes a long time to float back down, and a brief burst of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E can fix that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you want to see your trajectory several orbits in advance, put a second node after the first one and move it forwards a few orbits using the buttons either by right-clicking the node itself or in the node editor widget on the bottom left of the screen. You could also try increasing the patched conic limit. Having random interactions appearing many orbits after the one you\u2019re interested in is a distraction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pwn","CreatedById":197980,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-21T14:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe staging gets screwed up pretty frequently for me, i think it\u0027s almost always fixed by pressing space twice - still pretty stupid that the game doesn\u0027t simply activate the last stage that only has parts that were not activated before\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit seems like the game goes by ids and counts down some integer instead of dynamically looking what the last stage is and just activating it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut i knew people would immediately jump in and tell me all these things were not so bad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe point is that this is not a very polished experience tbh it\u0027s far from being polished.\u003Cbr\u003E\nand i didn\u0027t even mention the borked physics, unusable airplanes, mods getting broken with every update, bad graphics, balancing, unnecessary loading times etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nthese were all real issues that could easily be polished. no idea why you are defending the current state or tell me its my fault.\u003Cbr\u003E\nand to be honest some of your workarounds are really ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-21T15:02:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2022 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by pwn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-21T18:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224105039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207353\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221647874433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197980\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pwn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, pwn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunusable airplanes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey work for me, though I rarely have any use for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224105039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207353\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221647874433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197980\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pwn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, pwn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmods getting broken with every update\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthankfully to you, the active development is over so no more broken mods (which were a rare occurence anyway, and could happen either when mod was version locked, or when an update touched a bit of code the mod was using.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224105039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207353\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221647874433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197980\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pwn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, pwn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbad graphics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit\u0027s a 10.5 year old game.
