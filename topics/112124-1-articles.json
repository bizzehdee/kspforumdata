Considering the rate at which it was being processed, it would be years before the landing, so I sent a space bus filled with scientists, attached it with a klaw to the orbiting lab, and every few game days I come to collect... the 500 data would convert to 2500 science. Some ten biomes to perform the scan, that\u0027s some 1000 data. 5000 science points just for orbiting Minmus. Now when I land, there\u0027s about 8 experiments per biome.

All the data you try to process will go to the lab closest to the command module. There is no way to get any data into the 2nd lab. Therefore if you want a space station with more lab capacity, make sure each lab module\u0027s section of the station can undock from the rest of the station. Then you can undock whichever lab doesn\u0027t have data, dock the lander to it, fill it\u0027s data banks, undock the lander and redock the lab to the main station. repeat for any other labs until they are all full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan for a multi-lab station, after learning the above, central core with a main engine, Lf-O fuel, monoprop, RCS, power generation, batteries and habitation. The core is for refueling operations. Lab modules with monoprop, RCS. Every section will have a probe core and docking ports, both regular and Jr. Landers with a Jr. The core will have also have a Claw for missions to build a station onto an Asteroid. Labs will dock to the core with the regular docking port and the lander can dock to the labs with the Jr docking port. The I can just undock the lab after the lander docks, fill it\u0027s data banks, redock the lab/lander combo to the core, refuel the lander.

There is a limit of 500 data units to the lab, and the closer you get to that limit the more efficient the lab is. But the location of the lab also plays a part. A lab on the surface of Eeloo will be way more efficient than one in orbit around Mun. You can also return the same experiments when you are done processing and sending the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my career so far I have only one lab set up, it\u0027s on the surface of Ike. At its peak efficiency it is generating just under 1 science per day, and as it uses up data that daily rate decreases. The lowest I\u0027ve seen it is around .7 per day, when there was about 150 data left. I would expect that your daily rate will be over 1 when you are landed on the more exotic bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, science gets generated when the lab is not the active ship. It would be enormously annoying otherwise! I sent my Ike lab up with only a few of those oxstat solar panels, because thats all I had unlocked at that point. The things takes a few hundred days to process all that data, and it seems like a pain to have to wait that long for the payoff. But it isn\u0027t really; I\u0027m doing lots of rescue and tourism contracts in the meantime. That lab has given me several thousand science points and it still has more data to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon further testing with two labs on one station I learned the data banks of the second lab can be filled after the first lab is filled if the second lab is the only one current manned. If you have two labs on one station with four scientists, two manning each lab, all the data you process will go the the lab closest to the command module, or the first one placed in the VAB/docked if they are both the same distance from the command module. Let\u0027s call this the primary lab. In order to get data into the next lab you have to unman the primary lab. If you don\u0027t have another crew compartment these two scientist can move to, you\u0027ll just have to send them both on EVA. Then you can precess more data and have it fill the databanks of the second lab. You could have as many labs as you want on a station as long as you don\u0027t have any full labs manned when you want to process more data. Once you\u0027re done processing all the data you have, you can then man all the labs again and start doing the research in all of them that have data and are manned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
