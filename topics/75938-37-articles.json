That means I suck worse at everything else because really, building a tall rocket that goes upwards is pretty easy compared to something that actually generates lift. Unfortunately, unless you create a pre-made rover with pre-specified dimensions, a rover landing system is enar impossible to pre-build for a specific mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another subject, I have a few things to report about my experiences with the repulsors and wheels. First off, the water repulsion system available in the github works really well. I have yet to experience anything nasty with that. That being said, I have yet to try anything larger than a one-kerbal craft in those situations because my larger designs are too heavy and tend to hit the beach and blow up before they get the chance to repulse water. Remember, I suck at making anything worthy of being manned. Poor Jebediah, but he does so enjoy being blown to bits for science and he just won\u0027t die, not for lack of trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheel groupings are interesting, however I discovered that after using action groups to change the repulsor height I have to manually right click on a repulsor and tell it to apply the settings for anything to actually take effect. It would be great if those updates could happen on their own, or at least if the action group command could include an automated update for other like-grouped units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall though, this pack has ruined all other wheels in existence for me. I just can\u0027t handle those rigid wheels anymore.

That means I suck worse at everything else because really, building a tall rocket that goes upwards is pretty easy compared to something that actually generates lift.

First off, the water repulsion system available in the github works really well. I have yet to experience anything nasty with that. That being said, I have yet to try anything larger than a one-kerbal craft in those situations because my larger designs are too heavy and tend to hit the beach and blow up before they get the chance to repulse water.

His wheels look cool, but I can\u0027t use them because they\u0027re so... solid. is really sucks. So, I was thinking you could lock the wheel\u0027s steering system and stick an intermediary part between the craft\u0027s hull and the wheel part which would apply suspension and steering by simply moving the entire non-suspended part. The steering we could make a mock of, without all the cool steering specifics, with infernal robotics, but suspension is another pile of crud entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething to think on anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T08:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, now that\u0027s a tricky one...
