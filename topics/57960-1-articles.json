Currently, it integrates the water resource from TAC Life Support into KSP Interstellar. It does this by removing the KSPI LqdWater resource and replacing it with the TACLS Water resource. This allows more advanced forward supply depots to be built. More integration between TACLS and KSPI, as well as resources from other mods, to come!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock TACLS, the only resource that can be obtained off-world is oxygen and only from Laythe and only if your vessel has an air intake. You can can also make oxygen by using electrolysis, but this process requires you haul along TACLS Water with you. It makes no sense from a TWR point of view to bring extra TACLS Water and a TACLS Water Splitter part just to make oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock KSPI, the water collected by the KSPI Refinery is not drinkable by the crew. Nor is the TACLS Water Splitter able to produce breathable oxygen with KSPI Water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, my addon removes those restrictions and logistical problems. You can now obtain breathable oxygen and drinkable water in four locations outside of Kerbin! With TACLS\u0027s Water Splitter and KSPI\u0027s Refinery, you can set up supply bases that can produce different life support and fuel supplies. Additional resources may be attainable depending on where you are landed. In addition, if you want to use water to fuel your nuclear thermal rockets, you have access to the smaller water tanks from TACLS instead of just the single very large one available from KSPI. You could also siphon off some water from life support to serve as emergency fuel for nuclear thermal rockets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETACLS Water can be obtained on celestial bodies other than Kerbin in KSPI. Eve and Laythe have oceans that the Refinery can suck in water from. Vall and Duna have ice in their soil that the Refinery can cook water out of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of its low gravity (0.235g\u0027s), no atmosphere, and distant location, Vall makes an excellant location for a supply base to support missions in the Jool system or at Eeloo. Refinery ships can bring up water extracted from Vall\u0027s surface to a station in orbit where it can be processed into breathable oxygen, drinkable water, liquid fuel, and oxidizer. Vall also has supplies of Uranium and Thorium which can be used to refuel fission reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhjs46eruv1801m/KESA%20v0.1.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nhjs46eruv1801m/KESA%20v0.1.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstallation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace the \u0022KESA\u0022 folder into your \u0022GameData\u0022 folder, just like you would when installing any other mod.

I am on holiday until the end of the year. When I get home, I will test with the newest versions of dependencies and release an update if needed.

An example of this would be combining liquid fuel and oxidizer to make drinkable water*. Another example would be to have the TACLS Water Splitter produce liquid fuel when performing electrolysis to make breathable oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am considering retasking the Water Splitter to become more of a phase converter. The Refinery can already perform water electrolysis to make oxidizer and liquid fuel. Having the Water Splitter make breathable oxygen and liquid fuel is semi-redundant. It may be better to have the Refinery performing electrolysis and the Water Splitter able to phase shift the oxidizer into breathable oxygen. This is just an idea at the moment and not something I\u0027ve given a great deal of thought to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne change I am considering to make first is to have the Refinery collect WasteWater. Basically unpurified water that needs to be cleaned up before being drinkable or useable as fuel for nuclear thermal rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also would like to balance the energy consumption of the TACLS recycler parts with the standard units of KSPI\u0027s electrical system. In KSPI, one EC is one kW. With that known, I may be able to better approximate and balance the energy requirements for the Carbon Extractor and the Water Purifier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the list of things to be considered is integration with Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*KSPI considers liquid fuel to be liquid hydrogen and oxidizer to be liquid oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T00:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is awesome.

It also looks like the refinery resource collection module can be used to extract CO2 and store it. I have a few options where I can add this module: TACLS Air Filter, KSPI Refinery, and KSPI Atmospheric Scoops. It\u0027s applicable for all three parts, but I\u0027m not sure where it would make most sense, both from a mechanics angle as well as a quality of life / gameplay angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could add the CO2 collection to KSPI atmo scoops. The air filter is almost obsolete as it is from the fact that whilst below a certain altitude in an oxygen containing atmosphere, your kerbals breathe oxygen siphoned from ports on the vessel, and thus do not consume onboard oxygen supplies. If this feature were to be combined with the functionality of the air filter, it would remove the need for the TACLS air filter. So just being below a modest altitude on Laythe and Kerbin would allow your vessel to slowly recharge oxygen supplies. That though, is something that probably requires a TACLS API change as opposed to me being able to implement via config changes. As would the ability to use onboard supplies of CO2 for production of methane (sabatier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, it\u0027s very late and I just wanted to provide an update on what I worked on today. It was writing down my thoughts and planning out a bit of the CO2 integration. I will go ahead and say that v0.2 will focus on CO2 integration. If anyone has some feedback on what part(s) you would like CO2 collection to be implemented on or you have an argument for what part you feel makes the most sense, I would love to hear your thoughts. I also would like to encourage people to let me know if a resource I\u0027m working on is being used in or has something very similar in a different mod. I\u0027m also open to suggestions on what people would like to see integrated next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shad0wCatcher","CreatedById":98819,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T11:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy vote is the atmospheric scoop; it\u0027s already balanced as a large turbine requiring multiple megawatts of power to gather atmospheric resources. It\u0027s radially attachable as opposed to the other two (I suppose you could make a case for the refinery but honestly its stack attach node is painful to work around, and its size is also rather unwieldy; not to mention the number of functions it already has).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eadrom","CreatedById":91728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T13:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was leaning towards the scoop as well. In regards to breathable oxygen, I run into the issue that the scoop collects oxidizer and not beathable oxygen, so I suppose that makes a stronger case for a phase shift function. As a side note, I\u0027m also looking at the small TACLS hexcans and the two small radiators for hooking into the KAS storage system. KAS won\u0027t be made a dependency, but if you have it installed you\u0027ll have a few extra options. You can store extra life support supplies and radiators in canisters. That way you can augment radiator capability or strap on some extra life support supplies as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will need to wait for Fractal_UK to change the way the refinery module code works in order to use internal supplies of CO2. In the meantime, I\u0027m working on an efficient conversion for KSPI CO2. TACLS CO2 is \u0022CarbonDioxide\u0022. KSPI\u0027s CO2 appears to be \u0022PlanetCarbonDioxide\u0022 where planet is like Kerbin or Eve or Duna. So CO2 on Kerbin is \u0022KerbinCarbonDioxide\u0022. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s done this way so that each planet can have a different abundance of CO2, but I think it is. I\u0027m also not sure if the refinery is actually consuming a universal CO2 resource type or if it\u0027s just testing to see if CO2 is available in the atmosphere via the guiName field value.I\u0027ll see if Fractal can implement the needed changes in the refinery code to make my changes work when the next version of KSPI comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the issue of how/where to store CO2. I was also thinking that if TACLS has tweakables implemented for its life support containers, you could use the oxygen containers, tweakable all the oxygen out. Then either tweakable CO2 in the tank (might be unbalancing to do so since you can recycle CO2, giving oxygen tanks something like 190% storage capacity) or rig up something on launch clamps with a scoop. Another option is that since only the refinery part can perform the sabatier process, I could add a small amount of CO2 capacity there. I could also try to clone a part that just stores CO2. I was thinking maybe one of the two stock radial monopropellant tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to have a version with the KAS and CO2 changes (minus the refinery using internal CO2 feature) available sometime this weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KeithStone","CreatedById":71277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T16:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that Ironcross life support had some information on extracting carbon dioxide from duna\u0027s atmosphere as well.
