In the stock game, this doesn\u0027t happen ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). There\u0027s a mod that does this already, but it\u0027s freaking ancient and probably doesn\u0027t work. Again, in reality, if you\u0027re ascending then the air will get thinner and high frequency sounds are muffled and then muted, so you just get the bassy rumble of the rocket. Is this possible to do? Same for if you\u0027re in space and there\u0027s an explosion; you\u0027re obviously not gonna hear it unless you\u0027re connected to it.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know it\u0027s a massive handful to ask for, but this mod, added with planetshine, chatterer, a few other mods and these suggestions will make the game soooooo much more immersive ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much~ the mod Im still improving the mod so expect alot of changes still, \n\nSound Muffling is possible and has been already done by Atmospheric Sound Enhancement, it still works but for some reason its not working with jet engines and rapiers at the moment, to add also explosions, and also quite buggy (as you said quite ancient).
