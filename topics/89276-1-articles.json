I\u0027ve gone to the joint and right clicked but the buttons for decouple do not depress. I tried moving an astronaut next to the joint but that doesn\u0027t work either.

It was a little odd that I was able to decouple when clicking on one side, but not the other. Keep in mind the game is still in development.
