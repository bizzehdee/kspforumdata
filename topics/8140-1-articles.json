Basically you\\\u0027re being pulled in by the Mun, but due to combinations of your speed, its speed, and your angle of approach, its gravity isn\\\u0027t enough to pull you back around for a full, circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, a couple of ways to change this are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - put yourself in such a position that, when your craft meets the Mun\\\u0027s gravitational influence, your path intersects with the Mun itself (not that easy without practise), or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - when you get captured, slow down! If your path isn\\\u0027t going to cause you to hit the Mun itself, the reason you\\\u0027re getting shot out into deep space is your speed. If you start moving slower, the Mun\\\u0027s gravity will be more able to affect your craft and bring it back around for a lovely complete orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, when you notice the orbit pathway in the map view change from your elliptical Kerbin orbit to a Munar one, make a note of the PE height. When you reach that value, rotate your craft so that you are facing away from your direction of travel. This what is meant by \\\u0027retrograde\\\u0027, and there is an icon on the nav-ball to indicate it. It looks like a yellow (green, if you insist) circle with a dot in the centre, and (importantly) a cross through the middle of it. Align that with the middle of the nav-ball and fire your engines when you get to PE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the map view, and watch your escape trajectory become an orbit. Once you\\\u0027ve settled into that...well, there are plenty of landing tutorials but some rules of thumb are: aim for a crater, try to descend as vertically as possible, and go SLOW when you get below 1,000m, because the surface of the Mun is variable in height (and chances are whatever you\\\u0027re landing with won\\\u0027t take too kindly to more than 10m/s, anyway...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.

The stress of the situation causes me to brain fart lol..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what would have been the reason behind why i went from escape trajectory to orbit, back to escape trajectory? The orbit was getting weird and as I started testing different things out (retro/pro burn etc) I messed up so that it made me on an escape once again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so I avoid that in the future, what did I do to make that happen? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again.

You can practice that in Kerbin orbit first. To raise your apogee or perigee, burn prograde at perigee or apogee (on the opposite side of the orbit). To lower your apogee or perigee, burn retrograde at perigee or apogee. To obtain a nice circular orbit, you need to burn at least twice to adjust both the apogee and perigee to the same altitude. Easy once you get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get a nice landing trajectory, you simply have to burn retrograde to make your perigee intersect with the ground. Then it\\\u0027s a matter of maintaining a slow enough vertical velocity, horizontal velocity and attitude.

The best place to do this is at your Pe mark in the map view, but you may want to do it sooner to start the process and lower your Pe. Turn backwards and give it all you\\\u0027ve got until you get an orbit. On approach to the Mun when you change to the Mun\\\u0027s influence, you might not have a Pe marker. If you don\\\u0027t want to just do a direct approach, you\\\u0027ll have to thrust sideways (sideways to your direction of travel when you switch the Navball to \u0027Orbital\u0027 mode) one way or the other to mush your trajectory off to the side.
