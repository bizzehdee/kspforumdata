I just didn\u0027t list them since they don\u0027t directly add a \u0022realism\u0022 experiance to the crew as directly as your life support mod. I do love the KAS mod, allowed me to rescue a few things that I forgot to out solar panels on (whoops). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think my only hang up on your mod for me is lack of canisters. One goal for me is to setup a few \u0022weigh stations\u0022 at various strategic points.

They put up a really nice space station made from stock parts, it\u0027s basically a fuel depot. Along with they designed fuel pods and even a cargo ferry to resupply it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to modify those to include consumables tanks for O2, food, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought: waste tanks. Ability to store extra waste and deliver it to a processing facility for recycling (useful both for bases and colonies even orbital stations). Example: a waste water converter so you could dock and let the resupply station recycle your wastes and take it along further. (Hope that makes sense). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about comparability with other mods? I noticed another on the spaceport that adds oxygen tanks etc, is your mod able to interface with those?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T18:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGet the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37251-0-20-2-Project-Arcturus-Thrust-Corrector-Remission-and-Range-Safety?highlight=thrust\u002Bcorrector\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Arcturus Thrust Corrector\u003C/a\u003E.

Currently it is best suited for balancing the thrusts from each RCS thruster port so that rotation input does not cause translation and vice versa. This is similar to what real spacecraft like the Space Shuttle do to make precision manoeuvres while docking. There are issues with the current version though, like a lack of support for gimbals for main engine thrust balancing, and some inaccuracy on particular designs due to floating point errors, but it works much better than stock RCS control.

I thought I would do that by talking a little bit about each mod I\u0027m running and why and cover some of the mods I tried but removed and why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKept: ISA MapSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved: F. GPS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMap sat basically ended up \u0022winning\u0022 on eye candy. You get some parts to clip onto a ship and you get visual feedback on your progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GPS mod comes with only one part, the receiver, and requires that you just name orbiting objects \u0022GPS\u0022. So in practice it ends up working like the real life GPS system, but if your running RemoteTech getting the required 24\u002B sats into the correct orbits for GPS or use the cool parts from MapSat and RemoteTech? I chose the latter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKept : RemoteTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod challenges you like no other. Loose your line of sight ? forgot to input the next manuver to the computer? Yep, you lost your craft! You must setup a communications network and you have to plan ahead for when your unmanned missions go out of comm range for a little bit! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved : Deadly Rentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI liked the idea of this mod, and I liked the cool heat shields, but I ran into what I think was some compatibility issues because removing this mod made my game stop crashing. So I think it might have been conflicting with another mod, but I haven\u0027t figured out which one yet. Another reason I removed it, this mod takes things from semi hard to darn near impossible, good luck if you ever want to aerobrake anywhere (although if they would introduce some more heat shield options I might reconsider that, hint: watch the movie 2010 the sequal to 2001 Space Oddessey for some areobraking goodness ideas ). Finally, with over 44 mods installed more than a few had to go, I\u0027d like to load the game in a few min, not hours lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll continue in the next post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T06:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are additional mods to add heat shields to Deadly Reentry.
