Can anyone tell me what plug-in I should use?

It adds one, maybe two, parts which just give you information. In the VAB or SPH it will display the ISP, delta v, and burn times for all the stages. Once you launch, you have no access to the stats unless you have added one of the parts to you craft, or unless you have an engineer on board. There are sub menus for orbit, surface and vessel as well as two other menus(heat and rendezvous) which a beginner shouldn\u0027t worry about yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling it is extremely simple. You take the Kerbal Engineer folder and copy it over to the game data folder in the Kerbal space program folder. Make sure you are actually placing that folder and not a folder inside a folder which has the Kerbal Engineer Redux folder. It is very minimal and doesn\u0027t effect your fps or loading time much but provides a ton of information\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T07:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep Engineer Redux is what I needed.
