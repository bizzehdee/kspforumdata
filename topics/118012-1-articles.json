Can anyone tell me what plug-in I should use? I\u0027ve avoided adding mods in fear of more glitches in the game, so if you know something that really only will tell me my models delta v capabilities and/or is minimalistic in its code, that would be awesome.\n\nAlso as a general question, does one need to run an earlier version of KSP with some of the mods, or even something simple like displaying delta V during construction?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T08:00:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:46:26Z","Content":"I currently have 51 mods installed. No big deal, really. I\u0027m sure there are people with far more.\n\nThe one you are looking for is Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER).\n\nSome mods will only work on older versions of KSP. Most mods are up to date. They always say what version they are compatible with.

I got SCANsat, then SETI, then Remotetech, then got CKAN and went crazy. And now I have an Ubuntu dual boot with... what is it? 90 mods I think. I have a lot but I use about 6 gigs of RAM I think, KSP Linux lets you have more mods because of 64-bit."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T06:49:38Z","Content":"You\u0027ll want to use Kerbal Engineer Redux. It adds one, maybe two, parts which just give you information. In the VAB or SPH it will display the ISP, delta v, and burn times for all the stages. Once you launch, you have no access to the stats unless you have added one of the parts to you craft, or unless you have an engineer on board. There are sub menus for orbit, surface and vessel as well as two other menus(heat and rendezvous) which a beginner shouldn\u0027t worry about yet. \n\nInstalling it is extremely simple. You take the Kerbal Engineer folder and copy it over to the game data folder in the Kerbal space program folder. Make sure you are actually placing that folder and not a folder inside a folder which has the Kerbal Engineer Redux folder. It is very minimal and doesn\u0027t effect your fps or loading time much but provides a ton of information"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T07:57:45Z","Content":"Yep Engineer Redux is what I needed. Thank you!"}]}
