Hope that helps I will keep an eye out for the trigger logs werent very indicative of the cause AFAICT\n\nuhmm interesting, I have a good hunch of why this happens. My code goes like this:\n\n1. Calculate the data \u0022geeforce, atmospheric, engine\u0022 \n\nthen after grabbing the data and converting it into a Volume Controller we then:\n\n2. check if the current active vessel has IVA, if it has continue to 3, else dont.\n\n3. apply Volume Controller data to sounds and cues\n\nnow all sounds are only added and calculated to the current ship. so whenever a part of that ship is detached, its no longer going to have sounds/calculations. only exception is the docking sounds which I already have assigned to whenever it is decoupled/removed \u0022destroyed\u0022 it\u0027ll remove the events there.\n\nI think I know what causes the NREs, its step 1. it calculates anything regardless if the vessel has an IVA or not. we\u0027ll see if it fixes it by moving the Step 2 before 1\n\nI suppose this only happens in Linux because I dont have such NREs\n\ncan someone explain to me why linux is prone to NREs?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T17:50:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:54:13Z","Content":"Spent some time testing the latest build.
