That said, the way that you\u0027ve modeled up the bottom plates for the S-II and the S-IVB, with the straight section of tank and stringers right above the exposed tank and thrust structure basically throws FAR out of whack completely. The parts taper enough that they\u0027ll make stupid amounts of drag when they\u0027re exposed, but the small straight section of the part is enough to bring the centroid of the mesh outside of the area scanned by FAR\u0027s payload fairing code, so the Saturn IB and Saturn V have terrible amounts of drag as a result. I can try and come up with a fix for it to throw into FAR\u0027s config, but a better solution would be to re-model the bases to make things work properly. I assume that you don\u0027t want to put in the work to re-do them, so for now it probably makes sense to declare FASA Apollo to be FAR-incompatible (with no plans to make them compatible) somewhere in the OP so that people don\u0027t flood the thread with complaints about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T16:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIm having serious issues with the Mercury pod.
