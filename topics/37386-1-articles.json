Id appreciate if you would post back pictures of the assemblies you use this on and comment your ideas on how to make it better. This is also a proof of concept \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E also comment if you want the mk 1 command pod version. (pics on imagur)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe First module Is the E-1 which can be found @ the spaceport here with additional information: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/e-1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/e-1/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe second being the E-3 the difference being weight and reusability the E-1 is more like an unrechargable battery while E-3 is like a Rechargeable one, with the ability to interchange and the E-3 is much heavier in comparison to the E-1. I\u0027ve made both Modules steerable. The both work on all atmosphereic bodes. If it doesnt, there are multiple factors why, more prominently with the E-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe E-3 has basic maneuverability in space. mk1 Cockpit it holds onto is completely blank in additions, besides the docking port on the aft end of the cockpit. The modules are separable and can be delivered individually and reassembled together in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking the two together is a nice challenge for amateurs and pros alike, if you are too far left or right you are due to nudge the pod in the stead of actually docking it. Once you do get it docked you\u0027ll probably notice that your cockpit isn\u0027t orientated properly, this can easily be fixed by simply undocking, switching to the cockpit, re-orientating and re docking the two together. the E-3 is designed to have minimal debris when not in full orbit around a celestial body, otherwise you\u0027ll have a pretty large cloud that is very light in durability with the exception of the parachute ring. The primary issue with the desintagradeablity of the parachute ring is that it uses two i beams which are remarkably more durable than anything else on the ejector itself with the exception of the pod. it is strongly Encouraged that you activate stage zero when your landed, otherwise you wont have parachutes. The parachutes function in such a manner that it prevents the cockpit from detaching when the pod is at high speed and the parachute is fully deployed. The only disclaimer i have for the both of these is that i tested it Ferram so there may be drag instabilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/e-3/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/e-3/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPICTURE TIME!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S1Tz8qO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S1Tz8qO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kf5rnNv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kf5rnNv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/84T1tHO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002284T1tHO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepathrusters fire (this is the first stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FZXNfFk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FZXNfFk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LkbWMkP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LkbWMkP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore images here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/S1Tz8qO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/S1Tz8qO\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EENJOY \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-17T08:35:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2013 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gumby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
