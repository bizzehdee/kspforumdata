Would save me a ton of time if I didn\u0027t have to reinvent that also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Does anyone have(or know of) a current mod that replaces stock engine stack icon behavior? Fuel remaining and heat are probably the least useful metrics to display on a propeller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Does anyone have(or know of) a current mod that replaces the stock metrics in the VAB select-a-part GUI? Rocket motor metrics have no meaning in the aerofoil world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -I remember C7 at least tentatively deciding to replace the \u0022throttle as %thrust\u0022 behavior on the nuclear motors with \u0022throttle as %fuel consumption\u0022 a while back, did that end up in the game, and did the idea propagate to the rest of the motors? While it may make some sense in a rocket motor, it\u0027s beyond useless on a propeller, and if it\u0027s propagated through the control code, I\u0027ll have to fight with that also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kellven","CreatedById":16971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T13:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to ignore this unless you want to code aerofoil physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so obviously nobody gave a $#!^, so I didn\u0027t either, and dropped the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd decided to kill my KSP modding habit for good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I mod things because I want to, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77894-D12-Aerotech-a-full-B9-Expansion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E gave me an itch that needed scratching, so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a couple hours dusting off C# and came up with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74137297/AtmoData.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74137297/AtmoData.cs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is an interface/default-implementation/static-factory for encapsulating the atmospheric data one would need to have to compute aerofoil thrust, or at least the start of all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea if it works in game, but it\u0027s necessary as the stock density calculations are completely FUBAR, or were the last time I \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74137297/AtmosphericData.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elogged it out\u003C/a\u003E back in 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill needs relative wind speed, but that was going to be in a larger data class \u0022FlightCondition\u0022. Basic idea is you slip in a vessel reference, store the object, call a polling method once a frame, and everything now has access to a static copy of the current flight conditions. The stock code simply has each and every single part calling expensive calculation functions in FlightGlobals every single time they need a bit of data, which is beyond idiotic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the itch is now scratched, so I\u0027ll just abandon this again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
