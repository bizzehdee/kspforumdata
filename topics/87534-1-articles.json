I landed a rover on the Mun via sky crane just north of the equator, and dropped in Bob Kerman via lander nearby, and then drove him about 20 km (mostly downhill) to get to the anomaly at 23\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BAE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all went fine, but when I tried to get Bob back to his capsule, the lander wouldn\u0027t go back up the slope! It\u0027ll get most of the way up and then grind to a halt, and then start sliding down the slope unless the brakes are on. The rover uses the stock M1 wheels and has enough panels to keep the battery charged the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be willing to buy the notion that the rover wheels only have so much torque, but the thing I can\u0027t figure out is what\u0027s the limiting incline angle for this rover. It seems to do fine on steeper hills and get bogged down on slopes that seem less steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CdhtjUfl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CdhtjUfl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone shed some light on this?

For whatever reason, the angle of a slope doesn\u0027t define how much traction or gravity you have to contend with.
