The addition of lift rockets suitable to lift it when fully-loaded cost just enough DV to where a zero descent rate munar approach was required. I\u0027m assuming that if you want a tanker to bring fuel from the munar surface to orbit, you want to set it down in a precise spot. The ZDR approach is terrible for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It could probably be tweaked to do that job (it\u0027s only the first landing where this would be a problem), but if it were me I\u0027d leave it as a munar orbital depot and have smaller dedicated tankers to fuel it from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T01:10:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 01:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T02:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial vessel is indeed my \u0022tanker\u0022 to transport fuels from surface to orbit.

Both need to land, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just checked. I actually remembered the wrong number - single stage on the initial vessel is giving ~5km/s (whether using Mainsail or Rhino, just \u0026lt;100m/s difference), which is probably still going to be a few hundred less than needed, but close. And just to clarify - KER has no problem dealing with this number for single-stage dV. The 4.5km/s I claim in that reply wasn\u0027t from the same picture. I do know some bug in KER, but I don\u0027t want to over-blame KER that is in fact not true. Even for the picture I posted, I understand KER can\u0027t show the right number in that case because it can\u0027t possibly know I launch in that awkward way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw your SRBs - that fills the gap (both dV and TWR) for the single-stage approach, but - it\u0027s not single stage any more, I suppose?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, still appreciate your ideas, especially let me think more about the possibility of single stage designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T09:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the half-stage options might be useful, such as SRBs. They won\u0027t get into orbit, so there\u0027ll be some debris down-range, and maybe you can do things with a small probe core and parachutes to get actual recovery. With the acceleration-limiter in MechJeb the core stage can be running at low throttle for most of the SRB burn.
