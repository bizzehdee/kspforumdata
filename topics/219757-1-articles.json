I\u0027ve got tired of waiting for KSP2 to be what we wanted so back to KSP1 it is. I plan on just letting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E handle the modding for me but I\u0027m unsure which version I want to play on. Does anyone have any recommendations for which beta version to run specifically for any OPT mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T16:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to mod discussion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"savagekerbal","CreatedById":199989,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T16:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry\u00A0 I could\u0027ve\u00A0 swore I was under mod discussion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"savagekerbal","CreatedById":199989,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T22:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBump\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-04T09:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unsure what to recommend, because I don\u0027t know what you intend to do and how powerful (or potatoish) is your rig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play KSP mainly between day job tasks or between working times, when it would not worth start a new task after being blocked on another one because it would not be finished before the road is unblocked, and so I play KSP on a Potato secondary machine I have on my desk (MacMini 6.2, to be precise). I came to terms that I need to settle on KSP 1.4.3 to have good playability on it because the potato uses a Intel HD4000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have something more powerful (pretty easy\u00A0 to tell the true! :P), I recommend KSP 1.7.3. From the KSP versions, 1.7.3 have the better feature/bug ratio of all of them. You will be happy with any CPU with 4 cores, 8GB (16GB is better if you want some visual mods) and a GPU with at least 4GB VRAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want the most bugless KSP ever, you will need to settle with 1.3.1 or 1.2.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.8.0 and newer are good for small play sessions and for making videos - any long term playing is fated to be doomed due some horrible bugs on key features of the KSP engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"savagekerbal","CreatedById":199989,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-04T22:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell lets just say I\u00A0 ran KSP 2 at launch with no issues\u00A0 lol.
