I also read this entire thread and didn\u0027t see anything to this. And I didn\u0027t want to clutter up a how it works thread with what may be a bug report and belong in the buts instead of questions/tutorials section.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117461-New-Mobile-Processing-Lab-mechanics/page21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117461-New-Mobile-Processing-Lab-mechanics/page21)\n\nI\u0027m noticing a huge discrepancy between data amounts available to the processing lab between cockpit activation and manual scientist EVA activation of experiments. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a bug or intended behavior.\n\nI made up a simple plane with Goo, Pressure, Temperature, and Materials Science Lab, and the mobile processing lab to learn how it works hands on.\n\nI then proceeded to learn that simply activating experiments from the cockpit only gave 1 data on the materials lab and pretty much nothing on anything else. However if an EVA scientist activates the experiment manually there\u0027s a much larger amount of data available to process (discovered by accident). I also tried activating the experiments from the cockpit, then using a scientist to collect them and take them to the lab. This didn\u0027t increase the data available for processing it was simply the cockpit activated values and collecting and storing.\n\nQuick Report:\n\nAll Kerbals 1 star\n\nTemp \u0026 Presmat attached directly to SciLab, Goo in service bay, Materials Lab in tail after Medium to Small aerodynamic fitting.\n\nData Amounts for Processing from the Runway.\n\nShip Controlled Experiments from Cockpit/Autopilot\n\nEngy-Cockpit, Sci1-Lab, Sci2-Lab\n\nGoo: 0, Temp: 0, Pres: 0, Mat: 1\n\nEngy-EVA, Sci1-Lab, Sci2-Cockpit\n\nGoo: 0, Temp: 0, Pres: 0, Mat: 1\n\nConclusion1: putting a scientist in the cockpit doesn\u0027t change this.\n\nManual Experiments from Scientist on EVA\n\nEngy-Cockpit, Sci1-Lab, Sci2: EVA\n\nGoo: 3, Temp: 2, Pres: 4, Mat: 8\n\nEngy-Lab, Sci1-EVA, Sci2-Cockpit\n\nGoo: 3, Temp: 2, Pres: 4, Mat: 8\n\nEngy-Lab, Sci1-Outside Idle, Sci2-EVA\n\nGoo: 3, Temp: 2, Pres: 4, Mat: 8\n\nSci1-Lab, Sci2-Lab, Sci3-EVA\n\nGoo: 3, Temp: 2, Pres: 4, Mat: 8\n\nConclusion2: So long as a scientist collects the data manually... a large amount of data is available from each biome. (it\u0027s Kerbin surface... so yes I know small compared to elsewhere...) \n\nConclusion3: The lab must be manned with at least 1 kerbal. But the game doesn\u0027t care if it\u0027s a scientist or not for data collection. With no kerbals inside there was no data button on the reset/keep/process/transmit dialogue. There is no difference between 1 or 2 scientists or non-scientists in the lab while a scientist collects manual EVA data.\n\nIn flight Over KSC (Coast), All experiments repeats of previous scienceSci1-Lab, Sci2-Lab, Sci3-Cockpit\n\nGoo: 9, Temp: 7, Pres: 10, Mat: 22, CrewReport: 4\n\nConclusion4: Cockpit activation while in flight is producing significant amounts of data for Kerbin at least.\n\nQuick jaunt over to the highlands/mountains (never did science in mountains).\n\nCockpit Activation, Mountains Landed (new biome), (accidentally trashed Materials Lab on rough highlands landing...)\n\nCrew Report: 1.5 science, no data\n\nTransmitted Crew report... still no data or science on repeat.\n\nGoo: 3 science, no data\n\nTemp: 2.4 science, no data\n\nPres: 3.2 science, no data\n\nEVA Activation, Mountains (new biome)\n\nGoo: 3 science, 3 data\n\nTemp: 2.4 science, 2 data\n\nPres: 3.6 science, 4 data\n\nSurface Sample: 9science, 1 data\n\nGround EVA Report: 2.4 science, 0 data\n\nConclusion5: game rounds Data/Science values... 3.6 rounded up and 2.4 rounded down... not sure which rounding method is used on 5\u0027s.\n\nHighlands (old biome I\u0027ve tested before).\n\nHighlands Ground (old biome): Scientist on EVA\n\nGoo: 3, Temp: 2, Pres: 4\n\nHighlands, Ground (old biome), Plane Cockpit Controlled\n\nGoo: 0, Temp: 0, Pres: 0\n\nQuestions: Is this a bug or intended? (needing an EVA scientist manually activating experiments)\n\nQuestions: When flying a lot of data shows up without scientist on EVA? Why is landed acting differently than flying?\n\nObviously even with ladders... atmospheric flying vehicles don\u0027t tend to be kerbal friendly.... they like to get blown off to their demise.\n\nI didn\u0027t loft anything into orbit for lack of time. That\u0027s the next step. Since obviously orbital kerbals on EVA is easier to test vs cockpit activation."},{"CreatedByName":"NoClass","CreatedById":90399,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T14:59:08Z","Content":"Interesting...\n\nI\u0027ve been running experiments too, because there\u0027s an irritating lack of documentation on how science is supposed to work...\n\nStill, I haven\u0027t noticed any difference in recovery yield through EVA activation. Specifically, I\u0027m getting 5.4 science for recovering a Seismic Accelerometer mounted to a MK2 can on the launch pad. This is true if Bob (lvl 2 sci) is in the can or on EVA.\n\nSo your results are curious to me. How exactly are you activating \u0022manually\u0022 on EVA? I\u0027m assuming that means that you are controlling the scientist on EVA, getting close to the experiment module, then right clicking to perform the experiment.\n\nThe only difference the scientist seems to make for me is on the transmission efficiency, which turns to \u0022basic analysis\u0022 (in yellow), regardless if the scientist activates manually or is in the can. (Though there is supposed to be a bonus, I get 2.4 regardless. That might be a rounding issue). This is in contrast to what the [wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Scientist) currently says, that scientists give a bonus to \u0022recovery\u0022. It\u0027s clearly a bonus to transmission, just like in the Beta.\n\nInterestingly enough, I\u0027ve noticed that the \u0022basic analysis\u0022 bonus stays even after the scientist has left the craft and walked away. Using brackets [ ] to switch between craft doesn\u0027t seem to reset this bonus, but switching to the space center does reset the bonus. I assume that switching to a distant craft on the map will reset it as well. Experiments collected by non-scientists on EVA don\u0027t show the \u0022basic analysis\u0022 bonus, even if they\u0027re added to a craft with a scientist on board.\n\nIt would be great if there was some sort of authority out there on how this is supposed to work."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T15:13:22Z","Content":"Important question beforehand: was the scientist standing on the ground or hanging from a ladder - so being in flight for ksp in most cases - when you activated the experiments via eva?\n\nI also was under the impression that only scientists could manually activate experiments?"},{"CreatedByName":"Falconer","CreatedById":119245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:17:11Z","Content":"Yes only scientists can activate while on EVA. (toddle close then right click manual activate part)\n\nYes I tested it both ways. There was no difference between the scientist on a ladder while landed and one simply standing on top of the plane or solid ground. \n\nI put the scientist on the ladder which ran right next to the PresMat and Temp. I activated it while he was on the ladder and while he was simply standing on top of the plane. I also activated the Materials lab while he was on the access ladder I put in the back and while he was standing on the solid ground. No difference either way. That thought crossed my mind too since you get different EVA crew reports for standing on the plane (normal ground) or hanging off a ladder while landed (while flying over terrain)."},{"CreatedByName":"Falconer","CreatedById":119245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:21:11Z","Content":"More data... launched a very rough KerbLab into elliptical equatorial orbit (high \u0026 low orbits), also clipped atmosphere for some high altitude for experimental purposes.\n\nUsing a scientist is still producing different amounts of data than using ships controls.

So couldn\u0027t EVA it to figure out the differences. But anyhow EVA\u0027ing kerbal got less science than simply using ships controls in this case as well.\n\nHigh Orbit: Cockpit (285k)\n\nSci1: Lab, Engy: Lab, Sci2: Cockpit\n\nMat: 47, Goo: 19, Temp: 15, Pres: 22, Crewrep: 9, EVARep: 15\n\nHigh Orbit: EvA (285k)\n\nSci1: EVA, Engy: Lab, Sci2: Cockpit\n\nPres: 18\n\nConclusion4: EVA scientist loses out again to ships controls.\n\nAfter all that.. Kerblab has about 300 units of data and is pumping out roughly 0.4 science a day with 2 1star scientists aboard. So by the charts 2star scientists would move that up to about 2/day... and 3star 10/day. Unless you go through kerbal training camp (Mun/Minmus tour for quick 3\\*\u0027s... not the grreatest investment).\n\nFinal thought... the results may correlate to the data modifier by location. Kerbin surface is getting a penalty (like 10%) which is getting applied to the ship but not the scientist EVA. Kerbin orbit gives a slight bonus IIRC... and the ship is getting this bonus, but the scientist on EVA isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know the exact numbers there so someone who does might check that for correlation to the data numbers above. If so that is probably a bug. (no reason same experiment in same place with same equipment and kerbals in local ship vicinity would vary that much)."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:13:51Z","Content":"Yep, I agree with your final thoughts. You are likely circumventing the code that applies the huge landed on Kerbin penalty by doing it from the right click menu on EVA.
