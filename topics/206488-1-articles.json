Essentially, instead of controlling crafts and colonies, players control a population of kerbals. This opens up the possibilities of collaboratively building and managing crafts and colonies, as well as connecting probes, in an in-game way. I think the idea of acting as the systems officer on a ship while someone else works out the trajectories, or vice versa, is engaging.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach player would get a population of kerbals on Kerbin that would have a minimum growth rate (to avoid failure states) and as they explore and begin creating colonies and reaching boom events, their population would grow across all of their colonies and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Whatever these kerbals control, the player controls. Here is how it would work in a few different situations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECrewed Craft:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 A player controls anything their kerbals control. For example, if a kerbal is in a pod with control over the ship, the player can control that ship, but if a kerbal is in a passenger module, they cannot control the ship, only that passenger cabin, which probably just means the lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Kerbal in a pod doesn\u0027t mean control over everything though. For example, the mk. 2 lander can doors only open from that part (if there are people in there), or research can only be toggled from the lab module. A single player won\u0027t have any problems with this because all seats on the ship are under their control, but multiple people will have to coordinate if they are sharing a ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can feed into other gameplay with parts that are more advanced or specialized, like a pod that can plan constant thrust trajectories or act as a probe control point. One player might be able to steer the ship but not pilot the rovers down on the surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EColonies:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The same principle applies for colonies as for crafts. Whenever there is a module that performs a specific role (think BAE, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, logistics module, etc.), a player needs at least one kerbal in it to perform that role or have that control. This allows for colonies where other players can put their kerbals (after a supply route for example) but not accept new trade routes or launch their ships, unless you give them access to that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess important than the general idea, some things could change with more kerbals. If building things takes time, more kerbals means faster building or more simultaneous builds. This would work for a single person as well, as an understaffed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E would operate slower. I\u0027d also like to see building crafts done by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, so when you enter a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you load into that workspace, and if another person is using it, you can see and add to their work. Loading in crafts would load them into that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E specifically, and so on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast thing: when the population increases, there are a few options. Either only the player that triggered the boom event has the population increase, or players would see an increase in proportion to the number of kerbals they have at the colony. The second one would invite collaboration, as people would benefit from sharing colonies with their friends and getting more boom events.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProbes:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Each probe has a modifiable \u0022control point\u0022 which is the colony or craft that controls that probe. Like in KSP 1, probes will use a network to reach their control point, but they\u0027ll use only the network of a whitelisted player/players. This is to encourage people to either collaborate or develop multiple relay networks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure you have guessed it by now, but if multiple people have access to a control point, then the probe is controllable by those people. At any time, the control point can be locked, but otherwise, any player that controls the probe can change the control point. It is probably best to lock control to a big colony so that there is no chance that someone transfers control over to their little orbiting station full of grungy hacker kerbals. However, if that player wasn\u0027t on the relay whitelist, they might lose control as well, since the player with the whitelisted relay network is no longer controlling the probe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience/Data:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I\u0027m not settled on one method, but either each player gains the full science reward (assuming they can transmit the data), the science is split, or each player needs to bring their own set of experiments to run. I\u0027m leaning towards each player getting the full science reward. And physical samples will either go to the person who recovered them (or took them, if there were multiple), or split once recovered.

With that said...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis system is kept relatively peaceful because kerbals are a relatively peaceful (if death-defying) race. Essentially, you need a weighted majority to move someone else\u0027s kerbals. Moving kerbals is strongly balanced in the inactive player\u0027s favor, so be prepared to bring a crew of 10 to rescue 1 stranded kerbal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach part which can house kerbals has a \u0022security multiplier\u0022, which can become very high for late-game pods and even higher for colony control modules. This multiplier makes it harder to hijack a craft. Each kerbal within each part is weighted by that multiplier, so one kerbal might count for either 0.5 or 20 kerbals, depending on the part. If a player wants to move another player\u0027s kerbals, they need an \u003Cem\u003Eunweighted\u003C/em\u003E number of kerbals to match the \u003Cem\u003Eweighted\u003C/em\u003E kerbals of every other player in that craft/colony \u003Cem\u003Ecombined\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, if someone is running an airplane service, every kerbal in the big passenger bays has a 0.5 multiplier, so if there are 100 kerbals being transported, the player needs more than 50 kerbals docked to that craft to be able to move those passengers. Add a Mk. 3 pod (4 kerbals) with a multiplier of 5, and you need 70 kerbals to move those passengers. Finishing at a colony and recovering the craft dumps all the kerbals back into the colony pool, where they can be moved and reassigned collaboratively or, if the player has majority in that colony, alone.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0So, what happens when a craft is pirated? The player who has the weighted majority can move any kerbal in the ship/colony, even if it does not belong to them. However, they cannot EVA them. This way, any kerbals transferred without consent will find themselves still in a ship capable of getting to a safe colony - even if that is a pirate ship. Also, some colony modules will have very high multipliers, so a group of 20 kerbals in a secure module cannot be dislodged by 500 kerbals in the colony, allowing that player to keep the rest of their kerbals safe from others\u0027 control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-03T18:55:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2022 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T01:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get rid of the piracy and forced take over of other people\u0027s crafts and buildings, this is a decent outline to how multiplayer could work with resource sharing and co-op builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T02:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that the piracy is a little bit out of tune with the stock experience, but why not include it in the suggestion.

Personally I think that when a player is off the server, things should happen like normal (their craft keep flying and are still controllable, their population still expands with boom events, their colonies still do supply missions) but when the player is removed from the server (by kick, ban, blacklist, or otherwise) their kerbals are distributed randomly across all other players. This will almost inevitably make all their colonies into community colonies, as all the players have full access to it, and their biggest ships will also become controllable by everyone. The other players can then choose to sort out their kerbals and kick other players\u0027 kerbals off their ships, but it is only if they feel like it. If the kerbals in the colonies undergo boom events, the new kerbals belong to the active players permanently. that way, if the banned player returns, they will find their kerbals sort of in the state that they left them, albeit maybe a bit scattered across the system. Annoying for sure, but this is just a rough sketch of an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Thinking again about forcibly moving kerbals, I think there is a better solution that is more in line with Stock: In colonies, you can assign seats to other players\u0027 kerbals and some kerbals in their population will fill them, so you can give other players control easily. In ships, you can shift your kerbals around and if there is an open spot in a command pod, you can get into it. To actually steal the ship however, you will need to recover the ship at a space center or colony, at which point the other players\u0027 kerbals will disembark and live in the colony (Hospitality before everything! Also, it gives the other player more population)and you can relaunch the ship with a new crew, effectively stealing it. Once again, it is a little out of tune with stock, but it is an improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-24T18:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to say without knowing what type of multiplayer hosting Intercept intends on using for KSP2.
