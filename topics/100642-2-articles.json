Players choosing to fly IVA, however, are probably seeking that more immersive experience and have already decided to learn how to interpret the instruments.

During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\u003Cp\u003ENext up is implementing the actual jettisoning behavior for the panels, and also writing in the enclosure detection, which is already being handled by the cargo bay module. There is quite a bit of work still left to be done, but I dare say what we have is looking pretty good already. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fairings are very customizable via the part.cfg, so we can determine the number of panels, the amount (if any) of edge smoothing between panels of different angles, as well as a number of other parameters, on a per part basis. And yes, we are planning on a number of different sizes of fairing parts (at least covering 1.25m through 3.5m profiles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYAYYY!!!
