Presumably each part has its own collision mesh. Can a single part have more than one? Using the hitchhiker compartment as an example, you have four \u0022states\u0022 - both hatches closed, hatch A open/B closed, B open/A closed, and both open. If you can model the collision mesh as \u0022both open\u0022 by default (a hollow tube with open ends), then add/remove \u0022cap\u0022 meshes on either end as necessary along with appropriate textures, that should be fine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re suggesting is okay for stock game, but not scaleable for crew compartments from add-ons, with the potential to have far more hatches than *just* the couple used in the Hitchhiker. Surface-attached docking ports are even worse because then you\u0027d have internal hatches clipping through what add-on authors would, for instance, have intended to be uninterrupted rows of computer banks or other internal doodads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, IVA navigation that involves Kerbals actually walking around inside might be fun the first couple of times, but it becomes tedious when managing larger numbers of crew. As tempting as it is to retort with \u0022just make all the options available for all playtypes!\u0022, bear in mind that we\u0027re talking about lots of development time being put into a relatively minor convenience feature - given SQUAD\u0027s current direction, I don\u0027t think they want to spend too much time on comprehensive IVA overhauls. As such, I believe my proposal as originally presented is more efficient to use and quicker to implement as a small part of a major update (whereas your idea will take up an entire update in itself).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T10:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about add-on command pods large enough to warrant this (hypothetical) walk-through feature (e.g. Karmony Utilities, Starvision\u0027s USS Enterprise NCC-1701 bridge)?
