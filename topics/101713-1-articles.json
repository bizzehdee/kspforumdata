It\u0027s time to sign up to protect the galaxy from the Iconians.\n\u003E \n\u003E Starfleet, the Klingon Defense Force, and the Romulan Republic have all kicked up their recruiting efforts. New captains in any of these factions will be known as Delta Recruits, and they bring with them the knowledge and capability needed to see to the future of the galaxy.\n\u003E \n\u003E There will never been a better time to start playing Star Trek Online than during the Delta Recruitment event, which runs from April 2nd to May 21st. Characters made during this time will be Delta Recruits, and they will earn a host of new benefits and rewards to aid them in their leveling experience.\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta Recruits are specifically designed to rapidly close the gap that exists between new characters and characters that have been in Star Trek Online for years. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the most new-player friendly the game has been in almost two years, and the perfect time to join the community of Star Trek Online.\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta Recruits have a secondary responsibility, and that is to prepare themselves, their crews, and their entire factions for the coming Iconian War. A mysterious benefactor, an experienced captain traveling back in time, will contact all Delta Recruits during their faction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tutorial and inform them of the opportunities not to be missed during their career. Each faction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own temporal agency can confirm that what this person said is true, and will guide them using the Delta Recruit window, a new UI element that appears near the Mission Tracker.\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta Recruits will be playing a parallel story to that of their chosen faction. They have a list of goals that they can achieve at any time, and completing these goals will see them rewarded with equipment, Marks, and other rewards beneficial not just to the Delta Recruit, but to all characters on the same account. Completing the story arcs of your chosen faction will reward you with a unique Starship Trait for all characters on your account: Temporal Insight. This trait will proc a Damage Immunity when you use any Hull Heal on your starship.\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta Recruits can only be created during the Delta Recruit event. These recruits can be recognized by the Delta Symbol (\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC ) next to their names. All Delta Recruits will have an inherent bonus trait during the Delta Recruit Event of generating Dilithium Ore upon defeating enemies, a bonus which extends to your entire group. This trait will only be available during this event and will be gone once the Delta Recruitment event ends, so gather your Dilithium Ore while you can!\n\u003E \n\u003E Additional rewards are gained by leveling up, playing through story content up through the Breen story arc, and finding special Delta Recruit objectives on certain mission maps. Many of the same things that players do while levelling their characters will earn Delta Recruits improved rewards!\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, during the first six weeks of the seven-week Delta Recruit event, there will be server wide goals that only Delta Recruits can contribute to, but by accomplishing these goals, they unlock bonuses for the entire server for the whole of the next week of the event! For example, in the first week of the event, every Episode First Run that Delta Recruits complete will count towards the goal. How many First Runs they complete will determine the bonus of the week-long event running in Week 2. You will have either a 1.5x XP bonus, a 2x XP bonus, or possibly even a 2.5x XP bonus for the entire week!\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s far too many bonuses and rewards available to list them all here, so get ready to make your Delta Recruit (all accounts are getting one extra free character slot), and keep watching between now and April 2nd for more information.\n\nSo, yeah, if you are interested, visit startrekonline.com"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T18:59:29Z","Content":"1) Is it subscription, one time pay, or free to play game?\n\n2) Is it PvE (like WoW Normal servers) or PvP (like Lineage)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T19:35:21Z","Content":"it\u0027s F2P but stuff is set regularly that might get you to want to buy it. Or you have to grind a lot to get them. I was playing it(though I found the ship releases annoying), but being on linux, and running through wine, it was hard to grind becuase of performance decreases after basically every instanced event. which the game is largely based on for combat. And was/is for the world/universe map. Although I think they might have changed that to a larger single galaxy map for everyone. But there were instances for each galaxy/area also. So you could endlessly jump for harvesting resources or whatever you needed. Helped with lag when overcrowded. Unless you wanted in the lag for fun. Which did sometimes happen. Especially with the balloon guns. Which of course they eventually nerfed... 8\\"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T20:03:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) Is it subscription, one time pay, or free to play game?\n\u003E 2) Is it PvE (like WoW Normal servers) or PvP (like Lineage)?\n\nIt is effectively a Free to play game with the option to set up a subscription for ease of access to get ships and other stuff that you cannot get either by energy credit (main in-game currency) or as rewards for doing missions\n\nThere is very much based around the main story missions (which they are slowly revamping from when I started), but there is other stuff you can do including both pvp and pve. Also, you have a passive alternative to battling in missions to level up (you can currently level up to level 60 Fleet Admiral on the Federation side) in the form of duty officer missions (I can\u0027t remember what level you can start doing this, though I am positive that it is after you get your second ship)."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T23:50:11Z","Content":"The difference between PvE and PvP is that:\n\nOn PvP server / game you can be attacked by other player in normal (non-battleground) areas without your consent, in PvE games PvP is limited to agreed duels and designated battlegrounds.\n\nSo what happens in Star Track Online?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T00:15:58Z","Content":"The way it is set up in STO (as we call it for short), is that the main \u0022lobby\u0022 is set apart from both pvp and pve.
