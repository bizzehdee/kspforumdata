And was/is for the world/universe map. Although I think they might have changed that to a larger single galaxy map for everyone. But there were instances for each galaxy/area also. So you could endlessly jump for harvesting resources or whatever you needed. Helped with lag when overcrowded. Unless you wanted in the lag for fun. Which did sometimes happen.
