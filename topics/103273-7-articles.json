I took the time to read this entire thread today, whilst my bosses weren\u0027t looking, and I get the impression that I\u0027m one of a few players who just love the game. I have no serious complaints about it. Yeah I\u0027d like some things fixed and changed, but those are petty gripes. I\u0027d like my fuel cap on my car to be a bit more secure but I wouldn\u0027t demand the company hold up all of production just to fix my little issue. And no, I don\u0027t play with mods. Some of them are really cool looking, but I want to play Squad\u0027s Kerbal Space Progam, not some one elses. Even if I did have a mod and bugs were popping up, I wouldn\u0027t hold Squad accountable. \u003Cp\u003EI do remember earlier on the issue with the big orange tanks and over heating. I was equally frustrated and annoyed with the large rockets wobbling about with the older SAS system. The infini-gliders are kinda fun, but those are gonna disappear as well with the new atmosphere system. Bugs are being dealt with. Full disclosure, I haven\u0027t come across any. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave that one time my space station mysteriously exploded and sent debris in all directions at 3/4\u0027s the speed of light. That was a notable day as all of my crew were back on Kerbin ready to launch again. Would Love to have heard Jeb explain that incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven that bug was before .25 and I want to say ARM. I like this game, I love what it does, and what it intends to do. I get the feeling that it isn\u0027t about a continual development cycle, it\u0027s about the players always wanting more regardless. I imagine if there was clouds and night time light pollution then some one would be demanding to hit birds on the way up, or to see Aura Borealis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf an asteroid took out every member of Squad I\u0027d still be happy to play .9 as the final development. This game did so much more than I expected and taught me a lot about math and science. I hit a point where I was ready to do calculations and research before I launched a rocket. I hit that point honestly a long time ago, . The rest has been frosting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
