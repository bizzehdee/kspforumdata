Been watching loads of handy tutorials on YouTube without which I\u0027d be still trying to get off the landing pad. I\u0027m slowly getting my head around the game. Recently installed MechJeb and expect that I\u0027ll be getting to grips with it faster now that I don\u0027t have to worry about overshooting my maneuver nodes while time warping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ve been trying to go mining on the Mun. I\u0027ve so far managed to strand a pilot there, and mounted a successful rescue. safely returning Danrick Kermin to Kerbal (although I may have killed 6 Kerbals in the process), so I\u0027ve got the whole Hohmann Transfer thing down. I\u0027ve managed to achieve a polar orbit without the aid of MechJeb. I got my probe with the M700 Survey Scanner to what I believed was a polar orbit. I tried to run a scan, and was told that I must be in a stable polar orbit of between 25km and 1km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm... I decided that maybe my orbit wasn\u0027t exactly polar, and may have been off by a couple of degrees. I\u0027m not really too sure how to check. So, this prompted me\u00A0to install MechJeb, which I used to achieve an orbit of exactly 90 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPolar orbit.... check\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStable.... check\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20km is between 25km and 1km... check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scanner is still telling me that I must be in a stable polar orbit of between 25km and 1km to perform a scan. Does anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T03:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure it says 1km? \u00A0That would be... underground on all but the lowest parts of the Mun. \u00A0I suspect 25km is the minimum, and some bigger number (1mm?) is the maximum. \u00A0So maybe try expanding your orbit (burn prograde wherever), circularize, then try the scanner again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garbarrage","CreatedById":173052,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T04:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s done it.

An extreme amount of detail to process the first few times. But then it gets a lot easier. -- It\u0027s not exactly the game that\u0027s hard, though. It\u0027s doing a pretty good job of simulating reality, and the real world is in fact fairly complex like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
