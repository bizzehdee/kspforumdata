Here\u0027s a list of things to check:\n\n**Do you have the most recent CKAN release?**\n\nThe CKAN has a fast release cycle and is updated regularly. Please [check our release page](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases) to make sure you have the most recent release.\n\n**Is your modlist up to date?**\n\nThe CKAN metadata is constantly being updated. Please hit the refresh button in the GUI, or \u0060ckan.exe update\u0060 on the command-line. Your issue may have already been solved!\n\n**Does it relate to a new release that\u0027s less than three hours old?**\n\nThe CKAN indexer can take up to three hours to index a mod. If it\u0027s a very new release and we seem to be missing it, the indexer bot may still be digesting the release. Please be patient!\n\n**Are you using the right KSP install?**\n\nThis seems obvious, but do check that your KSP version is what you expect, and CKAN is running on the KSP install you intend.\n\n**Is it a genuine bug that needs to be tracked and fixed?**\n\nCKAN development is focused on github. Reporting bugs there means both contributors and interested parties can track their progress. If you\u0027ve found a genuine bug, please [search for it on github](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/issues) and add to the appropriate ticket, or create a new ticket as appropriate.\n\n**Have you read the code of conduct?**\n\nThe CKAN project takes matters of diversity and safety *very* seriously. Behaviour which violates the [**code of conduct**](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) will not be tolerated.\n\n**Have you checked all of the above?**\n\nGreat! Then this is the place for you to post. Please be aware that the CKAN is a volunteer effort, and is the result of *hundreds* of contributors volunteering their time and effort, so please be patient and respectful. If you know a solution to someone else\u0027s issue, please *do* offer them assistance and help. If you\u0027d like to contribute more to the CKAN, or would just like to participate further, we suggest you join our [IRC channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=ckan), check out the [CKAN wiki](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki), or even comment on or tackle [one of our issues](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/issues).\n\n**When posting,** ***please*** **include all of the following:**\n\n\\* Your CKAN version (seen in the window title, or from \u0060ckan.exe version\u0060)\n\n\\* Your KSP version\n\n\\* Your operating system\n\n\\* If an exception was thrown, everything up to (but not including) the \u0022Loaded Assemblies\u0022 line\n\n\\* Any other details that you feel are relevant."},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T20:56:59Z","Content":"**Kerbal Inventory System (1.1.5) / Kerbal Attachment System (0.5.2)**\n\nMod is reported as \u0027Compatible\u0027 under CKAN 1.10.0 / KSP 1.0.4.
