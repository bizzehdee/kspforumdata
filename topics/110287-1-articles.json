Wasn\u0027t expecting this! I do have some highlights on my channel. I tend to stream during the daytime USA time. I\u0027m currently working on a career mode where we are trying to colonize every moon, planet and whatever else we think of. This all courtesy of the Kerbal Science Institute (KSI) which looked up into the sky and realized there seemed to be no other kerbals out there so are out to spread across the system, and maybe if they are lucky find some other kerbals or something. But if not to make sure that there /are/ other kerbals out there when they are finished!\n\nSide note: Every Wednesday at roughly 3 PM CST I do a viewer appreciation stream. This is where I take viewer requests for challenges, I will review craft, mods, or explain things on request as well. All I ask is you twitch message me by Monday evening so I can have some time to read through the requests and see what I have a chance to pull off. I am always surprised by the wonderful things my viewers come up to challenge me with! My most recent highlight video is of an Apollo 11 stock part replica challenge which turned out far better than I expected.\n\nHope to see you all around twitch if you get a chance!\n\n-OakTree42 You can find me at: [http://www.twitch.tv/oaktree42/](http://www.twitch.tv/oaktree42/) or on twitter @Oaktree42 (Oddly enough!)"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:44:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for this honor!
