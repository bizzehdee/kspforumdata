The trick is now you can\u0027t just jet power your way into orbit. 1500m/s is FAST! I usually shoot for this speed around 20-25km then once I hit mach 5 I switch over to rockets and shutdown the jets and increase my climb rate from 10deg AoA to 20-25deg AoA. I can usually get most of my SSTOs into orbit with over 1200m/s DeltaV remaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is, the REAL life Skylon project shoots for mach 5 before it does its SABRE engine switch to closed cycle for the ascent into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
