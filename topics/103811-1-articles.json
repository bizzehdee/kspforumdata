He says that the program supports OSX, but there don\u0027t seem to be any OSX-specific instructions, particularly regarding file placement of the KSP.app directory and the xxxx.craft you want rendered. Is there an existing tutorial, or would someone out of the goodness of their heart make one/show me? Much appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
