For example I played one of the mage classes but you can still wear heavy armour and any weapon if you want without penalties. You can only have 5 spells in your quickbar at any one time. This may seem restrictive but this is how you level up your skills. YOu dont have to use the skills that are in the quickbar but as long as they are there, you will gain skill xp whenever you gain regular xp. Also at every 5th level you get to \u0022morph\u0022 a skill. IE This healing spell can now either heal more or also replenish magika\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works for the crafting system too. You can craft everything if you want (this will take skillpoints away from other skills at endgame though) However the crafting system itself is quite basic and theres no auction house system (unless you join a guild, then you get a sort of guild auction house)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know if theres a mod for it or not but the inventory system is really clunky. ITs like skyrims inventory system in that everything is in a list rather than icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts got an interesting system that rewards you for actually exploring (you find some loot and lorebooks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rate of experience gain is aakin to the original world of warcraft. You gotta work for your levels!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally dont like the combat system. I prefer the oldschool \u0022click on target\u0022 and it autoattacks and you use skills as and when but this is just personal preference\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know how on the ball you are with elder scrolls lore but this game takes place in the second era when molag baal is being a nuisance. All the quest dialogue is voice acted which would be a nice touch if the quests didnt suffer from that MMO syndrome of \u0022pick up all the quests, do them all by following the markers on the map, then handing them in\u0022 So you dont really pay any attention to the quest dialogue (as in any other mmo i ever played)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I find is, for me, its just another mmo. You run around and get experience and maybe craft some stuff...but thats essentially the gameplay it just doesnt feel like an immersive elder scrolls game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure its actually really good but like I said, MMO\u0027s just dont cut it for me any more. HOWEVER! I have only just reached level 10 and unlocked pvp so that may redeem it (i\u0027m quite competetive so I want to investigate the pvp system more)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-16T11:08:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2014 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T13:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, although I haven\u0027t played ESO, I actually prefer multiplayer Skyrim more\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T14:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI played the Beta some. I really liked it. It really felt exactly like you would expect an Elder Scrolls game to feel like. I put probably 400 hours into Skyrim, and I don\u0027t know how many into Oblivion and Morrowind. ESO looked like the perfect game for me. And it really felt great, as a Beta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not buy it, though. A $15-a-month MMO is just so hard for me to justify. I don\u0027t mind spending $60 on a game, but asking $60 PLUS $150 for the rest of the year is just a tough pill to swallow. I understand (rationally) that the cost is to offset servers and whatnot, but it just becomes a huge barrier to entry. Especially considering I can get 75% of the experience from playing existing games (such as Skyrim). I would love to love this game, but I just can\u0027t justify it at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T11:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vetrox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vetrox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was really looking forward to it but I have long grown out of MMO\u0027s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah somewhat the same here.
