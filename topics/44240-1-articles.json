I have discovered that if I create a branch of parts (with the symmetry feature turned off so that I\u0027m only creating a single row of parts) that once I have a few parts in that grouping, if I select the lead part (and thus all parts attached to it) and then turn on the symmetry feature to repeat the assembly around the core part, that it creates a symmetry bug after you go to either the launch screen or reload your vehicle. In either case, the vehicle becomes corrupt and usually causes a system crash or lockup if you try to edit the part again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bug is that if one of the repeat features (I believe it to be the original grouping placed) gets duplicated atop itself the same number of times as the symmetry feature you selected. So if you had a fuel tank and engine and you selected a symmetry 6, you would have 6 repeats of the fuel tank and engine with just one of those locations having 6 of each component ontop of itself. You can\u0027t miss it, the parts will be much brighter than all the other components and will have mesh jumbling as they computer is trying to display them all at the same time (all this while in the VAB). On the launch pad, when the screen finally loads I typically see the ship falling to pieces and some of the parts laying on the ground or placed oddly within the ship with engines firing and under power. The ship will be oddly re-assembled, with about 80% of the ship with what you expected and the rest in a post-launch active and fallen state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bug usually doesn\u0027t \u0022appear\u0022 as I activate the symmetry during assembly, it\u0027s only after I\u0027ve launched or re-loaded the vehicle that the bug shows up. Usually when I try to edit the ship after the corruption, if I select any of the parts on the \u0022stacked\u0022 arm, then will usually either lock up or become unable to deselect the part, drop the part, get a new part, or re-attach the part to anything. Only once was i actually able to deselect the parts, and that\u0027s where I noticed there were the same amount of parts in the stack as the number of symmetrical components, so there is an assumption on my part that a different number of symmetry will result in different stack quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the quick response is, \u0022don\u0027t build \u0027em that way stupid\u0022, but quite often with a bit of lag in the assembly process I\u0027ll grab a previously placed symmetrical component by accident and place it back, only to find the bug later on and have to scrap the design and start completely over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, mods I currently have loaded are Fuel Balancer V2.0, ISAMapsat X4R1, Kethane 7.7, Kerbal Alarm Clock 2.5, and Mechjeb 2.0.9.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T02:49:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jean Deaux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T03:34:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I went with the analogy that if you want something done right, best do it yourself.

I kept running into this bug rather randomly, sometimes a mod wouldn\u0027t cause it to appear, other times it would. What I began to take notice (mainly when I was attempting to get some play/design time in) is that the more parts I had in use, the higher my chances of the bug appearing. So what I opted to do was create a large model to first test the core KSP program to make sure it was working okay, and then move on to loading a single mod at a time to see if it caused the bug to appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to Test Ship module consisting of 1120 parts (have a well built high-end PC to load this baby) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/test_9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/test_9\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built the ship with no mods loaded, so obviously all stock parts, and would frequently save, load, launch, etc. to test and see if the bug showed up. As I expected, no bugs or problems occurred during the entire assembly process. Once I felt I had enough parts, I started to load one mod, test, close KSB, remove the mod, load another mod, launch KSP, repeat test... rinse, wash, repeat several times. What I was surprised to learn was that every single mod I tried resulted in the symmetry bug. I found this very odd and decided to try the stock version of the game and test in the same manner, sure enough the stock version of the game also resulted in the symmetry bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I performed my test....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I selected one of the \u0022branches\u0022 of the loaded file with Symmetry set to 1 (or off).
