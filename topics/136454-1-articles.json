When i used to use google as a browser the \u00A0first was r/r*******s\u00A0and rather than fish through the other psuedolinks i would go through that and log into my imgur album\u00A0page. I replaced google with duck-duck go and all those NSFW links onto imgur dissappeared. Unfortunately the porn is a large attractor to imgur viewers and porn is the most lucrative business on the net, i use a vigorus popup blocker to block alot of this stuff, but on my imgur album i see no adds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nature of the net is what it is, if you read reddit, that which is the norm on most of their front pages is pretty much offensive to my generation. But\u00A0the problem is if you hide from this you become a back row spectator to modern life, and you create a generation gap between yourself and younger people.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T23:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh damn, I meant to put it in Kerbal\u00A0Network! xD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T00:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Imgur does host adult content, such adult content is placed behind an appropriate age-wall which requires the user to state they are 18 years of age before it is displayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis policy makes it an excellent place to host all sorts of images without fear of sudden attacks of pornography, and I see no reason why access should be restricted here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread has been locked, as it is unlikely to go further with appropriate content, and the mainquestion has been answered.
