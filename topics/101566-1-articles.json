I will extend this as I progress with my own Eve journey. \n\n1. Landing to orbit around Kerbin requires around 4500 m/s of Delta -v, while both escape trajectory out of Kerbin and acquiring an orbit around Eve require exactly double that amount. Using MechJeb to calculate that is cool, but generally a lander that can achieve a 105 kilometer orbit (Eve\u0027s atmosphere stops at 96, but better be safe) and inject itself to interplanetary space all by itself from the surface to Kerbin should be a capable Eve lander. \n\n2. Eve\u0027s pressure at sea level is 5atm. However, this doesn\u0027t mean you only need five times less parachutes unless you actually land at sea level, which will make it much harder to ascend later. But no mountain is as high as 10 kilometers either, which has a pressure of 1atm, so you still will need less parachutes. A good calculation therefore is middle ground. Again, test on Kerbin ; achieve orbit with the lander (we\u0027ve already checked that it is more than capable of doing so), then deorbit it multiple times with a varying amount of parachutes . When it can barely land without breaking its landing legs, remove around 1/4 to 1/3 of the chutes (you have to compensate for the fuel weight you burnt during ascent)\n\n3. Taking of from Eve can also be a challenge. Generally, an Eve lander has to be able to takeoff from Kerbin with 50% thrust or less. Therefore, it needs a TWR of around 2.25-3 on the surface of Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T23:19:54Z","Content":"For parachutes, just use [KSP Parachute Calculator](http://ksp.freeiz.com/) and be sure to select Eve.\n\nTo test landing and ascent from Eve, why do that on Kerbin when you can test it on Eve directly using hyperedit? Use hyperedit to put your lander in low orbit of Eve or into an orbit in the atmosphere if you don\u0027t want to practice de-orbit burns - any altitude inside the atmosphere will eventually bring you to the surface so you can test your parachutes and landing gear.

It\u0027s just another tool that you can add to your toolbox - it is entirely optional and up to you whether you want to use it. The same can be said for using the debug menu for spacecraft testing. The purists out there may hate this idea, but there are plenty of folks who may find it useful to use mods for testing. Eve is an especially good example of where a mod like hyperedit can really save you a lot of time, but it does require a reasonably high amount of self-control to make sure you don\u0027t over-use it.\n\nEDIT: the parachute calculator is not even a mod, that is just a useful website."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:50:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For parachutes, just use [KSP Parachute Calculator](http://ksp.freeiz.com/) and be sure to select Eve.\n\u003E To test landing and ascent from Eve, why do that on Kerbin when you can test it on Eve directly using hyperedit?

Yes, Hyperedit is just a tool, and so is the calculator, but as you said, they are optional; this tutorial is for the rest.\n\nAnd yeah, never hurts roleplaying realistically ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T13:48:09Z","Content":"Thanks, I do test everything at Kerbin,\n\n(I guess now that I have hyperedit, that is roleplaying)"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:16:30Z","Content":"Is it possible to test on Kerbin by adding dead mass to the launcher ?
