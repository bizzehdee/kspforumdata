I will extend this as I progress with my own Eve journey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Landing to orbit around Kerbin requires around 4500 m/s of Delta -v, while both escape trajectory out of Kerbin and acquiring an orbit around Eve require exactly double that amount. Using MechJeb to calculate that is cool, but generally a lander that can achieve a 105 kilometer orbit (Eve\u0027s atmosphere stops at 96, but better be safe) and inject itself to interplanetary space all by itself from the surface to Kerbin should be a capable Eve lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Eve\u0027s pressure at sea level is 5atm. However, this doesn\u0027t mean you only need five times less parachutes unless you actually land at sea level, which will make it much harder to ascend later. But no mountain is as high as 10 kilometers either, which has a pressure of 1atm, so you still will need less parachutes. A good calculation therefore is middle ground. Again, test on Kerbin ; achieve orbit with the lander (we\u0027ve already checked that it is more than capable of doing so), then deorbit it multiple times with a varying amount of parachutes . When it can barely land without breaking its landing legs, remove around 1/4 to 1/3 of the chutes (you have to compensate for the fuel weight you burnt during ascent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Taking of from Eve can also be a challenge. Generally, an Eve lander has to be able to takeoff from Kerbin with 50% thrust or less. Therefore, it needs a TWR of around 2.25-3 on the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T23:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor parachutes, just use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.freeiz.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Parachute Calculator\u003C/a\u003E and be sure to select Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test landing and ascent from Eve, why do that on Kerbin when you can test it on Eve directly using hyperedit?

It\u0027s just another tool that you can add to your toolbox - it is entirely optional and up to you whether you want to use it. The same can be said for using the debug menu for spacecraft testing. The purists out there may hate this idea, but there are plenty of folks who may find it useful to use mods for testing. Eve is an especially good example of where a mod like hyperedit can really save you a lot of time, but it does require a reasonably high amount of self-control to make sure you don\u0027t over-use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: the parachute calculator is not even a mod, that is just a useful website.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kelderek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kelderek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor parachutes, just use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.freeiz.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Parachute Calculator\u003C/a\u003E and be sure to select Eve.\u003Cp\u003ETo test landing and ascent from Eve, why do that on Kerbin when you can test it on Eve directly using hyperedit?
