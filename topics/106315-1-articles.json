As Brotoro says, you really shouldn\u0027t be deploying chutes \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E re-entry heat. Just wait until the heat is gone and you have a reasonable speed (remember 500m/s is still around mach 2, depending on the air pressure) before deploying them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can use the chutes to bypass re-entry heating. You can also use Hyper-edit to bring your ship to the surface. Whether that\u0027s fun or not is up to yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
