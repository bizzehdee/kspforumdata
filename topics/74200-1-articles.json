The lander is docked inverted to the mothership, meaning it\u0027s lander can and MJ radio box are also inverted. The MS\u0027s command pod and Radio box are oriented correctly. The engines on the lander are shut down (but having them there affects the Dv estimations), and the MS command pod is controlling the ship. I can change orbits (raise, lower, circularize) using the manuever node planner correctly, but anytime i try to match inclination or transfer to mun or minmus, it fires the engines the instant it aligns with the node. The ships fly just fine individually. Any suggestions on whats going on?

I have a hotkey group for the lander engines, they are turned off, and the MS CM is the controlling part.

Thus it\u0027s compensating for this by burning earlier. Bring up the deltaV stats and check to see if the stage TWR is under 1. For every bit under 1 that it is, means slightly more time to execute your maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: on second thought, you saying \u0022every other time\u0022......is it with this same ship?
