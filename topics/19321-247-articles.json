I just don\u0027t know, i managed in previous versions to make more or less successful SSTO\u0027s... but with the current version I just can\u0027t, they won\u0027t make it... and i believe i\u0027m pretty experienced when it comes to gameplay...

I tried throttling back, switching to rockets but so far i have no success... And if by any chance i try to hit the rockets before that critical point i end up not having enough fuel to perform the orbital manouvers... Tried different combinations of engines and fuels amounts (including oxidyzer), turbojet\u002Bnuclear, turbojet\u002BLVs, and turbojets\u002Brapier, the most successful one was the last one...
