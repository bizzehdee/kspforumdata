The career mode however, is a bit sad for a (now released) game, specially for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, you start the career with a very limited and restricting game, going through a lot of grind to unlock further stuff. As the game progresses and new parts are unlocked, if gets easier and easier, not because you\u0027ve acquired knowledge and practice though. The early game feels more like a challenge to veteran players than anything else, just image how new players will feel coming into this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of limiting the players choice, I feel the game should progress instead as mission and eras:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst go for flight in Kerbin, then try sub-orbital rockets, orbital capsules, EVA, Mun fly-by, then landing and so on. Beginning with a 0.625 ballistic rocket instead of a one part rocket, most of us still don\u0027t understand how we have manned flight before even getting a very use-less early probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe progression of one mission to another and performing key experiments (and maybe accumulating science points) is what leads to new eras of exploration. Note that it is not limiting parts for early game, but instead a full set of lower tech parts, and as progress goes on, access to more advanced techniques, better capacity to weight tanks, more efficient engines, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also to provide a meaningful progression for new players as they learn the basics of space flight, getting into first orbit, the learning to go to moons, then leaving the Kerbin system and so on. Being a smoother progression that doesn\u0027t limit the player all that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stages are more of a an tutorial for newer players, then the game gets more and more open to exploration as it depends more on player choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look at Buzz Aldrin\u0027s game, I didn\u0027t particularly like it that much but it sure gives a very nice example of space program exploration progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere a couple of additions to make this progression even better, based on the mod Kerbal Construction Time, this is to simply give some to actually build and assemble crafts. Right now the only time progression that happens is the time it takes for completing flights, getting from one point to another. This is a major \u003Cstrong\u003Emust have\u003C/strong\u003E for a decent career progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother needed and useful feature would be to have procedural tanks and modular fuels, allowing for a proper shapes and capacity, you only carry what you need. This will help a lot with part clutter, and will fit nicely with tech progression, advanced technologies allows for more variation and such, conical tanks, and etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, you don\u0027t even need to build a lot of newer models and parts for the technological progression, just changing stats, possibilities and maybe throw in a new textures and its done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother mod inspired addition is Remote Tech, not only to make antennas and probes useful, but required, giving a whole lot planning challenge for the late game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this is all mostly done, as it is based off mods. And realistic speaking, you developers are probably not the best out to plan this career progression idea. Well, just the recent changes you made to the tech tree API show that, its basically saying: its in your hands now, we leave to the community to plan out a better tree. With that in mind I suggest to either hire new people, or use some of the very brilliant fan and modders. Or even just make an API with this progression in design and a very basic system and then let we come out with the neat stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve said before, this is not to bash on the devs, the release version brought some of our dreams to reality, with dynamics we couldn\u0027t have dreamed of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the career game is quite an oddity, something not in the same level of greatness as the rest of the game is. Specially if its discouraging new players, on the already steep to learn curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know of your thoughts on this, pull this up to bring attention to the devs. Useful additions are also appreciative, and I\u0027ll sure add them up here for reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really enjoy playing the early career game, so much so that I hardly ever get out of the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system on career before a new version of KSP comes out anymore.
