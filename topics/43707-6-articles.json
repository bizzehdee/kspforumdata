I believe this is a vector that runs from the center of the current gravity well to the active ship. This vector will change in direction based on where above the surface of the planet, the ship is. I believe that this is why we need to add the UP in to our steering commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you\u0027re circumnavigating Kerbin. The UP vector is the vector that connects the center of the planet to your ship so as you circumnavigate, that UP vector is rotating around to match your ship location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, imagine you want to set your ship to a \u002B30 degree incline from the horizon. If you just set your steering to a static direction vector, you would slowly pull up out of the atmosphere as the surface of the planet pulled away from your static vector. Now, if instead, you used UP \u002B some rotation, your angle is always relative to the UP vector, which changes direction based on your ship location. In this way, you can maintain a fixed angle relative to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all speculation on my part, so take it with a grain of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T16:18:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Desrtfox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T16:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the programs are saved in a serialised text file, that\u0027s why editing the text file directly doesn\u0027t work. I am currently trying to put something together as an addon for this since the original project is GPL, but it would be a separate component not a replacer, so that there wouldn\u0027t be any question of it needing to \u0027keep up\u0027 with kOS development. It would be a no-frills, no warranty text area with a save button. I had initially wanted to merge something into the main program on github but to be honest, I can\u0027t understand his code or object structure and it isn\u0027t commented very much. It\u0027s a hell of a lot better than my \u0027make a scripter for KSP\u0027 halfway down my todo list though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo promises though, I\u0027m not new to C# but am new to Unity. So far I\u0027ve managed to make an editable text box that reads in the first \u0022FILE\u0022 from his ARC file. When it is possible to save, it will probably be better to code externally and just paste into the text box from Notepad\u002B\u002B or something. Eventually it may have an import/export button but as a web developer I hate parsing text files that are not XML. I want to keep this as simple as possible, as it\u0027s mostly a \u0022necessity invention\u0022 of sorts as the \u0027official\u0027 editor makes my computer overheat and shut down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xhvkycw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xhvkycw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarLiner","CreatedById":41047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T16:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GavinZac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GavinZac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEventually it may have an import/export button but as a web developer I hate parsing text files that are not XML.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh come on; for an import you just need to load the entire file to the textbox (textbox.Text = IO.File.ReadAllText(string path)) and to export everything is even simpler (File.WriteAllText(textbox.Text, filename)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see where any of these files are...

I believe this is a vector that runs from the center of the current gravity well to the active ship. This vector will change in direction based on where above the surface of the planet, the ship is. I believe that this is why we need to add the UP in to our steering commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you\u0027re circumnavigating Kerbin. The UP vector is the vector that connects the center of the planet to your ship so as you circumnavigate, that UP vector is rotating around to match your ship location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, imagine you want to set your ship to a \u002B30 degree incline from the horizon. If you just set your steering to a static direction vector, you would slowly pull up out of the atmosphere as the surface of the planet pulled away from your static vector. Now, if instead, you used UP \u002B some rotation, your angle is always relative to the UP vector, which changes direction based on your ship location. In this way, you can maintain a fixed angle relative to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all speculation on my part, so take it with a grain of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is correct.
