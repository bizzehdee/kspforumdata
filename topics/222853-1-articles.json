Im currently playing on a mid-spec macbook using Parallels. Is it helpful for me to submit bug reports or might that not be useful because Im on Mac? For instance I\u0027ve noticed re-setting keybinds for throttle delta doesn\u0027t stick when I reboot the game but I can\u0027t tell if thats a mac/parallels specific issue? Other bugs seem very to be clearly not mac related and a lot of folks are echoing the same behaviors but again I know my machine isn\u0027t officially being supported.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-09T16:07:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2024 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 9\u0022\u003EJanuary 9\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicat","CreatedById":228085,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-09T18:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say it\u0027s always good to report bugs if you have the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerformance and crash issues will probably be more uncertain coming from an emulator. For other problems, I think it\u0027s absolutely fine. I would even say there is a higher chance your problem is not linked to your emulator rather than the opposite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, if you report bugs on machines not officially supported (below specs or different platform), people who have this bug can also answer it (to say they have it too). People that might have supported specs, removing the doubt of the hardware specific problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it can even be an advantage; to pinpoint that the problem is hardware specific, I can think of this bug for instance:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022229724\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5669624965\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/218198-strange-terrain-near-special-locations-and-discoverables-possibly-integrated-graphics-related/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat we think is linked to having an iGPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-09T18:55:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2024 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 9\u0022\u003EJanuary 9\u003C/time\u003E by Spicat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-09T20:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
