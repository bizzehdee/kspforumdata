The x-axis is the amount of prograde delta-v applied to expand the orbit, and this takes into account having to apply that same delta-v again to shrink the orbit back. This situation is based on starting at a 100km orbit of Kerbin. Since at that orbit, 930 m/s is enough for escape velocity, I ended there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, for plane changes of 60, 75, and 90, the more speed you add to your orbit initially, the better the savings in the end. For a 45 degree plane change, you can save a little delta-v by putting about 300 in to expand the orbit, but it will start to cost more again after that. For changes less than 45, expanding the orbit no longer has any benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really, it\u0027s up to how long you want to wait to complete the plane change, as obviously, expanding your orbit a lot will extend your orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also checked; these curves don\u0027t change at different starting altitudes, though obviously the range of extra velocity you can add shrinks as your altitude gets higher.

Let\u0027s make an inclination change of angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 only by burning locally. For a pure inclination change, your final speed equals your initial speed, but the velocity vectors differ in direction by angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) First, a truly horrible method: Burn dv = v retrograde, so that your speed is zero. Then burn dv = v in the inclined plane. The total cost is 2v, independent of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. Horrible. Consider this the worst case scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The best local, single-burn method is a burn along the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the initial prograde velocity vector and the final inclined plane velocity vector. The triangle has two sides of length v at angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 to each other.

Thus the arc length dv is equal to v \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. Remember to use radians for arc lengths instead of degrees. 90 degrees = pi/2 radians. So dv = pi/2 v. This method is always costlier than method 2.

A solution is: v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = v cos(c t), v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = v sin(c t). The total burn delta-v is obtained by integrating the acceleration a = sqrt(a\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E \u002B a\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E) = c*v from time t = 0 until time T, the time to get to angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. The integral of the constant c*v from 0 to T is simply dv = c*v*T. Now looking back at the solution, at what time T is the velocity inclined by angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8? Ans: When c*T = \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8, because the velocity points along angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 when v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = v cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8) and v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = v sin(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8). Thus dv = c*v*T = v \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(What is the angular velocity c anyway?
