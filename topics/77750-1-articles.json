There doesn\u0027t seem to be a good reason for this. Why is this the case? I know you can stick a small RCS tank to the side of what you\u0027re launching, but that messes with the mass and takes up space of small probes, two things extremely important for them. I am somewhat sure there are other parts of similar size that also don\u0027t work right. It has gotten me quite flustered when I can\u0027t attack things when they *should* work, especially when it is important that they are placed exactly where they are needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably a pretty tiny fix, we should bug the devs about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that enabling part clipping does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has been posted before, I searched a bit and didn\u0027t find any concrete answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T20:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENormal fuel tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachRules = 1,1,1,1,0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOscar-B:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachRules = 1,0,1,1,0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing that this is why?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T21:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a bug report, it\u0027s more of a suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T22:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis isn\u0027t a bug report, it\u0027s more of a suggestion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s correct.
