The crew will four 5-Star veterans. The trick is I am not sure when I should launch. My space station launch vehicle has 13,447 m/s of delta-V to work with. I know I should aim for a rendezvous a or shortly after the asteroid reaches its periapsis, but I\u0027m not sure of the best way to do that. On the picture below I have marked the current location of the asteroid (red star), and the four options I can think of. As it says on the picture, the asteroid will reach periapsis in just over 1 Kerbin year. I would like opinions on which option I should use. Please note the asteroid\u0027s orbit is moderately inclined to Kerbin\u0027s, and descends below the ecliptic just before periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lkhb5wX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lkhb5wX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first option is marked by the green triangle, and that is the current location of Kerbin. The idea of launch now is to put the space station into an elliptical orbit out beyond Duna, and have the space station arrive at or near the asteroid\u0027s periapsis at about the same time as the asteroid and importantly on about the same plane, so I have to do is burn like hell to match velocity. An earlier launch attempt that I aborted because I only had one Kerbal aboard showed the delta-v required to match velocity would be about 6000 m/s. Perfectly doable with this vehicle. The the other options would involve direct flights, and not launching for at least a Kerbin year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next option is to launch when the asteroid is at its periapsis, and I have marked the approximate location Kerbin will be in with the yellow pentagon. An advantage of this is that I won\u0027t need to muck around with timing arrival at the periapsis. I will also be catching up to the asteroid while it is decelerating, which might save some delta-v. The disadvantages are that I have to wait (I hate to wait), and rendezvous will probably not happen until the asteroid is out past Jool (meaning more waiting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third option marked by the blue rhombus is to wait a few weeks after periapsis, and catch up to the asteroid as it decelerates out. In retrospect I think launch there is about the worst option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forth option marked by the pink square is to launch when I can get the maximum boost from kerbin, in about 1.5 years. The burn to catch up the asteroid will be enormous, and as will the burn to match velocities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo which one would you choose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a picture of the asteroid\u0027s orbit. I\u0027m sending my Kerbals on a very long away mission.

kind of rendezvous, but I think the earliest launch option is the best choice.\u00A0 You\u0027ll be making a classic orbital rendezvous, with planes already matched and an orbital intercept established, so all you have to do is kill your relative velocity to match with the asteroid.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve done 95% of that, you\u0027ll gain time (because you\u0027ll stay near the target for a longer period) in which to finish matching and actually grapple into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a mission like this, a written checklist is a strong recommendation -- forget a
