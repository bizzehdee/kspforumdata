I did have to use the offset tools for that (so that the tanks would connect at the right spots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my SIC stage - the spine of the stage is a line of XL Girder segments. There are no internal tanks besides the visible 4 outside ones. I tell myself this makes up for the bottom (Mk2-3 adaptors) that account for the Saturn V\u0027s bulge at the bottom. The downside of this is that the lower stage implodes on separation (I was never able to fix that) but otherwise it flys wonderfully.

MF had a 25% \u002B failure rate on decouplers which means that almost every launch was a pain in the neck - on the other hand I never saw a failure other than that when I was using that mod (and it was always a silent failure too). The one thing I dislike with Dang IT! is that it has a Master Alarm sound effect which isn\u0027t easy to turn off. If there is a failure during launch (Apollo X had a LEM reaction wheel failure) - you get stuck with the alarm until your in orbit it seems. The failures can usually be fixed without any problem. They ruined my day on Apollo VII because of the way monopropellent flows. One tank leaked when I had my machine on mute and drained \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of my CSM\u0027s mono-propellent.

I\u0027m not sure if Apollo 13 will happen by itself or if I\u0027ll need to force it (using the manual failure option on the mod) - but for post 13 missions everything is going to become a lot more organic as I move beyond just recreating steps in the Apollo program and move into AAP elements too. For Apollo X - I\u0027ll just say that Bill and Jeb\u0027s relationship will never be the same after that mission.

They push for the Eve flyby mission that has long been talked of. Having got the mission approved, engineers and mission planners work overtime to get everything ready for the Eve transfer window in just a few months time. A spare Skylab is modified to be suitable for the mission and a special S-IVB stage is constructed to provide the fuel needed to shift something the size of Skylab all the way out to Eve. It is decided early on that the S-IVB will be discarded around Eve, with the CSM\u0027s engines firing to provide the final push back to Kerbin. In order to do this it must have as much fuel as possible, so launching with the conventional Saturn IB and using fuel cells for power will be impossible. Engineers quickly retrofit a CSM in storage with photovoltaic panels and a new Saturn IB rocket is commissioned with an expanded S-IVB stage and four strap-on solid rocket boosters. This will enable the CSM to reach orbit with nearly all its fuel, expending only a little on rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, with just weeks to go, the whole system is ready.

Kirnand was engineer on Apollo XIV on which he deployed a Lunar Satellite by EVA as well as walking on the surface, and also flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

During the course of the transfer, the Skylab mission ends and its crew are returned to Kerbin. As Aphrodite I approaches Eve, two probes are deployed, intended to enter the planet\u0027s atmosphere and land. However, due to an engineering oversight the probes lack the torque to overcome their off-axis thrust, resulting in one hitting one of the CSM\u0027s solar panels. The probe drop is aborted, much to the scientists\u0027 dismay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ubiaz7B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ubiaz7B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew get just a few hours of observation of Eve before they must start up their engines to put themselves on a trajectory that intercepts Kerbin. The S-IVB stage burns out sooner than expected, meaning that the CSM must make the brunt of the burn. The crew only just make it, using RCS thrusters to fine tune their trajectory after the fuel runs out. Several months later, they return to Kerbin, streaking across the polar skies at above 4km/s. The CM detaches and orients itself with heat shield first, while the rest of the spacecraft burns up rapidly.

They push for the Eve flyby mission that has long been talked of. Having got the mission approved, engineers and mission planners work overtime to get everything ready for the Eve transfer window in just a few months time. A spare Skylab is modified to be suitable for the mission and a special S-IVB stage is constructed to provide the fuel needed to shift something the size of Skylab all the way out to Eve. It is decided early on that the S-IVB will be discarded around Eve, with the CSM\u0027s engines firing to provide the final push back to Kerbin. In order to do this it must have as much fuel as possible, so launching with the conventional Saturn IB and using fuel cells for power will be impossible. Engineers quickly retrofit a CSM in storage with photovoltaic panels and a new Saturn IB rocket is commissioned with an expanded S-IVB stage and four strap-on solid rocket boosters. This will enable the CSM to reach orbit with nearly all its fuel, expending only a little on rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, with just weeks to go, the whole system is ready.

Kirnand was engineer on Apollo XIV on which he deployed a Lunar Satellite by EVA as well as walking on the surface, and also flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.
