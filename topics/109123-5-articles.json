Is there a physics thing I need to be aware of?\n\u003E \n\u003E All in all, eager to see everyone else\u0027s next steps!\n\nI\u0027ve got an octogon truss piece (can\u0027t remember what stock calls it) on the Mk 1-2 pod with the parachutes attached to it so that they appear to be inside the pod, but without clipping things (2 drogue and 2 normal). There are also 3 communitrons in there angled so that when deployed (action group 4) they become Apollo\u0027s male docking port.\n\n![CC443D7C2FA88AA4F8DA8AFF359E61ECD7788D45](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29615831437935279/CC443D7C2FA88AA4F8DA8AFF359E61ECD7788D45/)\n\nSo the docking port isn\u0027t offset, its on top of another piece and the struts are because I wasn\u0027t sure if it would hold together fine without it. It worked well enough that I never went back and removed them.\n\nFor my LEM - The decent stage is all built around the decoupler from the Ascent stage - so it stays behind wonderfully when I stage. I did have to use the offset tools for that (so that the tanks would connect at the right spots.\n\nFor my SIC stage - the spine of the stage is a line of XL Girder segments. There are no internal tanks besides the visible 4 outside ones. I tell myself this makes up for the bottom (Mk2-3 adaptors) that account for the Saturn V\u0027s bulge at the bottom. The downside of this is that the lower stage implodes on separation (I was never able to fix that) but otherwise it flys wonderfully. Most of my ascents don\u0027t use SAS behind the first 3000 meters.\n\nOn Dang IT! - I like it better than Mechanical Failures (The competitor mod). MF had a 25% \u002B failure rate on decouplers which means that almost every launch was a pain in the neck - on the other hand I never saw a failure other than that when I was using that mod (and it was always a silent failure too). The one thing I dislike with Dang IT! is that it has a Master Alarm sound effect which isn\u0027t easy to turn off. If there is a failure during launch (Apollo X had a LEM reaction wheel failure) - you get stuck with the alarm until your in orbit it seems. The failures can usually be fixed without any problem. They ruined my day on Apollo VII because of the way monopropellent flows. One tank leaked when I had my machine on mute and drained *all* of my CSM\u0027s mono-propellent. Apollo VII didn\u0027t need to do LEM docking tests though so I counted it as a win.\n\nApollo VIII was fuel leak happy, but nothing mission critical. It did make Apollo IX feel special since there were no errors throughout the entire flight.\n\n[Just finished Apollo X](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121623-Nessa-an-alternate-history-for-NASA?p=1969678\u0026viewfull=1#post1969678). I decided what I wanted to happen for Apollo X before I flew the mission and it wound up working out perfectly. I\u0027m not sure if Apollo 13 will happen by itself or if I\u0027ll need to force it (using the manual failure option on the mod) - but for post 13 missions everything is going to become a lot more organic as I move beyond just recreating steps in the Apollo program and move into AAP elements too. For Apollo X - I\u0027ll just say that Bill and Jeb\u0027s relationship will never be the same after that mission. Jeb is never going to forget that experience, or who made it happen.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T09:56:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by loch.ness**"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:04:42Z","Content":"The Kapollo 15 and 16 missions are complete, with a writeup and photo album over in [my mission report thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122064-The-KABOOM-Kapollo-Program-Mission-Report-Thread?p=1970870\u0026viewfull=1#post1970870).

The original proposal launched three fully-fueled S-IVB docked in serial arrangement on separate Saturn V launches. These were all attached to a Douglas Manned Orbiting Research Laboratory. The spacecraft supported up to four crew but roomy enough for three for the 942 day flight.\n\nGetting to Duna doesn\u0027t require much more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv than Minmus, so this mission used only three Saturn V launches: MORL, Duna injection stage (enhanved S-IVB), modified Apollo CS/M with three crew and Duna science package (including a surface rover). Got within 119km of Duna and only needed 190m/s burn at Kebol Pe to get back Kerbin. MORL returned to orbit, ready for the next mission (Eve flyby) and crew landed safely.\n\n**MORL in Mars flyby configuration**\n\n![p36.jpg](http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/p36.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They EVA\u0027d back to the LEM and powered it up for liftoff. Mission control were initially anxious that the angle at which the LEM had settled would cause problems on ascent but Sean managed to pilot it straight and a few minutes later they were safely in orbit and rendezvoused with Mirula Kerman in the orbiting CSM. \n\n**APHRODITE -** ***EVE FLYBY***\n\nMeanwhile, scientists at the KSC are confident that the Skylab mission, despite not being yet over, has provided ample enough evidence that kerbals are indeed able to survive in space for long periods of time. They push for the Eve flyby mission that has long been talked of. Having got the mission approved, engineers and mission planners work overtime to get everything ready for the Eve transfer window in just a few months time. A spare Skylab is modified to be suitable for the mission and a special S-IVB stage is constructed to provide the fuel needed to shift something the size of Skylab all the way out to Eve. It is decided early on that the S-IVB will be discarded around Eve, with the CSM\u0027s engines firing to provide the final push back to Kerbin. In order to do this it must have as much fuel as possible, so launching with the conventional Saturn IB and using fuel cells for power will be impossible. Engineers quickly retrofit a CSM in storage with photovoltaic panels and a new Saturn IB rocket is commissioned with an expanded S-IVB stage and four strap-on solid rocket boosters. This will enable the CSM to reach orbit with nearly all its fuel, expending only a little on rendezvous. \n\nFinally, with just weeks to go, the whole system is ready. First to launch is the habitat module as this lacks the attitude control required for docking. \n\n![8xcqeOB.png](http://i.imgur.com/8xcqeOB.png)\n\n![d9UsdPr.png](http://i.imgur.com/d9UsdPr.png)\n\nSafely in orbit, the second part of the Aphrodite spacecraft is launched.\n\n![GEzvBsG.png](http://i.imgur.com/GEzvBsG.png)\n\nUnfortunately more fuel is used in rendezvous than was anticipated, but docking is successful.\n\n![fthAOds.png](http://i.imgur.com/fthAOds.png)\n\nAt last, on the day of the optimum transfer, the first Saturn IB Advanced lifts off with veteran crewmembers Obemy, Kirnand and Franliana. Obemy has flown twice before, once on the very first manned test flight of the CSM, and once in lonely vigil over the Mun on Apollo XI. Kirnand was engineer on Apollo XIV on which he deployed a Lunar Satellite by EVA as well as walking on the surface, and also flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Franliana is the least experienced of the three, having flown only once before as CM pilot on the Apollo XIX mission to Minmus. Between them, however, they all have experience of life in deep space and with how to pilot the CSM. \n\n![CszuVq0.png](http://i.imgur.com/CszuVq0.png)\n\n![URtdtnI.png](http://i.imgur.com/URtdtnI.png)\n\nThe CSM docks successfully and a short burn puts them on course to intercept Eve. During the course of the transfer, the Skylab mission ends and its crew are returned to Kerbin. As Aphrodite I approaches Eve, two probes are deployed, intended to enter the planet\u0027s atmosphere and land. However, due to an engineering oversight the probes lack the torque to overcome their off-axis thrust, resulting in one hitting one of the CSM\u0027s solar panels. The probe drop is aborted, much to the scientists\u0027 dismay. \n\n![Ubiaz7B.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ubiaz7B.png)\n\nThe crew get just a few hours of observation of Eve before they must start up their engines to put themselves on a trajectory that intercepts Kerbin. The S-IVB stage burns out sooner than expected, meaning that the CSM must make the brunt of the burn. The crew only just make it, using RCS thrusters to fine tune their trajectory after the fuel runs out. Several months later, they return to Kerbin, streaking across the polar skies at above 4km/s. The CM detaches and orients itself with heat shield first, while the rest of the spacecraft burns up rapidly. The crew splashdown safely. \n\n![pzqybQC.png](http://i.imgur.com/pzqybQC.png)\n\nAfter their long trip, Obemy, Kirnand and Franliana report feelings of exhaustion and some disappointment at the lack of stuff to do and the brevity of their encounter with Eve. It is decided that the next major mission will be a large-scale visit to Duna, intended to carry six kerbals and begin construction of a semi-permanent outpost on the red planet. Scientists and engineers once again begin the scramble to design, build and test the massive abundance of technology required for this unprecedented mission...\n\n- AAP Eve flyby \u002B20\n\nTotal = 230"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T13:26:28Z","Content":"Built my Skylab - will launch it after Apollo 11 (mission in progress right now.\n\nI tweaked my Saturn V very slightly (got clean stage 1 seperation - but loose a good amount of Delta V, will be going back to the older configuration for all future launches unless trying to get stage separation pictures (apollo 11 \u0026 13).\n\nHad to finish up for tonight with Apollo 11 on its way to Mun.

In two hours, I\u0027m going to go face Christina and say we can\u0027t get Ore samples until SunShooter XIII at the earliest--and even then you\u0027re not making any promises--because the subprojects aren\u0027t playing nice with each other. \n\u003E \n\u003E James: Okay. Damn it. My turn to play nice. Tell Project KRISTEN to toss off their munar buggy blueprints our direction, and I\u0027ll see if we can find a way to shrink it. It still won\u0027t be ready in time for X, but at least we can tweak the new MEM so that you\u0027re sure to have your joyride by XIII. \n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Got it. And I\u0027ll be sure to update them about how you called one of their pet designs a monstrosity.\n\u003E \n\u003E James: ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) This is why the subprojects don\u0027t play nice with one another.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bob: Hey, you\u0027re the one who called it a monstrosity. Don\u0027t be so judgmental. \n\nThe (relative) success of SunShooter IV cleared the way for KSP to approve manned flights with the Celestia CSM. *That* didn\u0027t include flights post-LKO, and the Sparkle V was simply too powerful for the job of LKO delivery.

Either we start treating heat shields as crumple zones as well, or we order more parachutes.\u0022\n\nRandom engineer: \u0022Well, those heat shields do make good crumple zones.\u0022\n\nChristina: \u0022Order the damn parachutes.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just adding this to keep track when it comes time to tally the scores.\n\u003E \n\u003E New scores in this chapter are: Life support (now that it counts--but does Snacks count?), and... that\u0027s it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B26 for Snacks! Since SunShooter VII\u0027s a fuel cell-only flight the whole 3 days (the panels on the BonBon don\u0027t count, right?), this would make the fuel cell scoring from the last time finally legit. And I think I added up wrong in the Prologue (whoops!).\n\u003E \n\u003E To recap the scores, this would be:\n\u003E \n\u003E Prologue:\n\u003E \n\u003E Saturn V 5\u002B5\u002B1 = 20\n\u003E \n\u003E LES = 5\n\u003E \n\u003E Chapter 1:\n\u003E \n\u003E Fuel Cell = 10\n\u003E \n\u003E Life Support = 26\n\u003E \n\u003E Total to date = 61 points. Potentially reducible if the judgement is that Snacks! is too generous by life support standards. \n\nNext time: VIII and figure-8s.\n\nAlso, we eat munar regolith.\n\nGreg - no problem re: responses. Still not done with Apollo Program, anyway, let alone AAP and Super Manley.

They EVA\u0027d back to the LEM and powered it up for liftoff. Mission control were initially anxious that the angle at which the LEM had settled would cause problems on ascent but Sean managed to pilot it straight and a few minutes later they were safely in orbit and rendezvoused with Mirula Kerman in the orbiting CSM. \n\u003E \n\u003E **APHRODITE -** ***EVE FLYBY***\n\u003E \n\u003E Meanwhile, scientists at the KSC are confident that the Skylab mission, despite not being yet over, has provided ample enough evidence that kerbals are indeed able to survive in space for long periods of time. They push for the Eve flyby mission that has long been talked of. Having got the mission approved, engineers and mission planners work overtime to get everything ready for the Eve transfer window in just a few months time. A spare Skylab is modified to be suitable for the mission and a special S-IVB stage is constructed to provide the fuel needed to shift something the size of Skylab all the way out to Eve. It is decided early on that the S-IVB will be discarded around Eve, with the CSM\u0027s engines firing to provide the final push back to Kerbin. In order to do this it must have as much fuel as possible, so launching with the conventional Saturn IB and using fuel cells for power will be impossible. Engineers quickly retrofit a CSM in storage with photovoltaic panels and a new Saturn IB rocket is commissioned with an expanded S-IVB stage and four strap-on solid rocket boosters. This will enable the CSM to reach orbit with nearly all its fuel, expending only a little on rendezvous. \n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, with just weeks to go, the whole system is ready. First to launch is the habitat module as this lacks the attitude control required for docking. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/8xcqeOB.png](http://i.imgur.com/8xcqeOB.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/d9UsdPr.png](http://i.imgur.com/d9UsdPr.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Safely in orbit, the second part of the Aphrodite spacecraft is launched.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/GEzvBsG.png](http://i.imgur.com/GEzvBsG.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Unfortunately more fuel is used in rendezvous than was anticipated, but docking is successful.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/fthAOds.png](http://i.imgur.com/fthAOds.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E At last, on the day of the optimum transfer, the first Saturn IB Advanced lifts off with veteran crewmembers Obemy, Kirnand and Franliana. Obemy has flown twice before, once on the very first manned test flight of the CSM, and once in lonely vigil over the Mun on Apollo XI. Kirnand was engineer on Apollo XIV on which he deployed a Lunar Satellite by EVA as well as walking on the surface, and also flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Franliana is the least experienced of the three, having flown only once before as CM pilot on the Apollo XIX mission to Minmus. Between them, however, they all have experience of life in deep space and with how to pilot the CSM. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/CszuVq0.png](http://i.imgur.com/CszuVq0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/URtdtnI.png](http://i.imgur.com/URtdtnI.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The CSM docks successfully and a short burn puts them on course to intercept Eve. During the course of the transfer, the Skylab mission ends and its crew are returned to Kerbin. As Aphrodite I approaches Eve, two probes are deployed, intended to enter the planet\u0027s atmosphere and land. However, due to an engineering oversight the probes lack the torque to overcome their off-axis thrust, resulting in one hitting one of the CSM\u0027s solar panels. The probe drop is aborted, much to the scientists\u0027 dismay. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Ubiaz7B.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ubiaz7B.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The crew get just a few hours of observation of Eve before they must start up their engines to put themselves on a trajectory that intercepts Kerbin. The S-IVB stage burns out sooner than expected, meaning that the CSM must make the brunt of the burn. The crew only just make it, using RCS thrusters to fine tune their trajectory after the fuel runs out. Several months later, they return to Kerbin, streaking across the polar skies at above 4km/s. The CM detaches and orients itself with heat shield first, while the rest of the spacecraft burns up rapidly.

It is decided that the next major mission will be a large-scale visit to Duna, intended to carry six kerbals and begin construction of a semi-permanent outpost on the red planet.
