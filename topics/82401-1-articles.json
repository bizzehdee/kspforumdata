I think that something like this would add a lot to career mode, One way that this could be implemented in game is requiring at test flight, with a part that is representative of the node you want to unlock before the node can be unlocked. For example before the 2nd node can be unlocked you would need to do a test of the tr-18a decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This would also prevent unlocking large parts of the tech tree in a couple flights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T03:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of like the idea, but I think it should be less focused on limiting players and more focused on giving them things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RenevB","CreatedById":110395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T07:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, it will force a subset of players to do something they don\u0027t like, and do it repeatedly.

The basic technology of rockets is actually already pretty mature. The tech tree concept is sort of OK, but many things were in fact concurrent, and many were jammed into just a couple decades. To be honest, computer technology is what is driving modern rocketry in many respects, both from what is possible in terms of control, as well as simulating novel designs (both airframes and engine types).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if you started and could launch rockets with fixed launch parameters (one turn, no further control)., then maybe manned flights get that, plus just the (unmarked) navball. You\u0027d have to unlock the \u0022glass cockpit\u0022 that we start with now. For interplanetary, you\u0027d have access to the maneuver nodes, etc, but on the ground. You could try probes, but any direct command would be appropriately delayed (you\u0027d be however many seconds behind in knowing where the craft is at, and it would take as long for any corrections to get there). Eventually you get what we have to start in a few tech tiers.
