I did quickly look through the things not to post section...\n\nLOVE YOUR GAME.\n\nBusiness time:\n\nmy play style: Normal, No MODS, gather some tips/strats from friends, and Das then mission FUN TIMES! That\u0027s how I will play not really looking for anythiing more to this complex beauty, I won\u0027t download a mods there is plenty.\n\nSomething that bothers me from a system/design prespective is the minimum part count becoming unlimited at highest upgrade teir. It is used as a gating mechanism in early stages of the game, but would seem is also a way to limit builds becoming too much for most computers to handle. Yet when the VAB is upgraded to max the part limit goes away, and next thing I know my computer is showing me it is in desperate need of an upgrade. \n\nA 300\u002B part ship for me is no fun on max settings, and a mun base (450\u002B) ... yikes. And while I plan to upgrade to enjoy this game I love a little more I am wondering why you decided to uncap the part count at all? \n\nAll it really does is allow me to essentially break the game/my immersion. I get that this is what players want (freedom), so I get that\u0027s why it was made possible, but having played lots of editors in many games, I have found the part count is actually one of the most interesting ways to make an editor a game. It becomes a balancing act which thing is more important, is this the absolute best thing we can do here. In fact I truly believe you can\u0027t make anything right until you define your limitations (sorry ranting). I had more fun building ships with the 255 limit than once I had to remove it to get done what I wanted. So yes I get it, but its bad\n\nSo that\u0027s my issue. It is \u0022necessary\u0022 sure. but how could it be done for a better running experinece for more people/me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nTHE IDEA:\n\nWelding.\n\nConstruction teir unlock (300 - 550 sci req)\n\nTwo parts can be made into one part for more money and weight, these parts now carry both functionalities, and are considered by the part count (physics calculations?) to be one part. destruction applies to both welded parts, and the new crash tolerance could be set to the lower of the two parts (possible balance) or something like that.\n\nWhat would actually need to happen processor wise might be less optimal than I assume, but if there less parts each physics calculation then that calculation could be made much simpler/faster (?). I know that Unity does slow down a lot just with enough draw calls, and I wouldn\u0027t think that could be reduced in this case easily, since the mesh count would have to remain the same. but if the major lag spikes are all physics then I think this could work really well.\n\nexample\n\none command module, one fuel tank, one rocket engine.\n\nweld A to B, new A to C, and you have a one part rocket that weighs and costs more than a 3 part version of the same design. If the welded ship collides with something faster than its crash tolerance, bye bye ship and its pilot. in this simple example you can already see why welding as I speced would balance itself nicely. any OP uses could be restricted, similar to fuel transfer restrictions already in the game.\n\nAm I off base here? would this actually save processing power?\n\nWay less interesting if this didn\u0027t make more optimal ship building possible, but if it did work... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf so, you could set an actual part count for all VAB, SPH upgrade levels, and it could be even less than 255. Welding should also be unlocked in the science tree (rant on this coming, but I am sure this one has been said a million times). At a high enough science req it would essentially be the unlimited parts teir"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T08:06:18Z","Content":"Currently, not only the game\u0027s part loading system, but the whole loading system i quite unefficient. I am sure that something will be done about this. Currently, Squad is working on Unity5 implementation, wich will make things better.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Two parts can be made into one part for more money and weight, these parts now carry both functionalities, and are considered by the part count (physics calculations?) to be one part. destruction applies to both welded parts, and the new crash tolerance could be set to the lower of the two parts (possible balance) or something like that.\n\nI think that\u0027s the right way. Here\u0027s my idea: \n\nNo part welding.\n\nEvery rocket, every vehicle should be simulateed as one. There may be areas in this one part, where heat is spread slower/quicker, there are points in it, where heat is produced (engines), there are weaker points in it, where it\u0027s likely to break, there are more flexible points in it... This is also better when it comes to damage. If you hit it somewhere, instead of blowing up a part from it, the rocket could be separated, in a much more appropriate way. Rockets wouldn\u0027t be simulated as piles of parts, but like unique vehicles, like in most simulators. Of course, this would requie to convert each desgin in the VAB/SPH into a vehicle format, before launching. Also, it would save phys-warping!!\n\nLet me bring up the example of the Portal2 editor. There, after you desgined your puzzle in the editor, you had to convert it into an actual map. Converting took ages, but both the editor and the game was efficient, and you could run them with high settings, while it wasn\u0027t eating up your computer."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T08:55:47Z","Content":"Or, ya know, a real multi threaded GPU accelerated (OpenCL/CUDA) physics engine.

These things actually seem to me to make interesting design choices for many builds, Do weld the command module to the rocket or not?\n\nAlso the physics engine is fine handling the physics for most reasonable thing but as with all physics engines they have an upper limit. It is why there should always be systems that limit your options."},{"CreatedByName":"14thTry","CreatedById":149506,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:56:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think that\u0027s the right way.

They definitely would need to keep some limiters so you can\u0027t build it out of the hanger. But I would find it a little less desirable for testing purposes. I often launch a rocket 6 or 7 times before I get the Pad and orbit Dv balanced enough, that means in your system my waiting between launches and tweaks would become terrible fast. Plus why not add more build options and potential designs. Kerbal is a puzzle game, build a ship that can complete a mission (or more) and then see if it works."}]}
