I have had that feeling for a very long time. And during the making of this video, it took a lot of time to find the right glitches. Heck, there are even so many deleted scenes in which glitches don\u0027t happen. Sometimes you kind of have to think of the most unnecessary and radical questions when you do this. For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do I have to ram the plane into the Kerbal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do I have to run him over at 4X warp?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do I have to stretch him between two Advanced Grabbing Units?\u0022 (If you watched Danny2462\u0027s video on that, you\u0027ll get the reference) (Also called \u0027The Glitch Device\u0027)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have to stuff tons of Kerbals in a 2.5m service bay?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\netc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4X physics warp is also very helpful in situations like these.
