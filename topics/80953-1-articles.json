That place has now been mostly buried and looks less unusual than it did before. When you got close to this place you would hear an very artificial sounding noise. If you knew what an SSTV signal was before hand you would recognize it as one. You would then have to record the audio and put it through a separate program to get an image. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never really liked the signal because of the fact it would be impossible for people who had never heard of SSTV signals before to recognize it and then decode it. I think it shuts people out... I think if you\u0027re going to have a puzzle it should be solvable with in game tools and logic alone. Now that we have the science gathering system in place I think it could be made to \u0022gather\u0022 the signal and being it back to KSC for processing into the image... It can\u0027t do that now... I think in the future they should make it able to do that. KSP science isn\u0027t interesting unless there are mysteries to be revealed about the worlds through it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
