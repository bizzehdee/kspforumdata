A spacecraft in an elliptical orbit has a change in velocity. The closer to the parent body you are, the faster you go. The farther away, the slower you go.

Total mechanical energy of a satellite in a n elliptical orbit is -GMm/(2a), where G is gravitational constant, M and m are masses of the two relevant bodies, and a is the semi-major axis. (This assumes M \u003E\u003E m.) The potential energy of the satellite at some distance r from the center is -GMm/r. The difference between these two energies is kinetic energy of the craft, which is mv\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/2. Solve that for v and you will have the speed of the craft.\n\nGetting orientation is equally straight forward, but you use conservation of angular momentum instead. The quantity v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003Er, where v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is the tangent velocity, is conserved. Furthermore, precisely at apsides v = v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E.

Note: Use radians with all the below equations, not degrees.\n\nGiven a specific point on your orbit, determining your time to or since periapsis is plug and and play. Solve for [True Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly) (theta) from current radial distance from the sun\u0027s center\u00AE, semimajor axis (a), and eccentricity(e).\n\n![t3Dorl5.gif](http://i.imgur.com/t3Dorl5.gif)\n\n Calculate [Eccentric Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly) (E) from True Anomaly. (Fixed equation, 3/11)\n\n![p0F8BGZ.gif](http://i.imgur.com/p0F8BGZ.gif)\n\nCalculate [Mean Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_anomaly) (M) from Eccentric Anomaly.\n\n![4nWgYcr.gif](http://i.imgur.com/4nWgYcr.gif)\n\nAnd from Mean Anomaly and Orbital Period (p), you can find the time since Periapsis (t\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E).\n\n![sYz7FCG.gif](http://i.imgur.com/sYz7FCG.gif)\n\nPosition along an elliptical orbit as a function of time runs into the issue that there\u0027s no closed-form equation for going from Eccentric Anomaly to Mean Anomaly.
