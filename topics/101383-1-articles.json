A spacecraft in an elliptical orbit has a change in velocity. The closer to the parent body you are, the faster you go. The farther away, the slower you go. In a circular orbit, your velocity is constant because you are the same altitude (or distance) from the parent body for the entire orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would I calculate this change in velocity in an elliptical orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, I\u0027ll use KSP. Let\u0027s say we have a spacecraft traveling at 6 km/s on a transfer trajectory from Kerbin to Duna. When leaving Kerbin\u0027s Sphere of Influence, the craft is going at 6 km/s. By the time it reaches Duna\u0027s Sphere of Influence, the velocity will have slowed quite a bit - because of the gravitational pull (I assume) of being in the Sun\u0027s Sphere of Influence for the majority of the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to calculate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) What the final speed will be when approaching Duna\u0027s SoI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Is there a set rate at which the speed decreases (assuming it takes into account distance from the Sun and the Sun\u0027s gravitational parameter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) If I pick a point in an elliptical orbit, and I know - the original velocity, distance from and gravitational parameter of the parent body - is it possible to determine the exact velocity of the craft?

Total mechanical energy of a satellite in a n elliptical orbit is -GMm/(2a), where G is gravitational constant, M and m are masses of the two relevant bodies, and a is the semi-major axis. (This assumes M \u0026gt;\u0026gt; m.) The potential energy of the satellite at some distance r from the center is -GMm/r. The difference between these two energies is kinetic energy of the craft, which is mv\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/2. Solve that for v and you will have the speed of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting orientation is equally straight forward, but you use conservation of angular momentum instead.

Furthermore, precisely at apsides v = v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E.
