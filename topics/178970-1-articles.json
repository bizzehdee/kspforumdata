So I thought that there was probably another identifier, other than the Title in the CFG file. It turns out that identifier is of course the Name of the part (doh!) and as I was working with a copy of the FL-T400 cfg file and hadn\u0027t changed the name, then my part just overwrote the stock one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I gave both my tank and parachute parts new names in their CFG\u0027s, both appeared in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday\u0027s lesson kids is read the docs, in this case the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Part_Modelling_Guidelines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPart Modelling Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E which says \u0022 Just make sure that the name field in the cfgs are unique \u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve successfully added a fuel tank part to the game via Unity. However I\u0027m having an issue with parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem isn\u0027t with getting something I\u0027ve made into the game (my exported part from Unity didn\u0027t appear in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), but even a name changed duplicate of one of the stock parachutes fails to show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo create the duplicate I copied the parachuteMk1 folder from GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Utility to my own parts folder in GameData. I then renamed the copied parachuteMk1.cfg file to parachuteMkx.cfg and changed the Title of the part in that CFG to Parachute Mk X.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn loading the game no new parachute part appeared in the Utilities part tab. To check my process, I carried out the same changes on a copy of a stock fuel tank and that appeared in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo does anyone have any knowledge of getting parachutes into the game that might be relevant? Just to be clear, this isn\u0027t at this stage about the process of getting a parachute through Unity, just trying to find out if there\u0027s anything special about them, regarding gettting even stock duplicates to appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW.. here\u0027s my first rather simple creation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan is to make a set of parts that a more literally junkyard style than the stock ones, which can also serve as props for anyone wanting to put bits of junk in their screenshots etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r8bnBCp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/r8bnBCp.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-15T21:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2018 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
