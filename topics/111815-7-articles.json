What kind of measurement are civilians calculated in? Metric liters? So given that the average human has about 70 liters of volume, a kerbal standing in roughly half the size would be around 35-40 liters. So it\u0027s safe to say around 40 liters of depleted kerbonium is 1 civilian. That\u0027s all nice and dandy until you remember...\n\u003E ...2.4/4 civilians.\n\u003E \n\u003E I hope you didn\u0027t need to chop up any kerbonauts to get that .4 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Gotta test out this version, hope me luck with the crashes!\n\nHeh! The reason behind that is that Civilians are treated as resources.
