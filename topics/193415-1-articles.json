I then went EVA to do a report, but when I boarded my capsule once again and adjusted to a retrograde profile, the program seemed to erm\u2026 \u0027half-crash\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy vessel became unresponsive and figured the battery in my capsule had died so my reaction wheels were unable to counter my turn to retrograde and thus continued spinning on the axis I turned. Alas, the battery was still 75% charged. I tried some other controls, beginning with another EVA which worked but I couldn\u0027t board the vessel again, I could look at the messages, contracts, deltaV info etc, I could minimize the navball and bring it back upt yet I could still not enter my craft or get it to respond in any fashion, then I also noticed I could no longer move the camera - but still I could do the other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI brought up my task manager to see if it has stopped responding but according to that it was still fine. Then I noticed a 2nd program running under the KSP heading - this was the UnityCrashHandler64.exe - THIS file was listed as not responding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using the latest 64 bit version of KSP - recently purchased on the COVID cheap through steam with both expansions on a nearly new Intel i5 MSI gaming laptop and apart from a little occasional stuttering, it runs perfectly 99% of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only confirm this as unity crash for this specific crash but I believe it has been the same crash previously (3 or 4 times) - each time the only ting I can do is end the task on KSP and restart the application.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be extremely grateful if anyone has a solution to this issue, Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalnaut #55487\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--- EDIT ---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could find no output.log file in my KSP folder but I did find a KSP.log file, the last entries were -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:36.075] [Experiments]: FX Modules set: 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:36.079] [FLIGHT GLOBALS]: Switching To Vessel Untitled Space Craft ----------------------\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:36.079] [PlanetariumCamera]: Focus: Untitled Space Craft\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:36.090] Camera Mode: AUTO\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:39.835] [Experiments]: Setting FX Modules to 1...\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:50:39.835] [Experiments]: FX Modules set: 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n[EXC 17:51:07.857] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0ManeuverNodeEditorManager.ModifyBurnVector (NavBallVector axis, System.Double amount) (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0ManeuverNodeEditorTabVectorInput.\u0026lt;Start\u0026gt;b__15_3 (System.Double value) (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0InputFieldHandler.OnValueChanged (System.String text) (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0UnityEngine.Events.InvokableCall\u00601[T1].Invoke (T1 args0) (at \u0026lt;5aeafee3fea24f37abd1315553f2cfa6\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent\u00601[T0].Invoke (T0 arg0) (at \u0026lt;5aeafee3fea24f37abd1315553f2cfa6\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0TMPro.TMP_InputField.SendOnEndEdit () (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0TMPro.TMP_InputField.DeactivateInputField () (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0TMPro.TMP_InputField.OnDeselect (UnityEngine.EventSystems.BaseEventData eventData) (at \u0026lt;55ba45dc3a43403382024deac8dcd0be\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0UnityEngine.EventSystems.ExecuteEvents.Execute (UnityEngine.EventSystems.IDeselectHandler handler, UnityEngine.EventSystems.BaseEventData eventData) (at \u0026lt;e7863072d20d4124957779539fa3ff58\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0UnityEngine.EventSystems.ExecuteEvents.Execute[T] (UnityEngine.GameObject target, UnityEngine.EventSystems.BaseEventData eventData, UnityEngine.EventSystems.ExecuteEvents\u002BEventFunction\u00601[T1] functor) (at \u0026lt;e7863072d20d4124957779539fa3ff58\u0026gt;:0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0UnityEngine.EventSystems.EventSystem:Update()\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:52:00.614] Untitled Space Craft Debris Unloaded\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:52:00.614] Untitled Space Craft Debris Unloaded\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:52:44.482] [FLIGHT GLOBALS]: Switching To Vessel Jebediah Kerman ----------------------\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:52:44.483] [PlanetariumCamera]: Focus: Jebediah Kerman\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LOG 17:54:22.161] [UIApp] OnDestroy: CurrencyWidgetsApp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT --\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 10, GeForce GTX 1050 2GB, 8GB RAM - passes recommended specs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-26T19:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2020 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbalnaut #55487\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarified 64 bit version and added KSP.log snippet -- added specs\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
