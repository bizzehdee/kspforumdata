On ejection they should split up in 2 (or more, make it an option) sections along the longitudinal axis, it makes no sense that they split up in multiple horizontal cross panels as shown in the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the \u0022no procedural wings\u0022 et al. comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; I prefer having a list of parts and then putting stuff together. It\u0027s like a puzzle. And that\u0027s half the game, right there, too.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; but there are mods you can use. This is actually an okay argument here because proc parts aren\u0027t really suited to the game\u0027s puzzle of building rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree, by your reasoning we wouldn\u0027t have stock proc fairings either. Procedural wings are by no means a single item that limit \u0022lego-ness\u0022 in KSP, instead they allow for composite and creative design of winged craft without going into single digit FPS because of part-count (since part-count is still a thing). One of the main concerns with proc wings were that they would break off in large chunks, but now the same can be said for large Mk3 wings. Furthermore, with harv\u0027s recent explanation on the new fairing part-count:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s only one part, which is the fairing as a whole. Fairing \u003Cem\u003Epanels\u003C/em\u003E aren\u0027t independent parts, they\u0027re sub-objects of the fairing until you deploy them. A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\u003Cp\u003EAs for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings. They aren\u0027t fully persistent (which is good if you like 2 digit framerates). That doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t solid objects, however. Point away from face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that all proc parts can use this system right? So your proc wings could break into subparts without affecting the part-count. This is quite neat, if not in stock than definitely for the procedural wing mods out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EPlease also listen to your \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0/page97\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ecommunity on the 1.0 release\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E.
