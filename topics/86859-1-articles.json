Wondering if anyone here has taken part in a challenge based KSP competition? The computers society and astronomy society are working together to host a competition for all comers. I\u0027m super excited and was just wondering if anyone had any experience with something like this and could give me some prep advice?

For a Mun mission, send 5 rockets simultaneously and land them, but make them crash into each other on the return trajectory to Kerbin.
