If both the interfacing and textures already existed in KSP code, which has been suggested now (and I was only vaguely aware of when I wrote the OP) or he used derivatives from the open-source codes then two days *could* be ample.

Stuff liek clouds (despite the communities obsession) works perfectly fine with EVE mod, its not perfect, there are bugs such as z-fighting at certain ranges/certain textures, but it works, looks nice, and is well WAY better then teh stock cloudless game. That said, keep it a mod, works fine, is perfectly ok, and doesnt force everyone to use it, especially those running computers constructed with ducktape and super glue.\n\nOnly thing im sad about is that squad hates procedural parts. procedural wings (even if they were 100% procedural but pick from presets style) would save so many resources, cut down on part counts, and get rid of that part spam in editor. Even if they arent procedural, why not make fuel tanks come in one part per size, and select a preset length from a few presets. Thatd make it so much less resource intensive, and still make it lego style (and perhaps modders or some debug cheat could enable fully procedural of any length).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T16:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T16:22:27Z","Content":"Implementing rbray\u0027s clouds.
