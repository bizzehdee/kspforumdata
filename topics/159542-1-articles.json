So let\u0027s get started shall we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s obvious from the title that I\u0027m doing a grand tour with the OPM mod installed. I\u0027m doing this in career mode on normal difficulty with regular settings. I have a whole bunch of mods installed (105 at last count) so I won\u0027t go into all of them. The highlights? MechJeb, the Near Future family, DeepFreeze, Mark IV, OPT, and Kerbal Atomics. Oh, and OPM, what with it being in the title and all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what are my actual goals you ask? I have a lot of those too. To keep it simple, I\u0027ll just tell you what milestone I\u0027m on and what all it entails. You\u0027ll get an update from me once I complete a milestone. Milestone 1 was easy, get to space. Jeb got all of the initial distance and speed records, he was also the first Kerbal to strap himself into a rocket, but Val beat him to the punch for the two big ones, first to space, and first to orbit. Jeb got the first mission because he\u0027s Jeb, but he and Val swapped seats every flight, Jeb was just unlucky that his orbital attempt fell 3km short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I didn\u0027t take any photos of what I called my testing rockets. It\u0027s just the first bit\u0027s of the game and unlocking the bottom of the tech tree. Instead, I\u0027ve got prototype designs for y\u0027all to take a gander at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YwFucSS.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YwFucSS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MpvamWG.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MpvamWG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221Ikn8Mk.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Ikn8Mk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow those are very much works in progress, the station has already had a major overhaul since I snapped that shot, but they do give you an idea on some of the things I\u0027ve been working on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what\u0027s next in stage 2? In a nut shell, Kerbin. I\u0027m gonna rip every last bit of science that I can out of Kerbin by dropping into every single biome. My first satellites will go up and begin mapping for stage 3.\u00A0Stage 4, I\u0027m gonna visit temples, and abandoned launch sites, and every other thing I can find, and my first communication constellation will go up sometime during all of this. After that, I start reaching a little further out and doing what I can to truly unlock the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is what I need from y\u0027all. I have names for things I\u0027ve already designed (or are currently designing), but I don\u0027t have a name for my manned craft that\u0027s gonna drop into all these different places on Kerbin. So let the first round of suggestions roll in. I\u0027ll go ahead and mention that my probes I\u0027ve already come up with are named after various bugs, my landers after birds, and just about everything else after people. Oh, and my lifters are named after the Greek alphabet, not that they are anywhere close to finished. I think it\u0027ll be fun to see y\u0027alls thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny rate, thanks for taking the time to read about my attempt at what will likely be the most challenging thing I will ever try to do in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-21T11:51:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2017 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by lukavago\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo edit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-21T15:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo continue the animal theme, let\u0027s go with mammals. \u00A0I\u0027m not certain whether you\u0027re making individual craft for each biome, but that is my assumption because anything else would require a shorter list: \u00A0therefore, this list should cover your needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIce Caps -- \u003Cem\u003ECaribou\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNorthern Ice Shelf -- \u003Cem\u003ELemming\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSouthern Ice Shelf -- \u003Cem\u003ECrabeater\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTundra -- \u003Cem\u003EMarten\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHighlands -- \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMountains -- \u003Cem\u003EIbex\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGrasslands -- \u003Cem\u003EAurochs\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDeserts -- \u003Cem\u003EXerocole\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBadlands -- \u003Cem\u003EBison\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShores -- \u003Cem\u003EPlatypus\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWater -- \u003Cem\u003EBeluga\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukavago","CreatedById":120163,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-21T22:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZhetaan, your suggestions are great.

The Caribou\u0027s went up into polar orbits with either Jeb or Vall, and all the science I had to put on them.

Oops. Good news is that I can move to milestone 5 for now and come back. Now milestone 5 is to map Mun and Minmus, as well as to set up a coms network for both. That means Kerbin will have to get it\u0027s own version first, and Jeb and Val should get some high orbit flights under their helmets.

Exams, followed by me moving from a tropical island in the Pacific to Massachusetts with a\u00A0two week road trip thrown into the middle of my move for giggles. That\u0027s my way of warning you that I\u0027m gonna be gone for a bit. If I can, I\u0027ll have the first of my new class of probes off the ground and waiting for transfer windows, and well as some important Anomaly missions done and knocked out of the way. If that happens, I\u0027ll be up to milestone 9, with only 6\u00A0skipped in the process. What\u0027s milestone 6 you ask? I\u0027ll let you know when it happens, but since it\u0027ll be a proof of concept, I really won\u0027t be able to skip it for much longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s time I mention how I\u0027m gonna organize my Kerbals. To start with, there will be four Krews. Each crew will consist of three Kerbals, and will be named Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow. These four Krews are responsible for all of my manned missions throughout the system. Blue and Yellow have not yet been activated, but they will be doing the actual tour when the time comes. But what about Red and Green you ask. They will work together to uncover all of the Anomalies that there are to be found. The Grand Tour is a publicity stunt, the Anomaly Tour will advance all of Kerbalkind. Now, none of the four Krews can\u00A0support themselves across the entire system, so a series of stations, both manned and automated, will\u00A0be built.The five Manned stations will have four Kerbals, 2 scientist and 2 engineers. Once again, I am asking for advice on names for these brave krews that will spend long periods of time floating in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got for this update, wish me luck as I completely shift my life, and I\u0027ll get back to y\u0027all as quick as I\u0027m able.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003EFull Gallery -\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/FyXox\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#3c6994;\u0022\u003EPart 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E-\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/AJfI6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#3c6994;\u0022\u003EPart 2 and 3\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\u00A0-\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/teFyt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#3c6994;\u0022\u003EPlatypus Missions\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/dNuwN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStrange Sights\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Hint - There is always a couple bonus photos in the full gallery)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukavago","CreatedById":120163,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T04:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey everyone!
