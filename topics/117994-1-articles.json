This project has been riddled by cost and time overruns as more and more requirements were piled onto the aircraft. The total cost to the UKSAF for R\u0026amp;D was around $480 billion and unit cost has increased from an expected $25 million to a massive $45 million since the project began. The plane has also lost a large portion of its stealth abilities, its advanced thrust vectoring system, and lost an engine due to the VTOL requirement. Then plane is also not able to utilize any of the UKSAF\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s system pods due to a computer system not recognizing them. Originally the F-12 JSF was supposed to be able to share what its powerful radar can see with the other UKSAF fighter jets but that system was also sacrificed for the VTOL requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/TMasterson5/F-12-Panther-JSF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/TMasterson5/F-12-Panther-JSF\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T23:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow bout some pics dude?
