Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles."},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:35:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you have encountered the modified docking mode controls (that is to say this is a feature, not a bug).

Currently the small panels the OS-STAT is the cheapest, lightest, and lowest tech level option per unit of Electric charge generated. It\u0027s only downside is it doesn\u0027t track, but it\u0027s twice as powerful as the mid sized panels.\n\nThe ox-stat is indeed massively overpowered, and is in fact STILL massless. (#lolmassless)\n\nI did a balance pass on the panels myself in my Horrible Nerf. I rescaled their power based loosely on their surface area (so they\u0027re actually sensible by size), but also then ensured that the ox-stat had the highest cost/ec and lowest ec/ton metrics, and the gigantor the lowest cost/ec and highest ec/ton.\n\nHere\u0027s my notes from the top of that section:\n\n    //  Stock                                 HorribleNerf//  Panel     EC/ton  Cost/EC             EC/ton  Cost/EC      Size//  OX-STAT      150      133                 40     2000      45x32=1440//  SP-*          80      200                 60     1750      (roughly same as OX-4*)//  OX-4*        114.286  190                 60     1750      222x36=7992//  Gigantor      51.429  166                 80     1500      548x200=109600//  RTG            9.375 4400\n\nI hadn\u0027t done anything with RTGs by that point; in Horrible Nerf, with an inverse-square falloff, they naturally become competitive around Jool or Eeloo as the sunlight is very weak there (4.33-1.43% of kerbin orbit) - a gigantor, the (now) best ec/ton ratio of 80, is actually only ~3.47/t at Jool\u0027s periapsis vs 9.375 for RTGs (although I was still thinking of buffing the RTG\u0027s output a bit).\n\nI also increased solar panel cost and decreased battery costs (well above the z100), such that a battery-powered craft was cost competitive for short-duration missions.\n\nBy the way, if anybody else wants to adopt these figures, go ahead.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There is little point at all in using the Giginator as it\u0027s simply not as good in any metric except part count.\n\nYeah, exactly. Plus you generally don\u0027t even need the power output they produce (in 0.90 at least-might work for drills, will have to see), but that\u0027s a separate (but also serious) problem.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS:\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/TrJTd](http://imgur.com/a/TrJTd)\n\u003E \n\u003E Im basically speechless at this point!\n\u003E \n\u003E Then again, ive found a way to cut the dV to basically none with this new exploit/bug.\n\ndelta-v requirements in the new atmosphere are largely gravity/orbital speed based - if it were a vacuum, it would take about 2,500-2,600 delta v to reach orbit (vs 3300-3500). I wouldn\u0027t call that \u0027basically none\u0027.\n\nFAR had that same drawback too.
