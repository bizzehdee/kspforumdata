Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rcp27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rcp27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you have encountered the modified docking mode controls (that is to say this is a feature, not a bug).
