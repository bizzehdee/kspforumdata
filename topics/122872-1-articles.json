Stack priority is what you are likely used to, with fuel lines and parts that block crossfeed along with draining a single tank (or group of tanks placed with symmetry) at a time. Stage Priority draws from all the tanks in a stage evenly, with stage being determined by the number of decouplers between the tank and the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Rapier, this flow mode applies in both rocket mode and in airbreathing mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stigy","CreatedById":151508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T19:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
