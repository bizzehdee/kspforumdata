For example in current state Starlab and WSLR for radiation test are unusable since they are being affected by biome nad when that changes, experiment stops but wont resume when same biome appiers again. Plus Only way to start new biome test, is the original need to be erased, so u are in cycle of loosing bioms, restarting and all over agein loop. Pretty much imposible to make any science with Star lab or WSLR other than water/oceans/seas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i would like to pretty much edit time duration for a 1sec to collect as much science as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for hlep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"byaafacehead","CreatedById":176632,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-23T22:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust FYI: as you say, if you start in a biome then leave it it stops the experiment. But you can resume it if you re-enter that biome. Its annoying for the orbital survey as it takes a couple seconds to start (real time, regardless of time warp level so definitely buggy), but it\u0027s possible to get most science, as long as the orbit has some long patches of the biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeeds multiple orbits and is tedious so definitely needs improvement..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-23T22:56:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2024 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 23\u0022\u003EJanuary 23\u003C/time\u003E by byaafacehead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-25T01:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe community fixes mod fixes this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
