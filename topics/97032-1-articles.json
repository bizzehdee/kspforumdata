I \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E google it but it\u0027s one of those things where there\u0027s so much stuff about it, and most of it turns out to be about entirely different things, that it\u0027s tough to find relevant information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody know if there IS a reliable way to make use of an IR hinge in an assembly that also uses clampotrons and which will dock with other ships?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOdd thing is, at one point I built an ISS-style solar array for my space station and used IR hinges to fold it up flat against the sides of the launch vehicle, got it into space, detached the array from the launch vehicle (it was attached via a clampotron snr), picked it up using an orbital tug fitted with a clampotron snr, moved it across to my station and attached it to a node via the clampotron snr and then, after all that docking and undocking, when I finally came to deploy the array... the hinges all worked perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E be possible to use IR hinges in conjunction with clampotrons in certain circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, is it only the standard clampotron which causes IR to throw a fit, and the clampotron snr doesn\u0027t cause the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to KSP, I guess... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
