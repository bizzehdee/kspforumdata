Then match velocities by burning retrograde. Then burn towards target to get your prograde marker over it and some 10 m/s in speed.

Without maneuver nodes, it is very hard to go from 15km below to a close approach accurately. It is too big of a step at once, and once you get there, even if you get pretty close, the target\u0027s orbital speed will be very different from yours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better, safer way to rendezvous is this: Get your orbit circular and match inclination (I know you said you already did that part) then you have to gradually step your orbit closer to his. The closer your orbit is to his the closer your speed will be to his when you get your close approach. So if you start from 15 km lower than him and he is a good bit in front of you, take note how much closer you get each orbit at the Periapse or Apoapse. When he starts getting closer, step your orbit in closer to his, so you are gaining less ground on him each orbit. Keep stepping your orbit out to his until you\u0027re orbits are very close and he is very close to your craft. This method guarantees that when you get close, the difference in velocities is negligible and you can burn more or less towards your target, rather than trying to guess the right way to burn to null your velocity relative to the target. If I remember correctly, once you get quite close (\u0026lt;4km? \u0026lt;1km? not sure), it lets you double-click target him so you can accurately null velocities and get close safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T19:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t be too difficult once you know a few pointers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight click on your target and select \u0022set as target\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to decide whether you\u0027re letting the target catch up with you or you\u0027re catching up with the target. Whomever has the smallest orbit will be orbiting faster and doing the catching up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy watching you craft and target orbit in time warp, you\u0027ll get an idea of when an encounter is coming up. When an encounter is about one or two orbits away, adjust your orbit so that the difference between your orbit and the target orbit is smaller. This will reduce the rate of catch up and allow you to more finely tune the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your target is less than 10 km away adjust your prograde marker so that it aligns with your target marker. Accomplish this by burning on the opposite side of the target marker (compared to your prograde marker).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick on your speed indicator to change it to target speed (the speed of you relative to your target). You need to get this to zero by the time you have completed your rendezvous. If you do this too early, you\u0027ll make the whole procedure take longer than necessary. You will shed this speed by burning retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you near your target, small deviations between your prograde and target marker will become more obvious. By the time you\u0027ll actually be more interested in your retrograde and anti-target marker. Bring your anti-target marker into alignment with your retrograde marker by burning on the opposite side of the anti-target marker (compared to the retrograde marker) - note that this is the opposite strategy to getting the prograde and target markers into alignment. Failure to get your relative speed to approx 0 m/s is why you had the target rush past you earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy hovering your cursor over target, you will get an indication of the separation between you and you can use this to inform an appropriate relative speed between you and the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T19:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T19:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nevermind\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T20:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never use manoeuvre nodes for rendezvous, so can\u0027t really appreciate the problem.

Here is what I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stranded Kerbal was in an orbit with Ap ~180km and Pe ~120km and slightly inclined (I missed the inclined part until mid-mission)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a rocket with enough delta-V to get into orbit, do a bit of maneuvering, and have enough left to de-orbit. I also made sure there was space on board for an extra Kerbal... double-stacked command pods!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I launched and circularized into an 85km orbit. The Kerbal was significantly ahead of me in his orbit. Since I was lower than him, I just waited a few orbits to close the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I then brought my Ap up to nearly 180 km, leaving my Pe around 85 km. I was still behind the Kerbal, so the low Pe still allowed me to catch up, albeit somewhat more slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When I was getting \u0022close enough\u0022, I brought my Pe up to nearly 120 km (still less than the Kerbal\u0027s Pe, though) to creep up on him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At this point, I realized that his orbit was slightly inclined to mine, which explained why he kept flying north and south of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I matched inclination and matched his Ap and Pe as best as I could, and when he got within about 10 km of me, I selected him as the target. Now the navball displayed my velocity relative to the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. I burned prograde/retrograde/norma/antinormal as needed to reduce our relative velocities. When our relative velocity was only a few m/s, I aimed toward the target and burned to close at about 10-20 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. When the Kerbal came to within 2 km of me, I turned away from him and burned to drop our relative velocity, making adjustments for any lateral motion at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. I then switched to the Kerbal using the [ and ] keys, activated his EVA jetpack using the R key, and then thrusted toward the rescue vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. I had to go back and forth between the Kerbal and the rescue vessel a couple of times to tweak our relative velocities and positions, and I also rolled the vessel to aim the hatch in the direction of the Kerbal for an easy ladder grab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.
