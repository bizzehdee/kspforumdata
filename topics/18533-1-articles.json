I\u0027m going to be using it for flyby and orbiter missions at first, doing vital research to help in planning lander missions (getting a feel for how much fuel is needed to return, figuring out how big the planetary atmospheres are so that I can aerobrake without \u0022oops\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing is fun to fly, as long as you don\u0027t scrape its engines off on the runway.
