I\u0027m using the data from the KSP calculator, using a simple stage with just one liquid fuel ttank and one engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to calculate the Delta V by the Rocket equation, it is DeltaV = Ve * ln(m0/m1), where Ve is the effective exhaust velocity, m0 is the inicial mass, and m1 is the mass after burnout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVe = Specific Impulse / g at surface according to wikipedia. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the data from the calculator, Ve=5541 * 9.81=54366 m/s and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V = 54366 * ln(4500/2300) = 36488 m/s, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is obviously wrong.

The specific impulse shouldn\u0027t be equal to the exhaust velocity. The Kerbal liquid engine\u0027s specific impulse that is in the wiki, 5682 s, is greater than that of a Ion thruster, that can\u0027t be right.
