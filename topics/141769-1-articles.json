But under excessive G force they only seem to fail if sideward torque is introduced. And then it are the joints that fail, not the parts themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLast time I checked metal alloys have physical strength limits, *cough* any material does. Even without sideways torque (assuming a rocket goes straight up)\u00A0 a part should have a \u0022G tolerance\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd if there is a weak link attaching one stage to another which then carries a significant load of the rockets total weight a rocket should actually disintegrate on the launch pad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP, you just add struts, who seem to work more like dampeners. If you want real physical construction with the use of I-beams or girders then you can\u0027t strengthen 2 seperate stages because there is no way to attach girder segments to 2 individual attachment parts and I don\u0027t think it can even be implemented. And even if that is possible it probably involves some very technical workarounds in the VAB/SPH, and has yet no known methodical procedure for each and every player to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe structural parts that are loading the most G forces, which during a launch should usually be the lowest part of the rocket should fail, causing the engines or fuel tanks to blow up or fly freely and destroy the rest of the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m a real strut hater, Even although struts are used they don\u0027t seem to replicate a realistic attempt at simulating constructional realism. Sure they have real use in rocketry, but it only serves a limited aspect to construction. And since they only add parts and thus lower framerate I am a real Kerbal joint reinforcement fan. Construction of a rocket is one of the main aims of the game, and the most exclusive and fun part of KSP. You cannot however in your right mind consider it realistic, and involving constructional realism in KSP seems impossible to my knowledge. This is no problem when you work with a modded ksp where you use specifically modded rocket parts and stages. Where each and every joing is optimized for each 1st/2nd stage tank, fairing base and/or payload bay. These mods mods don\u0027t simulate G tolerance because it\u0027s not a function of KSP as of yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003ERegarding a idea of added constructional implementation in ksp stock or modded. We have KIS and KAS. Kerbals can drag fuel lines from a part attachment to another part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t it be a cool idea for squad to introduce constructional attachment point parts. This way you can add attachment points on stages within the VAB/SPH and you can then add beams or girders on a attachment point. A procedural drag and drop function like you would do with a fairing will then allow you to reattach the other end of a constructional beam to a attachment part added to another stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs long as we are limited to certain size tanks and parts in stock and tanks and fairing bases are not procedural in stock gameplay it seems a nice addition to the use of struts only. That in combination with a G tolerance model ofcourse.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-14T09:35:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2016 09:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T09:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E@vaporizedsteel interesting thoughts on the g-force effect on parts.\u00A0 I\u0027ve seen various comments on the struts, one thing I\u0027ve read is that if the parts connected on their outer rims rather than a central point they would therefore be stronger which makes sense (more surface area connecting at the least), don\u0027t know if that would be difficult to implement but if it could I\u0027d think that would help with reducing strut need (and I\u0027m no physics or engineering guy my major was math/comp sci so I may be off here one of the reasons I was asking my original question \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222630185\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465895557\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MircoMars\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, MircoMars said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOT: magnetic docking ports, really practical in-game, but totally unrealistic. in RL they have to be spot on, in line and pretty slow for docking. we\u0027d need a lot of stuff\u00A0(i.e. docking alignment indicators, more precise spacecraft controls, hours of RL time approaching) to pull a \u0022real docking\u0022 off consistently and without hundreds of failed attempts. chasing the docking port until both crafts wobble in place is ... appropriately kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMakes sense even in my Surface Pro the magnetic power connection is a real pain to get aligned right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBeardyMan","CreatedById":25616,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T10:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReaction wheels.
