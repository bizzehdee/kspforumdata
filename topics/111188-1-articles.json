It could just be a part that you radially attach, and it procedurally wraps around your craft. It could weigh quite a bit, to make using them a challenge (more thrust to move them, but in the end you don\u0027t overheat, probably) and could be fairly expensive. It would all be procedural. I think P.Fairings code could almost work here. Anyway, what do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould this be what you are looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DGKacey","CreatedById":123016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Seeker89\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Seeker89\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould this be what you are looking for?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat looks like it would work!
