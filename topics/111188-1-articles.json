It could just be a part that you radially attach, and it procedurally wraps around your craft. It could weigh quite a bit, to make using them a challenge (more thrust to move them, but in the end you don\u0027t overheat, probably) and could be fairly expensive. It would all be procedural. I think P.Fairings code could almost work here. Anyway, what do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:50:25Z","Content":"Could this be what you are looking for?\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak)"},{"CreatedByName":"DGKacey","CreatedById":123016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:54:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could this be what you are looking for?\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak)\n\nThat looks like it would work!
