With all the Biomes, Planets, Heights and experiments, it\u0027s easy to get lost. And while the Science Archives do a good Job at keeping track (at least \u0027till they meet Planet Factory) It doesn\u0027t really show you what science is still tere to be gained. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started looking for Spreadsheets, that would show me where I still could do science, and while I worked with some of them, none were really satisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering this, I followed the old saying: If you want it right, you got to do it yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I present my Science Spreadsheeds for anyone who\u0027s willing to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two versions of them, one purely stock, and one including the stock Custom Biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spreadsheets are categorised into Planets/Planetary systems, and show the Height by Biome on the Y-Axis and the Available Experiments on the X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the Stock Experiments are included at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBe Aware\u003C/strong\u003E that these Spreadsheets can be considered as \u003Cstrong\u003Espoilers\u003C/strong\u003E, so if you want to find things out for yourself, you might not want to use these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hereby release these Spreadsheets under \u003Ca href=\u0022https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECC-BY-SA 2.0\u003C/a\u003E so you can make copies for yourself and redistribute enhanced versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWLCv9sE3eNa5DUug_Wu-EDjqlkuLJGbGeK7gObzHRY/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETo Stock Sheet\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lxhzIODeJuHoWVwLebcZIF-EI68oOVGwYApXDPga3E8/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETo Custom Biomes Sheet\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
