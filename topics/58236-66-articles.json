The problem is that if I simply declare boiloff to be the 4/9th power, it will mean that to get realistic boiloff for large tanks, it will be impossible to create fuel cells that don\u0027t boil everything off very quickly. In real life, insulation mass is going to be increased for the small tanks to prevent that, and I\u0027m really unsure I want to go so far into the details as for RF to model insulation mass, *especially* given that it cannot know surface area except by the roughest approximation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou *could* make boil-off just scale with the 2/3rd power for the cryogenic tanks (assume the smaller tanks are insulated to the same relative rate of heat leakage for their volume), and make the mass of the cryogenic tanks scale non-linearly (such that larger tanks weigh relatively less when cryogenic). You can assume fuselages and Service Modules are both insulated as well (in fact, highly pressurized tanks have comparatively VERY LOW rates of boil-off, as their surface area is very small relative to their propellant mass- which also makes them cost much less mass to insulate, and the structural components of their walls are much thicker...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-cryogenic tanks (default and balloon tanks) *should* scale with the 4/9th power, such that it\u0027s almost impossible to have tiny tanks that don\u0027t boil-off very quickly: this is actually how it works in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne way or another, there needs to be more of an incentive to use large fuel tanks.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E At first I suggested tank \u003Cstrong\u003Estructural mass\u003C/strong\u003E scale with the Square-Cube law, but it turns out that is completely inaccurate as fuel tanks are pressure vessel in space. The Square-Cube Law *does* apply to the relative amounts of \u003Cstrong\u003Einsulation\u003C/strong\u003E required for the same effect with different tank sizes, and the base rates of heat leakage, however- which means the required amount of insulation mass should scale with roughly the 2/3rd power of volume (actually, it\u0027s even more favorable for larger tanks than that, as the thicker walls require for structural integrity act as low-quality insulators in themselves...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe also currently aren\u0027t enough ways to mitigate boil-off.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Thermal fins are heavy, expensive, and currently almost impossible to use with FAR as their surface attachment is too weak, and they tend to tear off during ascent. Even if they make it to orbit, they seem to be bugged and not all that effective. Plus, why should they work? All a thermal fin can do is cool a rocket to ambient temperature (which actually should be quite high near Kerbin or any other planet, in comparison to cryogenic temperatures, due to IR give-off from the planet...) Active Cooling systems work MUCH better, because with enough power, they can cool a fuel tank to any given/desired temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating a realistic (4/9th power) relationship between tank volume and boil-off is one way to mitigate that, as it would allow players to somewhat reduce the effect simply by making the tanks bigger. Allowing players to more heavily insulate (perhaps with a tweakable insulation slider- where insulation mass scales with the 2/3rd power of volume), \u003Cstrong\u003Eand actively cool\u003C/strong\u003E their fuel tanks would be another. One way or another, it shouldn\u0027t be harder to mitigate tank boil-off in KSP than it is in real life (in real life, you can make the tanks larger, better insulated, and actively cooled. You can also store propellants in chemically-stable low-boiloff forms, such as LH2/LOX as water.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-30T02:37:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2014 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T02:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe also currently aren\u0027t enough ways to mitigate boil-off.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Thermal fins are heavy, expensive, and currently almost impossible to use with FAR as their surface attachment is too weak, and they tend to tear off during ascent.

Yes, even pump-fed (vs. pressure fed) engines need pressurized tanks, but pressure-fed engines need \u003Cem\u003Ehighly\u003C/em\u003E pressurized tanks (which mass a lot more).

Second, longer fins create a LOT less drag compared to a comparable radiator area of short, stubby fins- which is particularly important for larger rockets (which need a LOT of radiator area to be effective, and normally benefit from a MUCH better ballistic coefficient than smaller rockets- something spamming stubby thermal fins works strongly against).

I am quite sufficient with the info and know-how and able to realise GEO orbits and such with these mods. But I am very poor at chemistry and fuel types and get sometimes confused. Could you please answer me these questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-Procedural fuel tanks: There is a tank type selection such as fuselage, default, baloon..etc. Could you please tell me which tanks are for which fuel? Because when comparing delta v, default tank seems to get 200-300 m/s more with a default tank than cyro..etc and I see no difference in operating. However, sometimes by J2 engines wont ignite in space, so I am sure its about selecting a proper tank for the fuels. So please guide me which tanks I should be using for vacuum, fuel type and surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-I am using Engine Ignitors: I still couldnt figure out how to take extra electrical ignitions with the tool box. It doesnt add additional electrical ignitons no matter where I place it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- \u0022Need settling down\u0022: I am using ullage to get some g before ignitions but sometimes they work sometimes they dont. I think related with question 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-Which type of fuels should I be using for most efficient 1st and 2nd stage with TWR around 1.25-13.0 at take off (to get around 4000-5000 delta v). Generally kerosene and LOX at main stage and lox and lh2 at second stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5-No matter what I try, I cannot get pass 16k delta v at RSS and RO with a payload of 12tonnes. So I think its impossible to have a manned flight to mars in rss/ro with saturn v type rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for all these noobish questions about fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
