Make it a separate thing just below the ASL\u00A0altitude meter. Or just make the altimeter clickable. But I think having it auto-switch would actually harm more than help. Since most rocket launches are over the ocean, your radar altitude would be about 1km\u00A0above your ASL altitude. This would be a problem, especially when trying to follow a special launch profile. If you deviate by a fraction of a degree, you\u0027d be over a different part of the ocean, and you\u0027d end up missing the maneuver. Not to mention polar orbits, which would cause an even worse effect as you fly over the mountains. I don\u0027t mind the new focus on plane parts the last few updates (in fact, I actually prefer planes), the key thing is that it hasn\u0027t been a detriment to\u00A0rockets. This would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
