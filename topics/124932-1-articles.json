For one, they seem to fry at much lower speeds making it near impossible to break 1400m/s before switching to rocket mode and having to pull up or risk just burning up, a thenomenon that was NOT that case in 1.0.4 (you still had to be careful but id often get up to 1600m/s at ~17-18km before engaging rockets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also feels (now when i say feels, it means i have no hard evidence of this as of now) that the drag has been increased.

At ~35t you get 7.3K dV, at 40t you get almost 8K (with the right profile and enough patience to try multiple times i bet it can be done. You also might need to tweak the wing layout a little bit (the uploaded version isnt optimized for anything above 37t and i think i added an extra pair of wet wing strakes as well but i dont remember and dont have the HK-201R6 model particular craft file anywhere to check).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor radiators, ive created a few terribly designed builds that never overheated cauise of radiators.

The fuselage is essentially a shock cone, then a mk1 to mk2 short adaptor, then a short mk2 bomb bay, then a 2nd mk1 to mk2 adaptor, then a mk1 inline pit, then a rapier, and then a nuke, and then a air intake facing backwards (depending on model that intake was different but used to cut down the drag of open node).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the only other equipment was 1 of the smallest solar panels that could extend and retract inside the bomb bay, a 0.6m inline batter in bomb bay, primarily big-S wing strakes filled with fuel for lift. 2 control surfaces in the nose, and then 2 small delta wings with 2 control surfaces on those, and ths usual smallest control surface alone for rudder. Then i ofc had to have landing gear, 2 were on wingtips, 1 was inside the bomb bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the only other components, i added basically clipped together FLT-100 fuel tanks inside the cargo bay until the weight was ~40t. These fuel tanks were only holding LF and had no oxy at all by using a mod i had that let me pick what fuel was placed in teh tanks (this could also have been done via .craft file edit too). More recent iterations of the HL-201 (now renamed the HK-101 as i decomissioned the old HK-101 and i the 201 kinda was the same basic role so i renamed it) feature a dfferent fuel setup, instead of FLT-100s that store 100 LF, i opted to use xenon fuel tanks with 660 LF in them to save on parts. Assuming my math is correct, the FLT-100 being a LFO tank stored 100 units of fuel, and has a dry mass of 0.0625. The xenon tank has a dry mass of 0.4125, which is exactly 6.6 times that of the FLT-100. SO using the same dry mass fraction, i gave xenon tank 660 LF capacity to keep it identical to the FLT-100 or any of that tank line, its just way more fuel in less parts (having a stack of 40 or so FLT-100s isnt fun for lag, and then will go outside of teh tank when u timewarp at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow not everyone will consider this fair, but ive gotten to the point that i just nolonger care whatsoever about part clipping, and in my eyes, having 40 FLT-100s with 100 LF each in virtually the exact same spot (i dont quite clip them 100% into each other but not far off from that) is no different, you are violating volume logic either way, i just save on parst with the xenon tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual reson behind even using such small tabnks and not clipping say FLT-400s or wha tnot is that the FLT-100 (and xenon tank as its same size) is the ONLY tank that can fit inside a mk2 bomb bay without interfering with the 2 missiles i placed beside em. Again, its a matter of preference, i enjoy compact builds, and external missiles are a big no-no when you are talking aerodynamics, so my only option left since i had no intention to make a large craft was to shove fuel between the 2 missiles, all in the bomb bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here is a screenshot of the HK-201R2 model, which (assuming my math\u0027s right s i calculate dV manually using the log formula since i dont use any mods with dV readouts in em) gives me approximately 7.3K dV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ohmQmZF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ohmQmZF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Puzj6N.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Puzj6N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy math (based purely on screenshot data of the fuel level and vehicle stats windows) gives the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*full mass 34.92t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*mass in LKO 27.01t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*empty mass 10.62t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*dV fully fueled: 9342\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*dV in LKO: 7326\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not have any pics of the HK-201R6 (that i can find currently, if i find one ill be sure to post the 40t monster in LKO with fuel/mass readouts), so i cant really prove that i got almost 8K dV, but since the 35 ton one got ~7300, its not like im making these numbers out of thin air, and it is within reason that if a 35t vessel gets 7.3K, a 40t one can get around 8K (and if i remember correctly it got ~7900K in LKO when i was messing with it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epanzer1b,\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t figure you were.

My craft (the HK-101A4 im working with) has 2 shock cones, one of which isnt even uses as an intake but to lower the drag the nuke engine has (since its end is exposed). So its basically one intake in the front, a fuselage, engines, and one intake to cap it off clipped far enough inside as to not block thrust (unless 1.0.5 made the whole capping the end nolonger as critical or important).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the shock cone still the best nose cone part in terms of drag, or has that now changed so that other intakes have perhaps better performance? Ohh, and what about radial intakes, are those any good now, or are they still a bad idea since before those radials had alot of drag and not so much area. Ohh, and what about the cool looking inline intake with some fuel inside, is that good at all, or worse then a shock cone (which im guessing still has to be in the front either way, unless regular nose cones are superior now to the ram in terms of raw drag values).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and the main reason i started this thread is that my recent project, the HK-101C series is failing hard (and the old HK-101A series from near the end of 1.0.4 as well) has major trouble getting up to speed on the rapier alone. In general, the HK-101 line is kinda heavy and i just CANT kick in rockets until ~1550m/s velocity as the nuke doesnt quite have the thrust, and i need the speed to give myself enough lift to accelerate to ~2000 orbital before i get above 35km. Such a profile (regardless of whether its realistic or not, or more fun or not), just does not work anymore, and im finding i actually need to drag alot of oxy to get above a minimum of 1700m/s before 30km or ill just drop out of the sky (and the nuke does not have the thrust to save me once i stop gfaining altitude, and rapier oxy is so inefficient i mnight as well forget low weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe project is suposed to have ~3000 dV in LKO, have 4 tons of payload capacity, all in something that uses the same or similar shape (i like compact sci-fi style vessels even if they arent very realistic) and is ~20t maximum. Can this even be done? the reason for teh highish payload is that i want 2 missiles, and a full IRSU system onboard. With 3000 dV (and preferably around 4K full fuel), i can finally have my infinite range SSTO to anywhere (you could do any planet with that, provided that spots like eeloo you refuel elsewhere beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T19:02:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T18:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one noticed, but body lift is not working on KSP 1.0.5... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ew/o body lift, crafts need a higher AoA to maintain vertical speed, increasing drag...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes rockets more easy to launch... but makes SSTOs way more inefficient...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T18:42:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by luizopiloto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T18:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo one noticed, but body lift is not working on KSP 1.0.5... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ew/o body lift, crafts need a higher AoA to maintain vertical speed, increasing drag...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never rely on body lift, it is always better to have 0 AoA and have an angle of incidence on the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T19:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo one noticed, but body lift is not working on KSP 1.0.5... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ew/o body lift, crafts need a higher AoA to maintain vertical speed, increasing drag...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes rockets more easy to launch... but makes SSTOs way more inefficient...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not liking this.
