Why add that, when methane can also be extracted, also being more efficient?\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple. Unlike methane, carbon monoxide can be producted with 100% indigenous materials, whereas CO2 can also be converted into oxygen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means it would be a pretty much infinite, easily producted fuel. This would dramatically reduce complexity and cost in a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA has published an article describing CO fuel (just search \u0022Carbon monoxide rocket fuel\u0022 and you will find it).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s 80% useless fuel. Maybe it\u0027s a nice addition to KSP2, and maybe they\u0027re already including it- but hey, I\u0027d like that fuel in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-08T18:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a very niche engine and would require a niche resource for tanks and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E so I don\u0027t see it in stock, but it could be a great addition to an existing mod, like NFP\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
