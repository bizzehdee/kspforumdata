Of course, Michael Bay movies produce enormous levels of said particles, thus solar powered devices are especially useful in a theater during their showing... but that\u0027s kinda beside the point. Anyhow, panels in bays, due to the bay particles, should ALWAYS produce power, even when in a planet\u0027s shadow.\u003Cp\u003E(just kiddin\u0027.
