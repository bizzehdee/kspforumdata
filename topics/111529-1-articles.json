However the recent update has presented an interesting new angle on this kind of content.\n\nI am currently creating a series of which I will role-play as the head of a brand new space company, starting from scratch in career mode eventually building up to large scale capital ships, carriers, mining vessels and combat. The in-game elements like reputation and money restrictions will add an interesting twist to the regular sandbox series, which I thought was pretty neat as I would have to carefully consider each launch I make and every move I make or face bankruptcy, humiliation and mistrust among the Kerbal society.\n\nThough it\u0027s starting slow as I am effectively re-learning KSP with the new aerodynamics I think it could potentially turn into something neat (see below the first few videos, they\u0027re starting slow but will progressively advance)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJRZotQHqLY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vfdJMc54_-k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nPlease let me know what you think and any recommendations that would go to making this better.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T08:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gonzo44v**"},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:56:56Z","Content":"Very nice thread Gonzo ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).
