At first I had problems, too. It\u0027s just that it doesn\u0027t work like in other games or applications.\n\n1. Get a Kerbal with engineer profession. He needs to have a wrench or a screwdriver in his inventory.\n2. Equip the wrench or the screwdriver. Go near the part you want to remove.\n3. Make sure you have an inventory open.\n4. Put your mouse cursor over the part.\n5. Hold down [G]. The mouse cursor changes to \u0022Grab\u0022.\n6. Hold down the left mouse button. The mouse cursor changes to the part.\n7. You can now release [G]. Continue to hold down the left mouse button!\n8. Move your mouse over the inventory and release the mouse button.\n9. ???\n10.
