It actually started off intending to be a lander and return spacecraft, but mid-flight I decided to turn it into a permanent base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft has parachutes and other random crap needed for re-entry, but it\u0027s no longer needed. I\u0027d like to remove the parachutes (real chute double-cones, TweakScaled up to 3.75m in size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, when I detach the parachute, because it\u0027s a cone it only attaches to nodes, not surfaces. So I can\u0027t put it anywhere. It\u0027s way too big to put in the inventory of a storage box either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware it is possible to somewhat let go of an object by trying to attach it to the Kerbal itself. This works fine for small parts; they just float in space next to the Kerbal, so you can fly around if needed, move stuff, etc., then RCS back to the part and re-attach it as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when you try to do this with this large RealChute part, the parachute part itself gets flung off at a great speed away from the Kerbal, and the Kerbal himself starts spinning rapidly. I estimate the parachute accelerated to about 50m/s. So there\u0027s literally no chance of getting that parachute back ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you please implement a simple \u0022drop object\u0022 button, rather than making me try to attach the part to the Kerbal? Then hopefully it\u0027ll just float there in space and not fly off really quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m hoping to attach a docking port where the parachutes are so the station can be expanded in line with its centre of mass, so I must remove that particular parachute, sadly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s another mod out there that may do what you want.
