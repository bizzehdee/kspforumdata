I\u0027ve gotten to the point where rover is 1.4k from base on surface of Mun. Now when I enter the game, it gets me to this point without loading a quicksave. \u00A0But, the problem persists as I get closer to Base. \u00A0Keep in mind, the autosave and quicksave work just fine, so long as I am not trying to get rover closer to base on Mun. \u00A0Perplexed #$%*\u0026amp;@ . Any ideas?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
