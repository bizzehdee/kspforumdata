I believe my problem largely lies with the high AoA requirement at lower velocities I think, as it basically falls like a rock below 150 m/s; which is rather high to land at for someone who\u0027s never been good at landing in the first place. Having the craft fall through the landscape glitch at high velocities doesn\u0027t help the landing experience, either :/.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgbox.com/RMw8ZYYZ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgbox.com/Dh8QAzQr\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgbox.com/7BNTkM2e\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgbox.com/dkh3F8PK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgbox.com/cWK0cK7r\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, so long as you don\u0027t exceed structural tolerances, it flies quite well.
