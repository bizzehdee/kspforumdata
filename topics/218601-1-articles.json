I will happily say \u201CI was wrong\u201D if it means I get what was advertised. For one, I didn\u2019t waste $50.

Try and steer development to the advertised features of KSP2. To get interstellar massive ships wobble has to go.

To keep others from spending money on the game in the state it is in. I like KSP a lot. Not so much that I will downplay the problems to others. My \u201Cnot recommended\u201D review will stay in steam until it is a game I would honestly recommend. Most of the positive review on steam are \u201Cit\u2019s not good yet but\u2026\u201D I find those type of reviews dishonest. People on the fence of buying this game should see a variety of realistic views expressed by people who have time in the game. I wish to share mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a last comment, I don\u2019t consider those with positive views of KSP2 in its current state to be shills or to be dishonest in their opinion, however little it makes sense to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would appreciate it if those of us with a negative view weren\u2019t referred to as haters. Critics is fine. I love KSP I don\u2019t hate it. And this is the only online community where the positive view outnumbers the negative one. On steam, YouTube, Twitter, reddit everywhere I read comments (in my counting) most are critical of this game at the moment. I do not believe that pretending we are dishonest in our opinion or that our opinion is a minute minority is productive. Rather, I think listening to the complaints can inform the developers what areas are of most concern and would have the most \u201Cbang for their buck\u201D in turning effort into positive sentiment. And hopefully eventually a good game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-25T05:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224305608\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690262905\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107035\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022moeggz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, moeggz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if steam had refunded me I\u2019d be out of these forums happy to forget about it until it either died or became good and I rebought it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you contacted IG about this?

The community at large is quickly losing interest and patience and I fear it may be too little too late.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be a good thing for the community to lose interest in KSP2 for a while. They will 100% certainly check in again when it hits 1.0. At that point the game will stand or fall on its own merits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PicoSpace","CreatedById":224964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-25T16:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224305507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690243493\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngryBaer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, AngryBaer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen a lot of comments about how important the feature is for many.

This seems perfectly reasonable to me, and it certainly doesn\u0027t warrant constant reminders about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never considered the heating as an \u0022essential core feature\u0022, since it could be switched off, and the visual effect is purely cosmetic for a fairly small part of a mission. I\u0027d be much more concerned if engines didn\u0027t produce thrust or exhaust plumes were missing. The essential part for me is atmosperic drag, which already exists and serves it\u0027s purpose during flight and de-orbiting. Why is this particular item such an emotionally charged topic? Is re-entry the favourite part of the mission? Was there really doubt that it wouldn\u0027t be included?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry heat will become a bigger deal when you start needing to return materials to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or Colonies on Worlds with Atmospheres or send out science collection missions to the same.
