However I would recommend against using any of the StationCore parts in games that you care about as they are still in active development and will almost certainly be seeing other potentially game-breaking/effecting changes (PartModules, mass/cost/crew/balance).\n\nThe untextured parts -- those WILL be getting new geometry and major changes to their configs; is part of why they are untextured.  They should be good enough for -testing- purposes, but generally not used beyond that.\n\nAs I remove the \u0027prototype part\u0027 stuff from the part descriptions, it generally means that those parts no longer have any planned changes (though sometimes unplanned changes are needed).  I will also add some info/details to the release notes when parts move from prototype to finished/usable, so it is a good idea to keep an eye on the patch notes.  I also try to put warning notes in the patch notes when parts do undergo game-breaking / effecting changes... so one more reason to read those before installing a release (gives you time to de-orbit, remove crew, or plan for replacement craft before installing the update)."}]}
