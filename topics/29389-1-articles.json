So when I cut my engines at an Ap of 100km then try and circularize using nodes, I manage to get my Pe to 100 km but by then my Ap is 200km... I\u0027m sure I\u0027m lining up perfectly in the beginning but then end always gets messed up and I end with a non circular orbit. I also tried starting early; I start maybe 5 secs early and I\u0027ve tried doing half-and-half and still can\u0027t get a near circular orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom personal experience: If you\u0027re within ~5% of your target delta-v change for the node, you\u0027ll be just fine. You don\u0027t have to actually change your heading as the target moves; just kill your throttle before the delta-v meter starts going up again. The maneuver node system assumes an instantaneous change in velocity, so your actual burn is almost never going to be a perfect match to the plotted course (unless you use an autopilot to help).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt used to trip me up quite a bit, too, since I have a slight OCD tendency towards getting things \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rflrob","CreatedById":24145,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen doing circularization maneuvers, I like to stay in the map view (with the nav ball brought up so you can actually perform the maneuvers), then just watch the AP and PE nodes until they\u0027re in the right place. If you do your burns as close to AP as possible, then only your PE should be increasing, but in practice what I do is start my maneuvers a few seconds early, then keep the \u0022Time until AP\u0022 readout around 5-10 seconds. When you\u0027re almost exactly circular, this becomes a lot harder, but I figure a circular orbit \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1300m (which I can pretty routinely achieve) is close enough to circular as not to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dagothar","CreatedById":66759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually start maneuvers at half time of calculated burn before the node (ie. if burn is supposed to take 1 minute, I start at 30s before the node), unless dv is small - then I don\u0027t use full thrust and start at ~-5s, or use RCS. It all also depends on what situation are you in, as sometimes there is a plenty of time for corrections, and sometimes there isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, you don\u0027t lose anything by not being in a perfect circular orbit, and fiddling around with it can cost you. If you can learn to live with a bit of clutter, straight 50/50 on the burn will be pretty accurate on burns lasting less than 10 minutes. It\u0027s easy to plan correction maneuvers later anyhow, and the reason that is the way that is done in real life. It\u0027s mighty difficult to get an accuracy of 0.1 m/s on a 1km/s burn. But it\u0027s easier on a later 15m/s second maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Outside a gravity well, kick back and relax, you have time and can always correct.

You\u0027ll drive yourself crazy trying to follow it exactly. I generally don\u0027t change my heading at all, once I\u0027ve started a burn, knowing that the original heading will get me pretty darned close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T07:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can allways reduce engine thrust once you\u0027re almost done with the burn. Do the last 10-20 m/s with minimal thrust if you have a powerfull engine. It will take a few extra seconds, but you will still nail it. Getting the correct amount of delta v is all that matters. At worst you will waste a little fuel, but with minimal thrust that\u0027s not really going to be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steffen_anywhere","CreatedById":64915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T10:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah... that happens when you overshoot with your manoeuvre burn. The easiest is actually to decrease engine power the closer you get to the end of the burn, then cut the engine with maybe 20 m/s to go and use RCS (if you\u0027re not short on RCS fuel). This is not a very efficient way, due to the use of RCS, but this way you will get the closest to the planned trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
