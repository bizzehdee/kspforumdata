This probably isn\u0027t how I was supposed to deal with my satellites. So wouldn\u0027t it be cool that you can launch satellites and get a (mayb lower) completion bonus and get paid for every hour/year/minute in game while maintaining the right orbits? Would make sense. You could stack up on income and it would pay off to leave them in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also add contracts where you have to change orbit or destroy / remove satellites\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stengord","CreatedById":85596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T13:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice but normally when they want to \u0027dispose\u0027 of satellites they boost them to a \u0027Graveyard orbit\u0027 that is above Geosynchronous and leave them all to die...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jansn","CreatedById":131392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T13:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis contracts are imho senseless (without any sidestory or background). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they can be training missions for target orbiting \u0022something\u0022.. ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expected maintenance- or extend-missions for that satellites, or maybe \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekind of gps/remote tech-functionality. but such contracts they never came up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never take such contract anymore..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T13:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to time warp anything available over time will not be implemented (in the stock game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Harvester has spoken. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not know if they can be selected for random maintenance missions by that mod whose name eludes me right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-23T13:34:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2014 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T15:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you read the blurb in the wiki about the success rate in those transfer\u0027s?
