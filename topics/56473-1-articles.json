The saber/nuke combo can make 26-27 Km before having to switch 3/5ths over to rocket.

I take off with 1,800 extra Liquid Fuel for the ascent and landing back at KSC so even if I burned up ALL of the Oxidizer, there would still be a couple hundred fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the ship set to only use the Nukes, MechJeb is showing over 900 M Delta-V with only the remaining onboard stores and and over 4,400 Delta-V if I used the contents of the cargo tank fuel as well. Could get that even higher if I transferred the fuel from the cargo to internal tanks and tossed the empty cargo tank overboard.

So I\u0027m now convinced the steeper ascent with shorter main engine burn times is the more fuel efficient route. PROVIDED you begin to nose up from low enough to get a good chunk of your vertical acceleration done while still in air-breathing mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lower angle, longer main burn with the MUCH shorter circle burn is great for simplicity plus saving time and aggravation on local orbit missions where every unit of fuel is not so mission critical. Unless you are planning to leave Kerbin orbit for some reason (Mun mission, etc), the trickier, steep ascent method is probably not needed.
