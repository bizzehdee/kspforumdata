This is limited by your available engine power however, if you tilt far enough over that 100% engine power can not keep you up, the engine will lock at 100% and you will have to adjust your vessel\u0027s angle.

The mod compensates for this to keep your vertical speed at the setpoint. (In tests, the stock Kerbal 2 rocket was generating an acceleration of 0.5m/s^2 upwards with a horizontal speed as low as 25m/s from the 3 control winglets.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKeyboard bindings:\u003C/strong\u003E By default this mod uses the Z key, although this can be changed if desired. Otherwise it uses the keys that are bound to throttle control, by default these are Left-Shift, Left-Control and X. This guide will refer to the keys by these defaults, but if you have changed which keys control the throttle, use those keys instead. These bindings correspond to the 4 top buttons (Off, Zero Vel, \u002B1, -1). The Height Control and Operation Mode button have no keyboard binding and must be clicked. Note that you can rebind this key to any key on the keyboard, a mouse button, a joystick button, or a controller button. However, there is no conflict check, if you bind the key to something already in use, \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E functions will execute when the button is pressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVelocity Step Size:\u003C/strong\u003E On the settings screen, you can change the size of the velocity step from the default 1m/s. Note that due to how KSP handles text boxes, you can not enter 0.5 directly, rather you must enter the 5, then cursor back and enter the decimal point. This is due to the fact that KSP \u0027auto-corrects\u0027 the 0. to 0 and deletes the decimal point if no number is after it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEmergency stop:\u003C/strong\u003E At any time, press any throttle key while Z is not held down will turn this mod off and return to KSP\u0027s default control scheme. Note that during orbital descent (\u0022Free Pitch\u0022), pressing a throttle key will behave as normal, but will not disable the mod. To disable the mod during orbital descent requires a double tap of the Z key. The first tap turns off Height Control and goes to Velocity Control, the second tap disable the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAltitude:\u003C/strong\u003E Be aware that the altitude reported is to the vessel\u0027s center of mass and so will report an altitude of a few meters even when you are landed.

The mod will compensate for vessel tilt (up to about 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) so you can control your horizontal speed by tilting your vessel. Pressing a throttle key will disable height control and return you to the default KSP controls.

I\u0027d tap the throttle key and my throttle would change by twice or three times as much as I wanted. Therefore this mod was born to give me a way to actually control my descent speed rather then bounce up and down wildly on the default analog throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the comments everyone, here\u0027s what I\u0027m looking at right now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Horizontal Speed Control: That was one of the major purposes of this mod, to allow Horizontal Speed control \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout\u003C/strong\u003E RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to 100 or 200 meters, hit Z-X to set a vertical speed of 0, which holds your altitude. You can now tilt the ship as desired to control your horizontal speed and this mod will regulate your thrust so that your purely vertical speed stays locked at zero. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t tilt too far, this mod only controls the throttle and once you angle far enough off vertical that max thrust does not give you sufficient upwards force, all this mod can do is set the throttle at max, you will still be descending in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also open to suggestion on how to zero out your horizontal speed without RCS thrusters. Landing a skycrane without RCS is one of the two major reasons this mod exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Mouse Control: This is already planned. I\u0027m actually looking at doing a full on mouse only interface (see the request for a Smartboard interface in the Add On Requests section) and I just have to figure the on-screen buttons out. I also want to overhaul this mod\u0027s UI entirely, it is very basic at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Takeoff: I was careful to make sure this mod works on takeoff. One of the big purposes I intend to use it for is relocating my mining bases when resources run out (I run both Kethane and Exo-Launchpads). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect your ship, hit Z to enable the mod, then hit Z-Shift, Shift and your ship will rise nice and slow at 2m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Altitude Hold: This is something I\u0027m certainly considering. The problem is I\u0027m not sure how to work the background math. Speed is easy as I can tie that directly to thrust. I\u0027ll try to hack some equations out. I work in a process automation office so there\u0027s PID reference stuff around, I\u0027ll probably start there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Link Vertical speed to Altitude: Once Altitude Hold works, this is almost trivial to implement. It will almost certainly be released at the same time so as long as I can figure out altitude hold, this feature will appear also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m certainly open to more suggestions, just keep in mind that this mod is intended to give you the fine control needed for landing sky-cranes, I\u0027m not trying to write an auto-pilot here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T01:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance this could be changed to a toggle?
