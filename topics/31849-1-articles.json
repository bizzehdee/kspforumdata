It\u0027s capable of reaching a 100km x 100km orbit with enough gas left over for a rendezvous to a fuel station or reentry...Not sure what to do with it since it\u0027s only crewed by 1 Kerbal and no payload, but perhaps one day I\u0027ll send it to Laythe. Still figuring out a reentry profile to hit KSC\u0027s runway, but it glides a bit like a brick, with the Velocity Vector showing 15-20 degrees down when held nose level, but the glide is long enough to conceivably land...However it does seem to improve once it goes subsonic for whatever reason. Anyways, pics and craft files follow. Oh and a set of SABREs and a turbojet from B9 really makes this thing sing. Plus those SABRE intakes are sweet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aBYaEhG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aBYaEhG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rMHuydW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rMHuydW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/53MOSg0.png\u0022 alt=\u002253MOSg0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RaVp8Dk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RaVp8Dk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/afk3939sa657vbr/Little%20Bird%20stock.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/afk3939sa657vbr/Little%20Bird%20stock.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spaceman1999","CreatedById":68861,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T00:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuess what I thought of when I saw this, a Fish/Phish!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
