The license is ICAO, the medical is not. If you lie to the doctor, your medical is automatically invalid. For example, if you lie about having diabetes, you get into an accident, and they discover you have diabetes, you then get charged with flying without a valid medical certificate. In other words, don\u0027t do it. The various tests will likely pick it up anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proper way to go is to get an exemption, a restricted medical, or a subsequent test. For example, I can never read those colour blindness plates (Ishihara pseudo-iso-chromatic-plates). To avoid having a restricted medical certificate, I did a Farnsworth D-15 test to show I am not colour blind enough to be considered colour blind. (Colour blindness is a gradient, not a positive/negative.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost countries (including the JAA I think) will allow you to convert a foreign license to a local license, but they usually require you to do a separate medical exam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
