It includes a spaceplane which is mounted on another spaceplane which is mounted on another spaceplane and so on - the possibilities are endless and it is as reusable as a classic SSTO while being able to bring more various (and larger) payloads into orbit. His idea was instantly accepted by the KSC when it was realised that although more resources will be required, less research will be required and as such the cost will be much less. But due to budget cuts, all engineers currently employed by the KSC quit because their pay has been delayed for months. So the KSC started a competition.
