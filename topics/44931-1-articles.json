At first, my original intention was to send two two manned ships up and dock them together. Then I would just return them both separately. However, I forgot to put parachutes on the first ship, so I made the second ship suitable for four Kerbals to be in at once, and put parachutes on this time! I just did a couple of EVAs to transfer the crew over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used Mech Jeb partly, mainly to get the rendezvous sorted out, however I tweaked it a little and ended up with an intercept at 0.1 km, but it actually turned out to be closer. Orignally, Mech Jeb came up with an intercept of 0.5 km, which due to the small size of the ship, would have been too far. So I\u0027m glad I tweaked it a little. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I might try building a small space station next. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing into dock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img407/539/zkkq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zkkq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img11/6849/e74s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e74s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd returned home safely! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img42/8821/1e66.png\u0022 alt=\u00221e66.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJacob \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T18:49:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jacob01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T19:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must have trapped at least 10 Kerbals in space without fuel or monopropellant trying for my first rendezvous.
