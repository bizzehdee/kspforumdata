You can even direct your telescope time to non-profit science centers and universities for use in your communities!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir Goals a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur primary mission is to develop low-cost robotic spacecraft to explore and mine resource-rich asteroids within our reach. The first step to making this possible is the launching a fleet of ARKYD spacecraft to identify asteroids that are ripe for further exploration. This same capability has numerous other potential applications in education and research. The goals that we want to achieve with this Kickstarter mission are four-fold:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give students access to space capabilities \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Whether studying planets in a 5th grade class or writing a graduate thesis, students of all ages will have the ability to direct the telescope and explore what interests them! We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re planning some exciting new educational opportunities just for K-12 educational programs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo support important research and discovery \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC There are thousands of institutions and researchers in need for greater access to in-orbit space observatories. The ARKYD will provide a new, low-cost resource to help observe distant galaxies, search for alien planets, and monitor the skies for potentially dangerous asteroids. Researchers at MIT, the University of Washington, and across the globe have shown interest in using the ARKYD to further their important research. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build excitement about space and all of its potential \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC The ARKYD is designed to be a fun and interactive experience that is accessible to anyone. This kind of direct access to a satellite is unprecedented. Our backers will be the first people in history to control a public space telescope! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give YOU a say \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC What makes this mission unique is that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re putting control of the telescope in YOUR hands. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get the opportunity to help decide which science centers and museums are the beneficiaries of ARKYD telescope time, what photos to take, and more. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re putting YOU in control! By pledging toward this mission, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll receive access to our website and mobile apps allowing you to follow along with the progress of the satellite, sneak peaks at photos and videos, and get voting access to make your voice heard in the future direction of the satellite!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T22:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a couple threads like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33389-Planetary-Resources-Bringing-the-stars-to-you\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33389-Planetary-Resources-Bringing-the-stars-to-you\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33076-Planetary-Resources-Kickstarter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33076-Planetary-Resources-Kickstarter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/32670-Check-this-out%21-Kickstarter-has-a-Publicly-Operated-Space-Telescope-Project%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/32670-Check-this-out%21-Kickstarter-has-a-Publicly-Operated-Space-Telescope-Project%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
