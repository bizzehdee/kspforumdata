The build-fly-dream playstyle of KSP kept my aerospace dreams alive through the tough courses and late nights in the computer lab with gravity turn rockets, orbital rendezvous, and 3 body programs until now, where I started working with trajectories at a company who names their rockets and spacecraft after birds of prey and mythical flying creatures ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nFollowing the hype for every release and looking back at how far this game has come, brings a strong sense of both nostalgia and excitement for 1.0!
