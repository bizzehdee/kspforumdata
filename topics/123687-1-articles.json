On the one hand, his obliteration of pre existing material could be taken as a sign he wants to recreate Star Wars canon under his own brand, rather than contribute to the EU like everyone else. On the other hand, at this point, the EU has expanded to fill just about every gap not covered in the movies, including concurrent events that happen elsewhere at the same time, or simply between screen cuts in the actual movies. It would be impossible to make episodes 7 through 9 about Luke Skywalker without duplicating material covered in exhaustive detail in the EU, and that\u0027s a no win situation for the Star Wars fans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it. Movies cannot tell stories the same way books, comics, animated series\u0027, or games, tell stories. There were always going to have to be changes to canon for the movies to work, and no matter how you do that, you are going to .... off a sizeable number of fans. As big a middle finger as obliterating the cannon undeniably is, it does open the door for a new EU with new heroes, villains, and stories. The EU covers events over thousands of years in part because after a while, that was the only way to create new stories without tripping over itself, just like any other massive world, such as Forgotten Realms (the most well known of the D\u0026amp;D universes). So I guess, the way I see it, a new canon doesn\u0027t have to diminish from the old one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also in a perhaps enviable position. Episode 1 came out when I was like 10, so of course I loved it, and I was still pretty young for Episode 2, so as long as I skipped all the boring love scenes, I really liked that too. The only movie I don\u0027t watch is Episode 3, because episode 3 breaks canon (the talking/emotional droids), among other things. My point being, unlike Star Trek, I have a very broad definition of what Star Wars is, and what it feels like, so I am optimistic that the movie will feel like Star Wars to me, instead of generic sci-fi. Basically, Star Wars to me is nothing more than a universe, while Star Trek is an ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T22:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess as long as they don\u0027t mess with Boba Fett having survived falling into the Sarlaac, it won\u0027t be as upset.
