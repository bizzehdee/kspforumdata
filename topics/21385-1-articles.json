The reason is that there is no such thing as magnetic monopoles. All magnets have magnetic dipole, but no net magnetic charge. And dipoles, instead of the normal inverse square law follow the inverse cube law. And to have stable orbits, you do need inverse square law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s where that knitting needle video comes in. The electrostatic attraction there is also a dipole attraction. There is some net charge on the needle, but not on the droplet. However, the small net charge of the needle polarizes the droplet, and droplet starts to work like an electrostatic equivalent of a magnet. No net charge, but lots of dipoles. So why does it stay in orbit around the needle? The trick here is that it is a needle, and not a sphere. The fact that it\u0027s a long cylinder makes it work like a 2D problem. Only distance from nearest point on the needle matters. And in 2D, dipoles follow an inverse square law. So the droplet orbits the needle in the plane perpendicular to the needle, but mostly free to bounce around along the length of the needle. (There are some interesting edge effects that prevent it from \u0022sliding off\u0022 the needle during all of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo can this work with magnets? In principle, yes. You need one magnet that is long and cylindrical. But it\u0027s not just a bar magnet. Its North and South poles shouldn\u0027t be on opposite ends, but rather on opposite faces of the cylinder. This is important for stability. Now, you should be able to send a small magnet orbiting around it. I\u0027d take a little puck-shaped magnet, and give it a bit of a spin to gyro-stabilize it, so that it\u0027s north and south poles are always aligned to attract to the cylinder magnet. Give the small magnet a bit of a push, and it should stay in a circular or elliptic orbit around the long one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T17:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas SunJumper and SillyChris said, an electric charge in a uniform magnetic field will go in circles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat they didn\u0027t say is that the particle will loose energy through synchrotron radiation (EM waves) and will stop moving after some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use complex tricks to achieve the same thing with only magnets, but you will still loose energy to radiation (moving charges or magnetic fields cause EM radiation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, planets emit gravitational waves as they orbit, but those are so weak, their effect is not measurable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordOfTheOrbits","CreatedById":101867,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T20:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is possible and used in particle colliders to keep the particles inside the beamlines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T07:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Idobox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Idobox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe particle will loose energy through synchrotron radiation\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t tell me that in phys 381 and now I\u0027m mad at the U of A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP just contributed to my education... again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T14:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it, you have charge moving, which means it creates a varying electrical field, which means EM waves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time you deflect a charged particle, you create EM radiations, with different names depending on how you do it (Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, even Cerenkov I think)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T14:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdobox, just being pedantic, perhaps, but moving charges don\u0027t radiate, because you can always go into coordinate frame where they are static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003Eaccelerating\u003C/em\u003E charges that radiate.
