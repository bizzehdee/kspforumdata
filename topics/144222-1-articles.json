I run some tests in Kerbin (to check docking port allignment and so) and it all worked fine. I sent it to Minmus, but in there, the steering works inverted. I tried inverteing the steering in the wheels, but although the wheels turn the other way, the rover steers exactly the same way:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Wheels on normal: I turn right, wheels turn right, rover turns left.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Wheels on inverted steering: I turn right, wheels turn left, rover turns left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAI tried changing control position too, (from the OKTO2 I\u0027m using to the docking port) but has no effect. This has no effect on kerbin either, where it works fine!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone can add some clarity to this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit\u003C/strong\u003E: I just noticed, that in Kerbin, the navball shows blue above and brown belows, like it should, but in Minmus this is inverted. So there lies the problem. The question now is, why does this happen, if it\u0027s the same rover?! Can I revert it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-20T19:46:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2016 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by gartzn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T21:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard to say for sure... can you post a screenshot of your rover, including the launch vehicle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you tested it on Kerbin with just-the-rover, and then got it to Minmus by putting it in a stage sequence with other stuff, then perhaps something got twisted around or the like as part of the assembly or staging sequence.\u00A0 Screenshot would really help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that can sometimes cause confusion is that by default, the rover-steering controls are mapped onto the same keys as the reaction-torque controls, which means that every time you go to steer your rover, you\u0027re also trying to rotate it with reaction torque, in a way that can be very counterintuitive.\u00A0 That\u0027s the sort of problem that can show up on Minmus (where the gravity is very low, so the reaction wheels can wrench the rover around any which way they like), but not show up on Kerbin (where the gravity is much stronger, so the reaction wheels aren\u0027t strong enough to slew the rover around).\u00A0 Again, hard to say whether this is actually relevant to your problem without seeing a screenshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T22:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like what\u0027s happening is that the intended root part and orientation of your craft is confused when you add rocket parts to them and fly them.\u00A0Once on Minmus, right-click on the part you intended to be the controlling part of the craft, and from the menu that comes up, choose \u0022control from here.\u0022 Should put things back the way you expect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T01:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it sounds like your okto2 and docking port got rotated upside down when you attached them to the booster rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
