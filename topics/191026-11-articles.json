For instance, both of the 737 MAX accidents should have been easily avoided if the pilots had just correctly followed the procedures for a malfunctioning trim system. That\u0027s true of many other aviation crashes too. But as the automation becomes more and more sophisticated, it becomes a harder and harder problem to know when to override it. And even, sometimes, to know HOW to override it. The main problem with self-driving cars is that relying on human backup is a bad idea. Even trained, certified, practiced pilots have problems with this. Untrained randos who probably aren\u0027t very skilled drivers anyway are not going to react correctly in the very short time available between recognizing an autopilot mistake and the last moment when it would be possible to recover from that mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree, now events in cars tend to happen much faster than in planes there any sudden action you have to make tend to be an incident.
