I\u0027d heard of contracts disappearing, and just happened to remember the exact sequence of events when it happened to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the map, I was attempting to double-click on Minmus, but apparently double-clicked on a probe on Minmus. Scene changed to that probe. Much of the UI was missing. The top bar was visible but I can\u0027t recall seeing anything else. I tried to go to Space Center, both by using the top bar, then by pressing ESC. The button would select, but nothing would happen. I shrugged and Alt-F4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter restarting, everything looked great at first. Then I went to review the active contract\u0027s parameters, and there weren\u0027t any active contracts. Checked Mission Control. \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 and \u0022Explore Ike\u0022 were available though they\u0027d been active before. \u0022Send Science from Minmus\u0022 had been active, but isn\u0027t there at all now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Archive, all tabs are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t save the logfile from the run that broke, sorry. Nothing looks interesting in the current one. Just the same warning about a flag I\u0027d seen before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
