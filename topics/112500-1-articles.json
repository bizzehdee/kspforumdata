In my 0.9 activities I thoughtlessly used the nuclear engine for all inter-planetary travel because of its high ISP.

For relatively light rockets the LV-909 gives a much better delta-v but I expect for rockets so heavy that the weight of the engine is relatively insignificant the LV-N will do better in terms of delta-v.

Or possibly redesign to attach those Mk2 tanks to a larger Mk3 tank that can absorb the heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr another example, this spaceplane that has LV-Ns for orbital maneuvering:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot155.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot155.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane can burn its entire remaining fuel load at full throttle (coincidentally also 10\u002B minutes) immediately after reaching orbit, without waiting for the heat accumulated during ascent to dissipate. Note that the LV-Ns are attached to different fuel tanks (it would overheat if they were both mounted to the central bicoupler). In this case, the tail fins and wing parts attached to the side bicouplers help with radiation, and the bicouplers themselves are attached to another thermally massive part, the large Mk2 LF tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither of these designs has a single part added just to manage heat; they just use the parts needed anyway arranged in a way that keeps temps under control. The real trick for me was not using low thermal mass parts attached directly to the LV-N for clustering them. Having a part with high thermal mass connected directly to the LV-N is the key, and if you can connect that part to another thermally massive part it\u0027s better still.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
