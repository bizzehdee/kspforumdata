In my 0.9 activities I thoughtlessly used the nuclear engine for all inter-planetary travel because of its high ISP. All my rockets were big and industrial but now I have to pay for things I am needing to be a bit more careful.\n\nI see that the LV-909 is 0.5 t with an ISP of 345 in vacuum and costs 390. The LV-N is 3.0 t with an ISP of 800 in vacuum and costs 10,000. Both deliver the same thrust. For relatively light rockets the LV-909 gives a much better delta-v but I expect for rockets so heavy that the weight of the engine is relatively insignificant the LV-N will do better in terms of delta-v. Is there a formula that relates mass of rocket, ISP of engine and delay-v so that I can work out the crossover point (i.e. the mass of the rocket) where the LV-N provides better delta-v?\n\nMany thanks for all your help so far.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T06:55:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THobson**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:49:53Z","Content":"Someone posted an \u0027optimal rockets\u0027 series of graphs on the main forum that may have you covered."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:06:26Z","Content":"Try [Meithan\u0027s Engine Charts](http://meithan.x10.mx/KSP/engines/).\n\nIt\u0027s an extemely useful tool.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:14:41Z","Content":"If instead of Meithan\u0027s tool you\u0027d rather a simple rule of thumb: If you are planning to use more than 5t of fuel for the LV-909 you are likely better off using the LV-N with Mk2 LF tanks, or Mk3 LF tanks if you need a lot of fuel. Avoid the 1.25m LF tank or any LFO tanks with the LV-N if possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:44:16Z","Content":"The rocket formula is:\n\ndV = Ve \\* ln(Mwet/Mdry)\n\n...where Ve is the rocket\u0027s exhaust velocity (in terms of KSP numbers, it\u0027s the published Isp in seconds, times Kerbin\u0027s 9.81 m/s2 gravity).\n\nLet\u0027s assume that your total mass consists of the following:\n\nMe = mass of engine\n\nMd = dry mass of everything except your engine\n\nMf = = mass of fuel.\n\nSo let\u0027s say we want to figure out the mass cross-over point where LV-909 and LV-N have equal performance. We\u0027ll assume that Md and Mf are the same in both cases; the only thing that\u0027s different between the two rockets will by Isp and Me.\n\nSo we start out with this:\n\nIsp1 \\* ln((Me1\u002BMd\u002BMf)/(Me1\u002BMd)) = Isp2 \\* ln((Me2\u002BMd\u002BMf)/(Me2\u002BMd))\n\nThere are two variables to play with: the dry mass of the rocket excluding engine, and the fuel mass. Where the cross-over point happens depends on these two things.\n\nPlugging in a few numbers:\n\nIf Mf is \\_\\_ tons =\u003E crossover Md = \\_\\_ tons\n\n1 =\u003E 0.96\n\n2 =\u003E 0.63\n\n4 =\u003E 0.23\n\nBasically, the more tons of fuel you have, the less dry mass you can have at crossover.\n\nThe \u0022point of no return\u0022 beyond which the LV-909 can\u0027t win: in the theoretical extreme, where the only dry mass of the rocket is the engine itself (which clearly can\u0027t happen, because there\u0027s no such thing as a massless fuel tank), then the max fuel amount is 6.17 tons.\n\nBeing a *little* more realistic, and assuming that your fuel tank has a 1/8 mass ratio (like most of the game\u0027s LFO tanks), we get a point-of-no-return of 3.08 tons of fuel.\n\nSummarizing the above:\n\nIf you\u0027re comparing LV-909 against LV-N, and you have a rocket whose mass is entirely fuel tank \u002B engine, then the LV-N will always win (in terms of dV) if you have more than 3.08 tons of fuel. If you have *any mass at all* besides tank \u002B engine (which of course you do), then this lowers the cut-off point. e.g. if you have 0.3 tons of non-engine, non-fuel, non-tank mass, the cut-off fuel mass drops from 3.08 tons to 2.21 tons.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u0027t tell the whole story. That\u0027s assuming that all you care about is the dV of that particular rocket stage. However, you have to get that rocket stage launched into orbit in the first place, and the LV-N solution masses more than the LV-909 solution, which means you\u0027ll need a bigger rocket to launch it in the first place (or, put another way, if you have the same booster stage in both cases, the LV-N will get less dV out of that.)"},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:54:29Z","Content":"That is really helps fuel.

Look at the lunar landers and most long range probes. Rockets get their shape from atmospheric considerations.\n\nRealistic non-landing craft would be huge spheres to hold fluids, engines, trusses to hold stuff together, and optional habitation modules.\n\nRealistic tugs only need the aerodynamic features for launch. Otherwise, they should resemble the previously described composition. Given unlimited operation time, the cost optimal approach would be to enclose a vacuum operation craft in a huge faring. Or assemble in orbit.\n\nMk2 vacuum craft look rather stylish and Mk3 craft look very similar to rockets. You could also use those tanks as catamarans for the rest of the ship.

Take this simple nuclear tug that uses 4 LV-Ns:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot13.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot13.png)\n\nIt can burn its entire fuel load (10\u002B minutes) at full throttle in a single burn without overheating. Simply connecting LV-Ns directly to largish tanks is enough to keep things from exploding in most cases (though they get very warm). If I needed more fuel connected to the docking port for longer burns it might be trouble, I would likely need some radiators wings mounted to the tanks to radiate heat away. Or possibly redesign to attach those Mk2 tanks to a larger Mk3 tank that can absorb the heat.\n\nOr another example, this spaceplane that has LV-Ns for orbital maneuvering:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot155.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot155.png)\n\nThis plane can burn its entire remaining fuel load at full throttle (coincidentally also 10\u002B minutes) immediately after reaching orbit, without waiting for the heat accumulated during ascent to dissipate. Note that the LV-Ns are attached to different fuel tanks (it would overheat if they were both mounted to the central bicoupler). In this case, the tail fins and wing parts attached to the side bicouplers help with radiation, and the bicouplers themselves are attached to another thermally massive part, the large Mk2 LF tanks.\n\nNeither of these designs has a single part added just to manage heat; they just use the parts needed anyway arranged in a way that keeps temps under control. The real trick for me was not using low thermal mass parts attached directly to the LV-N for clustering them. Having a part with high thermal mass connected directly to the LV-N is the key, and if you can connect that part to another thermally massive part it\u0027s better still."}]}
