This is in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enabled the thermal debug info in the context menus and found that the only contributor to the heating was radiative flux. For almost every part, it was somewhere between .05 and 1.5, which is enough to slowly cook the station. Flux drops, but does not go negative on the dark side of Kerbin. I would expect the heat to radiate out at some point, but it never does, the parts just get hotter and hotter until they explode, 1 by one. (ignore max temp is enabled in the pic below, hence the high temps for a few intact parts) The first to go was a rocket engine attached to a large fuel tank, so I don\u0027t think tiny parts are the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a case of me not having enough radiators?
