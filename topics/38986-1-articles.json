Here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you set up a maneuver node and turn on the SAS, the system will automatically turn to the heading that the node is on. This would reduce/eliminate deviation from the course, which would end the annoying node spazes at the end of the burn. You would still have full control of the throttle, so if something were to happen, X would cut the burn. Also, if for some reason you began to get off course, the ship would keep tracking on path. And for the people that don\u0027t want this, there would for sure be a way to turn this function off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SAS doesn\u0027t hold course properly at all at the moment. But even if it did, I\u0027m not sure this would be the most intuitive way to do it--when I turn on the SAS, I expect it to lock on to my current heading, regardless of where it is. It would be annoying if you don\u0027t want to burn to your maneuver mode but it is locked in there. I would prefer something like RemoteTech\u0027s flight computer, where you can simply lock in the heading to prograde, retrograde, maneuver, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, just a thought I had while in another forum.

What exactly is the challenge with locking onto a maneuver node currently? It is practically impossible to get a perfect alignment unless you want to fiddle for half an hour, which is not exactly challenge. Thus all burns will always be slightly off. Removing that allows for more complicated maneuvers and therefore more interesting missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you didn\u0027t want to use the maneuver node, why set it in the first place? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like an autopilot ish thing.

Maybe you could activate the lock on the maneuver node itself, and when SAS is engaged, it will move there. I don\u0027t think that would be too much autopiloting. You still set the maneuver node yourself, you still do the burn yourself. It is not like you would normally fry freely during the maneuver, heading is always locked by SAS. This feature would just make the already existing lock a tad more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T09:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf maneuver nodes were static, that wouldn\u0027t be the problem, but in that case, the maneuver node moves around, to ask the game to follow it is really piloting the ship for you, that\u0027s why I doubt the devs will want to add this to the game.
